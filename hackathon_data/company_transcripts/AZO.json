Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2015 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for delivering another solid quarter. We remain focused on several key initiatives and on growing our business on a variety of fronts. We've diversified our portfolio somewhat in recent years, with an emphasis on building additional legs of growth for the future. Our Retail domestic business, which generates approximately 70% of our revenues, performed well in Q2. And we continue to see opportunities for future growth in store count and same-store sales.","Secondly, our Commercial domestic business, which has been growing sales by double digits for five years, accelerated its growth in Q2 and continues to be a tremendous growth opportunity. Regarding our international operations, we've been doing business in Mexico since late 1998 and our model has proven to work quite well. In Brazil, we are still in test phase, but our sales have continued to grow nicely. As with other international companies, the strengthening dollar has negatively impacted our U.S. dollar earnings from these operations recently. Our Internet businesses, AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, continue to grow nicely and generally consistent with our expectations. ALLDATA, which is the leading diagnostic and repair business in the United States, continues to perform well although our growth in that business has slowed as the market has become more competitive in recent years and as our market share has reached all-time highs.","And finally, IMC, an imports parts specialist that we acquired in the fall, has begun the integration process where we are working to expand their footprint of branches and where we are working to leverage their inventory assortment across the AutoZone domestic store base. This past quarter, our U.S. Retail business expanded with the opening of 36 net new stores. We also opened 29 net new Commercial programs. Our Commercial business continued to grain traction, growing sales 14.5% for the quarter. We have the Commercial programs in 78% of our domestic stores, having opened approximately 800 new programs in just the past two years. Additionally, we opened five stores in Mexico during the quarter. In Brazil, we continue to operate five stores and expect to open a couple of new ones over the next few months. We currently have 8% of our total stores outside of the United States.","Finally, we opened our first IMC branch since we acquired the company. And we are in the final stages of relocating their East Coast distribution center. We believe we have growth opportunities on a variety of fronts in the United States and outside the U.S. for many years to come.","As mentioned on our last conference call, during our first fiscal quarter, our sales continued to gain momentum throughout the quarter. And in the last two weeks, due to the first significant cold weather, our sales grew significantly. Due to last year's very strong Q2 sales, up 4.3% on a same-store basis, the comparisons for this past quarter were challenging. We were quite pleased with our performance throughout the second quarter, especially in light of the difficult comparisons. And we ended the quarter with domestic same-store sales of 3.6%. This represents more than 200 basis points improvement on a two-year rolling same-store basis from last quarter. We were pleased to see we gained traction in sales categories where we've added merchandise, and our Commercial business benefited from both the inventory additions and the diligent focus on growing sales in our older programs, with particular emphasis on mature customers.","Our results were strongest in the West, South and South Central states and were weakest in the Northeastern and Midwestern markets. These weaker markets performed quite well last year with the extremely cold winter. And we knew the comparison this year would be difficult. While our cold weather-related categories didn't perform as well as last year, they continued to perform well under the circumstances. And as anticipated, our maintenance-related categories performed quite well in the quarter. Our belief is the Improvement and Maintenance category sales was driven by more conducive weather patterns, improved merchandise assortments due to the products we have added over the last year, and lower gas prices, which we believe is relieving some pressure, particularly on our most economically challenged customers.","In recent years, we have experienced a significant growth in our sales concurrent with the U.S. tax refund season. We believe our most economically challenged customers use their refunds to make repairs and enhancements to their vehicles that they have deferred for some time. Each year, the exact timing of tax refunds moves a bit and those moves occur at the very end of our second quarter or at the beginning of our third quarter. If you recall, in fiscal 2013, we cited the delays in tax refunds that caused a material reduction in our sales the last two weeks of the quarter, where we saw 8% decline in same-store sales for those two weeks. This year, refunds began earlier and helped our business, particularly in the second-to-last week of the quarter. This one week added about 100 basis points to our same-store sales for the quarter.","Overall, we were quite pleased with our sales performance in Q2. Our inventory per location increased over our Q1 2015 levels. The primary driver of this increase was timing. We typically experience an increase in inventory as we prepare for the spring selling season. We anticipate that inventory levels will decline somewhat as this merchandise sells over the balance of the next two quarters.","Additionally, the IMC acquisition has increased our inventory per store across the chain by $11,000 per store. IMC branches carry approximately 10 times the inventory per location that an average AutoZone store carries, but their volumes on a per-location basis are materially higher as well.","As we mentioned during the last several quarterly calls, we've been testing different delivery frequencies from our distribution centers. Our ongoing tests show us that increased delivery frequency increases sales and improves inventory productivity by reducing safety stops. We've been running tests in just over 150 stores for approximately a year. And based on the success of our initial results, during the second quarter, we made the decision to expand the test to more than 300 additional stores. These stores were added to the test in the last couple of weeks of the second quarter and the first week of the third quarter. We now have the test in approximately 10% of our domestic chains, which we believe gives us a substantial base of stores to assess performance.","The results to date show a nice low single-digit lift in sales, but we aren't prepared yet to determine our long-term strategy. We still have a significant amount to learn, including the optimal number of deliveries each store should receive weekly. It could be three, four, five times or more.","Ultimately, assuming our current findings continue, we would expect to increase the delivery frequency to most of our stores. And we would expect to add two to three additional distribution centers to do this cost effectively and timely. If we ultimately elect to increase the delivery frequency to our stores, we will increase our capital expenditures primarily for the new distribution centers but we will also add annual operating expenses. Our modeling to date, based on our current results shows that while it is somewhat dilutive to gross and operating margins over the long term, it is sufficiently additive to operating profit dollars and provides us with returns above our internal hurdle rate. We've been pleased with our learnings to date. And we are excited to expand our test to hopefully improve on our results and confirm our expectations.","Additionally, we have been testing what we call mega-hubs. Mega-hubs have substantially increased product assortments and they leverage those increased product assortments across other hub networks, providing stores across a large geography access to this expanded assortment. We have been testing two mega-hubs for about a year. Based on the encouraging results we've seen to date, we're expanding the mega-hub program by an additional three locations, which should open over the balance of our fiscal year.","Once these three locations are opened, 35% of our domestic store base will have access to these expanded inventory assortments. If these three additional mega-hubs meet or exceed our expectations, we will develop a long-term strategy to roll out mega-hubs to provide service to the majority of our domestic stores.","All of our inventory availability initiatives are designed to significantly increase our ability to meet our customers' needs. As our Commercial business has grown and our DIY customers' needs increase, our need for expanded parts assortments continues. This has been important and difficult work, and I'd like to thank everyone in the organization that has been involved with this initiative for their excellent work.","Now I'll take a moment to discuss our recently completed acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation. IMC is the second largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian cars. While considerably smaller than the number one participant in the industry, IMC, now with 18 branches, offers an impressive growth opportunity for us, not just because of the parts coverage, but also because of the very strong management team. While it's premature, I will mention our plans include opening more IMC branches and incorporating their parts catalog into the AutoZone Z-Net parts catalog. We will continue to go to market as IMC and we expect to open a handful of new IMC locations over the next 12 months.","This past January, we made the IMC catalog available to a small number of AutoZone stores near an IMC location. Thus far, while really early, we are pleased. We have seen a lift in those stores' Commercial sales that encourages us that our assumptions on the sales lift to AutoZone from cross-selling were correct. In fact, we're slightly ahead of our original sales assumptions, again, in a statistically insignificant number of AutoZone stores, but so far, so good. Let me stress. The IMC brand is very important to us. And we will grow the brand and its presence in the future in many more markets than it is in today. IMC has been in a growth mode recently and it's built an infrastructure to support a substantially larger footprint.","It currently doesn't enjoy the operating margins that we experienced, so it will lower our overall EBIT margins by approximately 40 basis points on an annual basis. We are very excited to have the great IMC team as part of our organization and very optimistic about our future together. The IMC team has embraced the acquisition by AutoZone. And we all are very excited about the future of our two companies together as this acquisition makes both of us stronger.","Now let's turn to our second quarter results. Our sales increased 7.7% and our domestic same-store sales were up 3.6%. Both Retail and Commercial experienced positive same-store sales growth. Our same-stores fluctuated from week to week due to the wild swings in weather patterns that occur this time of year. The overall trajectory of our business was quite consistent throughout most of the quarter. That consistency was across all regions of the country. We believe we benefited from macro tailwinds, our work on inventory availability and on solid execution. While our failure-related and maintenance merchandise categories performed well, we were especially happy to see the growth in our maintenance categories.","Regarding traffic versus ticket in our DIY business, traffic was slightly negative, while ticket was positive. Interestingly, the Northeast and Midwest experienced declines in customer count around 5%, while the rest of the country was positive, together blending to be down slightly. The comparison to last year's extreme cold in the Northern markets was a big contributor to this year being a difficult comparison.","Our average ticket grew generally consistent with the first quarter when it returned to more normalized levels after about a year of subdued growth. The hard parts additions we've added to our stores have helped drive ticket growth. While improvement in product quality has pressured traffic over the last couple of decades, the technology advancements have significantly increased the price of the products we sell. We've been managing through this phenomenon as mentioned for over two decades and expect to continue to do so.","We opened 29 new Commercial programs in the quarter versus 49 programs in the comparable period last year. We now have a Commercial program in 78% of our domestic store base. Our Commercial sales, excluding IMC, were up 14.5% this quarter. Our productivity per program showed a nice uptick this past quarter. We have intensified our focus on mature program growth and specifically mature customer growth, and it was encouraging to see the improvements that began in Q1 further accelerate in Q2.","Regarding Mexico, we opened five stores this quarter. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 9.2% over last year's second quarter. As a reminder, ALLDATA and e-commerce, which includes AutoZone.com and AutoAnything make up this segment of sales.","Regarding online sales, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to the individual consumers or B2C. While these businesses are small for us at just 4% of our total sales mix on the quarter, we expect these businesses to grow at a faster rate than our brick-and-mortar business for the foreseeable future.","With the continued aging of the car population and with gas prices on average down materially year-over-year for the second quarter, we are beginning to see miles driven increase. Declining prices at the pump has benefited our customers, especially those most financially strapped. The lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging, but we understand this is just one of the many factors that impact our business.","Our operating theme for 2015 is Wow! Every Customer Everywhere. And our key priorities for the year are: one, great people providing great service; two, profitably growing our Commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability.","On the Retail front last quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with improvements to our product assortment, we're incorporating more training tools to help our store AutoZoners provide trustworthy advice. Training will continue to be a large effort for us at the store level. Behind the scenes, we have increased our technology investment and challenged ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. It is imperative we continue to invest in both current and future technologies in order to drive sales growth across all businesses.","Additionally, during the quarter, we completed our second ever company-wide engagement survey. We completed our first survey in the fall of 2012 and had terrific results. This year, our results were even better, which is a great testament to our culture and to the terrific leaders we have on our team. It is so encouraging that our AutoZoners not only know they work for a great organization, but they are highly engaged in that work and feel proud to work for this great company we call AutoZone. Our AutoZoners are the most valuable asset we have.","In regards to Commercial, we opened 29 programs during the quarter and 90 year-to-date. We expect to open approximately 300 programs this year versus 424 last year. As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the sales potential will continue to increase. Our results continue to provide us with confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish Q2 at 31.2%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing.","However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to recognize our entire organization for their incredible effort to deliver another strong quarter of solid financial results, while providing Wow! customer service to all of our customers.","Now, here's Bill.","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and International results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, IMC, our Mexico stores and our five stores in Brazil, increased 7.6%. Regarding macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $2.82 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.27 a gallon, a $0.55 increase. Last year, gas prices increased $0.15 per gallon during the second quarter, starting out at $3.29 and ending at $3.44 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles, and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to benefit from some increase in disposable income.","We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 1% in November. Data for December and January isn't currently available. The other statistically highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1.753 million. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.","For the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 14.5%. Commercial represented 17% of our total sales compared to 16% last year and grew $47 million over last year's second quarter. We opened 29 new programs during the quarter versus 49 programs opened in our second quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our Commercial program in 3,935 stores, supported by 171 hub stores.","Approximately 1,100 of our programs are three years old or younger. As Bill had mentioned earlier, both our total Commercial sales and sales per program accelerated from the previous quarter's results. While our average sales per program is below some peers in our industry, we feel we are on the right track to methodically close that gap. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the last few years as approximately 30% of our programs are younger than three years old, these openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs.","However, our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers. Looking specifically at our mature programs, those at least five years old, they grew in the mid-single-digit range this past quarter. Additionally, we still have significant opportunities to open additional programs over the next several years. We feel good about the success we've had in profitably growing the Commercial business.","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe the improvements we have made and upcoming additional improvements from our inventory availability initiatives enhance our prospects, and we believe the addition of IMC will provide us with more avenues to service our Commercial customers very effectively. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share.","Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened five new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 411 stores in Mexico. As the U.S. dollar strengthened this past quarter, we did have an FX conversion headwind. However, we still delivered a solid U.S. dollar equipment EBIT results and felt good about being able to handle the currency weakening in regard to the overall impact for the company's results. We expect to open a similar number of stores in Mexico this fiscal year that we opened last year. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations.","Regarding Brazil, we are currently operating five stores. We expect to open a few more stores over the next several months and then refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. Once we refine our offerings and operations and evaluate the performance, we will provide you with an update on our long-term growth plans. Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $2.144 billion, an increase of 7.7%. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year were up 3.6% for the quarter.","Gross margin for the quarter was 52.2% of sales, up 15 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by the impact from Interamerican Motor Corporation, which was acquired during September 2014.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for merchandise gross margin expansion within both the Retail and Commercial businesses. The pressure we will experience in the IMC business, along with the rollout of further stores on more frequent deliveries from our distribution centers, will continue to cause headwinds to our overall gross margin rate. However, our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.","SG&A for the quarter was 35.4% of sales, 25 basis points higher than last year's second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was due to higher incentive compensation impact from the IMC acquisition and self-insured employee medical costs. Partially offsetting these items was a favorable credit card litigation settlement of $5.4 million recognized during the quarter. While we have invested in several key initiatives that are customer service-related, like training and systems upgrades, we believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.","EBIT for the quarter was $361 million, up 7.1% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was down 10 basis points at 16.9%. Interest expense for the quarter was $34.5 million compared with $39.5 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.4 billion or approximately $125 million more than last year's balance of $4.3 billion.","Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While on any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.2%, in line with last year's second quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis as the deviation in results this quarter, like last year, was primarily driven by the government tax credits reinstituted in December of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $212 million, up 9.8%. Our diluted share count of 32.5 million shares was down 5% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $6.51, up 15.6% over the prior year's second quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement for the second fiscal quarter, our operating cash flow was $101 million. Net fixed assets were up 7.7% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $93.8 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 44 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and Information Technology investments. With the new stores open, we finished this past quarter with 5,042 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 411 stores in Mexico, 18 IMC branches and five stores in Brazil for a total location count of 5,476.","Depreciation totaled $59.9 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $58 million. This is in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $26 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $544 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating agency firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 107.5%. The inclusion of IMC reduced the AP ratio by 170 basis points.","Next I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.5 billion, up 12% versus the Q2 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects the recent IMC acquisition, new store growth and additional investments in coverage. Inventory per store was up 7.1% at $631,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage and the IMC acquisition. The increase in inventory per store this quarter due to the IMC acquisition was $11,000 per store. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.2%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Bill. We are pleased this morning to report our 34th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 15.6%. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. At the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must innovate to ensure they turn to us for their vehicle solution needs.","As we continue to invest in our businesses and monitor the results from our ongoing inventory initiatives, we are optimistic about our future. We feel like we continue to be on the right track. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, supply chain solutions, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, e-commerce, Brazil and now IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low-single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we routinely look to grow our EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success.","Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and to continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.","Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question today is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much, and congratulations on another nice quarter, guys.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","First question for Bill Rhodes, concerns the delivery frequency program and increasing that. Could you maybe just provide a little bit more color, Bill, as to when you think, if the program goes according to your plan, when peak spending to support the effort will occur? And maybe provide a little bit of color on the comp lifts that you're seeing to the stores that are supported already by the increase in frequency? Thank you.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a terrific question, Alan, and one that I don't want go in too in depth at this point in time. And one of the reasons why is we've been testing this in, I think, 168 stores in five different markets, and they're five very different geographies with different competitive sets and the like. And our results generally have been good, but some parts of them are still hard to read, and that's why we decided to expand it by another over 300 stores. And I think as we get the read on those stores, over the third quarter and fourth quarter, we will have a much better understanding to confirm that we're on the right track, hopefully to confirm that they're actually performing better than the ones we've done to date. It's just a little bit early. Our expectation is once we make a decision, we're going to come back to you all and we'll communicate it clearly and show you what we believe the financial implications are on the operating margins and gross margins and capital expenditures.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Is it reasonable to expect, Bill, that the frequency actually may vary depending on region where some stores may get deliveries three times a week and others will get deliveries as many as five times? Or are you going to do a unilateral approach across the board?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think at this point in time, everything is still on the table. We are testing three times, we're testing five times, we tested two times, and clearly, in some places, you're going to be very close to the store. So the cost of going five times is not as significant as if you're 500 miles away. So I think we still have to determine those things, and that's why we expanded it to another 300 plus stores in the last month.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And one follow-up if I may, I believe you said that ALLDATA was slowing. Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color as to what you are seeing there and what initiatives over the next 12 months are you going to take to reaccelerate that business?","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","Yeah, I mean, ALLDATA continues to be the market leader in diagnostic repair software. And so what we have seen is a little bit more competition in the marketplace and a little bit more pricing pressure on the product. We continue to command a very large market share in that segment. And our strategy over the next 12 months to 24 months is to continue to add enhancements to the product to service our customers better and add additional value. Some of that will be through repair information, confirmed repair information, we put a community website up today as part of the repair product, and that's been received very well. So there's a lot of enhancements that we're making to our suite of products that we think over time will continue to create a larger stickiness with our customers and add more value.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much, and good luck in the spring selling season.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks.","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","Thank you, Alan.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from John Lawrence with Stephens.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens, Inc.","Bill, would you comment \u2013 your comment on the dilution of the EBIT margin at IMC, would you take a step further and if all these other initiatives on the rollout as far as multiple deliveries per week could over time offset some of that, would that not be correct if you looked out to the completion of that project?","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","Actually let me \u2013 I'll jump in, John. I would say probably not. I would think of them differently. IMC operates at a lower margin business than the overall AutoZone business does. We think we can improve IMC's operating margin. We think we can continue to grow that business, but it will continue to operate at a lower margin than our overall company and therefore will create a little bit of dilution on our operating margin. Now obviously when we anniversary that acquisition that occurred in September of 2014, then it won't be a year-over-year headwind per se.","Relative to delivery frequency, the play there is really to add some additional cost into our operating cost structure in an effort to increase sales, gain further market share and grow operating profit at a faster rate, and so, both of those will create a little bit of headwind from a pure operating margin rate standpoint. But the objective obviously in both cases is to continue to provide better service and value to our customers, be closer to our customers with inventory and be able to capture market share and grow operating profit.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Congratulations.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next call is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Chris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, this is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aaron Rubinson.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","Hey, how are you?","Chris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","I'm good. Thanks. Very nice quarter. Had just a quick question on the Commercial program growth, so you took the growth down this year, but obviously the sales were up nicely. Maybe you could just kind of walk us through your thought process there and your desire to slow that down, are your current inventory tests and field tests and delivery tests part of this? Is it to maybe realize that you grew too fast over the last couple of years or is it just kind of preserving capital to use it elsewhere in your business? Thank you.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, great question. I'll start with \u2013 it was our plan this year as we came into the year to slow down a little bit. Remember, what seven years ago, we had 51% of the stores on the program. We now have 78% of the stores on the program. We don't have a vision that 100% of the stores will have the Commercial program, but we do believe it will be significantly higher than it is today, we just don't know the exact number. The reason we slowed it down was one, we're later in the lifecycle of the program openings. But more importantly, we really want to focus the organization more on growing mature programs and specifically growing our business with mature customers. As we've opened so many these programs in the last four, five years, taken a lot of time and attention away from the existing programs, it's also cannibalized the existing programs. But this year, we really wanted to recalibrate our focus and focus intensely on growing mature programs and mature customers. And so far through the first six months, that's having some nice benefits.","Chris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's great. I'll pass it on to the next person. Thanks for your time.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Bill, you'd noted that you were seeing the initial payback with your mature customers. Does that reflect the fact that they're seeing the benefit of the better in-stock positions? And then second, what is the strategy for your top-down sales guys to become more aggressive and letting new accounts know about your greater commercial capabilities?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A couple quick questions. Thanks, Dan. On the sales force side, we really started building a sales force about seven, eight years ago now. And I will tell you I am just \u2013 every time I ride with one of our salespeople, every time I talk to our senior sales leaders, I'm just remarkably impressed by the progress that we've made. And unlike a lot of organizations where you put the salespeople out there to eat what you can kill, our sales processes are very well defined and our team determines exactly where we want our salespeople to be, the exact type of accounts and by the way, the exact accounts that they want them to call on that week. So part of what we've done is we've redirected some of their focus and efforts to the existing stores or the existing customers that we have. And that's beginning to pay off, which we are still calling on new customers, but we really want to be focused on the ones that we have today. And I'm sorry I forgot your first question.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, it's just \u2013 I think you answered that, that the initial payback with the mature customers, that reflects the fact that you're able to say yes more often to their orders.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Really so far, we've only seen one of the initiatives that we embarked on, and that was the change in our algorithms that we made last year to put newer inventory function to the customer. As we work on both this mega-hub approach and this delivery frequency approach, that can have a material difference in our ability to say yes. And it is more important with the \u2013 it's important on both the Commercial and DIY side. With the Commercial customer calling me multiple times a day versus a DIY customer calling you a few times a year, it's very important on the Commercial side.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And just one other question. After you complete opening three additional distribution centers, your total network is still about half the number of DC locations that your competitors have. Do you see this as just an intermediate investment and that someday AutoZone may operate 20 plus distribution centers?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say at this point in time, absolutely not. We see this as the permanent solution. That doesn't mean that we won't get smarter over time and decide we need to drop another DC in here. But we have no vision of a 25 distribution center model. Now that being said, three years ago, we didn't have a vision of going delivery frequency. And as our business has changed and as the competitive landscape has changed, we've had to modify our model. But today, we think that is the right long-term approach.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. This is Josh on for Simeon. Just a question on gasoline prices. Are you seeing a noticeable pickup from lower prices? And then on the weather front, do you expect a pickup later on as a result of the colder weather right now?","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","Yeah, it's always difficult to really measure with any precision on that. Clearly, the lower gas prices we believe have been helpful. And they certainty have probably contributed at some level to our comp, I don't think significantly, but they certainly have been helpful. So we try to weigh in all the things between gas and tax refunds, et cetera. From a maintenance perspective, we think that as we \u2013 obviously this has been a longer winter and it's dragging on, but clearly spring will be here hopefully in the next couple of weeks, and then we'll get back to our core maintenance categories and things like that. And we expect those businesses to perform well. So we'll have to get a little bit further down the road to look in the rearview mirror to see exactly what the impacts are of gas and whether. But we expect it to be favorable in the spring.","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. It's Simeon. If I can just ask one follow-up. Can you \u2013 I don't know if anyone asked this, so I apologize if it's redundant. The loyalty card, can you talk about how helpful it's been to sales? Have you've been tracking it in terms of sign-ups, in terms of wallet share, in terms of driving traffic?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Simeon. As you know, I guess we launched the first part of the loyalty program nine or 10 years ago, and then we took it to the digital program probably seven years ago. This past year, we used to have different programs in different parts of the country. This past year, we went to one consolidated nationwide program, and the program has worked very well since the beginning. It continues to work well and it's growing, although it's growing at a lower rate just because it's more mature. Now there have been two of our competitors that have launched loyalty programs in the last year or so, but both are different than ours. So far, we continue to be very help happy with our loyalty program and we continue to grow. We haven't seen material changes in our loyalty acceptance rate versus where we were before.","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Nice quarter. Thanks.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Can we take a step back and just think a little bit more about the long-term financial model? You continue to expect mid-single EBIT growth or better, but it seems like you're investing a little bit more capital in DCs and whatnot, and some of these acquisitions. So longer term, should we expect ROIC to continue to decline? Or is it going to be stable? How do you think about that?","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","The way we really think about it is that, and as Bill, I think, highlighted in his remarks, we're very proud of the ROIC number that we have. And we recognize that it's probably one of the highest in hardline retail. At the same time, we're very focused on investing in the initiatives that we believe will generate very strong returns and more importantly will capture market share and grow earnings. So I think as we look at the model on a longer-term basis that we'll focus on those kinds of initiatives and they may or may not have some pressure on ROIC and bring it down a little bit. But again, we're focused on growing operating profit dollars, capturing market share and investing in activities that generate very strong returns.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, can I add to that too? If we held ourselves to a standard where we wouldn't make investments unless they were at 32% return on invested capital, we wouldn't do a lot of things that would be very important to our business and would frankly put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage. That's why we've held to this long-term internal hurdle rate and it's worked very well. Remember when we implemented the internal hurdle rate, our ROIC was around 20%, so we've been able to grow it over time by being very disciplined, but at the same time, we can't hold single initiatives to a 30%-plus return.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","That makes perfect sense. If you look at the portfolio of initiatives you have right now, how do you think about them in a rank order in terms of the ROIC potential, whether it be IMC, whether it be delivery frequency, mega hubs, inventory additions, et cetera?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say the first and foremost biggest short-term to medium-term opportunity is just growing the Commercial business. It's a very low capital required to grow that business, so anything that we can do, enhance our sales force, continue to improve our execution, that is by far and away the single biggest way to drive ROIC. I think most of the other initiatives, based upon our modeling today, would be slightly dilutive to return on invested capital, but they have very good returns and they're going to accelerate the growth of operating profit dollars, which is one of our objectives.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys, and good luck.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.","Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. It's actually Mark Becks on for Chris. I just wanted to sharpen the pencil on the trend. You mentioned your core business was up 200 basis points on a two-year rolling basis. Outside of the 50 basis point contribution from tax refunds, is it safe to say the remainder is what you view as sustainable? I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of how you view the underlying growth rate of the industry versus potential share gains in the moving pieces with gas and whether.","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","Yeah, I think that well, first of all, I think to some extent, gas is probably a more longer-term one. I mean obviously, we're going to get some increases in gas prices. But on a relative basis, they will be well below last year. And I suspect that they will continue to be so for at least the immediate future. Relative to tax refunds, you're right. As we called out, we think that maybe that was 100 basis points of impact on Q2. We'll have a better feel for that as we move our way through Q3. And then excluding that, I think that the way we look at it is that that really is the underlying core trends of the business.","Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. If I look at DIY, historically it's been kind of a 1%, 2% growth business, and obviously that's with the benefit inflation which you're not seeing right now. Is there anything structurally changing with the industry, or are maybe your thoughts on just the outlook for the Retail business in general?","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","I don't think that we see anything necessarily structurally changing in the business. If you look at the competitive landscape from a pricing, promotional activity, even from a capital investment perspective, it continues to be pretty consistent and rational industry overall, and you are right. We have not been the beneficiary of inflation over the last, almost at this point I'd say 18 plus months, maybe pushing 24 months, and it doesn't appear as though there's a lot of inflation in the horizon either. There's a couple of categories here and there that have some inflation, but for the most part, we've been generating these sales out of a no inflation kind of environment. So it really is the strength of the customer, the strength of our offering that was really driving that.","Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then a follow-up to Alan's question on the expanded daily delivery frequency, your 10% of your stores now, if you were to flip the switch and roll it out to a greater number, is there anything in terms of a particular stretch that you'd be able to do to add to a greater number of stores? Or how would you think about the timing of that growth?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's still yet to be determined. We just went over and implemented 300 stores. Obviously, that's the biggest thing that we've done at this point in time. We did it over about three weeks, and so far, it's gone pretty well, but there have to be a tremendous amount of efforts in the distribution centers to ramp up for that increase of activity both inside the warehouse and in the transportation team. So we'll learn from this newest rollout and will plan for future wins, but more importantly now we got about 500 stores on the program and we are hopeful that we can quickly confirm our expectations today.","Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And one quick follow-up to that. Given the potential for increased CapEx, should you continue to roll this out, do you think that would meaningfully alter your philosophy on share buybacks going forward?","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","It won't alter our philosophy at all. I mean we believe that it is a great way to add value back to our shareholders and return capital back to the shareholders through the share repurchase program. We've been very disciplined about it. We operate at a very defined credit metric and will continue to do so.","Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Greg S. Melich - Evercore ISI","Hi, thanks. I had two questions. First was, how many stores now have the extended IMC inventory? So I think it was the 300 with the added inventory, but how many of those, or is it a different group that had the IMC?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A different group. It's under 10.","Greg S. Melich - Evercore ISI","It's just a handful.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we've been doing this for six weeks or seven weeks so far, Greg. And we did a lot of work around the systems piece, but even now at this point in time, we're muscling it. We're just trying to get a sense for it. So far we've been really encouraged.","Greg S. Melich - Evercore ISI","Very early days. Okay. So then switching to CapEx and cash flow a little bit, if my math is right, you'll be opening or doing 100 Commercial programs each of the next two quarters?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, roughly.","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","That's about right, yeah.","Greg S. Melich - Evercore ISI","And then with given everything that you've talked about, what's sort of CapEx run rate? Should we look at the last six months as sort of a normal thing now to get all the initiatives done that you've talked about?","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","I would say it's probably about that. We're certainly going to be right around about a $500 million number or so, I think, on an annualized basis. So it'll be a little bit of a step-up, but not significantly.","Greg S. Melich - Evercore ISI","And on the AP to inventory ratio, it seems like that came down. Was there any sort of timing issues there? Or again, just given everything you're doing on inventory that could be \u2013 we might see that effect kind of stick around for a little bit?","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","I think the latter. I think that hopefully we were somewhat consistent two or three quarters ago when we began to add more inventory, and we tried to call out that that will put a little bit of pressure on AP to inventory when you fast-forward three quarters or four quarters, and here we are. So it was certainly down this quarter. We don't anticipate it going down further, necessarily, for the next two quarters, but expect it to hang around that kind of number.","Greg S. Melich - Evercore ISI","Great. Good job. Good luck, guys.","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","Thanks.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys. Nice quarter, this is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. I just have two quick ones. Could you give us the contribution of IMC to your SG&A?","William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA","I think we said that it was probably around 15 basis points. I would say all three of those categories that we identified accounted for about 45 basis points...","Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. And then just to get some clarity on the recent cold weather, particularly Northeast region. Did it help? And what we're trying to basically gauge is, would the Northeast results have been any worse without the cold snap?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Are you talking about the most recent cold snap? They weren't...","Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. I mean basically the last month or so.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So about half of that was in our results. But remember, the cold snaps \u2013 as you get later in the winter, the cold snaps are more of a headwind than they are a benefit. Early in the season, it spurs activity of people trying to get their vehicles ready for the winter. What happens late in the winter, most of the parts that were going to fail have already failed, and frankly customers have winter fatigue and they're not doing things getting ready for the winter. So they're generally not beneficial later in the year or later in the season as they are (56:59).","Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rhodes for any closing comments.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that we have a long and strong heritage of consistent impressive performance. While we are excited about our growth prospects for the year, we will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have choices. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.

For the third fiscal quarter, our earnings per share increased 18.6%, and our domestic same-store sales increased 3.9%. This marks the 23rd consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Our sales grew 7% in total and our operating profit increased by 8.7%, driven by our continued growth in retail sales, strong performance in our Commercial business and ongoing growth in our Mexico, ALLDATA and E-Commerce businesses.","Over the course of the last few years, we've grown total sales in the auto parts segment in the high single-digit range while growing our other businesses in low double-digits. The credit for our stability in performance belongs to all AutoZoners across our organization. Their focus on continually striving to improve customer service is what differentiates us, we believe, in the eyes of our customers, which ultimately leads to our strong financial performance. Our strategies remain consistent this quarter, and we remain committed to our game plan heading into our all-important fourth fiscal quarter.","This quarter is important from the perspective that the summer selling season generates the highest average weekly sales. The summer months tend to put more pressure on components of the electrical coolant systems and other systems. In addition, it's an easier time of the year to work on your car, and it is the summer driving season. The foundation for our strategies is consistently delivering trustworthy advice, an intense focus on consistent execution and ongoing refinements to our processes and product offerings. We remain committed to this approach and believe our AutoZoners' execution of this well-defined, well-communicated approach has been a critical element in our success.","With our third quarter sales up 6.7% over last year's quarter, customers continued to shop with us to find good values in order to effectively maintain, repair and enhance their vehicles. During the quarter, we experienced some moderate deceleration in our retail business. Although we no longer receive the detailed NPD market share information, we continue to receive summarized information. That summarization indicates that we continue to gain share at levels generally consistent with recent history.","Our domestic Commercial sales growth exceeded 20% for the eighth consecutive quarter, and we grew our other business, made up of ALLDATA and E-Commerce, by 10.1%. In an effort to address questions that may be on some listeners' minds this morning, I thought I'd spend a moment discussing trend changes we have seen and their potential impact on current and future sales. We'll spend a moment discussing our results and what this means for AutoZone for the remainder of the fiscal year.","We were pleased with our financial and operational performance for the quarter. EPS grew at 18.6%, slightly below the 20% growth we've experienced for the last 13 consecutive quarters. Operating margin improved 37 basis points to 20.2%. We continue to aggressively invest in both our retail and Commercial businesses. During the quarter, we opened 121 new Commercial programs and 287 for the fiscal year. We've surpassed last fiscal year's openings already, and we still have a quarter to go. We now have programs in 64% of our domestic stores, and approximately 25% of the total program base is less than 3 years old. It is important that we continue to make these investments that position us -- position the company for future growth.","As most of you have heard from other retailers and businesses, April was a softer month. As we were asked on our last conference call, did the warm weather in the last few weeks pull -- or few months pull forward demand? We said it was a concern of ours, but as we got further from December, it would become less of a concern. Unfortunately, we, too, experienced softer sales in April in both our domestic retail and Commercial businesses.","As we assessed our performance in April in hindsight, our perspective is the softness in April was likely due to mild winter weather and early spring conditions experienced across the country. We believe spring maintenance was accelerated this year due to these conditions, particularly in the DIY business. In essence, we believe some of April's business was, in fact, pulled forward. We know and understand that many of our customers continue to be under financial strains due to macroeconomic conditions. However, that has been the case for an extended period of time. We don't see any significant changes in the marketplace or in the macroeconomic conditions that indicate a material change to the mid- to long-term fundamentals of our industry. We continue to be optimistic about the strength of our industry, both retail and commercial, and we continue to be quite pleased with the progress we are making on our growth initiatives in both sectors.","Our belief on the health of the industry was exemplified late in the quarter when we remained committed to our new Commercial program openings. We understood opening additional Commercial programs would negatively impact SG&A in the short run but pay dividends for the future. We are very fortunate to operate in an industry that has very strong fundamentals, an industry that sustains good growth regardless of the macro environment. Although we understand that any industry's performance will fluctuate from time to time, we believe the health of this industry will remain strong for the balance of the year and beyond.","Third, we should address the concerns surrounding new car sales and the potential impact in increasing seasonally adjusted annual rate of vehicle sales has on both our DIY and DIFM businesses, if not, in our opinion, a material driver to either sector like gas prices and miles driven. And over the longer term, we need new cars as today's new cars are tomorrow's OKVs. We do expect new car sales to increase from the depressed levels we have seen in recent years. However, with over 240 million vehicles on the road and the average age at 10.6 years, the number of annual new car sales doesn't impact the overall vehicle mix materially. And new car sales can't be considered in isolation. Scrappage rates are also an important element, and they've generally been in the 5% range or 12 million vehicles a year, basically offsetting the new vehicles added.","This impact has caused the number of total vehicles to remain at approximately 240 million for the last 4 years. Our hope is absolute vehicles on the road going forward increases. We are encouraged by the annual new car sales rates trending over 14 million units as it is likely that those vehicles being traded in will find their way to new maintenance-friendly owners. We want to reiterate, we believe that over the long term, miles driven and average age of vehicles are the most important metric for our industry's future sales performance, which recently have shown trends in our industry's favor.","Now let me review our operating theme for 2012, 1TEAM; Driving our Future. The key priorities for the year are: Great People Providing Great Service!; profitably growing our Commercial business; leveraging the Internet and hub store improvements. On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our theme of intense focus on improving execution. We continue to invest in training our store AutoZoners. We are also keenly focused on hiring and retaining the best parts professionals in the business, and we've been pleased with our progress in this area.","Recently, we implemented further enhancements to our parts catalog and sales tool, Z-net. Additionally, we remain on track with our new labor management system that will replace our legacy system. This new system will further assist us in managing our business as one team, leveraging our resources across both DIY and DIFM while providing the best service to all customers regardless of how they interact with us. We're also working on new planogramming efforts to improve and customize our sales core presentations to the demographics of a local market. Lastly, our efforts around expanding the utilization of hub stores remains a major focus. Our ability to add coverage while growing inventory per store in a working capital-friendly way is at the top of our priority list.","This past quarter, we expanded or relocated 17 hubs, allowing us to add inventory and continue to increase our yes percentage for both our retail and Commercial customers. We continue to be very pleased with the results of this initiative, and our efforts to ensure we have the right-sized hubs in the right location is progressing very well.","On the Commercial front, as I mentioned, we are executing our plan to continually open new programs, opening 121 new programs during the third quarter. We also focused diligently on growing our business with existing customers, and we are quite pleased with our progress on both fronts. We now have Commercial in 2,946 stores or 64% of our domestic store base. We will discuss our operating performance in more detail later in the call. However, our results with our most recent new store openings, combined with the success of our older programs, has given us greater confidence and encourages us to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.","Regarding our third quarter sales results, our total auto parts segment, made up of both our domestic and Mexico businesses, delivered a 6.7% increase. Our other businesses, made up of ALLDATA and E-Commerce, were up 10.1%. During the quarter, we continued to open new stores both in the United States and Mexico, 33 new stores in the United States and 10 in Mexico, and expect to grow square footage for the year at a combined annual growth rate of approximately 4%.","We continue to make progress on our hub store initiative. This initiative is focused on expanding and\/or relocating current hubs. During the quarter, we have expanded or relocated 17 hubs, and year-to-date, 31 hubs have been affected. Our hub count remained the same at 146. Since we've begun our efforts on redefining our hub network and square footage needs, we've modified to some degree 51 hubs. As we continue to see traction from utilizing and expanding the reach of our hub network by expanding sales from new hub store SKU additions plus related parts sales, we see the potential to modify, in some way, up to as many as 53 of the remaining hubs over the next few years.","While we spend a lot of time highlighting our hub strategy, this strategy is very important currently but arguably even more important over the long term. As parts proliferation continues to expand and vehicle parts technology advancements occur, in many cases, it results in lower unit sales per SKU. In order to effectively combat this trend, it is imperative that we have the local market availability to service our customers on a just-in-time basis in a financially prudent manner. Our hub strategy allows us to accomplish this objective by aggregating demand of a cluster of satellite stores. In some cases, combining this demand gives us the opportunity to add new local market coverage. In other cases, it allows us to move products that are stocked in many of our satellite stores to the hub stores, improving the productivity of our inventory.","Local market inventory coverage is an imperative in this business for both our professional and retail customers, and our hub strategy has allowed us to expand local market coverage in a cost-effective manner. Additionally, we continue to refine our product assortments in the satellite stores, specifically focused on late-model coverage. As our Commercial performance has improved, the overall sales productivity of our average store continues to set the pace for the industry, increasing 3.3% over the prior year's trailing 4 quarters, allowing us the opportunity to efficiently expand our inventory assortments.","I'll take a moment now to talk more specifically about our third quarter performance in a little more detail. Our domestic same-store sales grew 3.9% for the quarter. Our third quarter, which ended May 5, did experience some variability in sales results. As I mentioned earlier, we attribute the inconsistency in selling patterns compared to previous years to the milder-than-normal winter and earlier spring conditions we experienced this year. Last quarter, we mentioned that we believe weather was a positive on our quarterly results. What we learned this quarter was that weather did have an impact on the results this quarter. Traditionally, our third quarter benefits from a steady ramp in sales of maintenance-related items. Items we include in this category include antifreeze, brakes, oil, shocks, struts, spark plugs and wiper blades and many more.","In many of these categories, we experienced strong sales growth in Q2, while in Q3, sales were a little softer. Our third quarter traditionally marks the largest selling mix quarter for maintenance-related items. We believe the weather was mild enough in our Q2 ending early February that some jobs that are normally performed during Q3 were completed in Q2. Overall, however, weather always evens out over the long term. That's why we never get too excited on the upside or downside in regards to weather.","Our increased emphasis on the Commercial business again resulted in quite impressive results. Our third quarter Commercial sales growth of 21.4% represents our eighth straight quarter of 20% plus sales growth. While we are pleased with our Commercial rate of growth, we recognize that we currently have a small market share, and this remains a tremendous opportunity for us, both in terms of growing the number of programs that we currently have, as well as improving the productivity of our existing programs. Therefore, we have and plan to continue to invest in this business in order to grow sales and further capture profitable market share.","As we accelerate our investments to grow Commercial and as Commercial becomes a larger portion of our overall business, we anticipate our gross margin and operating expense rates will be challenged as Commercial is currently a lower-margin business. However, as we stated in the past, we are focused on growing operating profit dollars at strong levels of returns on the capital we deploy. It is important to highlight that while Commercial is dilutive to our overall margins, we continue to be pleased with the profitability of our Commercial business.","I'd also like to recognize our other businesses, ALLDATA and E-Commerce, for having another fine quarter of 10.1% in sales from this time last year. This portion of our business, while small as a percentage of our overall sales mix, continues to experience faster sales growth in the auto parts stores. We are proud of our results in the businesses we manage outside of our stores, and we feel we have a healthy runway for growth well into the future with them.","Additionally, we've been very focused on leveraging the Internet across a variety of fronts. Our efforts are concentrated on providing our retail customers with access to store, product and repair information to help them research or complete the purchase online, an important extension of the trustworthy advice we provide in our stores.","On the Commercial side, we are providing our professional customers with tools to streamline their interactions with us, making us easier to do business with. We continue to engage in social media, providing additional avenues for our customers to interact with us. We've been pleased with our progress on developing our Internet offerings, but we continue to be in the very early innings of tapping into these growing customer segments that utilize this venue for researching or ordering their parts and products.","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to grow this metric to 32.7% on a trailing 4-quarter basis, which represents another new all-time high for our organization. One of the big drivers to this growth has been the EBIT growth of the Commercial business. While having a lower EBIT margin as a percentage to sales, which creates some margin rate pressure, the capital requirements of our Commercial model are minimal. The investments are mainly operating expense-related, AutoZoners who develop relationships and sell to our customers and other AutoZoners who execute the orders and deliver product to these important customers. The ability to leverage our existing assets, primarily AutoZoners, store locations, inventory and information systems across this additional customer base, provides us with a terrific opportunity to grow operating profit dollars and drive incremental returns on capital.","It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we spend is our investors' capital. We are encouraged by our efforts thus far in 2012, but we know our busiest selling season is in front of us. We're excited about our continuing initiatives in place and believe our efforts and our belief the competitive landscape isn't changing markedly provides us with confidence heading into our summer selling months.","Our commitment to our ongoing planning efforts allows us good visibility into business trends, and our team is committed to managing to those trends appropriately. We've been very deliberate in how we manage expenses and capital in order to deliver consistent, strong financial performance while positioning our business for long-term growth, and we will continue with this strategy well into the future.","Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results for the quarter. Bill?","William T. Giles","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, Commercial and Mexico results for the quarter.","For the quarter, total auto parts sales increased 6.7% on top of last year's third quarter's growth of 8.5%. This segmentation includes our domestic retail and Commercial businesses and our Mexico stores. Regarding macro trends during the second quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.52 a gallon and inched up, finishing the quarter at $3.79 a gallon. Last year, if you recall, gas prices increased $0.83 per gallon during the third quarter, starting at $3.14 and ending at $3.97 a gallon. We're encouraged by the recent declines in gas prices as the reduction in prices at the pump can materially help our customers' discretionary spending. At the same time, the gas prices remaining at these overall high levels, we continue to communicate through our marketing messages to our customers the steps they can take to improve their gas mileage.","Miles driven showed some improvement in January, February and March, up 1.6%, 1.8% and 0.9%, respectively. These increases marked the largest year-over-year increases in miles driven since the fall of 2010. The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-olds and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. We also recognize the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear.","For the trailing 4 quarters, total auto parts sales per square foot was $265. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. This metric is up 2.9% over last year's third quarter. This is the highest level we have achieved since fiscal 2003. This impressive improvement is a key contributor to our record EBIT margin percent and our record ROIC.","For the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 21.4%. Commercial represented 15.4% of our total sales and grew $57 million over last year's Q3. Last year's Commercial sales mix percent was 13.5%. As we have said previously, overall, we have been very pleased with the progress we are making in our Commercial business, both operationally and financially and we remain on track with our plans. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings, and therefore, we are optimistic about the future of this business.","Our sales growth has come from both existing and new customers. We continue to believe we can grow revenues in existing stores, and we will continue to open additional Commercial programs. This past quarter, as Bill mentioned, we opened 121 new programs versus 92 programs in Q2 and 74 in our first fiscal quarter. We opened only 34 programs during Q3 of last year. We expanded the number of stores with the Commercial program by 4.3% during just this quarter and 15.3% over last year's third quarter ended. We now have our Commercial program in 2,946 stores, supported by 146 hub stores. Just fewer than 25% of our programs are 3 years old or younger. With only 64% of our domestic stores having a Commercial program and our average revenue per program materially below several of our competitors, we believe there's ample opportunity for additional program growth aside from improved productivity opportunities in current programs.","Our focus on building the Commercial initiatives that have been in place for the last few years remains our primary focus. We continue to watch our sales force mature. We are also enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of our sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. We have a model that is successful and scalable, and we are continuing to test additional enhancements to our offerings.","In addition to our focus on further developing and expanding our sales force, we have continued to add significant resources to our Commercial business from additional late-model import and domestic coverage, both in satellite and hub stores, to additional labor hours and trucks. And what remains a validation of our ongoing strategy, our Duralast brand continues to gain traction with our customers.","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our Commercial programs, having opened 670 programs over the past 36 months, a 29% increase. We believe our -- we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share. Our performance and current model demonstrate an ability to scale this business in a profitable manner. We continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business.","Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 10 new stores during the third quarter and 18 stores since the beginning of fiscal 2012. We currently have 297 stores in Mexico. We remain resolute on our strategy to open stores at a steady space while managing our Mexico business for the long run. We have operated stores in Mexico for over 13 years, and we continue to see great opportunity for growth going forward. Our returns and profit growth have them in line with our expectations.","Our efforts to open new stores in Brazil are progressing, and we expect to open our first store in the second half of calendar 2012. We're also expanding ALLDATA to Europe. Both of these initiatives remain in the early stages and will be implemented in a measured fashion. Neither should have a significant impact on our financial results over the mid-term planning horizon.","Recapping our second quarter performance for the company in total, our sales for the quarter were $2,112,000,000, an increase of 6.7% from last year's third quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores open for more than 1 year were up 3.9% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.6% of sales, up 37 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to leveraging distribution costs due to higher sales and lower shrink expense.","In regards to inflation, we have seen rising costs in commodity-related products. Although certain categories have experienced some higher levels of inflation, we have generally been able to pass along its cost inflation. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll remain -- and we'll make the appropriate adjustments, should they arise. Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and Commercial businesses. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross profit margin percentage. We are focused on growing absolute gross profit dollars. And gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment were up 7.5% for the quarter.","SG&A for the quarter was 31.4% of sales, flat with last year's third quarter. During the quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of sales were favorably impacted by lower incentive compensation, which was partially offset by higher self-insurance costs. This marks the third quarter where self-insurance was a headwind for us. The exposure we're seeing in this area made up of medical, workers' compensation, auto and general liabilities, remains a concern for us. However, we are seeing some improvement, and with our additional focus, expect this to be less of a pressure point going forward.","While we have experienced higher operating expense percentage growth these past couple of years, higher than our historic growth rates, we have been deliberate with our expenditures. We have purposefully invested dollars in our strategic retail and Commercial business initiatives to position the company for future sales and profit growth. This organization takes great pride in the disciplined approach to managing our cost structure and leveraging our culture of thrift, and we remain committed to appropriately managing expenses in line with our overall performance. Our current expenditures have been made to better position our company for future growth, a good example being the acceleration in opening Commercial programs. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure for this foreseeable future.","Earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter was $427 million, up 8.7% over last year's third quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 20.2% or 37 basis points versus the previous year's third quarter. This is the first quarter in our company's history that we have exceeded a 20% operating margin. Interest expense for the quarter was $39.7 million compared with $39.9 million in Q3 a year ago, essentially flat. As we completed the new $500 million 10-year bond deal this past quarter, we do expect our interest expense to increase approximately $16.5 million annually or $5 million more in interest expense in Q4.","Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $3,606,000,000 or approximately $385 million more than last year's third quarter balance of $3,221,000,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.46x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease debt levels based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.8%, above last year's third quarter of 35.6%, but essentially flat. Net income for the quarter of $249 million was up 9.3% versus the prior year's third quarter. Our diluted share count of 39.6 million was down approximately 8% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $6.28, up 18.6% over the prior year's third quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement for the third fiscal quarter of 2012, we generated $337 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $96 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 43 new stores plus 3 replacement stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores and work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,613 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and 297 stores in Mexico for a total store count of 4,910 stores.","Depreciation totaled $49 million for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $44.9 million. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $400 million of AutoZone's stock in the third quarter. And at the end of the quarter, we had $836 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 109%, flat with last year's third quarter.","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $2.6 billion, up 5.5% versus the Q3 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth, along with additional investments in coverage for select categories. Inventory per store was up 1.6% and below our 3.9% domestic same-store sales growth.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 32.7%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. In wrapping up our thoughts on the quarter, I know many listeners are concerned about the future and where our industry sales trends are headed. Let me stress, we remain bullish on the health of our industry. We're excited about our sales opportunities heading into the fourth quarter.","As previously mentioned, we have experienced unusual weather patterns for the last several months, and our sales have fluctuated positively and negatively, which isn't highly unusual. Our company has been successful over the long run because we remain patient and thoughtful on our execution, especially our execution at the store level. We remain committed to providing exceptional customer service in order to earn our customers' business every day.","Before we conclude, I want to reiterate our team's commitment to our culture and our customers. Although our industry's performance has been strong, we believe our efforts have contributed significantly to our success, as evidenced by our sales and share growth in both retail and Commercial. We remain committed to continuing to improve our business model and our operations. We believe our business model is healthy, and we have material opportunities for further improvements from this point.","For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we will continue to focus on our key priorities: Great People Providing Great Service!; profitably grow Commercial; leverage the Internet; and finally, our hub strategy. Our financial and operational performance has been strong for the first 3 quarters of our fiscal year. I want to again thank and congratulate our entire organization for their dedication to our customers, fellow AutoZoners, stockholders and communities. Our approach remains consistent. We're focused on succeeding in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and we are optimistic and excited about the remainder of the year.","Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's Gary and Simeon. I'll ask questions, and then Simeon will ask the follow-up or whatever the rules are. You commented, Bill, on the fact that business fluctuates, and we appreciate that. But could you -- what happens like -- and you could -- maybe you haven't seen this type of period, but it's such a mild winter, is there a concern that, that business in the spring will stay weaker into the summer because you just didn't do the damage to the cars that you normally do in winter? How do you think about that?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, I think your point's an excellent point, Gary. And I'm not sure that we have a well-defined answer for it. I don't remember a weather -- a winter where the weather was as mild as it was and when spring came as early as it did. Clearly, and we said this on our second quarter call, our failure-related businesses did not perform as well during the winter as they have historically. What I don't know is if we get significant heat in the summer like we typically do, will we have increased rate of failures or lower rate of failures? I think that's yet to be seen. And I don't have a good proxy for assessing how we've done it in the past.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And it's Simeon for a follow-up, 2 parts. To the extent there is a pull-forward, can you look at regions in which weather changes were not as dramatic and has there been more consistency? And then the second question, the Commercial programs, as you mentioned, are still relatively immature. But in some of the older rollouts, say on the 3-year side, can you talk about the balance of growth between the new customers versus increasing share with the existing ones?","William C. Rhodes","Sure. I'll take both parts of that, Simeon. Yes, in places where we have more normalized weather patterns, we have definitely seen more normalized sales patterns. And that's happened for during this whole period, both during the wintertime, during the early spring and during the later spring. As far as the older Commercial programs, one thing that I think is important to highlight, and if you looked at the productivity of our Commercial programs, they haven't -- they weren't necessarily as strong in the quarter. Some of that gets into how -- when in the quarter we're opening those programs, so I wouldn't read too much into that. What I will say is we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our older programs as well as our newer programs. And you must understand that on the older programs, as we're opening some of these new programs, we are taking -- cannibalizing some of the sales of the older programs, but we're frankly quite happy with the progress that we're seeing on that front so far. And as far as specific customers, we continue to grow new customers. We continue to accelerate the growth rate of retained customers. And we unfortunately do lose customers, but we're losing them at a slower rate than we have historically had. So we feel good about all 3 of those metrics at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan Chase.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Following up, can you talk more specifically about the variability during the quarter? The math on your competitor suggested sort of mid-single-digit negative comps in April. And related to that, what you are you seeing in May that gives you confidence that the pull-forward was generally isolated to the month of April?","William T. Giles","Yes. We wouldn't comment specifically on our month overall, but we weren't negative in any month during the quarter. So again, as Bill mentioned, April, and I don't think it's unusual for any of the other retailers, was a little bit softer. We attribute a lot of that to the weather. Again, we don't see anything from a macro perspective or the behavior of our customers that would indicate to us that there's been a change in the health of the industry. So we remain relatively positive as we look into the summer months, and we'll continue to execute our strategies.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Last year, you had -- there were some negative traffic comps in DIY. Could you just talk about what you saw in this most recent quarter and how you're thinking about DIY growth going forward, just maybe qualitatively?","William C. Rhodes","Sure. As we've talked about over, I guess, about the last year, we have returned to where we've been challenged on transaction count and have had negative transaction counts in our business each of the last 4 quarters. That trend didn't change significantly one way or the other during this quarter. As we've mentioned many times, some of it is structural in nature as the longevity of parts are much longer than they used to be. But the prices for those longer-lasting parts are much higher. So I don't think our point of view on transaction counts has changed any over the last year.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then final -- just one final one, as you think about 25% of your stores having Commercial programs that are 3 years or younger, what's the waterfall on productivity growth? I mean, do these stores come out at a -- Commercial program comes out at 70% productivity and then ramps up over 4 or 5 years to 100%? Is that what you're seeing?","William T. Giles","Yes. Probably a little less than that. And frankly, Chris, I think that we're still monitoring and measuring the model, if you will, of how the Commercial programs mature. When you think about all the things that we've done to our Commercial programs over the last 3 or 4 years between the territory sales managers, some of the technology that we've added in, the hub stores, all the inventory we've put into the hub stores to improve our coverage overall, it's an evolving model. And as Bill pointed out before, our programs are opening up stronger today than they were a few years ago, and they're continuing to ramp. But we don't really know what the maturity curve ultimately will be. But we're pretty happy with the programs that we've opened up to date and the progress that we're seeing.","William C. Rhodes","Yes. Can I build on that for a second, too? I think the most important thing is we don't think our oldest programs are mature. We think that they have tremendous upside from where we are today, so we don't know what the -- where the high watermark will be.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of follow-on questions on some topics that we've already discussed. First of all, as you think about the impact of the weather and its impact on the DIY business relative to the Commercial business, do you see those segments being impacted differently by the weather developments over the past couple of months?","William T. Giles","Not dramatically. I think that both businesses were impacted to some level by some of the activity in April overall. So I don't think that I think we're immune to it. And certainly, segments or 2 businesses were immune to it at all.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And also on the weather issue, as you think about the impact of that business or rather of changes in your business mix on gross margin, I know failure sounds like it was under a little bit of pressure. Can you talk about whether those mix changes impacted grosses or whether you would expect that to be the case over the next quarter or 2?","William T. Giles","Well, I don't know over the next quarter or 2, but there's no question that we probably had a little bit of a mix change -- a little bit of a mix impact -- mix impacted our gross margin rate for the quarter. So you're right on that, Matt, that the mix of the products probably put a little bit of pressure on margin. The margin's still healthy and we feel pretty good about the direction it's headed in. But for this past quarter, we'd say mix was probably not helpful.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then finally, you spoke about the pace of openings of new Commercial programs in the quarter and the extent to that -- to which might have been diluted your growth in sales per average -- Commercial sales per average Commercial program. Any way to quantify that? Only you guys see the schedule intra-quarter, and I know that I think you opened [ph] a record number of Commercial programs. So presumably the decline or the deceleration in productivity growth for Commercial program was magnified by that. Should we see that, assuming the pace of sales trends or underlying sales trends are equal, should we see that growth number bounce a bit over the summer quarter?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. Here's how I'd address that, Matt. Every segment of Commercial programs that we have is continuing to increase. So our long-term opened stores are continuing to grow average weekly sales at a pretty healthy rate. And our new Commercial programs are coming out faster than they were before, and they're growing more rapidly. So we continue to be pleased on all fronts.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's fair. But just to parse it a little bit more closely, your DIY sales per store in aggregate decelerated by about 1 point. Your Commercial sales in aggregate -- Commercial sales per Commercial program slowed by about 4 points. It sounds like that overstates the underlying slowdown in Commercial momentum.","William C. Rhodes","I think that's correct. And I don't want to get into any more specifics. But that's generally accurate.","Operator","Our next question is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays Capital.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Couple of questions on the Commercial side, Bill. So it looks like, if my math is right, for 13 consecutive quarters, your gross margins year-over-year have actually increased, which coincides pretty well with the point at which you started to accelerate the Commercial desk rollout. Would it be fair to assume that the benefits that you're getting on leverage from distribution costs actually outweigh the detrimental gross margins that are inherent on the Commercial side of the business relative to DIY?","William T. Giles","I wouldn't hang it on distribution costs per se, although we continue to get some benefits on all fronts of the components of gross margin. So clearly, as you've heard us talk about over the last several quarters, shrink has been a benefit to us, and we've had some good benefits on that. We've had some benefits on distribution. Gross margin rate over quarters has been relatively healthy. As Matt mentioned earlier, the mix of business probably was a little bit of a headwind on our overall gross margin. But as we continue to grow the Commercial business, it will have a lower gross margin rate than retail. So as it migrates itself to becoming a larger percentage of our overall total business, it will continue to put pressure on gross margin. You just haven't seen it in the last few quarters because we've gotten some benefits from things like shrink, et cetera.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Bill, with the acceleration of the Commercial desk program in the current quarter, was there any material cost over and above the original plan that was associated with the earlier opening of these desks?","William T. Giles","I wouldn't say over what we planned on. I think that we are continuing -- obviously, those programs that are opening are obviously less mature. And so therefore, they do have a little bit of a headwind from an expense standpoint. So there are some incremental costs that are incurred in the startup phase of the Commercial programs but not different than what we anticipated. So we have pretty good line of sight relative to how and where we're spending our money.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And one last one, if I may, it's somewhat of a follow-up to an earlier question. So if we look at the revenue stream of the 670 desks that have been added in the last 3 years and compare it to the older 2,000-plus desks, where do we stand relatively speaking in terms of the revenue production of the more recent desks that have been added?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. They clearly produce substantially below where the other more mature programs are. But as I mentioned earlier, we're pretty enthusiastic because they're coming out at higher levels and they're growing more rapidly. And the other part of that, that you have to think about is we've opened -- kind of like in the retail sector, we've opened the best programs in the best markets already. So we're going down to the next tier of market potential, if you will, and they're coming in at higher rates and they're growing more rapidly. So we continue to be pretty excited about that. And that gives us greater confidence to continue to open more and more programs over time.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Want to dig a little bit deeper -- and thanks, Bill, for all the color around the sales trends. And if you look at it holistically, comparing the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, the second quarter, the third quarter, how much demand do you think we did pull forward? Could it be 100 basis points that we gave up this quarter? And secondly, if you look at those individual categories, do you think some of that pull-forward we have is still going to be with us in the fourth quarter? Or do you think we worked through most of it in April and a little bit of May?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. Greg, those are great questions. And in all fairness, I wish I could quantifiably answer those with some sense of assurance. But even with hindsight and all the details that we have, I can't tell you exactly how much the third quarter benefited by it -- or the second quarter benefited by it and the third quarter was impacted by it. Something in your order of magnitude seems like it makes sense to me. And then moving into your second part of your question, what does this mean to the summer selling season? If it truly was that maintenance jobs that are normally performed when the weather improves were pulled forward earlier, then that should have no bearing on our summer months. What we don't know is the question that was asked earlier of the milder winter, did it put less stress on parts? Yes. Does that mean it's going -- more parts are going to fail in the summer? Or does it mean fewer parts are going to fail? And I think that's yet to be seen. I think the big thing from our point of view, we had a choppy month. We have those from time to time. We are not altering what we are doing in our business in any material way. We continue to believe that this industry is incredibly healthy. We have tremendous opportunities to control our own destiny. And so we're moving forward with our plans.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And on the inflation front, last year, we had some pressure in some of the commodity chemicals, et cetera. If you were to compare now to a year ago, what do you think inflation is either in your purchasing costs or going in sell-through?","William T. Giles","I'd say on a relative basis less, so I think that we're seeing a little bit less inflation than we probably did a year ago. And keep in mind also that when we talk about prices being higher that's somewhat inflation-related, there's also quality of product. There's innovation and technology enhancements that are being made to the products that create some level of inflation, albeit separate from commodity. But overall, we're seeing probably a little bit less inflation now than we were last year.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, AP to inventory steady at 109%. Is it fair to say that now we've sort of reached a steady state there?","William T. Giles","Yes. I think that our inventory turn is relatively flat. I think that we've had good leverage on AP to inventory. And as we have mentioned a couple of quarters ago, we expect it to be around this number. It does have opportunity to improve, but this is probably a pretty good level.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Bill, is it okay if I ask a question besides weather?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, that would be fantastic.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I wanted to talk about a competitive issue. O'Reilly has indicated that it is looking to grow its private brand mix, presumably to help improve its do-it-yourself competitiveness. And I think they're around 33% of their revenues today. Can you remind us if AutoZone is still at 50% on your private brand? Or have you been growing that of late?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. We've been growing it but not on a material percentage of the business basis. But it continues to be a very important part of our offering.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The other change that O'Reilly was alluding to was expanding the radius around its stores where it measures vehicle registration data, I guess, further enhancing its parts mix for late-model vehicles over a larger number of vehicles. Can you compare that to Zone's strategy in how you're customizing your mix of inventory to target that Commercial customer?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I think the big thing for us is as we continue to further penetrate the Commercial market, we continue to find opportunities in both our satellite stores and our hub stores to expand the mix. In very few instances have we expanded it to a point that we felt like we went too far. Many times, we expanded only to turn around and come back 6 to 12 months later and expand it again and have just as much upside as we had before. So I think our point of view is the farther we penetrate the Commercial market, it -- we basically increase the size of the market the more we penetrate it. And that allows us to productively add inventory more and more. And the funny thing is every time we add \"Commercial or late-model products,\" we see significant amounts of sales on the DIY side of the business. So it very much helps the productivity of our overall model.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And one last question. You were talking about the seasonality of your failure business, and that peaks during your third quarter. Can you maybe give us a little bit of numbers around the failure contribution both on an annual basis as well as to how it shakes out by quarter?","William T. Giles","In terms of sales, you're talking about, Dan?","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","William T. Giles","Our overall penetration of failure and maintenance hasn't really moved too much. So when you think about its contribution overall by quarter, it's been relatively consistent. So that's probably the best way to look at it, if you go back and look at it that way.","Operator","Our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Nomura.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A couple of things also non-weather-related. Around Commercial, would you mind talking about kind of what would be conceptual limitations to your growth there? For example, your pricing posture against your retail shelf pricing and how you're managing that; private label and how you're finding that, whether that's a limitation to the Commercial customer; availability, of course, I know you've been bulking up on. But just wondering kind of what are kind of the big limitations to reach where the other guys are in terms of penetration, and then I had a quick follow-up.","William C. Rhodes","Sure. Ultimately, I don't think there's any limitations other than limitations we put on ourselves. I'll start with the price notion. Clearly, for our best customers, we have differentiated pricing versus what we have in our retail customers. Our pricing seems to be well-accepted in the marketplace. I don't see that as any limitation. As far as our private label brand penetration, the way I always discuss this is if we had more national brands, we might be able to accelerate our growth faster than we are otherwise today. But the same would've been said in the retail business 20, 25 years ago, that if we would have the national brands, then we would've been able to grow more rapidly. I'm very pleased with the progression that we have in our business. I think our product offering provides great high-quality products at great prices backed by good warranties. And I think the longer we go, the more we see that the market is very accepting of those private labels. What was the third item? I forgot.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just around availability and...","William C. Rhodes","I think we've addressed the availability thing. And as I've said, the more we address it, the more we realize we have farther to go, particularly with the hub stores. And as I mentioned, we spend a lot of time talking about the hub stores. And the fact that we still have over 50 of them that aren't the size or in the location that we want, that'll be a nice upside for us to be able to help both sides of our customers going forward.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And if I could just follow up with a question on margin. I know you mentioned you're much more margin dollar-sensitive than margin rate, but I'm sure you still look at your competitors on a margin rate basis just for comparison. And both of them are creeping up pretty much near 50%, not very far from where you are. And considering your mix, let's say, is more advantaged both in private label, from the mix of ALLDATA or just for more retail business versus Commercial, I would think there'd be a couple hundred basis points advantage that you might have on rate. Can you speak to that or if you're seeing other competitors that are really keeping you limiting that upside?","William T. Giles","Yes. I think trying to look at the specific gross margin rates of competitors is very challenging because there's very different elements in there. You don't know what's going on with shrink, you don't know what going on -- our distribution strategies are different. So looking at the macro number to me is challenging. What we look at is as how is our pricing versus the competitive marketplace. And we want to make sure that we are providing a great value for the price that we're offering our customers. And we seem to see that on both the sectors, we're doing just fine.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.","Adam Sindler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Actually, all of my questions have now just been answered.","Operator","Our next question is from David Gober with Morgan Stanley.","Shaun Kolnick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Shaun Kolnick on for Dave. With the record number of programs up in the quarter, did you open any programs specifically in one region? Or was it pretty evenly spread across the country?","William C. Rhodes","It was very evenly spread across the country.","Shaun Kolnick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, is there any update on the new labor system being rolled out this year?","William C. Rhodes","No, I think it's in pilot stages right now, and we're going to -- I'm sure we'll have to make some refinements to it. But then we'll be rolling it out as we move through the quarter and on into the first part of next year.","All right. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model remains solid. We remain excited about our growth prospects for the year. We cannot take anything for granted as we understand that our customers have alternatives. Our culture remains our key point of differentiation from our competition, and we must not lose sight of the importance of basic store execution in order to remain successful. We have a solid plan for the fourth quarter of 2012, and our team is positioned to succeed. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we will continue to focus on the basics and never take our eye off of optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be incredibly successful.","We'd also like to wish everyone a happy and safe Memorial Day. It is important that we recognize our U.S. servicemen and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our country and also honor those past and present for their dedicated service on our behalf. We thank you for participating in today's call.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."],"2934":["AutoZone, Inc.

And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2019 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learned about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across our organization for their dedication, hard work and for putting our customers first in everything they do again this quarter. Their efforts directly correlate to our success.","On the last earnings call, we were optimistic about our second quarter, but cautioned everyone about the inherent volatility the second quarter presents to us every single year. It is our lowest sales quarter. It has a couple of holidays that shift year-to-year and different weather patterns make our week-to-week sales quite volatile.","As we entered this winter, we knew we had a more normalized winter last year than the two years before. We also knew that the middle of the quarter last year was very strong due to harsh winter conditions.","This year, our sales were generally on plan for the first few weeks. Then they were materially softer in the middle of the quarter on both the one and two year basis. Then when the polar vortex arrived sales rebounded nicely to finish the quarter.","We wish we didn't have to focus so much on 'the weather' but in the second quarter in particular it really matters. Just to add an exclamation point, our weekly sales during the quarter had a variance of more than $40 million between the highest and lowest weeks.","When it gets cold, certain products fail, like batteries. When cold is forecast, any freeze [ph] sales spike. When there's snow and ice plows tear off the roads and create potholes, which lead to other failures, and when the weather is mild, people do maintenance work like crate jobs.","While the cold temperatures didn't come until the latter half of January, they came and our business responded. Was the cold enough to have lingering benefits? Yes to some extent, and the lingering effects usually come more from the maintenance side like brake systems, chassis and the like.","As spring begins to arrive, so do tax refunds. We've begun to see some customers using their refunds in our stores in the last few weeks. But there is a significant speculation in the media and market on whether or not the total refund dollars will be similar to last year or not. We've seen conflicting reports, but regardless, we are ready to help our customers leverage those refunds to ensure their vehicles are performing well.","Now let's focus on the two different customer bases we serve, DIY and DIFM. We previously mentioned that our DIY market share gains were strong in the first half of last fiscal year and that growth materially subsided in the second half.","During the first half of this year, our market share has continued to grow and improved slightly, which we consider encouraging as we are lapping the large gains we made this time last year.","While DIY same store sales were slightly positive for the second quarter and for the year-to-date, we are optimistic that business can continue to grow for the remainder of the year.","Our optimism comes from the parts and staffing initiatives we have in place. If you recall this time last year, we had several major product category conversions underway and several of them did not go as planned. This year we are in much better shape as we enter the selling season. And we have intensified our focus on enhancing the customer service experience.","As part of our effort, we made meaningful pay adjustments to our most tenured hourly AutoZoners to ensure that they are compensated appropriately. We feel we are well positioned as we enter our peak selling period.","Regarding commercial, our sales growth eclipsed last quarter's double-digit gains ending up 12.9%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. We are excited about, but not surprised by this growth acceleration. We have been steadily building a stronger foundation and our customers are continuing to notice, recognize and reward those improvements.","Over the last several years, we have substantially improved our inventory availability. We have worked diligently to enhance the quality of the parts and products we sell. Many under the Duralast name.","Our sales force is becoming more tenured and effective and most notably recently we have been increasing the engagement of the local store teams, particularly the store manager and district manager, and we feel well-positioned to continue strong growth for the balance of the year.","Overall, we are encouraged as we head into the back half of the year. We are focused on flawlessly executing on the initiatives we have in place. While we have invested more on our AutoZoners and more in our systems, we have done so with the objective of improving customer facing activities. Our execution is improving as we intensify our focus on the customer.","As I mentioned the last quarter's earnings call, our annual operating theme for 2019 is focused on drive for excellence. A relentless focus on what matters to our customers, exceptional service, fast deliveries, high quality parts and products, flawless execution, changes in product assortments and store merchandising and on and on. We are focused on reducing non-selling tasks in our stores in order to reallocate that time, talent and attention to sales activities.","Tariffs have been a hot topic of late, so we'd like to address their impact on us. The initial tariffs on raw materials weren't significant. The 10% tariffs were expanded to broader and broader categories.","We did not see a material cost increase from these tariffs in fiscal 2018, because we were able to negotiate and offset some of the tariffs based on the strength of the U.S. dollar. Looking forward, the U.S. has agreed to postpone plans to increase tariffs from 10% to 25% until later.","At this point, we are waiting like you are. We will continue to monitor developments closely and working with our industry associations to share our concerns about the potential negative ramifications of ongoing and increased tariffs to our customers and the broader economy.","That said, our industry has much lower elasticity of demand than most other retail distribution sectors. If your car won't start and you have to go to work, you or someone else has to fix it. This phenomenon has historically allowed our industry to pass on product inflation in higher retails.","To date, the tariffs has not resulted in meaningful incremental inflation in retail pricing and unless the tariffs increase to 25% or added to other products we sell, we don't anticipate this being materially different in the second half of the year.","Turning to our omnichannel efforts. We continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting them when, where and how they want to shop. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites autozone.com AutoZonePro, mobile and ALLDATA.","In fact, we are investing more than ever before this fiscal year in improving these systems. We continued to see rapid growth in website traffic, as well as Ship-To-Home and Buy Online Pick Up In Store sales. While representing a very small percentage of our business, we are pleased with the acceleration of growth in our online platforms in both retail and commercial. And for retail through Ship To Home Buy Online Pick Up In Store and through our industry leading next-day delivery program that allows customers in over 85% of U.S. markets to order as late as 10:00 P.M. and oh by the way, we're testing midnight in a couple of markets and receive their products at their home the very next day.","We are also working diligently to further enhance our digital capabilities with our commercial customers to ensure that they have a great seamless intuitive no hassle way to interact with us digitally.","In summary, we're pleased with our recent performance and encouraged about our industry and our prospects for the remainder of fiscal 2019 and beyond. Macro factors are currently in our favor and we remain committed to not only maintaining, but growing our market share in both DIY and commercial.","Now, let me provide more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales increased 3.1% and domestic same-store sales were up 2.6%. As a reminder, we sold IMC in the middle of fiscal 2018, so our total domestic sales comparisons include sales from that business in the total number, but those sales have no bearing on the same-store sales results in Q2.","Regionally, our Northeastern Midwestern and mid-Atlantic markets representing roughly 28% of our sales performed 13 basis points better than the remaining markets. During the quarter, we opened 20 new stores in the United States and our commercial business opened 22 net new programs. We expect to open approximately 150 net new commercial programs this fiscal year.","Currently 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continue to expand in Mexico opening one new store. We also opened two new stores in Brazil this quarter finishing with 22.","Regarding our inventory initiatives in the spirit of our YES! We've Got It initiative, we continued our efforts around expanding our hub store network. We opened two additional hubs this past quarter and now have 171 hub stores and an additional 27 mega-hubs totaling 198 stores with significantly expanded parts assortments.","As we have seen both our DIY and commercial sales expand in markets where hub, mega hubs are added we will continue to grow the number of hubs we have this year. Having opened four already, we expect to open as many as 16 hubs for the full year with most being mega hubs.","As a reminder, both our hubs and mega-hubs are focused on making available additional coverage to the local markets, meaning, adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our network before.","Previously, we relied on shipping these hard to find or slower turning SKUs into a market when the demand arose. Both of these efforts are designed to enhance our ability to meet our customer's needs for coverage and immediacy.","Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it in a long term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We remain focused on the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request.","Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 41.4% versus last year's second quarter which reflect the sale of AutoAnythinng during fiscal 2018. We will continue to make our omnichannel selling efforts a key focus for 2019.","While Ship-To-Home - Ship-To-Home next day, Buy Online Pick Up In Store and commercial customer order - ordering are all showing growth and more traffic to our online sites, we continue to see customers primarily doing lots of research online and then coming into the store in order to receive trustworthy advice, Fix Finder, Loan-A-Tool and a host of services that simply cannot be duplicated online prior to making the sale.","Our efforts in 2019 are to make sure our AutoZoners are freed up in stores to provide WOW! Customer Service to every single customer. While, our online sales are small substantially less than 5% of our total sales, the omnichannel experience is very important for the customer experience. So we will continue to invest in our digital platforms.","With the continued aging of the car population and recently lower gas prices at the pump, these are contributing to our optimism regarding 2018 for both DIY and commercial. These trends remain encouraging.","Along with our operating theme for 2019 Drive for Excellence, we create key priorities each year. For 2019, these priorities are, customer's first, commercial acceleration, omnichannel, leveraging technology and YES! We've Got It inventory initiatives.","We are spending a significant amount of time across the organization, but especially in stores identifying areas where tasks can be simplified, streamlined or eliminated in order to free up time for our AutoZoners to focus intensely on customers and their needs.","We are also making further technology investments to improve our electronic catalog and point-of-sale systems to ensure we are putting customers first. We believe our current and future technology investments will improve our competitive position and lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.","While these investments are adding to both operating expense and capital expense, we feel this is - will meaningfully improve the customer shopping experience.","Regarding commercial acceleration. We've been investing in systems to help AutoZoners sell more efficiently and customers conduct business with us easier. While most of these initiatives won't be rolled out until late calendar 2019 or even later, our focus on increasing the engagement of the broader store team and focusing on existing customers is paying off today. We are quite pleased with our momentum heading into the new calendar year.","We should once again highlight another strong performance to return on invested capital as we were able to finish our second quarter at 33.5%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hardlines retailing.","However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investor's capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to again thank and reinforce how appreciative we are about our AutoZoners efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customer's expectations. We are excited about all the initiatives we are working on throughout 2019, but everything must start with the efforts of our exceptional AutoZoners.","Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles? Bill?","Bill Giles","Thanks Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results.","For the quarter, total auto parts sales which include our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores increased 3.1% and for the trailing 52-weeks ended total sales per AutoZone stores were $1.8 million.","Total commercial sales increased 12.9% in the quarter commercial represented 21% of our total sales and grew $59 million over last year's Q2. We are now averaging just under $10,000 a week and commercial sales per program. On a trailing four quarters, we are now selling over $2.3 billion commercially.","We now have our commercial program in 4,788 stores or 85% of our domestic stores. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we remain committed to gaining market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share.","Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened one new store during the second quarter ending the quarter with 568 stores. We expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2019.","Regarding Brazil, we now operate 22 stores. We have aggressive plans of approximately 17 additional stores by the end of the fiscal 2019. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long term future of this market. If we can prove success, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico, so while challenging the potential side of this market is significant.","Gross margin for the quarter was 54.1% of sales, up 115 basis points from last year's second quarter. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the impact of the sale of the two businesses completed last fiscal year and higher merchandise margins.","While we're asked about gross margin assumptions and direction they will be headed, our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.","SG&A for the quarter was 37.7% of sales, lower by approximately 667 basis points from last year's second quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales benefited 800 basis points versus last year's Q2, due to the impairment charge related to the sale of the two businesses, partially offset by the planned increase in store payroll, primarily domestic and investments in technology.","On the cost front, we highlighted on last few quarters conference calls the investments we will be making, specifically wage rates and technology for this fiscal year. For the remainder of the year, we feel that consensus numbers for SG&A generally reflect those investments.","However, I'd also want to remind everyone that fiscal 2019 includes a 53rd week, I bring this up to make sure analysts model that last quarter accordingly, and we encourage everyone to look to the last time we had a 53rd week which is Q4, 2013 as litmus test for modeling.","EBIT for the quarter was $400 million. Our EBIT margin was 16.3%. Interest expense for the quarter was $41 million, up slightly from Q2 a year ago. We are planning interest in the $44 million to $45 million range in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 versus $42 million last year.","Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.1 billion or approximately $70 million above last year's Q2 ending balance of $5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR.","While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market positions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter our tax rate was 17.9%. Along with tax reform, we benefited 386 basis points in our rates from stock options exercised during the quarter. Excluding this benefit, our rate was 21.7%.","Because it is impossible to predict when individuals will exercise options, we encourage everyone to model up on a rate assuming no stock option impact and roughly around 24% and we will report both rates.","Net income for the quarter was $295 million, up 1.8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 25.7 million was down 8% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $11.49, up 10.7% over the prior year's second quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement for the second quarter, we generated $368 million of operating cash flow and net fixed assets were up 4.6% versus last year, capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $97.7 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 23 net new stores this quarter.","Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub remodels or openings, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.","With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,651 stores in 50 states in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 568 stores in Mexico and 22 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,241.","Depreciation totaled $83.8 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $79.4 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates.","We repurchased $350 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter end, we had $635 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at quarter end.","Again, I want to stress we managed to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 5.4% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement.","Inventory per location was $690,000 versus $671,000 last year and $658,000 this past quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $58,000 versus negative $46,000 last year and a negative $59,000 last quarter. As a result, the accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 108.5%.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in a return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 33.5%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. While we had a strong start to our fiscal year, we know we have much work to do to finish this year strong. Our spring and summer periods generate a majority of our annual sales, and we'll be opening up a majority of our new stores and new commercial programs during this time period.","What keeps us incurs [ph] is the relentless focus we have on servicing our customers better and simplifying our AutoZoners work especially at the store level to reduce clutter and unnecessary tasks that get in the way of making the customer experience better for both our do-it-yourself customer and our professional customer.","We believe our industry's fundamentals remain very strong and are likely improving with the price of gas at the pump down versus last year. This upcoming quarter, we are focused on both macro and internally driven initiatives.","We are certainly monitoring the pace and amount of tax returns as this could either a significant benefit or a detractor based on the total refund dollars that are processed. And we are most excited with the sales tracks that we have been gaining especially in our commercial business.","We are excited about our balanced model for growth around domestic retail and commercial, international, online and Pickup In Store. We believe our hubs and mega-hubs Mexico, Brazil, ALLDATA and e-commerce can all grow their top lines in 2019.","To execute at a high level, we have consistently - we have to consistently adhere to Living the Pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan.","Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will be long into the future.","Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure that we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance.","In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over now nearly 40 years and we continue to be excited about our future.","Now, I would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question is on the gross margin outlook. Bill, you mentioned that you are focusing more on gross profit dollars. I think in the past you talked about - you saw some opportunities in terms of some gross market rate expansion going forward. So how are you thinking about the merchandise margin going forward?","And related to that, did this quarter include any benefit from - through the early timing, or early receipts related to tariffs or anything with managing the tariff through?","Bill Giles","I would say probably not. I mean, as we mentioned we had about 70 basis point impact, positive impact from the sale of the two business units, so far it be, a little less than half of that in next quarter. Excluding that our margin remains relatively healthy. So we are up about 44 basis points this quarter.","I think the merchandising organization has done a terrific job. They are sourcing the opportunities that they've done and managing inventory. So overall, we've been pretty sharp on our margin.","We are going to continue to have pressure on margin as our commercial business continues to grow at significantly faster rate than our DIY business. So we continue to expect to see that margin benefit that you will see [ph] come down a little bit over time, but we'll continue to be driving gross margin dollars.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then a follow up on your comment around 4Q, including the 53rd week. As you looked at the consensus numbers, where do you think people aren't picking it up? Is it a sales question, is it expenses, is it earnings? Where do you think the consensus isn't picking up that 53rd week?","Bill Giles","Yeah, I'm not calling out that they are not picking it up necessarily. I just wanted to make sure that others - that we highlighted it for anyone who isn't just so that when we get to the fourth quarter there will be no mystery about it and I would encourage you to just go back to 2013 to see how that's kind of laid out. But I'm not calling out anything specifically about the consensus estimates for the 53rd week.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then last question, you know, the commercial growth is really impressive as was the acceleration, especially in light of the weather issues in the middle of the quarter. Can you talk about what the primary drivers are, do you think it's the mega hubs that's driving the improvement, is it the sales effort and any delineation there?","And then related to that on the mega hubs, are you starting to transition to more same base fulfillment out of the mega hubs? Or is it still primarily an overnight fulfillment stores? Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Yeah, terrific question Chris. First of all, I think the growth in our commercial business and the acceleration in that growth which we are quite pleased with as well is coming because of a long list of issues that we've been - or initiatives we've been embarking on for the last several years.","We really started this inventory availability efforts probably four years ago now. They were first focused on in-store, placements and improvements in inventory there that were more focused on the commercial business. They then evolved to our hub stores and now our mega hub stores.","I think the other big thing that we are doing this year is we have really put a lot of focus on getting our in-store teams very focused on customer service in the commercial business.","So our store managers are now making sales calls and they are making sales calls, but the biggest thing they are doing is they are making customer service calls. And they are understanding where we're doing really well and their understanding where we have opportunities for improvement.","And then they are going back and doing what they do. They are managing the store operations, but focused much more today than a year or two ago on the commercial operations as well.","As we look at the mega hubs, one other big element and I want to talk about in commercial, is the Duralast brand. If we had this call 10 years ago, I think most of the people listening to it would have thought that the Duralast brand was a net negative.","Make no mistake about it, the Duralast brand is a big positive for our commercial business. And as we've improved the product quality and as we improved the assortments, we are really excited about what it means to our long-term growth potential.","As far as your question specifically on the mega hubs and are we increasing the same-day service? Yes, every time we open one, we increase the amount of stores that get same day or even three time a day service.","So, whatever stores are attached directly to that mega hub will immediately get three time a day access to that inventory. If there are other hubs that are in the local market that they can get to, those hubs will also get service between one and three times a day on a same day basis. So absolutely as we open more and more mega hubs, we are increasing the same day service.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks, guys.","Bill Rhodes","All right. Thank you.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill, your comments around the late tax refund, should we interpret that to mean that the business has slowed given that tax refund are down materially year-over-year in the last few week?","Bill Rhodes","Yeah, It's a fantastic question, Michael. And frankly one that I don't want to spend too much time on. As you well know, we have a - we released our earning so soon after the end of the quarter. So our quarter ended 17 days ago or so.","And so I don't like to spend any time on what's going on in such a short period of time, I just don't think it's productive and I know you all are looking at the long-term anyway.","But to your point, so far in the tax refund season, through last Friday, which we've all seen the numbers, we're down about 40%. I think it's $100 million through last Friday this time last year and it's $60 billion - $100 billion and $60 billion this year. Clearly that is impactful to our business. We talked every single year over the last decade about the importance of tax refund season.","I think that it's going to be really interesting to see what transpires over the next couple of weeks. The child income tax credit and earned income - child tax credit and earned income tax credit both have been delayed. We haven see those dollars. I think the expectation is they will begin to flow this week. We are anxiously awaiting them and we are going to make sure we are in very good shape and prepared to take advantage of whatever tax monies flow.","At the end of the day, there is nothing we can do about it. We are ready for them and look forward to seeing those dollars, but nothing else we can do beyond that.","Michael Lasser","I understood. That's helpful commentary. My follow-up question is your tone around price increases and the impact from tariffs related inflation on your business in the contrast a bit with what the others in the industry are saying. They are calling out clearly a benefit to the comp - their comps from some inflation that pushed through if only because of from a tariff. Why you think what you're seeing is different than them?","Bill Rhodes","Yeah, I think it's a great question. We're asking ourselves the same question, because frankly we're not seeing additional inflation over what we historically have seen. So I'm not sure what they are seeing in their numbers.","As I mentioned in our prepared remarks even with the tariffs that we saw at the same times that those tariffs happened the currency fluctuations where tariffs were up and the currencies was up 8%, so we were able to negotiate a significant amount of those increases away. So we haven't seen material changes one way or the other.","Michael Lasser","Understood. Good luck with the rest of the year.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you, Michael. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Simeon Gutman [Morgan Stanley]. Your line is now open.","Simeon Gutman","I apologize I missed a couple of the first questions. So hopefully this isn't repetitive. My first question is on the gross margin theme, and I assume it's being helped to some degree by private brand. I wanted to ask you how contentious your internal debate is around investing more into price versus letting gross margin go up.","Because as you know the bogyman of the space has been online and pricing and we get intrigued by that question a lot. So you are allowing the gross to grow up. How big of a debate is it internally to push pricing down?","Bill Giles","Yeah. I would say it's not necessarily debate per se. I mean, we're going to be priced right and within the marketplace, and we're going to remain competitive. And our value of proposition obviously is well beyond just pricing. As Bill actually mentioned in his prepared remarks, there's an awful lot of service that take place for both our DIY customers and our commercial customers both, as far as delivering products to our commercial customers or servicing the customer inside the DIY store with either Fix Finder, testing batteries, testing starters. So there is all sorts of service that takes place inside of store.","So it's really beyond just pricing, but we're going to remain competitive in pricing and we're going to just continue to be aggressive about sourcing and finding opportunities to lower acquisition cost that will keep up our margin healthy.","We obviously have had good improvement in margin over the last quarter - over the last several quarters. We expect our margin to remain healthy, but we also recognize that as our commercial business grows at an accelerated rate over DIY that will continue to put pressure on margin. So you may not see as big as increases in the future.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up is on the commercial sales, the composition of the 13% gain this quarter. Can you tell us what was a bigger driver, sales for commercial account or the number of accounts that you're picking up?","Bill Rhodes","I would say it's across the board. It was customer account increases, it was average ticket increases, it was new customers, it was up and down the street customers, it was national account customers. We're seeing it, Simeon, across the board.","We've seen that momentum continue to grow over about that last year and I think it's because we're working on the foundational elements that are important to the customer.","Simeon Gutman","And can I just follow-up to that, are there certain product categories where your share gains are outsized or are you seeing like breadth across all of your product categories?","Bill Rhodes","Yeah. There is one category in particular where our gains are high, but it's not driving our overall performance and that's because there are some supply disruptions in the marketplace. Those things are always happening.","As we talked last year, we had several high disruptions on our behalf last year. But it's really across the board from - but mainly focused on our hard points. There is not a lot of commodity sales growth. It's maintenance and failure of parts is where we're growing our business.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. Thank you both. Good quarter.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Bill Giles","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Dan Wewer","Yeah. Thanks. Bill you talked a lot about the big growth in Mexico and Brazil. Can you remind us how the economics of the stores compared to the U.S. perhaps talk about sales per store and operating margin rate?","And then also curious as to why you're more upbeat long term about Brazil and Mexico, is it just the size of the population or there other benefits?","Bill Rhodes","Yeah, terrific questions. We haven't gone into a lot of specifics of our business in either one. Mexico, we've been there for 20 years now and we have a really nice robust business, and the team down there has done a fantastic job and they really leveraged the AutoZone culture. The proudest thing that I have every time I'm down there is just to look and see how much they've replicated what has made AutoZone special in the United States.","As for Brazil, I was actually there last week. We had to talk a whole lot about that business except we mention that we're losing a sizable amount of money down there today. We have 22 stores. We've been there for six years, 6.5 years now. It's slow going because we're trying to make sure that we figure it out.","The one thing that we have solved for sure is that it works for the Brazilian customer. The customer traffic flow that we have down there is really terrific. It's exciting to see every time I go down there, I get inspired and encouraged about what could be.","The economics don't work for us yet. That's because we have 22 stores. We've got a big overhead structure in place and warehouse structure in place. We're still developing the vendor relationships that we need and we're optimistic about the future, but we haven't passed that final test phase yet.","What makes us excited and the reason we're there is it can be a really, really sizable market. So the size of the prize could be significant. One of the things we talked about last year when we sold IMC and AutoAnything is that they just couldn't ever be material drivers of the performance of AutoZone.","Well Brazil is the exact opposite of that. We could easily have 1000 stores in Brazil if we can make it work for us financially, but we have not finished checking that box yet.","Dan Wewer","Okay. And then just second question on the accelerated SG&A spend in 2019. Do you expect the SG&A growth to increase at the same rate in fiscal year '20? Or does that moderate closer to historic levels?","Bill Giles","It should moderate to more historical levels. I mean, we made some significant investments this year both on wages where we really invested in our most tenured and talented AutoZoners that are facing our customers every day. That investment was made at the tail end of Q1.","And so when we - we will continue to have an accelerated SG&A growth rate until the point in time in which we anniversary that. And we also have been making some technology investments throughout the year as well.","But Dan, I think if you look past FY '20 or fiscal year '20 when you get past the first quarter of fiscal year '20 then you should begin to see some more historical growth rates on our SG&A spend.","Dan Wewer","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Speakers, the next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning.","Seth Basham","My question for you is around mega-hubs build and you talked about increasing your mega-hub count and success [ph] best strategy. Can you give us some perspective for the mega-hubs that have been open for more than a year and markets that they serve, do they continue to outcome the company average?","Bill Rhodes","Yeah, I would say particularly the mega-hub itself will significantly outcome because it's got a significant inventory assortment. But the stores attached to it will generally grow certainly in the first year more and then it will moderate, but they will continue to outcome a little bit.","Seth Basham","That's helpful perspective. So when you think about the improvement in commercial sales trends in the last few quarters, how would you attribute the breakdown between increased availability through your mega hub and hub strategy relative to your increased engagement in the store teams?","Bill Rhodes","You know, I think the bigger thing that we've changed year-over-year is the engagement of the store teams. This mega hub and inventory availability work, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, that's been going on for four years.","We continue to get better and better at it and I think the customer continues to appreciate it more and more, just like they are continuing to appreciate the Duralast brand more and more. But I think the big - the biggest change that we made is the store manager into district manager engagement and it really makes a difference.","Seth Basham","Thank you very much and good luck.","Bill Rhodes","All right. Thanks, Seth.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jeffries. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Mark Jordan on for Bret. Good morning.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Just looking at the commercial growth here again, digging a little deeper, it sounds like you're taking share here and just thinking about the growth, are we taking maybe some national accounts or signing a more independent garages, just trying to think where it's going from here?","Bill Rhodes","Yeah, as I mentioned in a minute ago, we're re seeing really good growth on both the up and down the street accounts, the national accounts, the specific sectors of the national accounts from the tire stores to the - buy here, pay here folks. We're really picking it up across the board. There's not really a standout difference. And as I mentioned, we're also seeing it in maintenance and failure parts primarily.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. And then just one more on mega hubs and hubs here, it looks like maybe 12 more in the back half of the year, mostly mega hubs. How should we think about the cadence of those openings? Are they more maybe - Q3, Q4 weighted?","Bill Giles","Yeah, I think we'll probably just be ratably open throughout the remainder of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. Speakers, the next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Brian Nagel","Hi. Good morning.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning.","Brian Nagel","Nice quarter.","Bill Rhodes","Thanks.","Brian Nagel","I too wanted to discuss a bit the commercial growth, I know there's a number of questions on it already. But if you look into your business you know, clearly the rate of sales growth in commercial has pick up very nicely, however, you're taking market share, you know, this comes on the hills now of several years of significant investment in the business.","So with regard to the investment, how much opportunity remains to so to say continue to build out the infrastructure of your commercial operation from here or is it more a function of continue - just continue to gain share?","Bill Rhodes","I think it's a fantastic question and one that frankly we can't answer for you today. When you think about it, our retail business has 15% market share. Even with all this excitement that we have around how well we're going, we still have 3% share in commercial. We got a long way to go.","What do we do to crack that code to get it to 5% share, 10% share, 15% share over time, I think we're still trying to figure that out. What I am excited about is while we're trying to figure out some bigger potential possibilities, we are doing the day-to-day blocking and tackling which is leading to our accelerated growth and it feels like it's more sustainable when you do it that way.","Brian Nagel","Got it. And then within that as a follow-up to that, are there markets and I understand there is competitive dynamic. But are there other markets within your system that you have - you do enjoy outsized market share in the commercial side that could sort of say serve as a roadmap for the business in general?","Bill Rhodes","There is clearly markets that - you know, maybe the market share might be double what it is in some markets. But we don't have 10% or 15% share in any markets. We're going to. We just haven't figured it out yet.","Brian Nagel","Got it. And then there's one final question. With regard to wage inflation, I think you may have address this in prepared comments, and we talked a lot about higher wages is a somewhat of a negative headwind to earnings growth. Where are we on that front?","Bill Rhodes","Well, we've been talking about higher wages and higher wage growth at AutoZone for over a couple of years now. We did take that significant step as Bill mentioned in the latter part of the first quarter and we significantly increased the compensation of our most tenured and talented and knowledgeable AutoZoners at the hourly level. The ones that are closest to the customer. That will anniversary itself as he mentioned in the latter part of this first quarter.","That said, I do think that you have two parts of the wage story that's been going on. One is the regulatory fees, where in places like California they are on a path to $15 an hour and that's going to happen every year or every six months depending on if you are in a municipality or at the state level. So those increases are going to continue.","It still feels like to us that there is even outside of the regulated areas that there is more wage pressure than there has historically been. I think that has a lot to do with where we are in the economic cycle right now. Will that continue? I think it depends on what happens with the economic cycle.","Brian Nagel","Thank you very much.","Bill Rhodes","All right. Thank you. Have a great day.","Bill Rhodes","All right. Well, thank you all for joining us today. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth process for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We will continue to execute on our game plan to succeed this fiscal year.","But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. We thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"2768":["AutoZone, Inc.

Finally, we will highlight what we've been doing to improve our business model for today and beyond.","We are very excited about the initiatives we're working on and believe our recent learning's will help to shape our company's future for years to come. For the quarter, we reported total sales increase of 7.3%, while same-store sales were up 4.3%. This overall sales performance showed noticeable improvement from our Q1 results. I do want to point out that part of the increase in DIY was due to the calendar shift resulting from our 53rd week in fiscal 2013. Our DIY same-store sales would have been approximately 1% lower if we were comparing to the same weeks last year.","Commercial continue to outpace the growth of our retail business. This quarter retails showed marked acceleration from recent trends, but colder weather across much of the U.S. drove robust traffic on batteries and increase in wiper blades. However, our West Coast stores experienced less favorable weather for parts failures. Abnormally dry conditions led to fewer for example, wiper blade scales in our stores on the West Coast.","We also experienced growth in both traffic and ticket across both our retail and commercial customer segments. Our failure related hard part categories experienced the highest growth in both retail and commercial. Clearly, the weather was a significant factor, but we also believe that work that we have been doing to improve inventory availability had us very well positioned to capitalize on the increased demand.","We feel, as we continue to improve our hard parts product availability, this has led to increasing traffic and ticket, especially in commercial where the vast majority of the business is in hard parts.","In regard to the cadence of sales trends for the quarter, November, December, and through mid-January our sales ran quite strong above 5% in same-store sales. However, for the last month of our quarter our same-store sales slowed. During those weeks, our results dropped into the low-single-digit range. We experienced a slowdown across both our retail and commercial businesses. The culprit strange as it is for me to say was the weather. It seems I've spent a career talking about how weather; in particular extreme weather drives positive results for us.","But by late January, by the time several of the U.S. regions were experiencing their third or fourth heavy cold snap, the parts that were close to failing appear to have already failed earlier in the season. Additionally, the later storms, particularly across the southeast calls us and our commercial customers to close due to the severity of the storms and the poor driving conditions.","As we look at the balance of the year, we believe there will be a lingering positive effect on our industry. Two years ago the weather looked quite mild and we highlighted that as a headwind for our business for months. Conversely, after the extensive winter we have had this year we anticipate that demand will remain strong as we head into the spring and summer seasons. While certain failure related categories were particularly strong during the second quarter, other categories specifically maintenance categories that can be deferred or challenged. We expect these deferred projects to be completed in the balance of the year.","Regarding the consumer, we continue to believe our consumer remains under pressure. However we feel 2014 has several positive items going forward. One large headwind has now been anniversaried, the payroll tax reinstatement last year. Another is gas prices have begun to abate and we believe this can have a positive effect on our customer's ability to spend on routine maintenance. With approximately 10 billion of gasoline consumed monthly in the U.S., any sizeable move in price could have a material stimulus on the economy. Currently gasoline prices are approximately $3.35 a gallon, about $0.25 a gallon below this time last year.","As we are heading into what is forecasted to be a more normal spring and summer weather pattern, we are optimistic on the sales front. We continue to assume the most pronounced effects would be felt in the Midwest and northeast markets, as these have been the most challenging for a couple of years.","Regarding market share, the data we have available to us is showing we're gaining share on both the retail and commercial fronts. We are especially focused on improving our chance in the application parts area where our efforts to improve our assortments would have the most impact, and so far we're encouraged. We feel the initiatives we're working on are making a difference. For example we have enhanced our electronic catalogue to better serve our customers by further highlighting related items necessary to do the complete job.","We believe these enhancements will improve the customer experience and will compliment the knowledge of our AutoZoners. While we are early in our efforts, the feedback we're receiving from AutoZoners and customers is encouraging.","Regarding DIY ticket and traffic trends both increased for the quarter. As I previously mentioned the traffic count was much stronger earlier in the quarter versus the last few weeks. While we experienced traffic growth in commercial for several years, it was exciting to see growth in the retail channel.","On the average ticket front, retail continues to be up but at a lower rate than our historical experience. One driver of the lower retail ticket has been the lack of commodity-based inflation. Currently we don't see any indications of that trend changing materially in the short to midterm. Well that is good news for our customers; it has certainly challenged our results.","On the commercial front we were pleased to see a higher average ticket to another earlier more of hard part sales. Overall we don't have control over the macro factors that impact our business and that is why we had intensified our efforts on enhancing our offerings. Our effects on the initiatives we have underway or intent should lead to ongoing sales growth.","We are pleased with the progress we are making on commercial business. Our sales increased 12.2% from last year's second quarter and we opened 49 new programs to finish with 74% of our domestic stores having a commercial sales program. This brings our year-to-date openings to 174. We expect to open a similar number of programs this year as we did last year.","Our all other businesses increased approximately 31% over last year. Starting this quarter we began anniversary acquisition of AutoAnything. The all other segment of our business includes AutoAnything, autozone.com and ALLDATA.","Regarding all these businesses, we've introduced the idea of being more digitally integrated. Therefore we've made this one of our four strategic growth priorities, along with Retail, Commercial, and International. While in an early stage we believe this can be an important and significant opportunity for us to deepen customer relationships and ultimately grow sales. At this point the evolution of our online offering we're focusing more on data compilation and building a knowledge portal than on current sales.","Today, shoppers used our websites for educating themselves what they need for their vehicles and they continue to buy the vast majority of what they need from our stores, which to us makes perfect sense and is in line with our operating plans. Our objective is to satisfy our customer's needs regardless of how they want to interact with us.","Now, I'd like to update you on our initiatives. Last quarter we discussed that we were testing a handful of initiatives that focused on increasing our ability to say yes to our customers parts needs, in both retail and commercial. We establish tests last summer, focused on increasing the depth of coverage available at the store, hub stores and at our distribution centers. Product initiative at the hub stores and distribution centers also included tests around frequency of delivery to the stores that they service.","Over the last several months, we have significantly increased the pace of strategic assessments and challenged ourselves to review our tests results very carefully. The amount of time and effort going into this effort has been nothing short of extraordinary. Our entire organization owes the subset of individuals who are leading in this effort tremendous gratitude.","On last quarter's call, we highlighted that one of our test initiatives was complete and in the process of being implemented. This initiative was the enhanced modeling for stores SKU placements, where we would significantly add incremental inventory while simultaneously removing unproductive inventory.","At the end of the quarter, we were complete with about 75% of this initiative. But it is important to note that much of this additional inventory again arriving at our stores very late in the quarter and some is still in the distribution centers. This has been a massive undertaking and this can cause considerable work at the stores and in the distribution centers, as you can see our per store inventories increased significantly as a result of this initiative.","We have a high degree of confidence that these new assortments will drive meaningful profitable sales increases as we tested this new methodology several times before implementation. To-date the sales are generally in line with our expectations. But again, much of the inventory hasn't been positioned for sale or was positioned very late in the quarter.","We've also been testing additional inventory in our hub stores. We continue to earn opportunities to add productive inventory to all of our hubs and we expect this to continue, especially if we further penetrate to highly fragmented commercial market. Additionally, we are testing a much deeper product offering in a select few hub stores and these locations are leveraging net inventory across a wide network of additional hubs and satellites. This allows us to significantly broaden the depth of the product offering closer to the customer with many stores having same day access to the broad assortment.","In addition, to testing broader SKU assortments in our hubs and our distribution centers, we are also testing more frequent deliveries to both select hub and satellite stores. All of these efforts are deigned to assess the most effective way to service our customers needs and to reduce the amount of unproductive activity we have transferring products from store-to-store. It is still very early, but what we have learned as we expected that more inventory closer to the customer increase the sales. At this stage, we have not determined the optimal solution and we expect to continue to run these tests for an extended period of time.","We continue to execute on our strategies to improve the customer shopping experience. We expanded five net additional hub locations during the quarter to take our total remodeled hubs to 115 locations. These remodels entail expanding the size and capacity of these locations ensuring they are in the right physical location and adding additional inventory into the market that benefits both retail and commercial. We also opened three new hub stores finishing with 160. Over time, we do expect to open more hub locations, but we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level.","Last quarter, I also mentioned the new version of Z-net that was being deployed. Over the last couple of years, we have reset our expectations in regard to technology investments in an effort to leverage technology to enhance the customer experience and leverage operating efficiencies. The enhanced Z-net is the first of those efforts to be implemented.","Finally, I mentioned our goal is and remains to be growing market share in 2014, while continuing to deliver solid earnings. We were successful with this objective in the last calendar quarter of 2013, according to the data available to us.","However, we compete against great companies in our industry and they too are aggressively modifying their business. While we are improving, we clearly see where we can improve our selling proposition and we are focused on those areas. Our organization understands the importance of balancing investments and returns and we have to invest our time and capital accordingly.","With the continued aging of the car population, we are optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past two years, we have seen those traded-in vehicles be resold to new owners, who are repairing and enhancing their \"new vehicle\".","With gas prices declining a bit here recently on a year-over-year basis, we believe miles driven can increase in 2014. Historically, lower gas prices and an improving economic outlook have led to more miles being driven. We expect that trend to remerge.","We remain bullish on our industry sales growth opportunities on both retail and commercial front over the long-term, as the vehicle population remains at an all time high and consumers continue to look for good values while maintaining their vehicles, we see AutoZone's opportunity to sell to these customers only growing.","Now, let me review our operating theme priorities for 2014. Our overall operating theme this year is Creating Customers for Life and the key priorities for the year are: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our Commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and finally, improving inventory availability.","On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continue with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with the completion of the rollout of our new Z-net software, we spent a great deal of time training AutoZoners on the system enhancements. We've tried to make the system as intuitive as possible, but along with change, we have to spend time teaching and discussing those changes.","We also learned from our store AutoZoners how to improve the way the information is presented on the screen. This mutual respect for operations and technology will lead, in our belief, to a superior selling tool in our stores.","We also invested more payroll in our stores this past quarter. Last year we managed expenses tightly as our sales results were below our expectations. This year, as we expected sales to improve with all of our initiatives we wanted to make sure we represented our brand well, so we added additional payroll.","We should highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we finish Q2 at 32.3%. While slightly below last year's Q2 ROIC, excluding the acquisition of AutoAnything, we would have been slightly higher than last year. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing.","Our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investor's capital.","Now let me turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?","Bill Giles","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial, and International results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto part sales, which included our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our four stores in Brazil, increased 6.5% over the 12 weeks.","Regarding macro trends, during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.29 a gallon and finished the quarter at $3.38 a gallon. Last year gas prices increased $0.18 per gallon during the quarter, starting at $3.43 and ending at $3.61 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles and we continue to monitor prices closely in the future.","We also recognized that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10-years-old, the current average is much different than our newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven data, reported by the Department of Transportation are available only through December. While October was up 2.3%, while November was down 0.2%, December was up 1.1%.","The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-old and older vehicles on the road which continues to trend in our industry's favor.","Another key macro headwind last year was the favorable tax reinstitution, while we do not expect to benefit this year, we simply are anniversarying a negative event from last year, it is hard to gauge what the benefit this will have on our traffic but it won't be an additional pressure point like it was last year.","For the trailing four quarters, total sales per auto part store was $1,754,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.","For the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 12.2%. Commercial represented 16.3% of our total company sales and grew $35 million over the last year's second quarter. Last year's commercial sales mix percent was 15.6%. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings and therefore we are optimistic about the future of this business.","Year-to-date we opened 174 new programs versus 93 programs up in last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,595 stores supported by 160 hub stores. Approximately, 1,080 of our programs are 3-years-old or younger. With only 74% of our domestic stores having the commercial program, and our average revenue per program below several of our competitors, we believe there is further opportunity for additional program growth, in addition to improved productivity opportunities in current programs.","The tests on inventory that we've conducted provide us with one of the pieces of information on how to close the gap of competitors that are more productive and commercial than us today on a per outlet basis. We understand where share opportunities exist and we remain focused on closing that gap. We believe we're on the right track when it comes to our ability to climb the call list to becoming our customers' first call.","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our commercial programs having opened over a thousand programs in the past 36 months. 30% of the programs are 3-years-old or younger. And we believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share.","Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened four new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 367 stores in Mexico. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations.","Regarding Brazil we opened no new stores in the quarter and have four stores open as of the end of the quarter. Our plans remain to open in total about 10 stores, then pause our development as we refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and it's financially viable. At that point we will talk more on our long-term growth plans.","Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total our sales were $1,099,000,000, an increase of 7.3% from last year's second quarter. Domestic same-stores sales were sales for stores opened more than one year were up 4.3% for the quarter.","As Bill has mentioned earlier, our last four week sales results were below the run rate of the first eight weeks. We attribute much of this decline to even harsher than expected winter weather in certain parts of the country keeping customers at home, indoors along with an excessive amount of precipitation challenging customers to complete vehicle projects outdoors. Additionally we believe many of the failure parts that were subject to failure during extreme temperatures had already failed earlier in the season.","Moving onto gross profit, the gross margin for the quarter was 52.1% of sales, up 25 basis points versus last year's second quarter. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, lower shrink expense, offset primarily by the inclusion of the recent acquisition of AutoAnything.","In regards to inflation, we continue to see modest decreases in costs year-over-year. This was different than in past years. At this point our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing for the foreseeable future and therefore we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant in the future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses. However, we do not manage to a target gross margin percentage, as the growth of our commercial business has been steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years we have not bothered to call out the headwind quarterly as an integrated part of our business model. Additionally, AutoAnything has been a slight drag on our gross margins as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. As we anniversaried our acquisition of AutoAnything during Q2, our margin comparisons will be comparable going forward. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars.","SG&A for the quarter was 35.2% of sale, higher by 42 basis points from last year's second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the timing of advertising expenditures in Q2 from Q1. As I had mentioned a few moments ago, our investments were favorable, did leverage our domestic -- did deleverage our domestic store operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Advertising, however, was the larger single component to the increase.","While expenses are higher than last year, they were budgeted and were in-line with our expectation. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure and response to our sales environment.","EBIT for the quarter was $337 million, up 6.2% over the last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was 16.9%. This represented a decrease of 17 basis points versus the previous year's second quarter.","Interest expense for the quarter was $39.5 million, compared with $41.3 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.311 billion approximately $310 million more than last year's Q2 balance of $3.998 billion.","Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market condition, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. Our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.3%, lower than the last year's second quarter of 36.2%. This quarter benefited from certain discrete tax items. Net income for the quarter was $193 million, was up 9.4% versus the prior year's second quarter.","Our diluted share count of $34.3 million was down 7.2% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors grows earnings per share for the quarter to $5.63 million, up 17.8% over the prior year's second quarter.","Related to the cash flow statement, for the second fiscal quarter, we generated $151 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6.5% versus last year.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $77 million and reflected the additional expenditures required both from 32 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodel; work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investment.","Additionally, we purchase the rights to certain customer relationships in connection with our ALLDATA business. These investments were approximately $11 million this year with an additional $20 million to be paid over the next two years. For all of fiscal 2013, our CapEx was approximately $415 million.","With the new stores open, we finished this quarter with 4,871 stores in 49 states, the District to Columbia and Puerto Rico, 367 stores in Mexico and 4 in Brazil for a total store count of 5,242.","Depreciation totaled $58.4 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $52.3 million.","With our excess cash flow we repurchased $200 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter end, we had $727 million remaining under our share buyback authorization.","Our leverage metric was 2.5x this past quarter. Again, I want to stress, we managed the appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each trading firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program with an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 113%.","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory level one a per store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.1 billion, up 12% versus the Q2 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investments in coverage for select categories. Inventory per store was up 8.3% at $589,000 per store, reflecting our continued investment in hard parts coverage.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 32.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns but significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","","Thanks, Bill. We are pleased to report our 30th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. Our company continues to be successful due to our long term focus. That focus on exceptional customer service is part of the AutoZone DNA. We focus on executing at a very high level consistently, which we believe can be a competitive advantage. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of the execution.","Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail. But we also have to evolve and change to adapt to our ever evolving industry. The initiatives we are working around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, e-commerce and Brazil are all very exciting to us. We feel these efforts will lead to increasing sales for 2014 and beyond.","Our industry sales, according to the NPD data made available to us, accelerated this past quarter. We continued to experience share gains on both the retail and commercial fronts. While, this is exciting we cannot be complacent. We are just starting to implement our major initiatives and the best we believe is ahead of us.","Our long-term models to go new source new store square footage and a low-single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. As we continue to execute on our financial model, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single digit range or better in times of strength, and we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares enhancing our earnings per share within to double digits. We build the track we are on will allow us to continue winning from a long run.","We believe our study consistent strategy is right. It is the attention to details and consistent executions that will matter over time. Our belief that solid consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. We are investing in the key additions that we will drive our long term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure our sales. We remain committed to deliberate on our strategic and financial objectives.","Now I would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays","Couple of questions, if I may, first one to Bill Rhodes. Bill, you spoke about the lingering positive effect from weather on hard parts. And while it's easy to probably determine what the immediate effect is on battery, you may be provide a little bit more color on how you think that lingering effort is going to be and what proportion of the hard parts are typically accepted longer term from adverse weather?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, Alan, and I think the best proxy that we have in recent history was two years ago when we had a very mild winter of 2011-2012. If you recall in April and really on through October of that year, we continue to call the lingering impact in our business and it was really in the maintenance category places like brakes and chassis that didn't get replaced at the same rates that they had in previous years. Now we attribute a lot of that to the lack of snow and ice, lack of snow piles, lack of potholes in the roads. And clearly from an out of the winter that we just had our expectation is that those categories should be robust. Also, those categories specifically that I talked about brakes and chassis and the line, they were challenged Q2. We had great performance in batteries and wipers and antifreeze, but a lot of categories where the customer could defer them they did the defer them, and we expect those deferrals to come back.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays","So Bill, what you say is the positive effect this year from the poor weather equal to the core effect we had on revenues a couple of years ago from the unseasonably warm weather that we had?","Bill Rhodes","I see your guess is as good as mine on that one, Alan. I'm just -- I'm bullish about it, but we're going to see how it plays out.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays","Thank you second question may be for Bill Giles. Hey, Bill, with less than 30% of the hub stores under three years old, what is the ramp on the revenue growth that newly opened hub stores look like? Was most under maturity captured post three years? You can maybe provide a little bit more color on that, I'd appreciate it.","Bill Giles","Yes, actually unlike a traditional retail new store a lot of it is captured really in the first two to three years. So there is a continued ramp in the maturating post that, but there is a much more accelerated ramp in the first frankly a couple of years and sometimes even shorter than that depending on the market that we get into.","And then the other thing with an addition to having a increasingly maturation process of the new commercial programs that's just all the initiatives what we are doing. So we are trying to make every program better every single day and a lot of things that Bill talked about on the inventory availability, we think it will help in that process.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays","One last question if I may to Bill Rhodes. Obviously, with one of your major competitors completing the acquisition at Carquest recently, there were certainly -- it was well documented at Carquest that was on the auction block for quite some time. Are you at liberty to maybe elaborate on what it was about the Carquest that did not interest you in moving forward more aggressively?","Bill Rhodes","That's a tough question, Alan. I think I'd rather keep our deliberations to ourselves. I think those could have competitive implications over the long-term and one other industry consolidation.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays","All right. So you never try that.","Bill Rhodes","I appreciate the question. I understand it. I just don't think it will be appropriate for us to comment on it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","Bill Rhodes, a question on the inventories entering the next quarter 8% higher than a year ago. Is this all additional SKUs or were you finding you didn't have enough depth in the existing SKUs to fulfill commercial ordering? So for example may be your systems shows your X stock was two pieces of a certain SKU, but I've got a commercial customer asking for four pieces and therefore you were having to say no.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. What you've seen to-date is the vast majority of it has been incremental coverage, not incremental quantities. We are, as I mentioned we are testing a lot of different things and then in some respects some of those tests are increasing or decreasing the quantities of the parts that we have based upon the delivery frequency of that store. But what you've seen to-date, the vast majority of it has been incremental coverage. I did want to reiterate it that a lot of it came in right at the end of the quarter.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","You talked about that your management is doing a lot of analytical work on the payback on the inventory investment. Could you help us understand the implications for our GM ROI? I'm assuming it's probably dilutive but if you could tell us what you are seeing in your tests?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, certainly as we go farther down the curve -- farther down the bell curve, it is clearly GM ROI dilutive to where we are today. Let's remember we're 32.3% ROIC. But a lot of decisions, opening a new store a lot of times is dilutive to ROIC. We're very comfortable that it's going to provide us with reasonable returns well in ahead of our cost of capital.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","And then just the last question and I know we have talked about this in the past but when you look at your tests improving your delivery capabilities in commercial, what do you think are the advantages and what are the disadvantages relative to competitors to build large distribution centers and then could achieve a lot of the same benefits?","Bill Rhodes","Well obviously the disadvantages of significantly changed or significantly with broader distribution network are so costly, it's quite costly. And so we're looking at several different things and we've made no decisions at this point in time on the other initiatives. We've rolled out our improved algorithms for store replacement. But we've not made any decisions about distribution centers, hub stores or the like. We're in the midst of testing all those things.","But we're encouraged -- we're encouraged by all the different things we're testing. But what we now have to move is to figure out is which one is the optimal approach. Which one provides the best return at the lowest cost? And I think that's going to take us a couple, two or three more quarters to figure that out.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. So a couple of questions on the commercial. I just wanted to go back. You said, Bill Giles, that stores that are two or three years old in the commercial business ramp up quite well in terms of the sales and in fact even faster than the retail business. So I guess I don't fully understand why you wouldn't be seeing greater sales on the commercial business if you have so many immature store, so many stores in that 1% to 2% to 3% of three-year-old cohorts and those would be driving higher sales growth?","Bill Giles","They do and then but at the same time, we still have, keep in mind 30% of the commercial programs that we have opened today are all less than three-years-old. So they're continuing to ramp and that's driving down a little bit of our productivity when you look at it on an average basis. And the other thing is obviously we're at 74% penetration. And as we continue to ratchet that up, will be some level of cannibalization not significant, but it will be a little bit until we just continue to penetrate the market overall.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank","So I guess that explains why the sales per store would be lower. But still I would think the growth rate would be higher and so perhaps and here's my second question, is it a function of increased competition in the commercial business on the West Coast O'Reilly is maturing more and more every year with their CSK stores and then in the Northeast, you did the VIP acquisition? So is it possible that you're just seeing more competition in the commercial business?","Bill Giles","I wouldn't say more because obviously those are replacements of existing competition.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank","Better perhaps.","Bill Giles","Yes, I would say they're slightly better capitalized. But what we've got a 3% market share or less. We continue to believe there is a lot of Greenfield opportunities and we got to continue to drive our productivity. Also I think the inventory availability and not to hang our hats just on that, we've got a lot of initiatives going on. But I think more inventory in the market place is going to be beneficial for the Commercial programs, both DIY and Commercial, but specifically Commercial as well.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The next question is from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","My question is really about the inventory addition and its impact on ticket and what it does to the AP ratio going forward. Specifically did you -- is it too early or did the increased SKUs help ticket in either do it for me or DIY in the quarter?","Bill Giles","That's a great question. I think it's a little too early for us to see whether or not both that inventory and as Bill said, still -- some of it's still on the pipeline has an impact on ticket. We would expect it to drive it a little bit overall as we continue to be able to say yes to more profits, more demand but in the future.","So might the inventory ratio perspective I think over time that that will likely to put a little bit of pressure on AP to inventory. But I suspect that will be over a couple of year kind of a timeframe, I don't see that in the immediate future necessarily. But it also points to the fact that we've got opportunities and try to reduce some of the unproductive inventory that we have in the chain as we continue to replace this with other additional SKUs and that we're grow inventory grow SKUs and will put a little bit of pressure on inventory churn and put a little bit of pressure on AP to inventory ratio and I suspect that that will be over a couple of years and not something in the immediate future.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","And you mentioned 75% of the initiative is done in terms of the enhanced SKU placements. If you look at all the other things that you listed that are still on test, could you help us understand the magnitude if you decide to go through with those, would it be a lift of inventory similar to what we have seen so far per store?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, Greg this is Bill Rhodes. Number one, one of the initiatives that we're working on or competing against each other where you have a delivery methodology frequency change out of the distribution centers but at the same time we also have a mega hub notion that's doing the same kind of work. So we don't really -- it's hard to say what's going to happen.","When I look at it I don't think there would be nearly significant increase in inventory as a result of these initiatives because you would be talking about deploying inventory in fewer number locations either hubs or distribution centers. This is not talking additional inventories in the stores and if you increase the frequency of delivery you're also going to bring the quantities of inventory in the stores down. That could actually be a benefit to inventory but it would require capital and operating expenses to get that benefit.","","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from John Lawrence with Stephens &Company.","John Lawrence - Stephens & Company","Bill would you comment a little bit the follow-up on Alan's question a little bit about the frequency change as far as the deliveries. I mean I know some of those hub stores have gone may be once or twice or maybe even three times a day to some of these stores. Could you talk a little bit more about that and how does this, the bay or the garage know that you have this additional inventory.","Bill Rhodes","That's a great question on how the garage knows that, the way that they know is our incredibly talented sales force is out anytime you give a sales person or an operator additional inventory they are going to tell everybody and so that's a big part of our sales message right now.","As far as the frequency of deliveries in the standard hub stores, we really haven't changed those in the last two or three years. We did increase them pretty significantly in '09, '10 timeframe but now we are testing something and this is again just in test and that's kind of a mega hub notion, where it's a hub serving additional hubs, so I think that one hub that might be servicing six or seven other hubs. And if they are in the same major metropolitan areas it might be serving that additional hub multiple times a day and then for the long faraway hubs it's only servicing them once a day.","John Lawrence - Stephens & Company","And just to follow that in periods when these bays and garages are very busy. Does that give the opportunity to that third and fourth player in the market to really move up on that call list because of the increased demand?","Bill Rhodes","I think increased demand but more importantly increased availability. When the shop finds, you have something that somebody else doesn't that gives you real opportunity and move up that list. Particularly you are doing a great job of service.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","One question and a follow-up. The first one is about volatility. Some of the metrics that we see are kind of steady as ever, EPS growth being in the 15% to 17% range, cash flow you mentioned very predictable and steady. SG&A a little bit more volatile and sales, little bit more than historical, but can you talk to us about the underlying patterns of customer behavior that you're seeing inter-quarter, inter-week, to understand kind of what it is that the customer is kind of preferring and just wondering if you can give us a historical perspective on volatility?","Bill Giles","The second quarter for us is always an incredibly volatile of time, it's the most volatile period of time that we have. Number one, you have the holidays in there. Number two, weather patterns can be extremely different one week to the next. Last weekend it was 70 degrees here in Memphis, today the kids, Shelby County's schools are out, because it's ice and snow. So those kind of changes will really change the volatility -- the customer traffic patterns.","The other thing that's been different for us, and we talked about is our average ticket, our average ticket for about the last nine months has been, it's still growing, but it's been more muted growth and the big part of that is due to the lack of commodity-based inflation, we had significant commodity-based inflation for a couple of years and that slowed down a little bit. We think that will continue for a reasonable period going forward, we don't see a change.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Just a follow-up. On your comment earlier, Bill Rhodes, about inventory and kind of willing to put inventory in so long it's kind of in excess of your cost of capital. How do you philosophically think about inventory when your cost of capital is effectively zero and what are guard rails telling us when it's going to hit that diminishing return?","Bill Rhodes","We know everything to a 15% after tax IRR. So regardless of what happens to our cost of capital, we're going to hold every investment through a 15% IRR with the exception of a few real estate decisions that we make in strategic markets where we have to hold them, because we hold them to at least 12%.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","How does payables factor into that, because that effectively makes the cost of adding inventory free in that regard?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, we charge the initiative with payable, with the inventory and don't give it the payables benefit although we let some of the inventory come back at the end of the IRR calculation period.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","That's real helpful. Thanks.","Bill Rhodes","The burden of those costs are real and just because we're able to get the AP coverage on doesn't mean that we don't need to look at that very closely and make sure we are making wise business decisions.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","A couple of questions, another question around the inventory. I guess if you look at sort of the puts and takes, the scale of purchasing the incremental inventory versus the possibly lower margin of growing the Commercial business. In the gross margin improvement year-over-year, could you sort of give us the impact of both sides of that?","Bill Giles","I would say that the increase in the inventory during the quarter had some additional supply chain cost et cetera, but there wasn't a benefit per se from the additional purchasing of the inventory that would necessarily bolster gross margin, at least at this stage, it wouldn't happen till the inventory is sold necessarily. So that answers it, Bret.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","And then I guess as you talked about market share, could you give us any color regionally were there markets that you gained relatively more share in?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. The information that we get today about market share is not at the same level of granularity on a regional basis, we only get regional information on non-application products. So I don't really think it's wise for us to get into those discussions.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS","Now that you've had time to see the results of both the inventory and the labor investments, do you think these initiatives will give to you -- will allow you to fully close the commercial productivity gap with your peers? And is that the goal here? Or do you think that if you do close the productivity gap, it will be return dilutive, you don't necessarily want to get there?","Bill Rhodes","Number one, we want to focus on us, not our competition. We believe we have tremendous opportunities for increased business in the Commercial business over time. We don't think it's going to come one week or one quarter or one year, it's going to take us improving our model, continuing to work with our sales force, continuing to deepen our relationship with our customers. I believe that the initiatives that we're working on particularly the inventory availability initiatives will have a big benefit to us going forward. But it's not going to be measured in quarters it's going to be measured in years.","As for the inventory that we added, again, I will reiterate that we added right at the end of the quarter, so we didn\u2019t see much of it. As far as the payroll addition and I appreciate you calling that out. We really -- last year the second quarter was really tight and our sales trends weren't very exciting. And so we very aggressively managed our payroll, and in hindsight we felt like we too aggressively managed it. So we didn't -- we weren't that aggressive this time. Now that was a one quarter event. That was not something that we did in Q3 and Q4. It was really a Q2 event that we've now annualized.","Michael Lasser - UBS","Then as my follow-up question, I think some of your comments around the cadence of the comp during the quarter have raised some questions about sustainability of the recent industry performance. Could you parse may be on a regional perspective, did you see the same type of slowdown on the West or the less weather affected areas? And have you seen that continue into the current quarter or maybe there's been less adverse weather?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. We kind of have a standing practice not to talk about the current quarter, but I appreciate you bringing that up. So let me add a little bit more specifics to it. In the last month that we talked about, there were three weeks. The first three weeks of that month where it was snow and ice across much of the Eastern United States including the South. Those three weeks, we had significant pressure on our sales. The final week of the quarter, we had much improved weather and our business was materially better. That also coincided with when the tax refunds started flowing in the marketplace. We had the combinations of improved weather and tax refunds and we saw a material improvement in our business.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush.","Seth Basham - Wedbush","I think you just helped us understand the calendar shift a bit with that last week being so strong.","Bill Rhodes","Right.","Seth Basham - Wedbush","But going forward, should we expect any changes with calendar shifts in the balance of the year?","Bill Rhodes","We all wait, it cost us 70 bps in the first quarter, it cost us about 1% here. I think it should be -- it's certainly going to be neutral for the balance of the year. There is going to be a slight shift between Q3 and Q4? It's going to depend, just like you picked up on, it wasn't going to be a big event until we had a really strong last week and that infotainment event. I know what the first week of this quarter is going to be, but I don't know what the last week is going to be. So, I think it's anybody's guess.","Seth Basham - Wedbush","And just picking apart the SG&A deleverage in the quarter a bit, can you give us the puts and takes year-over-year as it relates to some of the line items around payroll and advertising, et cetera, and were there any incremental investments for your initiatives?","Bill Giles","I would say that there wasn't a lot of incremental investments on the initiatives. There were some additional costs. I think payroll deleveraged probably less than 10 basis points or so, but to Bill's point earlier, that was really a function of us kind of keeping more consistent with our payroll model where last year we probably got off of that a little bit and we really made some cuts that in retrospect we didn't want to repeat as we went through Q2.","In Q1, we mentioned that there was going to be some timing related to advertising where we pushed some advertising from Q2, or Q1 into Q2, and that was worth probably a little over 20 basis points. So that's kind of the majority of that 42 basis points.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer","I actually have just a couple really quick questions. One, we've already discussed weather a lot, but is there a way to specifically look -- you take the comp you hedge in the fiscal second quarter, how much of that was directly attributable to the weather? Then the second question, I think to some extent you discussed it in your prepared comments, but the buyback, looking at my model here, you obviously continue to buy back stock, but it would seem like a slightly or a modestly slower pace than it had been in prior quarters. Any reasons we should be thinking something into that? Thanks.","Bill Rhodes","All right. I'll take the first and I'll give Bill Giles the second one. It's really difficult to quantify the impact of the weather. And again, it has puts and calls, so we can see that our batteries and starters and alternators businesses are up pretty significantly. Conversely brakes and chassis and the like are down. I think it did have a benefit; I would characterize it in the 1% to 2% range.","But I also think that we've got this pent-up demand which should help us going forward. We love the extremes. But if you don\u2019t get the extreme weather and those batteries don't fail than it's going to be the next extreme when they do fail. So we got that business and now hopefully we'll get the deferral of the maintenance business as we look forward.","Bill Giles","I would just say. I have nothing to really read on the stock repurchases. We'll try to be relatively consistent year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter so I wouldn't read too much into that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","You mentioned the tight payroll couple of times. You were talking about the year-over-year SG&A I'm curious did that lead to changes in employee turnover at all and in addition to that with some of the industry consolidation we've seen is employee turnover a greater concern may be than what's been in the past?","Bill Rhodes","No. We haven't seen any material change in employee turnover. We did see a material reduction when the onset of the recession and we've seen it kick up 1% or 2% over certain quarters, but it has nothing material. As far as the industry dynamics, I think number one it's far too early to see what any ramifications of those changes are. But we are always looking for great people that love the AutoZone culture and if they want to come join a great team we'd love to have them.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","And when do you think that might play out, you said it's still too early. Just given your experience in the industry, and obviously with acquisitions themselves like when would we start to see when people are kind of placing their longer-term debt is it after three months, is it six months is it a year, just kind of given your experience wondering what your thought process is.","Bill Rhodes","It all depends on what the strategy is and what the level of execution on that strategy is. It can happen very quickly. If there is a massive determination, on what the integration plans are or it can take a year. It's all going to depend on the implementation pace.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over the speakers for any closing comments.","Bill Rhodes","Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate what separates us from the other players in our industry; our culture is very unique. Being part of the AutoZone family and striving to improve its very unique across the entire retail landscape, it's the passion to continue to build our culture that will carry us to new heights. We are currently working on the variety of exciting new initiatives and tests that we believe will enhance our performance over time. Ultimately, our AutoZoners have delivered, year in and year out, and I'm highly confident that with them leading the charge, our future is incredibly bright.

And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2016 third quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA, and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all of our AutoZoners for another solid quarter. In the third quarter we continued to execute our strategies to organically grow our business. We expanded our US retail footprint with the opening of an additional 33 new stores.","Our commercial business continued to grow, with sales increasing 6.5% and we opened 46 net new programs for the quarter. We now have the commercial program in 82% of our domestic stores. And we continue to expand our presence in Mexico, opening 7 stores this quarter. We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter and currently have 8 stores in operation.","Lastly, we opened 1 new IMC branch, bringing our total branch count to 25. While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we continue to see great growth prospects in international and our other businesses.","If I could sum up our quarter's major highlights, we continued on our game plan of executing our inventory availability and delivery frequency initiatives, while maintaining our efforts to constantly improve our customer\u2019s experiences. We continued implementation of our multiple delivery frequency initiative, adding just over 300 locations this quarter. We now have approximately 1,600 of our stores receiving multiple distribution center deliveries each week.","And we added two additional mega hubs in the quarter, for a total of seven now, and are targeting to open four more by the end of the fiscal year and we have more in the real estate pipeline for next year.","Additionally, we continue to look for opportunities to expand our merchandise margins. And our new global sourcing initiative is a significant part of our focus, and, while still early, those efforts are progressing well.","We also experienced some challenges this quarter. Our same-store weekly sales performance was quite volatile during the quarter. We started the quarter very strong, but recall that last year's third quarter started very weak due to a shift in tax refund timing.","Additionally, we had a few weeks of poor sales when the weather was materially colder and wetter than last year. On the surface, it appears that the quarter started strong and then moderated. But when you assess it on a two-year basis, sales trends were generally consistent throughout the quarter.","On a regional basis, our performance in the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states were substantially below other markets, especially in late March, all the way through the end of the quarter, where temperatures were much cooler and it was much wetter than usual.","We continue to feel our retail business is benefiting from a continued focus on customer service, improving parts availability, and lower overall gas prices. Lower gas prices, we feel, are contributing to Americans driving more, although recent price increases at the pump have likely muted some of this benefit.","Regarding commercial, we underperformed relative to the overall business in the same weather impacted markets noted previously. We don't think we are alone. Some of our large national account customers have told us and yourselves they too experienced weaker sales while temperatures were cooler than usual.","What I'm most proud of is what we've done to address those challenges. We are focused on both our large and small account sales growth while incorporating a one team approach in communicating with our customers.","As I talk to customers, I continue to see tremendous opportunity to grow sales and we continue to be excited about the performance and future benefit of our inventory availability initiatives.","But we really have only scratched the surface with what we can do here. The forecast of a hot summer, which we would welcome, along with continued store level execution makes us optimistic about our sales potential heading into the summer.","Getting back to DIY, our number one business priority, the business performance during the quarter was mixed. In markets unaffected by the weather patterns noted above, we continued to perform well. However, for the quarter our DIY traffic count turned slightly negative and our average ticket trends were slightly lower than the first half of the year.","While the overall macro economy remains favorable for DIY, we also continue to gain share and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store with every customer.","Over the past two years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued the rollout of more frequent deliveries to an additional approximately 300 net new stores in the quarter. We now have a total of roughly 1600 locations out of our 5000-plus stores on multiple weekly deliveries.","Our results continue to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate, with the varying weekly sales volumes of our stores, replenishment needs vary, as well. For the fourth quarter, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 350 additional stores ending the fiscal year end with around 1,950 stores with this enhanced service model.","The implementation of this initiative continues to create a gross margin headwind due to higher supply chain costs of approximately 20 basis points until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about two thirds of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries.","This past quarter's deleverage from deliveries was in line with the previous quarter. I appreciate our team\u2019s efforts to manage these rollouts on a cost-effective basis. This is a material change in how we do business and our teams are executing it well and managing the costs effectively. Our sales lift from this effort continues to show the investments make economic sense.","Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the mega hub stores. We ended the quarter with seven mega hubs and expect to add up to four additional mega hubs this fourth quarter.","As a reminder, these super sized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and stores serviced by other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis.","Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations, and we're experiencing sales improvements from both our retail and commercial businesses. While there is incremental costs to these rollouts, including payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest.","Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative this year. Currently, seven mega hubs support approximately 800 stores on a same-day basis and roughly 2,200 stores in total. And once built out, we would expect to have a network of mega hubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. Consistent with increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our mega hub expansion over the next few years.","Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work, with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.","As with last quarter, we continue to invest in training our AutoZoners to say, Yes, We've Got It more frequently. Yes, We've Got It is the operating mantra for us in 2016. We've made meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory and now it is a time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change.","We understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customer\u2019s needs, as customer service is a key part of our value proposition and a key differentiator. When customers have requests for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, Yes, We've Got It.","With the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools and specifically the staff necessary to provide our customers with the WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve.","In regards to learning about our customers shopping behaviors, we are capturing data from all of our selling platforms. We know it is essential to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of customers needs.","While being several quarters away from truly using the data for marketing purposes, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective of our customers will change the way we communicate our message.","As we are devoting more resources to building these capabilities, we think this will be a real differ differentiator for us over the next several years, more to come later.","In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores, as well as to mega hubs, we continue to expect to open two or three distribution centers over the next few years. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online until fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development, but the larger portion of the capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18.","Regarding our expectations for the capital required to open these new distribution centers, as we have completed further due diligence we have updated our expected capital required to $55 million to $60 million per distribution center.","To summarize our plans, we expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more mega hub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open two or three new domestic distribution centers over this time.","While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from this past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 basis point gross margin headwind from the multiple weekly delivery rollouts.","Now, turning to the third quarter's results, our sales increased 4% on top of 6.5% growth in Q3 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 2%. Our sales growth in Q3 slowed from the first half of the year and our earnings growth moderated as well.","We attribute the majority of the sales and related earnings deceleration to weather patterns, particularly in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions, where it was considerably cooler this year.","In regard to our three primary merchandise category splits in our US stores, both failure-related product sales and discretionary purchases easily exceeded maintenance this past quarter. Maintenance merchandise sales simply did not sell as expected and drove its piece of the mix below previous third-quarter percentages. We attribute the variance in sales between these businesses to the regional differences.","Specifically, spring-related items simply sold at a lesser clip as cooler temperatures prevailed in certain geographic areas. While our total domestic sales grew 4% on the quarter, our domestic commercial sales growth was up 6.5%.","As previously discussed, we feel like the ongoing initiatives in place position us well for our summer selling season. We believe our sales potential heading into the fourth quarter remains bright.","As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter we opened three additional hub locations, now operate 182. In addition to opening over time more mega hub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hubs.","Regarding IMC, we opened one new branch this quarter and continue to be excited by our opportunities. We've opened seven additional branches since Q3 of last year. The IMC parts catalog is currently accessible to over 700 AutoZone stores on a same-day basis and over 1,400 AutoZone stores through overnight shipment.","Regarding Mexico, we opened another 7 stores this quarter and now have 458 total locations. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on our US dollar earnings from our Mexico business to begin to abate in the fall, as we begin to lap the most significant exchange rate increases.","However, the volatility in the oil markets directly correlate the peso to the US dollar exchange rate and recently the peso has weakened with oil price volatility. For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by just over 1 percentage point. At the end of the quarter, the peso to US dollar was 18% worse than last year.","Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 2% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales.","The biggest sales tailwind at the moment, in our opinion, remains the increased miles driven across the country. While volatility with weather has been the greatest headwind, increasing miles driven leads to more failure and maintenance related demand and benefits both our DIY and DIFM businesses.","But unusually cool weather leads to limited sales. While we focus on both short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to consistently delivering strong earnings performance and extending our streak of 39 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth, which is a very important milestone for us.","While our delivery frequency initiatives and expansion of our mega hubs will add some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of 2016, our focus remains on growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels.","Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, improving inventory availability, and Yes, We've Got It.","On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service priority, we remain focused on improving our store level execution. While we've added payroll this year, we are also stressing to our AutoZoners the importance of communicating our ever improving availability message.","We've also been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.","On the Yes, We've Got It front, we've added training, metrics and, most importantly, share of voice to educate our store level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We are excited about this initiative.","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish the quarter at 31.2%. We are proud of this metric, it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing.","However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investor\u2019s capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank our entire organization for executing on our many operating initiatives, while providing our customers with great service and managing our expenses appropriately and prudently.","Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles.","Bill Giles","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial, and international results for the quarter.","For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores, and our 25 IMC branches increased 4.1%.","Our switching to macro trends, during the quarter nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $1.72 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.22 a gallon, a $0.50 increase. Last year gas prices increased $0.42 per gallon during the third quarter, starting at $2.27 and ending at $2.69 a gallon.","It is usual for gas prices to go up during this time of year as summer blend begins to take effect with refiners. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.","We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both January and February. We don't have March or April data yet.","The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry\u2019s favor. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per average AutoZone store were $1,785,000.","For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 6.5%. In the third quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $29 million over last year's Q3. As Bill said previously, we remain confident in our strategies to grow sales with this customer base for many years to come and we are particularly excited about the long-term benefits our inventory availability initiative will provide.","Our commercial sales growth has decelerated some from the pace we have experienced in the last few years. In prior years, we had a much larger percentage of our commercial programs recently opened or going through the maturation cycle. As more of our programs have matured, the contribution to our sales growth or the maturation cycle has declined.","This only partially contributed to our decelerated growth this past quarter. Regarding Q3 in particular, we also experienced slower growth in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets where the spring season has been very late to arrive. These markets commercial sales performance was materially below other regions for us.","This past quarter we opened 46 net new programs versus 72 programs opened in our third quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,274 stores, supported by 182 hub stores, approximately 1,000 of our programs are three years old or younger, which is about 24% of the base.","With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. This year we plan on opening around 250 commercial programs, approximately 120 more programs in Q4 alone.","We have a very talented sales force and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in stock trends.","We believe we are well-positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share as we continue growth profitably We continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.","Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 7 new stores during the third quarter. We currently have 458 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores and we are on target to open a new distribution center this calendar year. This will mark our second DC in the country and it will support further Central Mexico store growth.","As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our company EBIT growth rate by 1 percentage point. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, the Mexico leadership team continues to do an exceptional job managing the peso denominated business. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our US dollar earnings into the fall.","Regarding Brazil, we did not open stores in the quarter and continue to operate 8 stores. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to US dollars, as well. Similar to the peso's challenges versus the dollar, the real is devalued at 17% this year versus last year.","When we embarked on this initiative, our intentions were to be very methodical and measured as we entered and learned about this market. Our objective was to assess whether or not our model was embraced by the Brazilian consumer and whether or not it was financially viable. We also wanted to very carefully manage the risk associated with entering a new market.","We have determined that our model works well for the consumer and we continue to make good progress on the economic operating model, although we continue to operate at a loss currently.","However, it is difficult to determine the long-term economic model with such a small group of stores. Therefore we've decided to reinitiate our store development efforts with a goal over the next few years to expand the store base to 20 to 25 locations. We characterize this as an expansion of our initial test.","We haven't declared success or built long-term expansion plans but we are encouraged by the progress we have made and believe our progress warrants going to the next phase.","Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total our sales were $2.594 billion, an increase of 4% over last year's third quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores open more than one year were up 2% for the quarter.","Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, up 58 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives.","In regards to inflation it remains subdued, down slightly last year. Currently we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and will make the appropriate adjustments, should they arise.","SG&A for the quarter was 32.2% of sales, higher by 52 basis points from last year's third quarter. The increase in operating expense as a percentage of sales was due to higher legal expenses. The legal expense was driven by a single discrete item.","I should also point out, like the previous two quarters, this fiscal year we had deleverage from our store payroll initiatives. We feel our customer service is a key differentiator for us versus the competition and we remain committed to investing in our AutoZoners. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.","EBIT for the quarter was $536 million, up 4.4% over last year's third quarter, our EBIT margin was 20.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $34 million, compared with $32 million in Q3 a year ago.","We expect our upcoming fourth quarter's interest expense to be up from last year's fourth quarter by a similar amount. As we sold $650 million in bonds this past quarter, the coupon was higher than the retired commercial paper, thereby raising interest expense.","Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.95 billion or approximately $400 million more than last year's balance of approximately $4.5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.56 times EBITDAR.","While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate at 34.8% was lower than last year's Q3 tax rate. This rate was lower than planned, as we had a discrete item that lowered our tax rate, an expected ongoing rate for us is approximately 36%.","Net income for the quarter was $328 million and up 6% over last year. Our diluted share count of 30.4 million was down 5.9% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $10.77, up 12.6% over the prior year's third quarter.","As Bill said in the press release this morning, the quarter was impacted by a legal charge, along with a discrete tax benefit, which netted to a reduction to earnings per share of $0.11 per share.","Now, related to the cash flow statement, for the third fiscal quarter we generated $516 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5.6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $113.3 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 41 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters, and information technology investments.","With the new stores opened we finished this past quarter with 5,226 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 458 stores in Mexico, and 8 in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5,692. We also had 25 IMC branches open at fiscal quarter end, taking our total locations to 5,717.","Depreciation totaled $69 million for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $62 million, in line with the recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow we repurchased $533 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter. At quarter end we had $765 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.56 times at quarter end.","Again, want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.9%.","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per location basis, the company's inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores over the last 12 months. Inventory per location was $629,000, consistent with last year, and $633,000 last quarter.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.2%. We have and will continue to make the investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","Thanks, Bill. We are very pleased to report our 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 12.6% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to Living the Pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution, success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution.","We are confident in our initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis.","In addition, the performance of our mega hubs has been strong and ahead of our expectations and we look forward to opening more. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses.","Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single-digit range or better in times of strength, and we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double-digits.","We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long term. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter.","Our belief is that solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution drives success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance, regardless of market conditions, and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance.","In the end, delivering strong earnings per share growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are proud of our results this past quarter. But we are capable of doing better. We have a lot of work in front of us, but the future looks bright.","Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good morning. Could you guys - can you share with us the spread between the weather and non-weather affected markets?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. It was roughly 500 basis points.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. So if its \u2013and I guess we could make some assumptions on the percentage of stores that are affected. But if you look then at the non-weather affected markets, then that would probably equal something between a 3 and a 4 comp, I don't know if you'd agree or disagree with it.","But if you look at that trajectory, are there any changes in those markets, whether it's internal efforts from some of the supply chain investments, anything miles driven in those markets, I mean, what's the trajectory like in the non-weather, is there anything notable?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, I would start with any time you're in the springtime, regardless of the markets you're in, things are changing. They're pretty volatile week-to-week. That's just the nature of the spring business. But I would say that the unaffected markets that we were talking about generally performed consistently with how they've been performing the last couple of quarters.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. That's fair. And then in the commentary you were talking about the distribution strategy, the DCs and the mega hub. Maybe it was the tone, but you sounded a little more bullish than you did in the last quarter. I don't know if that's the right read or not.","But in general can you talk about the changes you are seeing or the adoption you are seeing with the distribution rollout?","Bill Rhodes","Well, I would say a couple of things on that front. I wouldn't say I'm necessarily more bullish. I think we continue to be pleased with the performance of the multiple deliveries per week program. We've said all along that as we rolled out the mega hubs they were outperforming our expectations.","I guess, there was one piece of negative news and that is we updated our guidance on what our new distribution centers are going to cost. They are going to cost substantially more amount of money as we got further into the due diligence.","But we believe in this strategy we're rolling it out. We're pleased with the performance so far. We can see how it is benefiting our business and think it will only gain more traction over time.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of David Schick of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open.","David Schick","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could update us on the competitive environment. There's a lot going on out there, just your view on that. And then anything you could add on how you're thinking about SKU additions to the autoanything.com? Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Thanks, Dave. On the competitive environment, number one, we have fantastic competitors. We have a lot of very strong competitors and have for a number of years, and that's both on the retail side and the commercial side.","There is more than normal going on in the competitive environment. Obviously we have one competitor that's going through an integration effort and they're converting and or closing some stores. We're obviously monitoring that very closely and seeing how we can optimize our performance.","But the biggest thing that we're focused on is us and our initiatives. We've got to make sure we believe in the game plan that we have and we've got to execute that game plan. So, I don't want to get too overly focused on what's happening short term in the competitive market.","Bill Giles","An AutoAnything, that's obviously primarily focused on performance and accessories business. But as you may have seen, we are beginning to expand in some replacement parts on AutoAnything. That's still relatively new but we're continuing to expand the SKU count on the site to be more encompassing and to really take advantage of the name AutoAnything.","David Schick","Thanks so much.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kate McShane of Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Kate McShane","Thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. My question is centered around commercial. I know you had said commercial was impacted by the weather, just as DIY was, and while accelerating in the quarter it didn't accelerate on the two year. How should we expect for the rest of the year to play out especially considering the two year stack?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, clearly, our commercial performance, if you go back to Q4 of last year, our commercial performance has decelerated. We talked about some of that deceleration, but not all of that deceleration has been due to the number of new stores that are going through the maturation process.","But there's still a gap and we are very focused on why that gap exists and what are we going to do about it. We talked on the last call about really significantly increasing the engagement of our district managers and our store managers in the commercial business. We said at the time that will take time. That's proving to be you true, but I'm very excited about getting those great leaders more involved in the commercial business.","We're also looking at what else can we do to drive sales in this business over the long term. We think inventory availability is having an impact and will continue to have an impact over the long term. But we've got to get more acceleration in our commercial sales growth.","Kate McShane","And just a follow up to the question prior about the competitive environment, do you have a sense of how much share gains is contributing to your business at this point and are you seeing more in DIY versus DIFM?","Bill Rhodes","I think we're seeing pretty fairly significant share gains on both sides. Clearly the market, we grew 6.5% on the commercial. I don't think anybody thinks the commercial market grew 6.5%.","Now, that's not as wide a gap as we had before, and then all the indicators that we have on the retail side of the business show that we continue to gain share.","Kate McShane","Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Dan Wewer","Thanks. I just wanted to drill into commercial a bit further. You did note that mega hubs are [exceeding plans] [ph], multiple delivery sounds like it's in line with expectation. And in the past you talked about stores with both initiatives, mega hub and increased fulfillment, to increase their weekly sales $1,000 to $1,500.","But how do we reconcile those comments with the deceleration, that gap between 6.5% and 10% plus can't all be due to weather. So, is there any other company specific initiatives or challenges, let's say, with these initiatives that's not working out as you had intended?","Bill Rhodes","Let's make sure I'm clear on one thing first, Dan, when we talked about $1,000 to $1,500 per store, that's both our retail and commercial business. And, frankly, more than half of that goes to the retail side of the business, okay.","We do believe inventory availability and saying Yes, We've Got It more frequently will build to longer and stronger relationships with our customers over time. But I don't think it is a flip the switch, and obviously that's playing out to be true.","You said, yes, weather was a material drag on commercial. Also this maturation cycle is a significant drag. But, frankly, there is some more sales that we haven't figured out why we're missing those and we're working on that. And I have a high degree of confidence we'll figure it out and hopefully reaccelerate our commercial growth rate.","But it's not lost on us. We're marginally disappointed with our commercial sales performance and frankly, disappointed with our sales performance overall for the quarter. But we're not managing this business for one month or one quarter or frankly, even one year.","Dan Wewer","Are you customers aware of the improved parts availability? Has that message been communicated recently?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, absolutely. We have territory sales managers on the ground in those markets. And nobody's more excited about turning on a mega hub or getting increased frequency of delivery than a territory sales manager or a store manager and they are preaching that from the rooftops.","Dan Wewer","And the last question I had, subtracting out the extra supply chain costs, it implies your merchandise margins are improving over 70 basis points year-over-year. Are we going through a new cycle of this gross margin expansion cycle or just the magnitude of further cost concessions from your vendors, is that accelerating?","Bill Giles","I think it's probably a combination of both cost concessions and also sourcing. And so we've put a lot more time, energy and effort around improving our capabilities around sourcing. We've mentioned earlier that we had established an office overseas to help support that effort. That's still relatively immature.","And so from our vantage point we're very pleased with the hard work the merchandising organization has done to improve our overall margin rates and we really think there is continued opportunity for us to continue on that track some time into the future. Obviously I don't know exactly what that rate will be, but we're really pleased with the health of the margin and our opportunity to continue to grow it.","Dan Wewer","Okay. Thank you.","Bill Giles","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks, excuse me, thanks a lot and good morning. You are executing the enhanced distribution and supply chain efforts with increasingly tight inventories. Can you just give us some insight as to how you are pulling this off, where the inventory is relative to where you'd optimally like to see it please?","Bill Giles","Actually, I'd say our overall inventory level right now at $629,000 a store is pretty close to where we think it should be able to sustain itself, between 629 and say, 640. I think that the more frequent delivery has allowed us to optimize some of the inventory even though we're increasing the amount of inventory we have in the mega hubs.","So I think the organization's done a pretty good job of balancing out. We've obviously increased it pretty significantly, if you go back a couple of years. But we think that probably that 630, 640 is a pretty good range for us at the moment.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. A second question, Bill Rhodes, you talked about data capture and deployment of that data. Can you talk about what if anything is changing in your capacity to get that done and how you would envision deploying some of this in the future?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, I mean, if you think about it in the simplest form, we've acquired businesses over the years, and many of those businesses have some of the same customers that we have in the AutoZone business.","So, think about ALLDATA and the customers that they overlap with our commercial customers, and think about IMC and some of the overlaps we have with those customers. So, we're really trying to build what we call one view of the customer, so that we have a holistic view of how we as an enterprise interact with that customer. And it's going to take us some time. We've been working on it\u2019s for a while, but it's very hard to get all those data sets the same.","I'm really pleased with the work our IT organization's doing but it's going to take us a while. When we come out the other side of it we think we'll be in a much better position in the market to those customers, be they retail or commercial.","Matthew Fassler","That's great. And then, finally, very briefly, you spoke about weather. You also spoke about traffic and ticket. To the extent that weather was an impact on the quarter and the markets where it was impacting you, is that felt more on the traffic side, on the ticket side or evenly?","Bill Rhodes","It's generally more on the traffic side, Matt. You do see some compression, for instance, if your battery business is off, because its - then that's going to hurt your ticket because that's a high-price ticket. But most of it is in the traffic count.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. Thank you so much, guys.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Greg Melich","Thanks. I want to talk two things, one on sales and the other one is on payroll cost. First, on sales, I want to make sure I interpreted this right. Do we actually go negative in April, May?","And if the two year stacks was stable through the quarter, why shouldn't we roll that into the fourth quarter because this is a harder comparison and assume comps are less than one. Then I had a follow-up on payroll costs.","Bill Rhodes","To answer your first part of your question, they were flat to slightly negative in the latter part of the quarter. But really, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Greg, sales were really volatile week-to-week, and it directly correlated with when those weather patterns were coming through.","To your question about should you straight-line the two year comp, our premise at this point in time, as you know we don't give guidance. But we think the weather was a pretty significant headwind in this quarter.","They are calling for a hot summer. We haven't seen it yet. It's starting to heat up around here a little bit, and hopefully it does in the Northeast. But we think if that comes to fruition we could have a pretty strong fourth quarter.","Greg Melich","Got it. So, the point is the two-year would have been influenced by weather?","Bill Rhodes","No question about it.","Greg Melich","Okay. Great. And then the second question was, I think in your prepared comments, and maybe I read it in the release, the pressure on payroll cost. Could you describe where that's coming from, if any of that is due to the new Department of Labor salary to hourly switches or just help us understand what happened there and what we should expect?","Bill Giles","Yes, I would think of it as more intentional. I think that we're very focused on improving customer service and so we've made some investments from a payroll perspective. Yes, we're getting some pressure from some of the regulatory environment in terms of wage rates, et cetera. But I would say that's much to a lesser extent currently.","So today, I would say that it's more intentional from ensuring that we've got great customer service in the stores.","Greg Melich","Okay. And, I guess, Bill, while I've got you, then, on the higher CapEx cost for the DCs, should we just take the current CapEx and for modeling out just sort of add $50 million to $60 million for three DCs over a couple years? Is there any other thing we should\u2026","Bill Giles","Yes, nothing much more dramatic than that, Greg. I mean, we've already added tractors and trailers to support more frequent deliveries. There will be a little bit more of that as we open up new distribution centers. But for the most part I would think of it as those three distribution centers over the next couple of years. Exactly right.","Greg Melich","That's great. Hope it gets hot soon. Thanks, guys.","Bill Giles","Me too.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Tony Cristello of BB&T. You may now ask your question.","Tony Cristello","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about the IMC business. It sounds like there continues to be a lot of potential opportunity, but you don't discuss it much in terms of the plan for the rollout, just sort of integration into a potential to have those parts touch on some of your existing businesses.","Can you elaborate a bit more on where you are in that rollout and how we should think about that alongside your initiatives to increase parts availability?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, I would say, first of all, the premise behind the acquisition of IMC was it's a good business and we think it can be a great business and can be substantially larger than it is today.","After we bought them, we quickly started increasing the branch count. We were at 17 branches less than 2 years ago when we acquired them. We're now at 25, that's over 50% growth or right at 50% growth.","And frankly, we've probably got a little bit out in front of our skis, we were moving too fast for an organization that had not opened a lot of branches over time, and we were also doing a lot of integration with AutoZone.","And so, we've slowed down a little bit and intend to slow down our branch growth and really work on the fundamentals of the business in the 25 branches that we have and then restart the branch expansion later.","We are using, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have about 700 stores that are using and selling IMC parts. That is just to supplement our commercial offerings. It's not going to be a radical change in the sales trajectory of our commercial business. But it's a nice way to say Yes, We've Got It to a commercial customer who has a unique need.","Tony Cristello","And are the same territory managers or regional managers working on expanding that IMC as relationships of that part, as well as the newer initiatives? What I'm asking is, do you need to, as you grow your parts availability and your frequencies of delivery, add more sales in order to sort of educate and get that message out there?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, as far as a separate sales organization, we have separate and distinct sales organizations for AutoZone, commercial, ALLDATA and IMC. Now, we are doing some work around them on lead generation between the three different businesses, but each one of those is really a standalone organization.","As far as on the AutoZone side regarding mega hubs and increased frequency of delivery, at the current point we don't believe we need a significant expansion of our sales force. We've got a very talented sales force that we've built over the last seven or eight years and think they are performing well. We've just got to keep telling our story.","Tony Cristello","Okay. And then just quick on a follow-up, I'm not sure if you categorized why you are increasing the cost in terms of those DC rollouts. Was there something that you found, whether it's automation or something, that you needed to provide, and I apologize if I missed it in the prepared remarks.","Bill Rhodes","No, I don't think we addressed it. Frankly, we just missed our estimate. It's been a while since we built a distribution center. These are in different geographies which have different site preparation costs.","It was just a function of we got deeper into the due diligence and found out they were going to be more expensive than we thought. It's the same general operating model that we've opened in the last couple of distribution centers we've opened.","Tony Cristello","Great. Thank you for your time.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Your lines is now open.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Bill Rhodes","Morning.","Chris Horvers","Bill, I want to get your thoughts on how much of the slowdown could simply be the lapping of the benefit of lower gas prices. Could you refresh us on what you thought the benefit of lower gas prices was to your business in 2015 impacted it and when you thought it peaked during the year?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, I'm trying to remember back, I think we quantified it and said we thought it might be 1 point, 1.5 points, something like that. As we're thinking about gas prices currently and yes, they are elevated but they are still at historically low levels for the last decade or so.","So, when we're thinking about it, yes, it may have muted that benefit, and maybe slightly a headwind, but we don't think it's a significant major driver. It will be interesting to watch what happens to miles driven as we get those data sets that show when gas prices started to increase. So far, all the miles driven data we've seen has been incredibly positive.","Chris Horvers","Okay. So, I guess, said another way, it's not as if we have to - any of your business out perform by that point, 1.5, and it's not symmetrical where we maybe have to give that back versus what the underlying trend was?","Bill Rhodes","No, what we've really seen is in gas prices the real shocks that we've seen have been when gas prices got to $4. And there seemed to be almost a magic switch there, that it changed customer behavior. People started changing where they lived or where they worked or using public transportation.","There was a meaningful change in miles driven at those levels. Below those levels it's really hard to ferret out.","Chris Horvers","Understood. Thanks very much, guys.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Michael Lasser of UBS. You may now ask your question.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It's on the commercial side. If we look at your sales per commercial program, on a two year stack it decelerated to 3.5% from 5% the last couple of quarters. Can we attribute all of the 150 basis point sequential slowdown to the weather?","Bill Rhodes","No. I think you can contribute some of it to the maturation cycle change. You can contribute some of it to the weather, and I think there's still a gap there that we haven't identified yet.","Michael Lasser","So you previously talked about adding new commercial programs in areas where you already have a store, so there's some cannibalization impact. So are you still seeing that and is it now being compounded by the maturation curve issue such that\u2026","Bill Rhodes","No, I think cannibalization by definition is less today than it was three or four years ago when we were opening 400 programs. We're just not opening as many on top of the other programs.","Michael Lasser","I guess, the question was getting at is, are those mature programs still in decline or has the decline started to abate?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, I don't think they were ever in decline. I think that they were not growing as rapidly as we would have expected because that cannibalization was coming in. Now a specific store, if we open a store two miles down the road, yes, it might go in decline for six months. But as a general rule, most of them were continuing to grow.","Michael Lasser","And Bill, my last question is, in your mind, did you have some time frame on how long it might take for these investments to pay off? And has that been slower than you expected and now you have updated thinking on the time frame for earning return there?","Bill Rhodes","No, I think we're absolutely on par, if not ahead, with our initiatives, particularly the mega hubs. We see the performance every week. We know that they are outperforming where we thought we would be. We see the inventory, the frequency of deliveries, they continue to perform in line with our expectations, if not even a little bit ahead there.","So, we're seeing that performance. There's just other things that are going on in the business too, that are giving us a little bit of headwind and that happens over time.","Michael Lasser","Got it. Okay. Thank you so much and good luck.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Bret Jordan","Good morning, guys.","Bill Rhodes","Morning.","Bret Jordan","A quick question on IMC and those 700 stores that have same-day distribution of the catalog, are you seeing any impact on those commercial volumes relative to the other stores?","Bill Rhodes","We're clearly seeing that we're selling some products to them, but it's not going to be a meaningful change in the overall performance of the commercial program.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then on AutoAnything, as you're beginning to put some replacement parts through that channel, is the pricing strategy the same or as you're selling on an online platform like AutoAnything, do you have to price against the RockAutos as opposed to the other brick and mortar retailers?","Bill Giles","I'd say that we're focusing it more on an online strategy and we're basing it based on the level of value proposition that the online retailer has. So obviously returns are a little bit more difficult, you don't have the trustworthy advice that you have at a brick-and-mortar store. So we're pricing it appropriately based on that and based on the level of service that we provide.","Bret Jordan","Are you differentiating the products so people don't wind up going to AutoAnything to buy the same thing cheaper that they could have bought at AutoZone?","Bill Giles","Yes, it will be a different product, different brand, et cetera.","Bret Jordan","All right, great. Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Your line is now open.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you very much. With respect to the 1,600 stores that are getting greater deliveries, can you maybe provide some color on the relative comp of those stores relative to the corporate average?","Bill Rhodes","It's a great question, Alan, but we don't focus on it that way. What we're doing, we run simulations so we can understand what they wouldn't have sold. And those stores are all over the country.","So some of these weather patterns that we're seeing would distort those views in certain areas versus other areas. I think we're just going to stick with what we've said all along, that we expect, when a store gets each of these two initiatives, then their sales will grow between $1,000, $1,500 per week, and we're seeing that's being confirmed in our test results, excuse me, our roll outs.","Alan Rifkin","Okay. And on the commercial side, you said that it was slowing a little bit but could you maybe provide some color as to the increases? Is it coming from you new customers or are you just seeing greater traffic or greater ticket from already existing accounts?","Bill Rhodes","I think we're seeing both. Clearly we're constantly out there trying to hunt for new accounts and build better relationships. We also are out there building deeper relationships with the customers that we have. So I would say it's on both sides.","Alan Rifkin","Okay. Just a quick point of clarification, the two to three additional DCs does not include the one in Mexico you're adding later this year, correct?","Bill Giles","That is correct. That's exactly right, Alan.","Alan Rifkin","Thanks for that clarification. Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is coming in the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Bill Rhodes","It sounds like Scot - I think he already asked a question. So we'll just go into the closing. Before we conclude the call I want to wish everyone a nice Memorial Day weekend, and look forward to updating you on our initiatives in September.","While we're excited about our growth prospects for the remainder of the year, we will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this quarter, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint.","As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"2622":["AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) Q2 2012 Earnings Call February 28, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Brian Campbell - ","William C.

Rhodes","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's Fiscal 2012 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Store Development and IT; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. ","Regarding the second quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. ","We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong financial and operational performance. For the second fiscal quarter, our earnings per share increased 24.4%, and our domestic same-store sales increased 5.9%. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter of EPS growth in excess of 20% and the 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Our sales and operating profit growth rates were in line with the last couple of quarters, driven by our continued growth in the retail sales category, strong performance in our Commercial business and impressive growth in our Mexico, ALLDATA and E-Commerce businesses. ","Over the course of the last few years, we've grown total sales in the auto parts segment in the high single-digit range while growing our other businesses in the low double-digit range. The credit for our stability and performance belongs to all AutoZoners across the organization. Their focus on improving customer service is what differentiates us in the eyes of our customers, which ultimately leads to our strong financial performance. ","Our strategies have remained very consistent for many years. While relatively simple and straightforward, they are focused on the areas that are very important to our customers. The foundation for these strategies is consistently delivering trustworthy advice, an intense focus on consistent execution and ongoing refinements to our processes and product offerings. We remain committed to this approach and believe our AutoZoners' execution of this well-defined, well-communicated plan has been a critical element in our success. ","With our second quarter sales up 8.6% over last year's quarter, customers continue to shop with us to find good values in order to effectively maintain, repair and enhance their vehicles. Our retail business performed well again this quarter despite strong same-store sales growth last year. Our domestic Commercial sales growth exceeded 20% for the seventh straight quarter, and we grew our other business made up of ALLDATA and E-Commerce by 11.3%. ","In an effort to address questions that maybe on some listeners' minds this morning, I thought I'd spend a moment discussing trend changes we have seen and their potential impact on current or future sales. First, as I'm sure you all are aware, weather patterns during the second quarter, which as a reminder for us was from November 20 to February 11 were quite unusual, with lower levels of frozen precipitation and generally milder temperatures. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we are always very cautious about the second quarter when it comes to sales and profitability. It is the seasonally lowest point for average weekly sales, which magnifies the profitability impact to sales changes, and our sales performance can be quite volatile due to weather patterns, holiday calendar shifts and pressures on consumer spending. The calendar shift where Christmas and New Year's were on Saturday of last year and Sunday this year were a small benefit to our performance. ","The changes in our sales trends due to the weather are more difficult to summarize because they vary by category. Clearly, we suffered from lack of extreme weather in certain hard part categories, where parts failed due to cold conditions. And we also lost sales in some other categories that spike when severe weather is experienced. However, we benefited from the milder weather in categories where the weather was more conducive to our customers working on their vehicles. The net result is our failure-related categories grew slower than they have in recent quarters, while our maintenance and discretionary categories expanded more rapidly than our recent past. ","Overall, the data available to us shows weather having a net positive effect on our same-store sales. Also, the shift in sales to more maintenance and discretionary categories had a positive impact on transaction count and a net negative impact on merchandise margins. The merchandise we category as maintenance and discretionary carry lower tickets on average than failure merchandise, but represent a higher proportion of our transactions. ","While transactions were still a headwind to the retail business this past quarter, they sequentially improved versus our first quarter. While we experienced some improvement in transaction trends this quarter, our message on the DIY transaction front this morning remains consistent. We expect, over the long term, transactions to continue to remain under pressure as technological advancements result in longer-lasting, better-performing parts and products, typically with higher retails. ","Concurrently, we anticipate that the average price per piece will continue to experience gains. Again, this is not a new phenomenon and is something we have managed through for well over a decade. The bottom line is we remain optimistic about the trajectory of the retail industry, and we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to continue to lead in this sector. ","Second, we want to address new car sales and the potential impact in increasing seasonally adjusted annual rate of vehicle sales has on both our DIY and DIFM businesses. It is not, in our opinion, a material driver to either sector like gas prices and miles driven. And over the long term we need new cars, as today's new cars are tomorrow's our kind of vehicles. We do expect new car sales to increase from the depressed levels we have seen in recent years. However, with over 240 million vehicles on the road and the average age at 10.6 years, the number of annual new car sales doesn't impact the overall vehicle mix materially. And new car sales can't be considered an isolation. Scrappage rates also an important element, and they've generally been in the 5% range or 12 million vehicles a year, basically offsetting the new vehicles added. This impact has caused the number of total vehicles to remain at approximately 240 million vehicles for the last 4 years. Our hope is absolute vehicles on the road going forward increases. We want to reiterate, we believe that over the long term, miles driven and average age of vehicles are the most important metrics for our industry's future sales performance. ","Now let me review our operating theme for 2012: 1Team Driving our Future. The key priorities for the year are: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our Commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; and four, hub store improvements. On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our theme of intense focus on improving execution. We continue to invest in training our store AutoZoners. We are also keenly focused on hiring and retaining the best parts professionals in the business, and we have been pleased with our progress in this area. ","Recently, we implemented further enhancements to our parts catalog and sales tool Z-net. Additionally, we are in the final stages of developing a new labor management system to replace a 2 decades old system. This new system will further assist us in managing our business as one team, leveraging our resources across both DIY and DIFM, while providing the best service to all customers regardless of how they interact with us. We're also working on new planogramming efforts to improve and customize our sales core presentations to the demographics of the local market. ","Lastly, our efforts around expanding the utilization of our hub stores remains a major focus. Our ability to add coverage while growing inventory per store in a working capital-friendly way is at the top of our priority list. We continue to be very pleased with the results of this initiative, and our efforts to ensure we have the right-sized hubs in the right locations is also progressing well. ","On the Commercial front, we are executing our plan to continually open new programs, opening 92 new programs during the second quarter. We also focused diligently on growing our business with existing customers, and we are quite pleased with our progress. We now have Commercial in 2,825 stores or 62% of our domestic store base. We will discuss our operating performance in more detail later in the call. However, our results with our most recent new store openings, combined with the success of our older programs has instilled greater confidence in our plans and encourages us to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative. ","Regarding our second quarter sales. Our total auto parts segment, made up of both our domestic and Mexico businesses, delivered an 8.6% increase. Our other businesses, made up of ALLDATA and E-Commerce, were up 11.3%. During the quarter, we continued to open new stores both in the United States and Mexico, 29 new stores in the U.S. and 6 in Mexico, and expect to grow square footage for the year at an annual combined growth rate of approximately 4%. We also continued our hub store expansion and relocation efforts this past quarter. With a total of 146 hubs, we expanded our hub count this past quarter by 1. We also expanded 5 locations, adding a material amount of square footage. We did not relocate any hubs in the quarter. Since we've begun our efforts on redefining our hub network and square footage needs, we've modified, to some degree, 34 hubs. When we say modify, we mean either expand or relocate existing hubs. As we continue to see traction from utilizing and expanding the reach of our hub network by expanding sales from new hub store SKU additions plus related parts sales, we see the potential to modify, in some way, up to as many as 70 of the remaining hubs over the next few years. ","While we spend a lot of time highlighting our hub strategy, this strategy is very important currently, but arguably even more important over the long term. As parts proliferation continues to expand and vehicle parts technology advancement occur, in many cases it lowers -- lower unit sales per SKU. In order to effectively combat this trend, it is imperative that we have the local market availability to service our customers on a just-in-time basis in a financially prudent manner. ","Our hub strategy allows us to accomplish this objective by aggregating demand on a cluster of satellite stores. In some cases, combining this demand gives us the opportunity to add new local market coverage. And in other cases, it allows us to move products that are stocked in many of the satellite stores to the hub stores, improving the productivity of our inventory. Local market inventory coverage is an imperative in this business for both our professional and retail customers, and our hub strategy has allowed us to expand local market coverage in a cost-effective manner. ","Additionally, we continue to refine our product assortments in the satellite stores, specifically focused on late-model coverage. As our Commercial performance has improved, the overall sales productivity of our average store continues to increase, increasing approximately 4% over the prior year, allowing us the opportunity to efficiently expand our inventory assortments. ","I'll take a moment now to talk more specifically about our second quarter performance in a little more detail. As I mentioned, our domestic same-store sales grew 5.9% for the quarter. Our second quarter, which ended February 11, did experience variability in sales results from week-to-week, which we attribute primarily to the weather. It is difficult to determine the net impact the weather had on our business for the quarter. As mentioned previously, on one hand, it clearly negatively impacted our cold-weather categories but on the other hand, the mild weather benefited some of our maintenance and discretionary categories. Overall, we believe it was a net positive. ","Our increased emphasis on the Commercial business again resulted in quite impressive results. Our second quarter Commercial sales growth of 24.6% represents our seventh straight quarter of 20% sales growth. While we are pleased with our Commercial rate of growth, we recognize that we currently have a small market share, and this remains a tremendous opportunity for us, both in terms of growing the number of programs that we currently have, as well as improving the productivity of our existing programs. Therefore, we have and plan to continue to invest in this business in order to grow sales and further capture profitable market share. ","As we accelerate our investments to grow Commercial and as Commercial becomes a larger portion of our overall business, we anticipate our gross margin and operating expense rates will be challenged as Commercial is currently a lower-margin business. However, as we have stated in the past, we are focused on growing operating profit dollars at strong levels of returns on the capital we deploy. It is important to highlight that while Commercial is dilutive to our overall margins, the Commercial business operating margin continues to improve despite heavy investments. And the expectation is that over time, that will continue to do so. ","I'd also like to recognize our other businesses, ALLDATA and E-Commerce, for having another fine quarter of 11.3% in sales from this time last year. This section of our business, while small as a percentage of our overall sales mix, continues to experience faster sales growth in the auto parts stores. And that's quite an accomplishment considering we remain pleased with our stores' performance. ","Additionally, we've been very focused on leveraging the Internet across a variety of fronts. Our efforts are concentrated on providing our retail customers with access to store product and repair information to help them research or complete the purchase online, an important extension of the trustworthy advice we provide in our stores. On the Commercial side, we are providing our professional customers with tools to streamline their interactions with us, making us easier to do business with. Also over the last several months, we've begun to engage in social media, providing additional avenues for our customers to interact with us. We've been pleased with our progress on developing our Internet offerings, but we are in the very early innings of tapping into these growing customer segments that utilize this venue for researching or ordering their parts and products. ","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to grow this metric to 32.2% on a trailing 4-quarter basis, which represents another new all-time high for our organization. One of the big drivers of this growth has been the EBIT growth of the Commercial business. While having a lower EBIT margin as a percent of sales, which creates some margin rate pressure, the capital requirements of our Commercial model are minimal. The investments are mainly operating expense-related, AutoZoners who develop relationships and sell to our customers and other AutoZoners who execute the orders and deliver products to these important customers. The ability to leverage our existing assets, primarily AutoZoners, store locations, inventory and information systems across this additional customer base, provides us with a terrific opportunity to grow operating profit dollars and drive incremental returns on capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we spend is our investors' capital. ","Our financial performance has been impressive for the last few years. But I want to reiterate that we take nothing for granted. Our commitment to our ongoing planning efforts allows us good visibility into business trends, and our team is committed to managing to those trends appropriately. We've been very deliberate in how we manage expenses and capital in order to deliver consistent, strong financial performance, while positioning our business for long-term growth, and we will continue with this strategy well into the future. ","Now I'll turn it over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results for the quarter. Bill?","William T. Giles","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, Commercial and Mexico results. ","For the quarter, total auto parts sales increased 8.6% on top of last year's second quarter's growth of 10.3%. This segmentation includes our domestic retail and Commercial businesses and our Mexico stores. ","Regarding macro trends during the second quarter, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.37 a gallon and inched up, finishing the quarter at $3.52 a gallon. Last year, gas prices increased $0.26 per gallon during the second quarter, starting at $2.88 and ending at $3.14 a gallon. We're always hoping for declining gas prices as the reduction in prices at the pump can materially help our customers' pocket books. At the same time, with gas prices remaining high, we continue to communicate through our marketing messages to our customers the steps they can take to improve their gas mileage. ","Miles driven remains a headwind to our sales potential for 2011 calendar year. Only the months of January, February and December showed upticks in driving. Previous to December, the last 9 months were negative versus the previous year's miles driven. For the calendar year 2011, miles driven were down 1.2%. That marked the first decline in years since 2008. The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7 year olds and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. ","For the trailing 4 quarters, total auto parts sales per square foot were $263. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry, and this metric is up 3.5% over last year's second quarter. This is the highest level we have achieved since fiscal 2003. This impressive improvement is a key contributor to our record EBIT margin percent and our record ROIC. For the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 24.6%. For the second quarter, Commercial represented 14.8% of our total sales and grew $53 million over last year's Q2. Last year's Commercial sales mix percent was 12.9%. As we have said previously, we have been very pleased with the progress we are making in this business, both operationally and financially. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings and therefore, we are quite optimistic about the future of this business. ","Our sales growth has come from both existing and new customers. We continue to believe we can grow revenues in existing stores, and we will continue to open additional Commercial programs. This past quarter, we opened 92 new programs versus 74 programs last quarter and 43 programs during Q2 of last year. We expanded the number of stores for the Commercial program by 3.4% during this quarter and 12.1% over last year's second quarter ended. We now have our Commercial program in 2,825 stores, supported by 146 hub stores. With only 62% of our domestic stores having a Commercial program and our average revenue per program materially below several of our competitors, we believe there's ample opportunity for additional program growth aside from improved productivity opportunities in current programs. ","Our focus this past quarter was to build upon the Commercial initiatives that have been in place for the past -- for the last few years. We continue to watch our sales force mature from its inception 3-plus years ago. We are also enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of our sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. We've had 19 consecutive quarters of sales growth. We have a model that is successful and scalable, and we are continuing to test additional enhancements through our offerings. In addition to our focus on further developing and expanding our sales force, we have continued to add significant resources to our Commercial business from additional late-model imports and domestic coverage, both in satellites and hub stores to additional labor hours and trucks. ","In summary, we remain committed to building a platform for long-term growth at a deliberate pace, growth in both sales and profits. Our Commercial business remains on track, and we're excited about our continuing opportunities. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 6 new stores during the second quarter and 8 stores since the beginning of fiscal 2012. We currently have 287 stores in Mexico. We remain resolute on our strategy to open stores at a steady pace while managing our Mexico business for the long run. We have operated stores in Mexico for over 13 years, and we continue to see great opportunity for growth going forward. Our returns and profit growth have been in line with our expectations. ","Our efforts to open new stores in Brazil is progressing, and we expect to open our first store in the second half of calendar 2012. We're also in the process of expanding ALLDATA to Europe. Both of these initiatives are in the early stages and will be implemented in a measured fashion. Neither should have a significant impact on our financial results over the mid-term planning horizon. ","Recapping our second quarter performance for the company in total, our sales for the quarter were $1,804,000,000, an increase of 8.6% from last year's second quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores open for more than 1 year were up 5.9% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.3% of sales, up 43 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower shrink expense. Our field and loss prevention teams have undertaken several initiatives over the past few years that have led to improving our shrink results. While we have benefited the last 5 quarters from lower shrink expense, we recognized savings only after we've physically counted our stores and distribution centers and there can be no guarantee that this trend will continue, although we are pleased with our most recent results. ","In regards to inflation, we have seen rising costs in commodity-related products, although certain categories have experienced some higher levels of inflation. Taken as a whole, inflation hasn't been a material component of our overall sales or gross margin improvements. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments, should they arise. ","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross profit margin percentage. We are focused on growing absolute gross profit dollars, and gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment were up 9.5% for the quarter. ","SG&A for the quarter was 34.7% of sales, deleveraging by 13 basis points from last year's second quarter. The primary contributor to the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was higher self-insurance costs, partially offset by leverage of other operating expenses due to higher sales volumes. This marks the second quarter where self-insurance was a headwind for us. Exposure we're seeing in this area, made up of medical workers' compensation, auto and general liabilities, has grown significantly higher. We've implemented initiatives to manage this exposure more effectively on a go-forward basis and with this additional focus, expect this to be less of a pressure point going forward. ","While our operating expense percentage growth increased faster than square footage growth, we have purposefully invested these dollars in our strategic retail and Commercial business initiatives to position the company for future sales and profit growth. This organization takes great pride in our disciplined approach to managing our cost structure and leveraging our culture of thrift, and we remain committed to appropriately managing expenses in line with our overall performance. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure for the foreseeable future. ","EBIT or earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter was $301 million, up 10.6% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 16.7% or 30 basis points versus the previous year's second quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $38.9 million compared with $39.6 million in Q2 a year ago, essentially flat. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $3,464,000,000 or approximately $215 million more than last year's second quarter balance of $3,249,000,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.43x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease debt levels based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. ","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 36.2%, flat with last year's second quarter of 36.2%. We expect to be closer to 37% on an ongoing basis. Net income for the quarter of $167 million was up 12.7% versus the prior year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of $40.2 million -- or 40.2 million shares was down approximately 9% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $4.15, up 24.4% over the prior year's second quarter. ","Relating to the cash flow statement for the second fiscal quarter of 2012, we generated $119 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 7% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $71 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 39 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores and work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,580 in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and 287 in Mexico for a total store count of 4,867.","Depreciation totaled $47.5 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $44.1 million. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $173 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. And at the end of the quarter, we had $486 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110% versus 104% in last year's second quarter. ","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $2.6 billion, up 6.6% versus the Q2 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investments in coverage for select categories. Inventory per store was up 2.3% and well below our 5.9% domestic same-store sales growth. ","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 32.2%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. ","Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes","Thanks, Bill. Before we conclude the call, I want to reiterate our team's commitment to our culture and our customers. Although our industry's performance continues to be strong, we believe our efforts have contributed significantly to our success, as evidenced by our sales and market share growth in both retail and Commercial. We remain committed to continuing to improve our business model and our operations, continual steady refinement. We believe our business model is healthy, and we have material opportunities for further improvements from this point. For the remainder of fiscal 2012, we will continue to focus on our key priorities: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably grow Commercial; three, leverage the Internet; four, our hub strategy. ","The financial results for the first half of fiscal 2012 have again been strong. On the first quarter earnings conference call, we cautioned listeners on the uncertainties of the second quarter, the winter weather and the effects the Christmas selling season would have on our customer's wallets. But with our AutoZoners' continued intense focus on providing great service and trustworthy advice, we were able to deliver these impressive results. I want to again thank and congratulate our entire organization for their dedication to our customers, fellow AutoZoners, stockholders and communities. Our approach remains consistent. We're focused on succeeding in the third quarter of 2012, and we are optimistic and excited about the remainder of the year. ","Before we move to the question-and-answer period, I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize and say goodbye to one of our great leaders. Next month, Tim Briggs, Senior Vice President of Human Resources, will be retiring after 10 great years of service to AutoZone. During his tenure, he has provided great stewardship over our human resources function and has been a key contributor to leading the overall organization. He will certainly be missed but he has built a strong team, and his team will continue to provide great service to our organization in his absence. We wish Tim and his family all the best in their future endeavors. ","Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.","Alisa Guyer Galperin - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It's actually Alisa Guyer on for Aram. Can you talk just a little bit about sort of the 1TEAM approach as Commercial gets bigger? Are there any limitations to that approach? Is it a reasonable expectation to run the store as a single operating entity even if that business gets bigger?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. Certainly, there are times when -- as the Commercial business in a particular location gains scale, the integration of the 1TEAM approach is generally less important. It's typically when it's at lower volumes and you have fewer people, particularly on the Commercial business, you need to leverage the DIY staffing to help manage through spikes in the business. So over time, as the average per-store sales increase, it is less and less important. But remember, we have a wide variety of volumes on our Commercial business per store.","Alisa Guyer Galperin - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you give us any sense of that range? I mean, we can look at sort of the average per store. But my understanding is that there are very few Commercial programs that are actually doing the average.","William C. Rhodes","Yes, I mean, it's a pretty wide range. And frankly, we haven't really gotten into that in the past. And I don't necessarily know that it's hurting it right now. What I can tell you is we have some stores that are doing really, really significant volume, and we have some stores that do very little volume. And we're working to move them all up the spectrum.","Operator","Our next question is from Kate McShane with Citi Investment Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You had mentioned in your prepared comments that the discretionary category was up this quarter. And I wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail on this. Is this the first quarter where you've seen the discretionary category inflect positively? And do you think it was all weather related?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I mean, we've had some challenges, frankly, for the last 2 or 3 years on our discretionary categories, and this is the first time we've really seen some accelerated lift as compared to the rest of our business. But really, the one that really jumped out was the maintenance category, and I think that, that was due to weather. I think the discretionary categories, in some respect, came along. That's not to deemphasize the great work that our team is doing in discretionary categories. But I think as we got more footsteps in the stores, some of the discretionary purchases came along with those maintenance purchases.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my second question is on the Commercial business. Have you talked about what your goal is for 2012 with regard to how many stores will have Commercial business versus the 62% you reported today? And with regards to the 92 new programs in Commercial, where did the majority of those accounts come from regionally?","William C. Rhodes","I'll start with the first part of your question. We really don't get into where we want to be at the end of the year. I would tell you if we told you at the beginning of the year where we'd be at the halfway point, we are significantly ahead of that. We have a methodology here that's kind of termed 2 things. One is pay-as-you-go and another one is underpromise and overdeliver. So we set our sights low and as the business continues to perform, we try to accelerate it. So at this point in time, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made so far this year. Our performance continues to be good. So in the short term, we will continue to accelerate our openings. But where we're going to end at end of the year, I think, is somewhat better to know how the business performs. Secondly, your question was on regional variations of customers? Help me with that a little bit.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sure. You had highlighted the 92 new programs in Commercial. I wondered if there was one region where you had more success in obtaining those new programs or if it was more evenly distributed across the U.S.","William C. Rhodes","Yes, it's very evenly distributed. There are some areas, certain regions of the country where we aren't as penetrated as great, and they will get a little bit of an upside. But that's really just been our posture in those local markets on how aggressive we've been to open programs historically. As we continue to perform very well, everybody's getting a higher level of confidence in our ability, and so we're being more aggressive in some of the markets where we were pretty conservative before. But I think it's not based upon geography, I think it's mainly based upon our posture in that local area.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Do you think there's any risk that the warm weather in the last few months has pulled forward demand and you may feel it in the upcoming quarter, especially at a time when oil prices and gas prices seem to be continually on the rise?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I think clearly that that's been one of our concerns. As the warm weather hit in December and we saw some of our maintenance-related categories performing very well, I will tell you we were quite concerned that it was a significant pull-forward. I will tell you that as we've gotten further into the season, where we typically see the reason -- the seasonal ramp-up, that has become less of a concern than it was several months ago. The second part of your question regarding gas prices, clearly we have mentioned it many times in the past as we see significant increases in gas prices, that creates a headwind for our business. So we're clearly mindful of where gas prices are and where they're headed, and we're managing and are projecting our business accordingly. But who knows where they're going to go? What I know is we will focus very much on how do we help our customers manage through a high gas price environment, how do we market to them, how do we help sell them the parts and products that will increase their fuel efficiency. And this isn't the first time we've been through it. We've managed it very well in the past, but it clearly would be a significant headwind.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then my follow-up question is if you isolate the labor expense this quarter and then the trend over the last couple of quarters, how's the leverage flowing through on labor expense as a lot of the growth has come from Commercial?","William T. Giles","It's a good question. We have been successful at leveraging labor. At the same time, for the new programs that we're opening in Commercial, obviously, there's an investment that takes place on that. And we certainly have opened more stores in the front half of this year than we have in the front half of last year. And we feel, as Bill mentioned, good about the progress that we're making in Commercial, so we expect to continue to make those investments. But on our baseline business, we continue to leverage from a labor perspective.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So the labor leverage hasn't really been there as you focused a lot of the investments on the Commercial side.","William T. Giles","Some labor leverage on our core base business. And what I was mentioning was that on some of the newer programs, you'll see a little bit higher labor. And so as we continue to ramp those up, there will be a little bit of deleverage just on those programs.","Operator","Our next question is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays Capital.","Helen Pan - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is actually Helen Pan filling in for Alan. We were wondering if you could sort of talk about how the comp progressed throughout the quarter. Was the quarter very back end-loaded in terms of performance?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I wouldn't say it was back end-loaded. Actually, if you look at the trajectory of the business during the quarter, the middle part was really where the strength of the quarter came. But if you take a step back and look at it more holistically, if you look at it on a 2-year basis, it was really very consistent. So I think it's more to do with year-over-year comparisons during the quarter than anything timing-wise otherwise.","Helen Pan - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I just had another question on the Commercial. You said that the range of performance was very wide. Have you seen that sort of narrow as existing companies with existing programs mature at all?","William C. Rhodes","Well, it's just clearly as they mature, yes we see them narrow, and frankly, we see them increase. We've seen nice growth in our average weekly sales on the Commercial program, but we continue to open new programs. But those newer programs put pressure on the average weekly sales, albeit we're very pleased with their progress. They're coming out at higher levels than they used to and they're maturing faster, so we continue to be pleased with the progress. But with only 62% of our stores in the Commercial program, we'll continue to open programs for an extended period of time. That will pressure our average weekly sales and as Bill mentioned, it will also pressure our operating margins because as you open those stores, they're an EBIT drag for a period of time.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Melich with ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the SG&A question. The growing 9%, the dollars this quarter, would you say that's a good sort of normal run rate now, given what's you plan for Commercial in these activities in Brazil and the ALLDATA, building that business for Europe?","William T. Giles","I think it's probably hopefully a little bit at the high end on that. So I mean, I think that we have opportunities for just to continue to manage it. The key for us is to be able to try to control the expenses that don't really do a lot from a customer service perspective. So things like risk management, et cetera, we've got to be able to do a better job of lowering those expenses. Conversely, we've done a great job from a shrink perspective in being able to add margin improvement on that. Further on to SG&A, as you mentioned, we continue to feel good about the Commercial programs. We've opened close to 200 of those programs in the first half of this year, that's on pace. We've opened just over 200 programs through the full year last year. So we'll continue to make investments in Commercial, particularly given the results that we have seen. And as you mentioned, to a very lesser extent, things like ALLDATA Europe, Brazil, et cetera, those are investments that, albeit that we will continue to be internally aggressive about, they will not be material to the financial statements overall. So our investments are mostly focused on hub stores and Commercial. Those are the places you'll see us.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And the labor scheduling, that new program that you said you're implementing, it was a 20-year-old system, I think I heard in the prepared comments. Can you describe a little bit on the timing of that and the costs and when we expect to see that?","William T. Giles","We expect to have that probably rolled out to the chain by the end of our fiscal year. So hopefully at the beginning of our fiscal year '13, we will have that system in place. And really, it's an opportunity for us to get better visibility and better micromanaging, if you will, from a labor perspective. So as Bill mentioned, it is a 20-year-old system, and it's worked well up to this point. But we really have an opportunity to take it to the next generation and really manage it at a lower level than we have before. So we think we'll be able to improve some efficiencies along the way. Much of the investment has been made up to this point. And so we're in the final stages of the investment.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just lastly on comp transactions. I think, Bill, you mentioned that DIY, you think it's sort of structural that you might get more AUR, but it's just hard to get more actual transactions. In this quarter, was it actually a negative still? Or did it actually get slightly positive?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, it was a headwind this quarter. But Greg -- and I've tried to be very clear on this point. It's been that way as long as I've been in this business. We've seen significant or minor degradation in transaction counts year over year over year, except during recessionary cycles, as long as I've been in this business. But you also have to understand that that's structural in a lot of cases because new parts technology make parts and products perform better and last longer. But at the same time, all the technology that goes into make them perform better costs more. So there's a natural headwind on average ticket -- or excuse me, a natural benefit on average ticket and a natural headwind on same-store transaction count.","Operator","Our next question is from David Gober with Morgan Stanley.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to dig into the Commercial margins a little bit more. And Bill, I think you mentioned that Commercial margins have been going up. And I wondered if that was simply related to the number of older programs continuing to grow and those programs maturing, or if there's actually been any sort of structural shift in the way that you're executing the Commercial business that's improved your ability to execute sooner.","William T. Giles","I think I would look at it as the maturation of some of the older programs. And so -- and think about the fact that we've got a lot of programs that are still relatively immature. And so we've seen EBIT margin improvement in just our Commercial business alone as the investments that we have to open those programs begin to get leverage as those programs begin to gain maturity and gain sales volume. So really it's a leverageable model, and we believe there's opportunities to continue to improve our EBIT margin within our Commercial business. As we've stated before, Commercial operates at a lower margin than DIY. So as Commercial becomes a larger piece of the puzzle, it will put some pressure on operating margin percent, although obviously we're focused on operating margin dollars, which is a real driver for ROIC as well because the investments aren't that significant to get a Commercial program going. But overall, operating margin is going to continue to improve, we believe, on the Commercial programs as they continue to gain momentum and increase volume.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Bill, I guess just as a follow-up on return on capital. This quarter, share buybacks were down a little bit versus last year and obviously, that's going to happen eventually. But I was just curious if there's any change in the thinking around longer-term capital allocation or if there's any incremental thought being given to dividends over buybacks or any change in the capital allocation philosophy.","William T. Giles","No. We actually feel pretty good about the capital allocation philosophy. We believe that maintaining BBB stable, targeting a credit metric of 2.5, albeit that there will be some fluctuation on any given quarter, we think that that's the right capital deployment and served us very well. And we think it's showed up in our financial results.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You mentioned even after the easy weather comparisons in January, you thought that the performance in the seasonal ramp has been encouraging even after that. As you look into that and the come-along on the discretionary side in 4Q, do you think this is a sign of consumer feeling a little bit better overall? We're hearing from a lot of retailers that they've been positively surprised by sales. So I was curious if that's something that you've looked at or perhaps discussed internally.","William C. Rhodes","Yes, Chris, you've got to remember first that when things got really bad, our business did not get bad. So I don't think that we're a good barometer of how the consumer feels good or bad. I don't think we've seen anything material in our trends that would make us think that the consumers' mindset has changed one way or another. But it could be happening very much in other sectors of retail, and we're just somewhat immune to those.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. And then as you've pushed out the Commercial program, has there been any competitive changes as you've ramped up the growth and entered new markets?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, I would say we haven't seen any material competitive changes across all geographies. I mean in certain geographies, you'll see somebody do something different. But generally, it's been consistent. Unfortunately, we have a lot of great competitors out there, and they're tough every day out in the street. But our Commercial team has really continued to execute on -- at a very high level, and it's showing up in our growth in share and sales.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one real quick Commercial-related question. Can you maybe articulate why you think your average Commercial sales volume versus others is so much lower? Is there anything structural there that the way you go about it with your sales force? So just trying to figure out what the potential opportunity would be there.","William C. Rhodes","Yes, I think it's maturation of our Commercial business. We kind of changed our Commercial strategy about 4.5 years ago, and we've been very methodical with it. But we're a bit behind the development of other players in our sector, behind some of them by 50, 60, 70 years, but -- and others more on a comparable basis. But we don't see anything in the Commercial business that makes us think long-term that we should perform any worse than the rest of the marketplace.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess related to that, the outside sales force that you guys employ there, I have a number from about a year ago that it was about 250 outside salespeople. Can you update us on where you are in that process?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. We continue -- we kind of quit giving the specific numbers for competitive reasons. But it continues to grow year-over-year, and it's grown quite substantially since then. We continue to be very pleased not only with the number of salespeople out there, but really the maturation of that sales force. We've done a lot of training for that sales force. We've provided them with some technology that makes them more effective. And frankly, over time, they continue to get more confidence in our program, and they've been a key contributor to our success.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So one last question. I'm just curious, how are you guys and those sales guys go -- how are they going in trying to win business from an existing player? Is it -- and the other guys have the SKU count that you guys have. So is it on price? Is it service? What -- how do you see you guys differentiating from the other guys to try to get to their volumes?","William C. Rhodes","I think if you look at our history, the strength of AutoZone's business has been our culture, which folds into great customer service and also our ability to have the right parts and the right products. We've got good, strong brands. We leverage technology to make us a more efficient player. So I think those are the kinds of things, just same things that made us special in retail relate themselves very well to the Commercial business.","Operator","Our next question is from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a quick one on the self-insurance reserve. I think this was the second quarter in a row that you might have mentioned it. It looks like as the broader market trend is maybe for some of those medical cost pressures to actually have eased a bit, so wondering what specifically is driving that impact, relatively large impact, and how long you think that persists.","William T. Giles","That's a good question. And in fairness, we didn't mention it last quarter as well as a bit of a headwind. And so for us, it is just claim-related, larger claim costs from a medical perspective. At the same time we also, with increased activity on the Commercial side of the business with significant more trucks, et cetera, we've had some higher experience there as well from auto liability and workers' comp. So it really is activity-based for us as well as some large claim experience, so we think we'll cycle through that and we've got some initiatives in place. And so as we look forward, we expect it to be less of a headwind.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then I got on the call late, so I may have missed it. But did you detail what you thought the gross margin pressure was from Commercial mix?","William T. Giles","We didn't necessarily other than the things we've said previously. But again, obviously, we've got some benefits from shrink. Commercial continues to be a bit of a headwind on, certainly, our gross margin rates. But obviously, we've overcome that with other things. So I would categorize it as overall, our gross margin rate remains relatively healthy. Certainly from a mix perspective, Commercial will wind up putting some pressure on gross margin. As Commercial matures over time, we believe that our EBIT margin will improve. But Commercial will operate at a lower margin than DIY.","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I guess, the other thing on gross margin, we did have some fairly significant pressure in the quarter based upon the mix of products that we sold. And that was generally driven by the weather-related categories.","Operator","Our final question today is from Bret Jordan with Avondale Partners.","Bret David Jordan - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up and on the discretionary mix, trying to determine the weather impact versus the economic impact. Did you look at that improvement in markets that did not have abnormal weather patterns over the winter? Did discretionary remain more or less flat in some of your Southern or Western markets?","William C. Rhodes","Frankly, we saw the weather pattern changes pretty significant across every part of the United States. I mean, the South had significantly warmer weather, the West was warmer. So no, we haven't tried to go tease it out of those individual markets, but we saw it pretty much across-the-board.","Bret David Jordan - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","But it really feels like it's a weather impact versus an improvement in consumer confidence, buying categories they didn't buy 2 years ago?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, I think that's our supposition at this point in time. We'll learn more as we go forward. But we saw a big change in the growth rates of maintenance-related products, which are really the kinds of things that our customers would do in more favorable weather patterns. So our supposition at this point in time was the discretionary kind of came along with that much more so than there's been a change in consumer mindset.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to your speakers for any closing comments.","William C. Rhodes","Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model remains very solid. We remain excited about our growth prospects for the year. We cannot take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. Our culture remains our key point of differentiation from our competition, and we must not lose sight of the importance of basic store execution in order to remain very successful. We have a solid plan for the remainder of 2012, and our team is positioned to succeed. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we will continue to focus on the basics and never take our eye off of optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be incredibly successful. We want to thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Sir, you may begin.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2015 third quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer IT and ALLDATA and Brian Campbell, Vice President-Treasurer (sic) [Vice President-Treasury], Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners for delivering another solid quarter. Our primary focus this quarter was to continue and expand our different delivery models, open two additional mega hub stores and closely monitor the performance of these ongoing tests. We've made good progress on these tests and now have just over 900 stores receiving increased deliveries intra-week or 18% of our domestic store base and we now have four mega hubs in operation.","In recent years, we've diversified our portfolio somewhat with an emphasis on building additional legs of growth for the future. Our retail domestic business, which generates approximately 70% of our revenues, performed well in Q3 and while our growth slowed modestly from last quarter, we continue to see opportunities for future growth in both store count and same store sales.","Secondly, our commercial domestic business, which has been growing sales by double-digits since 2010, continued its growth in Q3 and continues to represent a significant opportunity for us.","Regarding our international operations, we've been doing business in Mexico since late 1998 and our model has proven to work quite well. In Brazil, we opened two additional locations and our sales continued to grow nicely.","As with other international companies, the strengthening dollar has negatively impacted our U.S. dollar earnings from these operations recently. Even with this volatility, we're comfortable continuing to open stores at our current pace.","Our Internet businesses AutoZone.com and AutoAnything continue to grow well, generally consistent with our expectations. ALLDATA, which is the leading diagnostic and repair information business in the United States, continues to perform well. However, that business is more mature and coupled with increased competition has experienced more nominal growth.","And finally, IMC, an imports parts specialist that we acquired last fall, continued with its integration process where we're working to expand their footprint of branches and where we're working to leverage their inventory assortment across the AutoZone domestic store base.","This past quarter, our U.S. retail business expanded with the opening of 27 net new stores. We also opened 72 net new commercial programs. We've a commercial program in 79% of our domestic stores having opened approximately 750 new programs in just the past two years. Additionally, we opened seven stores in Mexico during the quarter. In Brazil, we opened two additional stores and operated seven stores at the end of the quarter.","We expect to open a couple of additional stores over the next few months. We currently have 8% of our total stores outside of the United States. We believe we have growth opportunities on a variety of fronts in the U.S. and outside the U.S. for many years to come.","The cadence of sales this quarter showed much weaker performance at the beginning of the quarter, offset by stronger performance during the last two reporting periods. These results were not unexpected to us. If you recall, during our conference call last quarter, we discussed how income tax refunds were issued earlier this year, following in the last two weeks of the second quarter. We believe approximately 100 basis points of same store sales were pulled forward, which benefited our 3.6% reported comp last quarter. After the tax refund cadence normalized, our sales results improved as expected.","Regarding merchandise categories, our failure categories continued to do well, outpacing both maintenance and discretionary categories. This was opposite of last quarter and a little unique considering we were hoping the lower gas prices at the pump, coupled with the spring season, would lead to accelerating growth. Our belief is that the late winter storms in the first few weeks of the quarter coupled with accelerated tax refunds led to a later start to the spring maintenance season.","Regarding regional performance, the west and the east did a little better than the central part of the country. Much of this can be attributed to the precipitation we experienced in these areas. We felt we finished the quarter in good shape to start our summer selling season with our stores looking great and our inventory assortment better than it's ever been.","I should say one last thing regarding the income tax refund discussion I mentioned earlier. From a report issued by the Treasury Department, the amount of refund dollars were just about identical with last year's totals. However, it was the pronounced shift to initiating refunds two weeks earlier this year that was new. We believe this was the large reason for the start of our quarter being a little weaker and we believe our last quarter sales represented more normalized levels.","Overall, we were pleased with our sales performance in Q3 and we're optimistic about the sales environment heading into our fourth quarter.","Inventory levels increased over last year's Q3, approximately 6% on a per-location basis. This was in line with our expectations, as we have implemented several tactics over the past year to improve our hard parts coverage and to place inventory closer to our customers.","We anticipate that inventory levels will remain relatively flat in Q4. Additionally, the IMC acquisition has increased our inventory per store across the chain by about $13,000. IMC branches carry approximately 10 times the inventory per location that an average AutoZone store carries, but their sales volumes on a per-location basis are materially higher as well.","As we discussed on the last several quarterly calls, we have several initiatives to improve our inventory coverage and our ability to say yes to our customers both retail and commercial more frequently. We're continuing to expand our initiative around replenishing stores on a more frequent basis from our distribution centers. Traditionally, the vast majority of our stores were replenished once per week.","At the end of the quarter, we had more than 500 stores that were being replenished between three times and five times a week, the majority of which began in Q3. Based on our results to-date and to provide us with additional data to determine our long-term strategy, we added more than 350 additional stores to this program in just the last few weeks. This brings our total store count of stores receiving additional deliveries per week to well over 900 stores.","We are seeing a lift in sales. However, we have yet to definitively determine the ultimate benefit, nor we determine the optimal frequency. So consistent with past test and given the magnitude of change, we will methodically test and carefully measure our results.","In order to replenish our stores on a more frequent basis, it will require increased operating expenses and capital expenditures, primarily for two to three additional distribution centers. Our modeling to-date based on current results indicates that while it is dilutive to gross and operating margins, it is sufficiently additive to operating profit dollars over the long-term. We've been pleased with our learnings to-date and are encouraged to continue to expand more stores under the program to better evaluate our results.","Additionally, I want to update you on our mega hub stores. As a reminder, our stores are supported by approximately 173 hub stores with an expanded assortment. While our traditional hub store carries between 35,000 SKUs and 50,000 SKUs, our mega hubs typically more than double the hub stores' SKU assortment. With these substantially expanded product assortments, our mega hubs leverage those increased product assortments across other hub networks, providing stores across a very large geography access to this broad assortment.","Along with the two older locations, we opened two additional mega hubs this past quarter. We're planning on opening one additional mega hub location in the fourth quarter. Based on our results to-date, we've begun to identify the next set of mega hub locations and are in various stages of developing these stores. Assuming our findings are confirmed by the more recent mega hub openings, we will develop a long-term strategy to roll out these mega hubs to provide service to the majority of our domestic stores.","All of our inventory availability initiatives are designed to significantly increase our ability to meet our customers' needs. As our commercial business has grown and as our aspirations for this business are quite high and our DIY customers' needs increase, our need for expanded assortments of quality products at the right price continues.","This has been important and difficult work and I want to stress we are still learning. While we are encouraged by these initiatives, before moving more aggressively, we need to have solid evidence of the long-term ramifications to our business and we need to ensure these initiatives are the appropriate course of action. At this point, we are encouraged with our findings, but there are examples of inconsistent performance between markets and initiatives and we need more time and more test results to determine our ultimate strategy.","Lastly, around our inventory initiatives, we're in the early stages of expanding our direct import capabilities. Although we currently have an active program, we believe that it can be significantly expanded by developing more internal capabilities. We've completed significant research and have now developed a new global sourcing strategy and that strategy which includes opening our first offshore sourcing office is in the implementation phase.","Now, I'll take a moment to discuss our recently completed acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation doing business in the marketplace as IMC. IMC is the second largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian cars. While considerably smaller than the number one participant in the industry, IMC now with 18 branches offers an impressive growth opportunity for us, not just because of the parts coverage, but also because of the strong management team.","While it's still early in the process, I will mention our plans include opening more IMC branches and incorporating their parts catalog into our AutoZone Z-net parts catalog. We will continue to go to market as IMC and we expect to open several new IMC locations over the next 12 months. We acquired IMC in September and the rate of integration and expansion has been encouraging to-date. Thus far, we've made the IMC catalog available to over 500 AutoZone locations.","While many of these 500 locations recently added the ordering capabilities from IMC, we've seen a sales lift in these stores' commercial sales programs that encourages us that our assumptions on the sales lift to AutoZone from cross-selling were correct, if not even conservative. Additionally, IMC added one new branch and several others are in the development pipeline.","Finally, we relocated the IMC East Coast distribution center, which allows greater access to more sizeable markets. Let me stress, the IMC brand is very important to us. We will grow the brand and its presence in the future in many more markets than it is in today.","IMC has been in a growth mode recently and has built an infrastructure to support a substantially larger footprint. It currently doesn't enjoy the operating margins that we experienced. So it lowers our overall EBIT margins by approximately 40 basis points on an annual basis. We're very excited to have the great IMC team as part of our organization and we're very optimistic about our future together. We continue to see synergies moving forward.","Now, let's turn to our third quarter overall results. Our sales increased 6.5% and our domestic same store sales were up 2.3%. Both retail and commercial experienced positive same store sales growth. While our same store sales were negative the first few weeks of the quarter, due in our belief mainly to a shift in the income tax refunds, the remaining weeks improved. That consistency was across all regions of the country. We believe we continue to benefit from macro tailwinds, our work on inventory availability initiatives and solid execution.","Regarding traffic versus ticket in the DIY business, traffic was negative, while ticket was positive. In line with weekly sales performance, our traffic accelerated at the end of the quarter versus the beginning. Our average ticket grew generally consistent with the first and second quarters when it returned to more normalized levels after about a year of subdued growth.","The hard parts additions we've added to our stores have helped ticket growth. While improvements in product quality have pressured traffic over the last couple of decades, the technology advancements have significantly increased the price of the products we sell. We've been managing through this phenomenon as mentioned for over two decades, and expect to continue to do so.","We opened 72 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 137 programs in the comparable period last year. We now have the commercial program in 79% of our domestic store base. Our commercial sales excluding IMC were up 11.4% this quarter. While our productivity per program was nicely positive, it did not increase as much as last quarter.","Much like our retail business, our commercial business did slow in the first few weeks of the quarter, but finished more in line with our expectations. We've intensified our focus on mature program growth, and specifically, mature customer growth, and it was encouraging to see the improvements that began in Q1 and Q2 continue into Q3, although those improvements were muted in the first few weeks of the quarter as well. Finally, our older programs, those greater than five years old, continued to grow in the mid single-digit range.","Regarding Mexico, we opened seven stores this quarter and we added two stores in Brazil. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 6.5% over last year's third quarter. As a reminder, ALLDATA and e-commerce, which include AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. Regarding online sales, there continued to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to individual customers or B-to-C. While these businesses are small for us at just 4% of our total sales mix on the quarter, we're seeing these businesses grow at a faster rate than our brick-and-mortar businesses.","With the continued aging of the car population and with gas prices on average down materially year-over-year for the third quarter, miles driven increased 3.9% year-to-date through February. Declining prices at the pump have benefited our customers, especially those most financially stressed (17:57). The lower end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging, but we understand this is just one of many factors that impact our business. While gas prices have increased more recently, prices are still around $1 a gallon below last year.","Our operating theme for 2015 is Wow! Every Customer Everywhere, and our key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies, and finally, improving inventory availability.","On the retail front last quarter, under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with improvements to our product assortment, we're incorporating more product content and information to help our store AutoZoners provide trustworthy advice. Delivering product quality, features and benefits content through training and in Z-net continues to be a major effort for us at the store level.","Behind the scenes, we continue to increase our technology investments and challenge ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that supports all the ways they desire to connect with us. It is imperative we continue to invest in both current and future technologies in order to drive sales growth across all of our businesses. Over time, we will update you on the rollout of these technologies and how they help us interact with our customers and their vehicles more effectively.","As our competition continues to innovate, we understand our ability to both maintain and gain market share will require us to have great-looking stores, higher in-stock levels, and most importantly, more knowledgeable AutoZoners to help customers than even what is available today.","While we are gaining share, we need to be even better. The biggest link to all of this is our people. As you have to have the right merchandise at the right price in great looking convenience stores, real differentiation comes from our AutoZoners meeting and exceeding our customers' wants, needs and desires. Our AutoZoners are the most valuable asset we have in differentiating us in the eyes of our customers.","In regards to commercial, we opened 72 programs during the quarter and 162 programs year-to-date. As we expect to open approximately 300 programs this year versus 424 programs last year, we will have a busy fourth quarter. We're on track thus far. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that our sales growth potential will continue to increase. Our results continue to provide us with confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.","We should also highlight another strong performance and return on invested capital. As we were able to finish Q3 at 31.1%, we're very pleased with this metric, as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to recognize and thank every AutoZoner for this past quarter's effort to provide Wow! customer service to all of our customers.","Now, here's Bill.","William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results.","For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, IMC, our Mexico stores and our seven stores in Brazil, increased 6.5%. And regarding macro trends during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.27 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.69 a gallon, a $0.42 increase. And last year, gas prices increased $0.29 per gallon during the quarter, starting at $3.38 and ending at $3.67 a gallon.","We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles, and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to benefit from some increase in disposable income. We also recognized that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 4.9% in January and 2.8% in February. We don't have March or April data yet.","The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,761,000. This statistic continued to set the pace for the rest of the industry.","For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 11.4%. Commercial represented 18% of our total sales compared to 17% last year and grew $46 million over last year's Q3, an almost identical dollar growth to last quarter's $47 million improvement. We opened 72 new programs during the quarter versus 137 programs opened in our third quarter of last fiscal year; we now have our commercial program in 4,007 stores supported by 173 hub stores. Approximately 1,100 of our programs are three years old or younger.","As Bill had mentioned earlier, both our total commercial sales and sales per program accelerated from the previous quarter's results. While productivity per program is lower than several of our peers, we have a much younger program base. Being able to increase sales approximately $50 million for the quarter year-over-year is allowing us to close that sales gap. Our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers, and we are consistently making progress.","Looking specifically at mature programs, those at least five years old, they grew in the mid single-digit range this past quarter, slightly slower than last quarter. However, the first few weeks of the quarter for commercial were muting our productivity growth. Additionally, we still have significant opportunities to open additional programs over the next several years.","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe the improvements we have made and upcoming additional improvements from our inventory availability initiatives enhanced our prospects, and we believe the addition of IMC will provide us with more avenues to service our commercial customers very effectively. We believe we are well-positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share.","Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened seven new stores during the third quarter. We currently have 418 stores in Mexico. As the U.S. dollar strengthened this past quarter, we did have an FX conversion headwind. However, we still delivered a solid U.S. dollar equivalent EBIT result and felt good about being able to handle the currency weakening in regard to the overall impact of the company's results. We expect to open a similar number of stores in Mexico this fiscal year that we opened last year, about 40 stores. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations.","Regarding Brazil, we opened two new stores and now have seven total locations. We are committed to our prudent pace of development, customers are embracing our offering, and sales results continue to climb. While still not profitable, we're beginning to close the gap. While it is easy to envision several hundred stores in Brazil over time, currently, our strategy is to open a few more stores over the next several months and then refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. Once we refine our offerings and operations and evaluate the performance, we will provide you with an update on our long-term growth plans.","Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $2.493 billion, an increase of 6.5%. Domestic same store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year were up 2.3% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.3% of sales, up 29 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by the impact from Interamerican Motor Corporation, which was acquired during September of 2014.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for merchandise gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses. The pressure we will experience from the IMC business along with the rollout of further stores and more frequent deliveries from our distribution centers will continue to cause headwinds to overall gross margin rate. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.","SG&A for the quarter was 31.64% of sales, 12 basis points higher than last year's third quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the impact from the IMC acquisition. While we have invested in several key initiatives that are customer service related, like training and systems upgrades, we believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.","EBIT for the quarter was $514 million, up 7.3% over last year's third quarter. Our EBIT margin was up 16 basis points at 20.6%.","Interest expense for the quarter was $31.8 million compared with $36.2 million in Q3 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.533 billion or approximately $160 million more than last year's balance of $4.378 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy; and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.9% above last year's third quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis.","Net income for the quarter was $309 million, up 8.4%. Our diluted share count of 32.3 million was down 4.2% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $9.57, up 13.1% over the prior year's third quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement, for the third fiscal quarter, our operating cash flow was $523 million. Net fixed assets were up 7.3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $107 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 37 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.","With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,069 stores in 49 states, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 418 stores in Mexico, 18 IMC branches and seven stores in Brazil for a total location count of 5,512.","Depreciation totaled $62.3 million for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $58 million. This is in line with recent quarter growth rates.","With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $515 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter. At the end of the quarter, we have $778 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again, I want to stress, we managed appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric; the metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.9%. The inclusion of IMC reduced the AP ratio by about 174 basis points.","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.5 billion, up 10.7% versus Q3 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects the recent IMC acquisition, new store growth and additional investments and coverage. Inventory per store was up 6% at $629,000 per location, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage and the IMC acquisition. The increase in inventory per store this quarter due to the IMC acquisition was $12,700 per store.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.1%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Bill. We are pleased this morning to report our 35th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 13.1%. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. At the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must innovate to ensure they turn to us for their vehicle needs.","We will continue to invest in our businesses and monitor the results from our ongoing inventory initiatives. As we have tested multiple delivery frequency models, financial results have been inconclusive as to which format makes the most sense. There are incremental costs to more frequent deliveries, and we have to make sure we develop the appropriate long-term solutions, because many of these additional costs will virtually become fixed costs.","We are moving forward with our mega hub store concept. As you can see, we've got lots of exciting things going on. Along with our inventory assortment, our initiatives around commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, e-commerce, Brazil and now IMC are all just getting started. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double-digits.","We feel the track we're on will allow us to continue winning for the long-term. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It's the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief this solid consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success.","Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we're investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We're pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.","Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","My first question is around your mega hub strategy. It seems like you've developed more confidence in rolling out that strategy. Can you give us some more color on what kind of lift you're seeing from mega hubs?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, first of all, Seth, thank you for the question. I want to be careful about giving out too much specific information, because we have two stores that have been on the program for a considerable amount of time. We just rolled the other two locations in the last eight weeks or so. I will tell you that those two locations are performing at or above our expectations so far, so they are helping us build our confidence level.","But I don't want to get into specific sales performance indicators, because there is some variability between them and there's two of them that are just so new. But what I will tell you is we do have a higher degree of confidence in that, that's why we're going forward with looking for additional sites. And we are \u2013 it is certainly meeting or exceeding our financial expectations, which means it's meeting our internal rate of return or better.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got you. Good to hear. And then secondly, as it relates to IMC, you talked about the sales there meeting or exceeding expectations thus far. What kind of assumptions do have there for your cross-selling lift? And do you expect to maintain that type of cross-selling lift as you expand that to more stores that are further from the IMC branches?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's going to be interesting over time and we're very early in this as well. We started with eight stores on the program and we've now up to over 500 stores, but many of those stores are very early in the process. I think what we're learning so far is the stores that are very close to IMC locations are going to outperform those that are farther away; and there's certainly a big amount of our stores, call it, half of them that can be touched by an IMC location today, but there's a bunch of them that would have to be serviced overnight. So it's really early. While we did have assumptions in our overall model and so far we're meeting or exceeding those assumptions, but we've got a long way to go.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got you. Thanks and good luck.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Bill. You talked about the variability and the results from the new initiatives. Does that reflect different levels of execution? Or is that just the inherent variability that AutoZone sees in a lot of its different businesses?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a terrific question, Dan. I would say it's not about execution. I've got to tell you, what our team has done to roll out over 900 stores on multiple deliveries per week and really just over two quarters is pretty remarkable. I guess there's 700 stores of them (38:00) just over the last couple of quarters is really remarkable. And while we're still learning how to do it better, they've almost flawlessly executed that, so hats off to all the team that's worked on that.","One of the problems we have with this initiative is that we have elected to do many of the tests very close to the specific distribution centers. It's easier, it's cheaper, lot of other reasons, but because of that, we have very small geographies that \u2013 where these tests are focused on, and some of those geographies are going through different things in the marketplace that have nothing to do with delivery frequency. So we're seeing very different results in certain markets, and so that's why we keep expanding the test to try to broaden that slot so that we can make sure that we understand what the benefits of that are.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just as a follow-up question, when you think about the benefits from the better parts coverage, do you think you're getting a bigger benefit from the multiple shipments per week from the distribution centers? I think those are focusing on the faster turning SKUs or do you think you're going to get a bigger lift from the slower turning SKUs that you're adding to the other mega hubs?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say we definitely get a bigger lift from the frequency of delivery test, which is focused on the SKUs that are in those local stores that are sorted there and making sure we have the right replenishment levels. However, the costs of that initiative are materially higher than they are on the mega hubs.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So a bigger sales lift but also higher expenses?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's much higher expenses.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Great. Thank you.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from John Lawrence with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you and good morning, Bill.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens, Inc.","Would you comment a little bit about the global sourcing strategy. I know it's very early, but give us a sense of sort of that \u2013 the context of that process of using that type of strategy globally?","William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA","Yeah, thanks, John. We obviously today import a fair amount of product directly ourselves today and we use third parties in order to help us do that. And we will continue to do so. But what we really want to do is to be able to put ourselves in a position to increase that fairly significant over the next several years. Though as Bill highlighted in his comments, our expectation as I said, we will put AutoZone resources overseas in a dedicated office that will allow us to be closer to the vendors and the manufacturers so that we can source with a broader net and improve our quality control, et cetera. So there's a lot of opportunities there on a long-term basis.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens, Inc.","All right. Thanks. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. So a follow-up question on the mega hub and then how it relates to or how it fits into the puzzle of multiple delivery. Are you expanding them, meaning testing them so that the DC may not necessarily be the primary vehicle that's used for multiple delivery? And does the number of mega hubs mean that you won't have to use the DC as much?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me go into a little bit more depth to make sure that we're articulating it appropriately. So think about a standard AutoZone store that carries 20,000 SKUs, 22,000 SKUs. When those SKUs are replenished, that replenishment today comes from the distribution center, and tomorrow, if our test proves successful, will still come from the distribution center, but will come three times or five times a week.","When the SKU is not in that 22,000 SKU assortment, today, the AutoZoners in that store can go for that expanded assortment to a hub store, which will take the 22,000 SKUs up to 35,000 SKUs to 50,000 SKUs. Tomorrow, if the mega hub continues to work, if that hub store doesn't have it, they can reach out for another 30,000 SKUs, 40,000 SKUs to the mega hub store. So the increased frequency of delivery is all about replenishment, and the mega hub is all about increased access to additional parts coverage.","Does that make sense?","Simeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, no, that's helpful. So my follow-up is you have \u2013 you said as of today, I think over 900 stores that are benefiting from some type of daily delivery. What's the timeframe, your best guess, is how long some of your tests will keep running? And then once you arrive at some formula, whether it's you decide certain stores will be two days, three days, five days or even once a week, will you turn this on all at once? Or what would hold you back from once you figure out the formula from turning on the rest of the chain all at once?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's a fantastic question, which means I wish I could answer it and I can't. I would have thought we would have made this decision by now and would have articulated it to you. But some of our results have been inconclusive. And there's a lot of moving pieces here. And as we said in our prepared comments, this is a big decision, and we at AutoZone are pretty methodical in how we make decisions. This isn't about next year or year after, this is about the long-term and so we want to make sure we get it right. So we're going to take enough time to get it right.","And then as far as rollouts, we've been pretty aggressive the last two quarters by rolling 350 stores, 400 stores onto this program. I don't know that we could go a lot faster than that. We might be able to as we get deeper into it, but it's not something that we would be able to roll out all at once, nor is it something we need to roll out all at once. I think you look at the way we've done things in the past, whether that was the commercial new model that we rolled out or the hub store initiatives that we rolled out, we like to get in a cadence, do it where it's digestible and where we can execute it at a very high level, so I suspect that's how we would roll it out.","Simeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Bret Jordan with BB&T. Your line is open.","Bret D. Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Hey. Good morning.","William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA","Good morning.","Bret D. Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","A question on the global sourcing and I guess as you look at it, is this going to increase your penetration with the Duralast mix? And I guess what does it do to supply chain? Does it add inventory because you own inventory further into the supply chain? And I guess is the strategy to pick up better pricing? Or is it to have better management of products quality?","William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA","I think probably better opportunity to source from a broader selection of manufacturers and vendors. It will have the opportunity to reduce pricing, because we'll be able to go direct in many circumstances. It likely will add a little bit of inventory just from the standpoint that you'll own it for a longer period of time in the process, but we believe obviously there's the savings that we will achieve from the acquisition costs will far outweigh those carrying costs.","And then from a quality perspective, it probably has some opportunity to improve the quality although we feel really good about the quality of our product today that we import. So there's a little bit of opportunity there, but probably not as much. The real focus is going to be on the acquisition cost, getting closer to the vendors and the manufacturers and improving the profitability of the company.","Bret D. Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Will Duralast as a percentage of the inventory increase in this process? Or is it largely stable just better sourcing?","William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA","I would say that if Duralast increases as a percent of our total, it wouldn't be as a result of this initiative necessarily. It's more about sourcing.","Bret D. Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then one quick question on the e-commerce; you said it was growing faster than brick-and-mortar. Is that traffic-driven increases or is that ticket-driven increases? Are you seeing any price pressures out there from people like RockAuto or is the market pretty stable?","William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA","The market is somewhat stable from an online, although it does continues to be somewhat promotional in nature. From our vantage point, it's really mostly traffic. And so, our traffic has continued to grow at double-digit kind of rates. So we've experienced good traffic and it's a great source of information for our end customers.","Bret D. Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.","William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, there, guys. Good morning. Two questions. The first one just about the capital structure, shares outstanding fell by 4.2% on a year-over-year basis, the lowest that I've seen at least in our model. Can you talk to us a little bit about the CapEx element that might be pressuring that? CapEx is higher as a percent of sales, but talk a little bit about where you think that might max out? And also whether or not it's making you think about things differently on the rent-to-own calculation when you're building out some new stores? Thanks.","William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA","Yeah, just to kind of \u2013 if you don't mind me going backwards, it doesn't necessarily change our mind relative from a rent perspective. We're obviously going to continue to prefer to own where we have those opportunities, because we want to be in control of the asset and we think it's cheaper long-term.","I would say from the 4% element, it is a little bit lower, but you've seen it come down a little bit over time. Some of that is stock price driven, and so the cash flow generation that we have has been relatively consistent and the stock price has gone up along with the P\/E so it's had a little bit of a natural dilution effect, if you will, from that perspective.","And from a CapEx perspective, it continues to be a little bit of an increase in CapEx. We had mentioned in previous calls it's likely that we would do an additional distribution center or two over the next couple of years, so that will have some additional usage of CapEx certainly not in the numbers today.","And then AP to inventory ratio, which has been a big benefit for us over the past several years, has begun to moderate a little bit more. And so, as we have said before that our expectation is that our AP to inventory ratio will probably stay close to its current rate or a little better, but it won't have the significant increases that it experienced two years or three years ago.","Does that help?","Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, thanks. And just to follow-up the second question on the commercial, really, you've given us some statistics in terms of commercial penetration and growth. Can you give us some more subjective elements in terms of whether that you've got customer service scores or retention out rates or anything internally that you can help us to get a sense that you're qualitatively gaining traction there would be great.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. One of the things we talked about probably more extensively on the last call was at the beginning of this fiscal year, we made a shift. We've been opening a tremendous amount of stores over the last three years or four years on the commercial program. And with that, our sales with our mature programs and specifically, our mature customers, were not performing as well as we would have liked.","So beginning kind of September 1, we really re-anchored our focus on those mature stores and mature customers, and we've turned the tide not I would say, marginally at this point in time, but probably more encouragingly than we would have thought. We still have a ways to go, but I think that is one of the key metrics that's on the forefront of what we were looking at.","More subjectively, I'd just say you think back seven years, eight years ago, when we went to this new commercial strategy, our receptivity in the marketplace is just vastly different from people that we try to hire to customers that we go in and make sales calls. Think back eight years ago, we didn't have a sales force out telling our story. Now, we have a very robust and talented and well-trained sales force out there telling our story, and it's making a meaningful difference in the marketplace on their receptivity to us.","Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC","And is it fair to say that the lift in sales that you're getting from the hubs and the mega hubs, is that all attributable to the commercial side of the house?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, not at all. Not at all. It's probably slightly skewed to commercial, but it's also very robust on the retail side.","Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks so much. Have a good day.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. You too. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot. Good morning.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I want to ask another question on global sourcing and then a quick follow-up. Can you help us get a sense of the relative profitability of branded goods versus private label goods as they're currently sourced versus where you think having your own sourcing infrastructure overseas will take you?","William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA","That's a good question, and my expectation is that the further we penetrate into the global sourcing, the narrower those numbers will get. But I suspect it's a few hundred basis points when you take everything into consideration. But you do have some additional cost, as we mentioned earlier, relative to owning the inventory for a longer period of time, and frankly, owning it end-to-end. So there are some offsets, but I would say that's probably a round number to use.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And if you think you're starting essentially at zero, how much penetration do you think you could ultimately achieve with your own sourcing infrastructure? And to some degree, would simply having an infrastructure in place be a good bargaining or negotiating tool for you to work with your costs with your current vendors?","William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA","Yeah, I think the way to think about it is that we've started this journey a long time ago, and we do a fair amount of direct importing today. And so, it's not that we're starting from ground zero necessarily. The merchandising team has been working on this for a long time, and quite frankly, today, have done a great job of having a fair amount of direct importing. However, we think we can probably more than double what we're doing today and probably a little better than that over the next three years to five years. So we're kind of in the third or fourth innings, and working our way through.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","My follow-up is on gas prices. And Bill Rhodes, you talked to the way the impact of gas played out kind of at a very high level versus expectations. I know it's hard to attribute sales to individual sources, but if you think about A, the discretionary products that would sell when people have more money in their pockets and B, the kind of products that ultimately get sold more of (53:25) due to miles driven going up, whether it's in chemicals perhaps or I guess wear and tear would take a while.","Since gas prices have come down, if you could, not just restrict it to this past quarter, but the past seven months, eight months, can you talk about that journey and how is that all you think you've seen that impact the business?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we've actually called it out on the last two specific discussions that we thought it was a net benefit. It's not 5% benefit, but in the 1% kind of range. This quarter, we didn't spend as much time on it, although I think it's beneficial with a slight increase. It's probably not as beneficial as it was the last quarter.","The real story this quarter was all about our first period and first four weeks of the quarter, which were really, really tough, we expected them to be tough because of the 100 basis points that we mentioned last quarter we pulled forward. But then those late winter storms, particularly in the Deep South, just really muted our growth. Actually, we were down pretty significantly, so we were \u2013 that was the story of the quarter so the one we wanted to focus on in our remarks.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So the weather is kind of an additional factor above and beyond the tax issues, that perhaps was not anticipated?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I would just say in those first few weeks, Matt, weather is always seasonal in the spring time. But we were \u2013 it was the third quarter here. We're sitting with six inches of snow in Memphis, Tennessee. That's not normal.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Understood. Thank you so much.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS Investment. Your line is open.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill, I was hoping you could size (55:08) the potential opportunity from both the mega hubs store rollout as well as increasing the frequency of replenishment. So of that 22,000 SKUs that will see a benefit from the mega hub, are you missing out like 10% of the time? Or is it more like 20%? And then how would you size the increasing frequency of replenishment as well?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's difficult for us right now to continue to size it. Look, we're doing close to $1.8 million per store on an annual basis. These are not going to make that $2.5 million. We could maybe pick up $1,000, $1,500 per store per week over time if these initiatives work, but that's let's also remember the competitive landscape is not a stagnant place either. People \u2013 this whole industry is chasing parts coverage, parts availability and the ability to say yes, because our customers need it. As parts proliferation continues, it's become a greater and greater challenge and frankly, it's on the forefront of one of the ways we compete against each other. But I don't know that we can sit here and say here's what the numbers going to be because the landscape is going to change over time.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","Does the sales increase all come from being able to say yes more often? Or is there some element where the parts pros, the folks in the stores feel a little bit more comfortable with what's available and then they can go out and sell the capabilities to the commercial relationships more aggressively?","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, you're talking about really a halo effect there, and clearly, the confidence of our sales team on the commercial side of our counter folks on the DIY side, that's certainly an element. But I would say the bigger element of it is, if a customer, specifically a commercial customer, is calling you six times or seven times a day, if they see a noticeable increase in the amount of times that you say yes, you're going to pick up more share with him.","Conversely, if you're saying no more than your competitors said, then you're going to be challenged. So I think there certainly are halo effects. That's hard to see in the data and hard to estimate over what time that's going to happen, but we certainly think if there's an issue or a benefit there.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And then last question on this line is what's the downside? Can a store become overwhelmed with too much inventory? Or does the complexity become a little greater when there's more availability? Thank you very much.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the downside is what's the cost to get that last sale. There is a lot of diminishing returns on putting inventory into locations. Why don't we put 50,000 SKUs into the local store? Well, because we can't afford to. That's why we have a hub store that will aggregate the demand of 30 stores or 40 stores. Same kind of issue with delivery frequency, there is a lot of diminishing returns, how much can you afford to get that last sale?","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Thank you so much.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Before we conclude the call, I hope you had a nice Memorial Day weekend, and I look forward to updating you on our activities from the summer. While we're excited about our growth prospects for the year, we do not take things for granted, as we understand our customers have choices. Our competition is not standing still and we must continue to challenge ourselves to improve.","We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress this is a marathon, not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we're confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.","Thank you for participating in today's call, and have a great week.","Operator","Thanks for participating in today's conference.

Please go ahead.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2019 first quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their tremendous efforts during our first fiscal quarter. Their dedication and commitment to superior service resulted in a strong start to our new year. As we entered the quarter, we knew we had a difficult sales comparison due to the sales favorability we experienced last year from three significant widespread hurricanes. Last year, we highlighted that our sales increased an additional 50 to 60 basis points from the effects of those hurricanes. ","Unfortunately, this fall, many people were also impacted by the two hurricanes that struck our shores and the terrible wildfires out west. While certain areas experienced significant damage, the effects of the storms weren't as widespread as last year and the impact on our business this year was negligible. Unfortunately, we have AutoZoners and customers who were severely impacted and we've worked diligently to help them where possible. Ultimately, considering the more challenging comparisons to last year, we were pleased with our same store sales growth of 2.7%. ","Regarding the cadence during the quarter, results were generally consistent, except in the weeks and markets that we were lapping the hurricane events from last year and the last week of our quarter was particularly strong as much of the country experienced the first major cold weather, which accelerated our sales. Overtime, weather effects normalized, but in certain weeks, it can have a meaningful impact on our sales. ","We previously mentioned that our DIY market share gains were strong in the first half of last fiscal year and that growth materially subsided in the second half. Recently, our market share has continued to grow and improved slightly, which we consider encouraging as we are lapping the large gains we\u2019ve made this time last year. As for regional performance, we continue to see strong results in the Northeast Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern markets while results were improving, but still a bit subdued out west. ","Our stronger results in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest don\u2019t surprise us as the very cold winter and seasonal summer we experienced continued to generate benefits for us throughout this summer and fall. We were especially pleased to report that our commercial sales growth eclipsed double-digits for the quarter, ending up 11.3%, marking our strongest growth quarter since fiscal 2015. We strive to show continued profitable growth in our commercial business and we've intensified our focus on achieving much of that growth in existing programs. ","We've enhanced our inventory availability significantly in recent years. We have high quality parts and products, many under the Duralast name with a seasoned sales force and now we are increasing the engagement of our local store team, particularly the store manager and we're pleased with the results and the sequential improvement we have experienced over each of the last three quarters. We feel well positioned to continue strong growth for the balance of the year.","Overall, our business strengthened in Q1 and we were encouraged as we head into our second fiscal quarter. Every year, our second quarter is significantly more \u2013 has significantly more volatility due to sales, widely varying weather patterns and in February, March, due to the timing of income tax refunds. Additionally, it is the lowest volume quarter of the year as we have closings and elevated expenses around the holidays. The second quarter is always our most challenging quarter. ","During the first quarter, we launched our theme for the new fiscal year at our annual sales meeting here in Memphis in October. Our annual operating theme for 2019 will be focused on our drive for excellence, a relentless focus on what matters to our customers, exceptional service, fast deliveries, high quality parts and products, flawless executions of changes in product assortments, in-store merchandising and on and on. ","We're focused on reducing non-selling task in our stores in order to reallocate that time, talent and attention to sales activities. We continued executing our inventory availability initiatives during the quarter and opened two additional mega hubs. We now have 26 mega hubs in operations. Many investors are quite interested in our perspective on industry fundamentals heading into 2019. We've spent considerable time over the last few years, discussing the weather, something I'm quite reluctant to do as there is nothing that we can do about it. And over the long term, weather impacts normalize and are not material drivers of the long term success of this business or industry. ","And I'd like to remind everyone of the long term solid growth trends our industry has experienced in DIY and commercial over the last three plus decades. But at specific times in markets or region, weather matters. Extreme heat and cold causes premature failure of parts and also accelerates the deterioration of maintenance parts. And in the spring and fall when temperatures are milder, most deferred maintenance gets done, if the weather is favorable. Fiscal 2016 and \u201817 had very mild winters and our industry sales were softer than the couple of years before or last year. We don't know if this year's weather will be more or less conducive to our business, but we do know that our current industry fundamentals, including declining gas prices are favorable. ","And as our economy enters the later stages of an extended growth cycle, we know when economic times get difficult, our customers turn to us more frequently out of economic necessity to help them stretch their resources. We don't know what the next year will hold. We have a high degree of confidence built off of nearly 40 years of experience that this is a very reliable, predictable industry over reasonable planning horizons and we continue to be optimistic about our industry's prospects and particularly our company's prospects.","Another key topic of latest tariffs, the initial tariffs on raw materials weren\u2019t significant to us. The 10% tariffs were expanded to broader and broader categories. We did not see a material cost increase from these tariffs in fiscal 2018 or in our first quarter, because we were able to negotiate and offset some of the tariffs away based on the strength of the US dollar. Looking forward, the US has agreed to postpone plans to increase tariffs from 10% to 25%. We will continue to monitor developments closely and working with our industry associations to share our concerns about the potential negative ramifications of ongoing and increased tariffs to our customers and the broader economy. That said, our industry has much lower elasticity of demand than most other retailer distribution sectors. If your car won't start and you have to go to work, you or someone else has to fix it, period. This phenomenon has historically allowed our industry to pass on product inflation in higher [indiscernible].","Turning to our online efforts, we continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience in an omni-channel world. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites, autozone.com, AutoZonePro, mobile and all that. In fact, we are investing more capital than ever before this fiscal year in improving these systems. We continue to see growth in website traffic as well as ship to home and buy online, pick up in store sales. ","While representing a very small percentage of our business, we are pleased with the acceleration of growth that leverages our online platforms in both retail and commercial and for retail through our ship to home, buy online, pick up in-store and now through our industry leading next day delivery program that allows customers and 85% of US markets to order as late as 10 PM and receive their products at their home the very next day. We are also working diligently to further enhance our digital capabilities with our commercial customers to ensure that they have a great seamless, intuitive, no hassle way to interact with us digitally.","In summary, we are pleased with our recent performance and encouraged about our industry's prospects for 2019 and beyond. Macro factors are currently in our favor and we remain committed to not only maintaining, but growing our market share in both our DIY and commercial businesses.","Now, let me provide a little more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales increased 3.3% and our domestic same store sales were up 2.7%. As a reminder, we sold two businesses in the middle of fiscal 2018, including one IMC that was included in the total auto parts sector. Therefore, our total domestic sales comparisons include sales from that business in the total number, but those sales have no bearing on the same store sales results in Q1. All three months are of course September, October and November were positive with October being our strongest month. ","On a two year basis, the first two weeks of November was our strong. During the quarter, we opened 13 new stores in the US and our commercial business grew by 11.3%, while opening 25 net new programs. Our commercial growth accelerated from last quarter\u2019s 8.8% increase, as we continued to execute on our strategies to grow sales. We expect to open approximately 150 net new commercial programs this fiscal year. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we have continued to expand in Mexico, opening three new stores. We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter. ","Regarding our inventory initiatives, in the spirit of, YES! We've Got It initiative, we continued our efforts around expanding our hub store network. We opened two additional mega hubs this past quarter and now have 170 hub stores and additional 26 mega hubs, totaling 196 stores with significantly expanded parts assortments. As we have seen, both our DIY and commercial sales expand in markets where hub and megas are added. We will continue to grow the number of hubs we have this year. ","We expect to open as many as 10 hubs for the full year, with most being mega hubs. As a reminder, both our hubs and our mega hubs are focused on making available additional coverage to the local markets, meeting adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our network before. Previously, we relied on shipping these harder to find or slower turning SKUs into the market when demand arose. Both of these efforts are designed to enhance our ability to meet our customer's needs for coverage and immediacy. ","Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a long term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customer's needs, regardless of how difficult the requests.","Regarding inventory, on our last call, we highlighted that over the last six months, we had executed a significant amount of changes, including product category changeovers that we felt were disruptive to our company and negatively impacted sales during that time. We are happy to report that the majority of those challenges have been addressed and rectified and those issues are predominantly behind us. As importantly, we've studied our opportunities for improvement in the future and have improved our planning and processes accordingly. ","Now, adding more color to our international operations, our three store openings in Mexico this quarter pushed our total store count to 567 stores. Mexico now represents 9% of our total store base and this month marks the 20th anniversary of our first Mexican store opening in Loreto. I'd like to congratulate the original AutoZoners who laid the groundwork and began this journey 20 years ago as well as those who have built it into one of the premier retailers, distributors in all of Mexico. For everyone past present and future who has or will have something to do with the great service we provide to our Mexican customers, congratulations on 20 years of success and thank you for all you have done. ","Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 38.9% versus last year\u2019s first quarter, but I wanted to remind everyone last year's numbers had a business that was sold later in fiscal 2018, AutoAnything. We will not anniversary those lost sales entirely until this year's fourth quarter. We will continue to make our omnichannel selling efforts a key focus for 2019. At the end of fiscal 2018, we reinstituted promotions online as we have removed them at the start of calendar 2018. ","Thinking with the promotions, we launched our next day delivery in 80 plus markets across the country. About 100,000 SKUs were made available for next day. In this quarter, we expanded that availability to over 95 markets. While ship to home, ship to home next day, buy online, pick up in store and commercial customer ordering are all showing growth and more traffic to our online sites, we continue to see customers primarily doing lots of research online and then coming into the store in order to receive trustworthy advice, [indiscernible] and a host of other services that simply cannot be duplicated online prior to making the sale. ","Our efforts in 2019 are to make sure our AutoZoners are freed up in stores, provide Wow customer service for every customer. While our online sales are small, substantially less than 5% of our total sales, the omni-channel experience is very important for the customer experience. So, we will continue to invest in our digital platform. ","With the aging of the car population and recently lower gas prices at the pump, these are contributing to our optimism regarding 2019 for both DIY and commercial. Trends remain encouraging. Along with our operating theme for 2019, drive for excellence, we create key priorities each year. For 2019, these priorities for the year are customers first, commercial acceleration omni-channel, leveraging technology and YES? We've Got It inventory initiatives. We're spending a significant amount of time across the organization, but especially in stores, identifying areas where task can be simplified, streamlined or eliminated in order to free up time for our AutoZoners to focus intensely on customers and their needs. ","We hosted our national sales meeting in October and our messages were simple, intensely focus on customer service. That's what has made this organization legendary. And we will focus on simplifying things in stores to help free up time. We're making further technology investments to improve our electronic catalog and point of sale systems with the goal of putting the customer first. We believe our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.","Regarding commercial acceleration, along with opening 25 net new programs, during the quarter, we've been investing in systems to help AutoZoners sell more efficiently and customers conduct business with us easier. While most of these initiatives won't be rolled out until late in calendar 2019, our focus on increasing the engagement of the broader store team and focusing on existing customers is really paying off. We have solid momentum heading into the new calendar year. ","Along with our usual program openings, we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings, we expect further sales growth, which is once again highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our first quarter at 33.7%. We continue to be pleased with this metric, as is one of the best in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to again thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team\u2019s efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers\u2019 expectations. We're excited about all the initiatives we're working on throughout 2019 but everything starts with the efforts of our exceptional AutoZoners and we thank them for that.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill Giles.","Bill Giles","Thanks, Bill and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic, retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, retail and commercial businesses along with our Mexico and Brazil stores increased 3.3%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,792,000. ","Total commercial sales increased 11.3%. In the quarter, commercial represented 21% of our total sales and grew $56 million over last year's Q1. We opened 25 net new programs versus 30 programs opened in our first quarter last year. We now have our commercial program in 4,766 stores or 85% of our domestic stores, supported by 196 hub stores. In 2019, we expect to open approximately 150 new programs. As Bill mentioned earlier, we remain committed to gain market share with our commercial customers and we're encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. ","Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened three new stores during the first quarter, ending the quarter with 567 stores. We expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2019. Mexico business remains challenged by peso foreign exchange rate movements relative to the US dollar. While our hope is 2019\u2019s exchange rate will settle down and will strengthen relative to the dollar, we are pleased with the Mexico leadership team's ability to manage this business through foreign exchange volatility.","Regarding Brazil, we continue to operate 20 stores. We have aggressive plans to open between 15 and 20 additional stores by the end of the fiscal 2019. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long term future of this market. If we can prove success, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So while challenging, the size of the prize is significant. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.7% of sales, up 90 basis points from last year's first quarter. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the impact of the sale of the two business units completed last fiscal year and higher merchandise margins. ","While we\u2019re asked about gross margin assumptions and the direction they will be headed, our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A expense for the quarter was 35.2% of sales, higher by 54 basis points from last year's fiscal quarter. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were higher than last year, primarily due to the planned increase in domestic store payroll. On the cost front, we highlighted on the last few quarters conference calls the investments that we would be making, specifically, wage rates and technology for this fiscal year. As we discussed, the majority of the wage rates would be implemented during the latter part of the first quarter. ","Although consensus may have had these investments starting sooner than they actually did in Q1, we feel the consensus numbers for SG&A for the remainder of the year are more in line with our expectations. Also, I would remind everyone that fiscal 2019 includes a 53rd week. I bring this up to make sure analysts model that last quarter accordingly. We encourage folks to look at the last time we had a 53rd week, Q4 of 2013, as a litmus test for modeling. I\u2019ll add here regarding inflation and pressures on wage, we feel we have been good at getting out in front of the local market pressures modeled accordingly and managed higher expenses well. From a regulatory standpoint, around wage, there was nothing new we saw happening there in Q1. ","EBIT for the quarter was $488 million, up 4.1% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.5%. Interest expense for the quarter was $39 million and in line with Q1 a year ago. We are planning interest around $42 million to $43 million range in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 versus 39.3 million last year Q2. The higher expense is due to assumptions on variable rate interest being impacted by planned fed funds rate moves in December. ","Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.156 billion or approximately $173 million above last year's Q1 ending balance of $4.983 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR, while in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.7%, down from last year's Q1 of 34.6%. Along with tax reform this past year, we benefited 250 basis points in our rate from stock options exercised during the quarter. Excluding this benefit, our rate was 24.2%. Because it is impossible for us to predict when individuals will exercise options, we encourage folks to model us on a rate assuming the stock option impact, roughly 24.2% and we will report both rates. Net income of the quarter was $351.4 million, up 25.1% over last year. Our diluted share count of 26.1 million was down 7.1% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $13.47, up 34.7% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter.","Related to the cash flow statement, for the first quarter, we generated $449 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 4.1% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $98 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 16 net new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub remodels or openings work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,631 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 567 stores in Mexico and 20 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,218. ","Depreciation totaled $82.5 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of 78 million. This is generally in line with the recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $497 million of AutoZone\u2019s stock in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had $985 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at quarter end. Again, I want to stress we managed to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric, metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive deploy -- capital deployment strategy.","Next, I'd love to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 2% over the same period last year. Inventory per location was $658,000 versus $663,000 last year and $636,000 just this last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories, less accounts payable, on a per location basis, was a negative $59,000 versus negative $52,000 last year and a negative $75,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 108.9%. ","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in a return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 33.7%. We have and we will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. While we had a strong start to our fiscal year, we are careful to not over commit to any outcomes when it comes to our second fiscal quarter. The second quarter has perpetually been our most volatile quarter due to many things I\u2018ve already highlighted. We believe our industry\u2019s fundamentals remain very strong and are likely improving with the price at the pump decreasing. We've seen predictions that it will be a relatively harsh winter, but I'm not sure our insights into upcoming winters have traditionally been very strong. I know we will adjust and optimize our performance regardless of conditions and we remain very bullish on the long term fundamentals of our industry, both in retail and commercial. ","We are excited about our balanced model for growth around domestic, retail commercial, international, online and pick up in-store. We believe our hubs and mega hubs, Mexico, all data and e-commerce can all grow their top lines in 2019. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us. ","We are fortunate to operate in one of the strongest retail segments and as we continue to be excited about our industry's growth prospects for 2019 and beyond. As customers continue to look to save money while taking care of their vehicles, we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice that they have come to expect. It truly is the value add that differentiates us from any other faceless transaction. Customers have come to expect that advice from us. It is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our DIY and commercial websites and in-store experience to provide even more knowledgeable service. ","Service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will be long into the future. Our job remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last 40 years and we continue to be excited about our future.","Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First in queue is from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","Good morning, guys and good start to the year. So, Bill Rhodes, two-part question. You talked a lot about this in the prepared remarks. Can you talk about what's been driving this steady improvement in the commercial the past few quarters and now the jump to double digits? And just a second part is, if there's any extent, there's a difference in your answer, how do you narrow the gap over time versus your competitors.","Bill Rhodes","Yeah. I'm not sure that there's a difference. I think it's about blocking and tackling more than anything else, Simeon. As we mentioned in the last call, in the second half of the last year, our execution wasn't up to our standard across the enterprise and we, as a senior management team and across the organization, really re-dedicated ourselves to customer service across the organization and on the commercial side, the biggest thing that we've done is we've enhanced the engagement of the local store team and particularly the store manager. They own that business. They have to own that business. Many of them grew up with retail only as their strength. And so, as we've matured in this business, they're getting more and more involved and I think that's leading to our success.","Simeon Gutman","And if we drill down, if you look at sales per account or the number of accounts that you're selling to from a commercial standpoint, if you look at geography, if you look at stores that are benefiting more from mega hubs, is there anything that distinguishes how the step up is occurring or where it's occurring?","Bill Rhodes","Well, I think there certainly are geographies that are outperforming others and that's always the case based upon weather patterns or what happened last year. Probably, the biggest difference over the last couple of years with our commercial business is for -- from -- for 5, 6, 7 years, we were really focused on opening new programs and that's where our sales growth was coming from. As those new program openings slowed down, we had to figure out ways to grow our business in the -- with existing stores and with existing customers and I think that that's where we've been successful. ","I would also say that our traditional up and down the street business has been very strong and that speaks to the same thing, just focused on the customer relationship day in and day out, providing fast deliveries. I think the other thing is more and more the Duralast brand is becoming stronger and stronger in the automotive aftermarket, if you looked at it 10 years ago, a lot of people thought it was a weakness. I don't think there's anybody out there that thinks it's a weakness anymore.","Operator","Next is Michael Lasser of UBS.","Michael Goldsmith","It\u2019s Michael Goldsmith on from Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So, was there a pickup from the impact of inflation during the quarter until the vehicle parts and equipment CPI accelerated in October and are you starting to see prices go up as a result of tariffs? And then just also, has there been any rising prices in the goods you purchased from vendors, as they experienced some of the cost pressures out there like wages?","Bill Giles","That's a great question. I would say that we have seen very moderate inflation overall, but we are seeing a little bit. And so, I would say some of our margin benefit this year continues to be the great work that our merchandising organization is doing at lowering acquisition costs across the board and our ability to continue to pass on retail pricing where appropriate for products that do experience some cost inflation. From a tariff respective, we haven't seen a significant impact on this first round of tariffs. And obviously, the Chinese currency was devalued, so there was some opportunity for us to mitigate some of those tariff increases, but I think our merchandising organization has done a great job of mitigating that. So overall, I\u2019d say, a little bit of inflation, which we think long term will be helpful and continued ability to pass on some retail pricing.","Michael Goldsmith","And then recognizing that weather can have an influence, how does your outlook for industry growth next year compare to a normal year and maybe what would a normal year look like at this point?","Bill Rhodes","I would just -- we don't give guidance. I want to be very careful on that. I would just encourage you to go back and look at what's happened over the last 6 or 7 years. I\u2019ve spent some time about a little over a year ago talking about how tight demand is of our industry's performance and our performance. It just doesn't fluctuate significantly and I just turn you back to look at what's happened since 2013 for instance. 2013 was a bad year with weather and our sales were softer. \u201914, \u201915, \u201816 were stronger, so we'll see what happens.","Operator","Next question is from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse.","Seth Sigman","Bill Rhodes, following up on one of your points, thinking about some of the challenges that you highlighted in the fourth quarter and I'm talking about the product changeovers, the impact from pulling away from that online promotion, I'm just curious if you can elaborate a little bit more on the changes you made in the first quarter and if the issues that you were facing, were those fully addressed in the quarter? In other words, there was no drag on this quarter at all from some of those issues lingering?","Bill Rhodes","Well, we obviously corrected the online promotions about a week and a half before the beginning of our first quarter. So that was up and running the entire quarter and oh, by the way, it was enhanced by our next day delivery program that was in 80 plus markets at the beginning of the quarter and ended in 95 plus markets. So, we had some benefit of rolling next day, but that's not a material driver.","As far as the product category changeovers, most of them had recovered by the beginning of the quarter, but some of them still hadn't and frankly there's still a couple of them that we still have some lingering effects, but the vast majority of it was behind us, as we came into the quarter.","Seth Sigman","And then my question, my follow-up is on the DIY business. One of your competitors had talked about weaker traffic and consumers maybe deferring some maintenance due to higher gas prices and product inflation and obviously that was as of September, but I'm just curious is that something that you guys have seen also and if so, are there any signs that that's starting to reverse, particularly in light of your commentary and optimism for the lower gas prices that you're now starting to see? ","Bill Rhodes","Seth, I would say that that commentary is inconsistent with our experience. And I would also say, I'd add an exclamation point to it and we're talking about a different period of time. This quarter started at the beginning of September, ran through mid-November. That is inconsistent with what we experienced and in fact we spent a lot of time coming into this quarter, talking about the fact that we had those massive hurricanes last year. If you remember, they were significant in all of Southeast Texas, in particular, Houston. ","And then you had the whole South Texas and central or sorry, South Florida and Central Florida were impacted and then Puerto Rico where we have a significant presence, those were all impacted. But we were expecting to have a pretty tough compare coming into this quarter and the performance that we had was certainly an acceleration of the performance that we had in the summer.","Operator","Next question is from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker","First, I wanted to ask you about the commercial business and I was intrigued by something you said that you were just implementing new systems for that business, but they won't really even kick in until the end of the year. So just to be clear, you're seeing an acceleration without even the benefit of those and if that's the case, when do you expect commercial to go over time, as you put in those systems, as you have to sort of target percent of sales or anything along those lines.","Bill Giles","I would say that relative to the systems, I mean, we're always working on some things in order to enhance our ability to be able to do business with our customers on an easier basis, whether that be billings, looking at activity, et cetera. There's a host of things that we're working on today and will likely launch later in the calendar year of 2019. We feel great about the commercial business growth rate that we achieved in this quarter, being up double digits. We still said it's one of the strongest performances we've had in a few years and so we feel good about the momentum and I think a lot of it is really gets back to the blocking and tackling. So the systems will be a benefit, but there's a whole host of other things that we're doing every single day in order to help drive commercial. So we feel good about where we are.","Mike Baker","One more question, just the \u2013 can you tell us your buy online, pick up in store percent of e-commerce where I guess customers are coming in -- for going at 20% discount to come into the stores, what percent of your online sales is that?","Bill Rhodes","We haven\u2019t given a lot of clarity on that. So think about it as three different buckets. Ship to home, our next day delivery program and buy online, pick up in store. Buy online, pick up in store is the largest of those three segments by a pretty significant margin. So yes, it says that the customer needs that trustworthy advice. They need to figure out what do they need to fix, how do they fix it, do they need the tools, do they need to fix finders, all those things, that's what drives them into the store and that's why this is the perfect channel in my opinion for an omnichannel experience, not just an online experience.","Operator","Next we have Chris Horvers of JPMorgan.","Jerry Sullivan","This is Jerry Sullivan on for Chris. Your peers reported seeing some pressure from rising fuel costs. What was your experience with fuel this quarter and if fuel was a headwind to margins, were there any offsets on your delivery?","Bill Giles","Fuel was a little bit of a headwind, it wasn't significant, but obviously, as you see it as we do as well, we're encouraged by fuel prices coming down as of recent. So I think it was a little bit of a headwind in Q1, not significant, not worth calling out, but we hope that moderates going forward.","Operator","Next is Matt McClintock of Barclays.","Matt McClintock","So, two questions. The first one is just the next day delivery, follow up on that. I think you were 80% of cities or the country last quarter. Now, you're 85%. Can you give us a sense of the uptake in terms of consumer interest in that offering that you've seen and is that accelerating and how should we think about that in year 2, year 3. Is this something that will build with brand awareness?","Bill Rhodes","That's a great question and frankly one that I'm not sure we have wonderful answers to, because we're new on this journey as well. Yes, we went from 80% of the US population to 85% of the US population, including Puerto Rico. I would not expect us to get to 100% and I would think that our growth from here would be fairly limited, because you're talking about less dense areas of the United States. Is it continuing to grow? Absolutely. It's also, I would say, a minuscule part of our business today. ","So I don't want to get pumped as up as some massive change in our offering. It is a really good offering for a customer who needs that service and we are certainly the only ones in our sector and frankly probably leading all of retail for a customer to be able to order something as late as 10 PM and have it on their doorstep the next day. But it is again a very small part of our business. I hope it grows and I hope that it satisfies customers and meet some of their needs that couldn't be met yesterday.","Matt McClintock","And then just as a follow up, you did a good job of outlining all the improving macro drivers of the business and optimism as we progress through the year, can you talk a little bit about tax refunds? There's a lot of noise out there about that potentially being a pretty strong positive as we get to that season in the spring?","Bill Giles","I think we're still trying to learn what's going to happen with tax refunds and frankly every year, we are. What's the timing? That seems to be more certain this year than it was a couple of years ago. The real question is, what are people's withholding rates going to be versus the tax credits that they're getting and this is all a brand new world for everybody. So I don't think we have very good visibility into what that's going to mean. At the end of the day, I can't do anything about it except market into it. We will be marketing into tax season, regardless of whether it's bigger or smaller. So that's where we are at this point.","Operator","Next, we have Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","My first question is on SG&A guidance. Previously, you guys had talked about 6.5% to 7% SG&A growth for this fiscal year, excluding the impact of the 53rd week, is that time -- is that guidance still intact?","Bill Rhodes","Yeah. I would say that guidance is still intact and that would be a little bit towards the lower end of that range, but I would say that that guidance is still intact.","Seth Basham","And then my follow up is around the commercial programs. You talked about the engagement of store managers helping drive improvement in commercial sales, can you talk about what you've done to engage them and when you\u2019ve made such changes, including any changes to the incentive compensation structure?","Bill Rhodes","We haven't made any changes to the incentive compensation structure. What we have done and again, you have to remember, we did grow up as a retailer. We were a retailer long before we ever got in the wholesale business and most of our management team grew up as retail first, I call it, when they think, they're fastball, it's retail. So one of the things we don't over the last, I guess, starting in the fourth quarter is, we started getting our store managers to make sales calls directly to the customers. ","So leave the store and go in the shop and make sales calls. In doing so, they certainly get a better understanding of the commercial business, they also have the opportunity to hear from their customers face to face what's going well and where there are opportunities for improvement and that has just driven their engagement at a very different level than it was before. I applaud our team for coming up with this approach and I think it's working at this point in time.","Operator","Thank you. Next line is from Greg Melich of MoffettNathanson.","Greg Melich","I had a couple of questions. One is \u2013 and congrats on the quarter, guys. You mentioned, I think, last quarter that the removal of promotions online had hurt comps by 40 bps. Is it fair to assume that putting them back on sort of gave you that -- part of that reacceleration or does it take time for that to kind of come back? And then I had a follow up?","Bill Giles","Greg, it definitely was 40 basis points. That was the direct portion and I would say it absolutely came right back. So yes, that was a difference. The question that we had that really is very difficult to answer is there's a lot of customers that are going to our website and our competitors\u2019 websites to look for pricing and availability. If we're out there, without a promotion and others are out there with a promotion, does a customer dig deeper into the website, because of a price perception and therefore even though they're doing in-store purchases, do they -- do we get at a disadvantage about not being that promotional effort? I don't know what the answer to that is. So it's definitely at least 40 basis points. It could be more than that.","Greg Melich","And you mentioned tariffs before, could you help us frame that a little bit? It sounds like it's being mitigated really well. What percentage of your cost of goods sold or sales, however you want to cut it, are on the current section 301 list? In other words, if in 60 days or 90 days, if we end up going to 25%, just help us frame what's on the list and what isn't as of today?","Bill Giles","I don\u2019t have a number off the top of my head, Greg, to give you exactly what percentage of our CGS is impacted by the current tariffs that are going. Obviously, you\u2019re right. The next round is going to be broader, if it does happen, and obviously, at a higher rate. So there will be some impact from that. Traditionally, the industry's had a very good track record of being able to pass on increased prices to consumers. So we currently expect that to continue, but we'll wait and see.","Greg Melich","Was the 2.7 comp this quarter, was that all basket or was there some traffic or transaction count growth?","Bill Giles","It's all -- it's predominantly basket. It's not really driven by traffic.","Operator","Next is Scot Ciccarelli of RBC.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually [indiscernible] on for Scot Ciccarelli this morning and really nice quarter everybody. A quick question on the commercial side and you talked a lot about it already this morning, but given the industry trends, I guess, how would you think about or how would you attribute the success particularly in this quarter to longer term factors such as the cyclical recovery versus maybe shorter term factors such as the better weather.","Bill Giles","I wouldn't really chalk it up to either of those. You have to remember, our market share is only 3% in the commercial business and I think what we do dwarfs anything that's going on in the macro environment. And if you look at the succession of our growth the last three quarters, we've accelerated the growth and basically doubled where we were about a year ago. I don't think there's anything in the macro that would be contributing to that. And I also think, I don't want to overstate that it was what we did in the fourth quarter with sales calls or anything else. ","This has been a long standing program to improve our commercial business. If we look at the work that we've done over the last three years on inventory availability, our ability to say yes to our commercial customers needs is vastly different than it was a few years ago. And as I mentioned earlier, the Duralast brand is becoming a really strong brand in the commercial side of the aftermarket. That was not the case years ago, but I think it's more about what we're doing and less about the macro factors.","Operator","And our next question in queue is from Bret Jordan of Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Just about a follow up question on the commercial. It sounded as if a lot of what you're picking up is sort of up and down the street independent, commercial customers as demand here is going out, could you talk about what your mix of that independent versus national account is in commercial.","Bill Giles","Yeah. I would say it's certainly way over 50%. It's the core of our program and we're spending a lot of time and energy building that side of the businesses as the national accounts as well, but that is a healthy part of the business and continues to grow.","Bret Jordan","Any feeling for where you\u2019re taking that share from? Is that mostly the independent distributors that are giving up the smaller commercial customer?","Bill Giles","Let me back to what Bill said before, we have such a very small market share today. We view everything as very green field and with significant opportunities. I'm sure we're taking a little bit from everyone.","Bret Jordan","And Bill, just a question I guess on inflation for next year, obviously, we don't know what the tariffs will amount to, but when you think about just material costs and higher rates on factoring expense, what do you think is sort of a base case for inflation in 2019?","Bill Rhodes","I think it's probably, I don't know for sure, so I hate to get pinned down on a number, but it's probably in the 1% to 2% range.","Operator","Thank you. And that was our last question. Back to you, Bill.","Bill Rhodes","Okay. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted, as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long term shareholder value, we're confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. We thank you for participating in today's call and we'd like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous New Year.

Rhodes","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2019 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website www.autozone.com and clicking on Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. ","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the organization for their amazing efforts to deliver on our pledge. Most organizations have a vision and\/or mission statement, we don't. We're unique, we have a pledge, a pledge to ourselves and more importantly to our customers where we are committed to delivering exceptional customer service where our AutoZoners\u2019 passion and willingness to go the extra mile allows us to deliver the kind of numbers we reported this morning. All credit goes to our dedicated AutoZoners. ","Overall, we were pleased with our performance in Q4. This morning, we will review the major themes for the quarter, specifically we'll talk about our continued success with our commercial business, our monthly sales cadence, and regional performance, the impact tariffs had on this quarter's results both on retails and margins, and lastly we'll report on the success we had on our stated initiatives; customers first, commercial acceleration, omnichannel, leveraging [indiscernible] technology, and yes, we've got it inventory initiatives. Our commercial sales grew 21.1% year-over-year and 14.1% on a 16-week basis, and this was no easy task as we were up against a tougher Q4 comparison last year. It has been encouraging to see our two-year commercial comps build every quarter this year. ","For the quarter we grew 15.7% and 13.4% on a comparable 52 week basis. This growth represented roughly $350 million more in sales versus last year. Our team did a great job on our commitment to growing this business during 2019. While we remain smaller than many of our peers in absolute sales volume, our growth rate has been very robust growing more than three times the industry growth rate. This growth has come from a combination of many initiatives that have been in development for years including inventory assortment improvements, hub and mega hub expansions, the ever strengthening reputation of the Duralast brand across our professional customer base, technology enhancements, increased engagement of our very strong store operating teams, and tremendous efforts on the part of our entire selling organization to artfully and effectively convey our value proposition. ","We also grew our sales per store at a higher clip than we have in the past. Although we are averaging fewer program openings now as approximately 85% of our stores have a program, their productivity has increased steadily. For the quarter, we averaged our highest weekly sales productivity ever at $10,700 per program. And we grew our sales with mature customers at a substantially improved growth rate this year versus previous years indicating our offerings, products, coverage, service, and beyond are improved and have been recognized and rewarded by our customers. Additionally, we grew our up and down the street business faster for the quarter and the year than the overall growth of our commercial business indicating these improvements are being rewarded across all different types of customers. And with more hub stores, improved salesmanship, and product assortment, we have a very solid foundation that we can continue to build on into the future. Congratulations again to our entire organization for their efforts on delivering a great performance in commercial for 2019. Their intense focus on growing this business is absolutely working. ","Regarding our domestic DIY business, while generating positive same-store sales for the quarter, our performance was clearly impacted by slower month of May and a slower first half of the quarter on a two-year basis followed by nice acceleration in the second half. Retail remains a very solid predictable story for us as it is definitely a more mature customer segment than commercial but a steady revenue stream and substantial cash flow generator. In addition to May's weaker performance we saw underperformance out West and across the Southwest. Additionally, we didn't experience the same level of heat, particularly in the first half of our quarter as normal and our heat-related categories\u2019 performance was certainly softer this quarter. ","Finally, we saw some weakness in certain strong Hispanic markets. While it is very difficult to objectively quantify, we have seen this at certain times in the past in select markets when immigration issues are front and center. With the data we have available to us, our DIY share was flat this quarter while commercial grew very nicely. For the fiscal year, we gained share. While our retail business is far more mature than our commercial business, we were pleased with our performance in Q4 and remain optimistic about the New Year and beyond. Our optimism comes from the inventory availability and staffing initiatives that we have in place. Our constant focus on enhancing the customer service experience is making a difference. We believe the wage adjustments we made last October will continue to help us attract and retain high quality talent that can continue to provide WOW! Customer Service. It is important to remember the high touch nature of this business and the vital role our highly knowledgeable AutoZoners play to help our customers maintain and enhance their vehicles. ","Regarding tariffs, on last quarter's call, we went into extensive detail on the lack of SKU to SKU inflation we have experienced historically because products are introduced into our assortments at very low scale; and as they scale, per unit cost decreased due to efficiencies. This is quite visibly evident by our unrecorded substantial LIFO negative reserve. We also noted last quarter that because of the earlier tariffs, we had experienced a small amount of inflation, a departure from the norm due to tariffs. As the new tariffs have been introduced, we have begun to pass those costs on to our customers. As these costs can be significant up to 25% currently on a product and since we use weighted average costing and the costs roll in over time, we have been implementing many of these retail increases in waves attempting to make it less burdensome on our customers. This has resulted in SKu-to-SKU inflation increases higher than last quarter, but still quite manageable. We have not experienced material changes in our gross margins as a result of tariffs, but our prices to our customers have and will continue to increase.","Turning to our omnichannel efforts, we continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting them when, where, and how they want to shop. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites autozone.com, autozonepro, mobile, and ALLDATA. We're investing heavily in the system to support these shopping patterns. We continue to see growth in website traffic and rapid growth in ship to home, next day delivery, and buy online and pick up in store. While representing a very small percentage of our business substantially below 5%, we are pleased with how the customer is embracing all of our offerings. ","Last quarter, we discussed our next day delivery program that allows customers in over 85% of U.S. markets to order as late as midnight in some markets and receive their products at their home the very next day. We continue to expand to more markets, and I would be remiss if I didn't say we are working diligently to further enhance our digital capabilities with our commercial customers as well. The improvements with the online commercial offering will be ongoing as we know we have ample opportunities which once addressed will allow us to make deeper inroads with certain customers that have not bought from us in the past and will allow us to further grow our business with existing customers, many of which are the more sophisticated shops. ","While ship to home, ship to home next day, buy online and pick up in store, and commercial customer ordering are all showing growth and traffic to our online sites is continuing to increase, for our retail business, we continue to see customers primarily doing lots of research online and then coming into the store to receive that trustworthy advice, to have help with the Fix Finder or Loan-A-Tool and host of other services that simply cannot be duplicated online prior to making the sale. ","Regarding our initiatives, we have invested more on our AutoZoners, inventories, and systems with the objective of improving customer-facing interactions. We believe our execution is improving as we intensify our focus on the customer. Regarding our annual operating theme for 2019, Drive for Excellence, we push for a relentless focus on what matters to our customers; exceptional service, fast deliveries, high quality parts and products, flawless execution of changes in product assortments, in-store merchandising, and on and on, some of the areas that we didn't execute so well on in 2008. As part of this initiative, we have challenged our store leadership teams to reduce redundant or non-customer facing activities. While we have identified opportunities to improve the effectiveness of our AutoZoners, we have much additional work to do in 2020. By removing these tasks, we know we can improve our levels of service. This will continue to be a major focus for us next year.","Regarding our inventory initiatives in the spirit of our Yes, We've Got It initiative we continue expanding our hub store network. At the end of the quarter we had 35 mega hub stores and 100 hubs -- 170 hub stores for a total of 205 locations with significantly expanded parts assortments. For the year we opened an incremental 11 mega hubs. We have consistently seen both our DIY and commercial sales expanding markets where hub or mega hubs are added and we will continue to grow the number of hubs. Last quarter we announced that our ultimate target is to have between 70 to 90 mega hubs open across the United States. We have some ways to go and it'll take us a few years to build this out. As a reminder, both our hubs and mega hubs are focused on making available additional coverage to the local markets meaning adding skews that would not have been available locally in our network before. Both the inventory and the hub store initiatives are designed to enhance our ability to meet our customer's needs for coverage and immediacy. ","Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We remain focused on the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customer's needs regardless of how difficult the request.","In regard to our initiatives for 2019 in customers first we have been making technology investments to improve our electronic catalog and point of sale systems to ensure the customer has an efficient and seamless, frictionless transaction. We believe our current and future technology investments will improve our competitive position. We will make our AutoZoners more knowledgeable and more efficient and ultimately will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. While these investments are adding to both operating expense and capital expenditures, we are committed to further investments in 2020 to improve the customer shopping experience. Our expectation is our business will experience ongoing acceleration in technology investments for the mid to long-term. We spent more on development in 2019 than ever before by a wide margin and we remain committed to improving the technology around helping customers in 2020.","Regarding commercial acceleration, we have been investing in systems to help AutoZoners sell more efficiently and customers conduct business with us easier. While we said on last quarter's call most of these initiatives won't be rolled out until late calendar 2019 or even later. Our focus on increasing the engagement of the broader store team and focusing on existing customers is absolutely paying off today. In summary we are pleased with our performance and remain encouraged with our industry strength in both DIY and DIFM and our prospects for the new fiscal year. We believe macro factors such as relatively low gas prices and increasing miles driven remain largely in our favor and we remain committed to growing our market share in both our DIY and commercial businesses. ","Now let me provide a little more detail on the quarter. For the quarter total auto parts sales increased 11.9% in total and we're up 5.2% excluding the additional week of sales, and our domestic same store sales were up 3%. Regionally our Northeastern, Midwestern, and Mid Atlantic markets representing roughly 28% of our store base performed better than the remaining markets. For our fiscal year we opened 209 new stores including 55 internationally and a 152 net new domestic commercial programs. We closed no stores for the year. During the quarter we opened 86 new stores in the U.S. and our commercial business opened 62 net new programs. Currently 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program and the vast majority of our international stores have a commercial program. ","During the quarter we continue to expand in Mexico opening 28 new stores and surpassing the 600 store mark in Mexico, an amazing accomplishment for our team in Mexico. We also opened 10 new stores in Brazil this quarter finishing with 35. We should once again highlight another strong performance and return on invested capital as we were able to finish our fourth quarter at 35.7%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hard lines retailing. However our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors capital. ","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results I'd like to again thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our AutoZoners efforts to again deliver solid results for fiscal 2019. Now I will turn it over to Bill Giles. Bill. ","William T. Giles","Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. To start this morning let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial, and international results. For the quarter total auto parts sales which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores increased 11.9%. However, excluding the extra week of sales total auto parts was up 5.2%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store was $1,809,000 this is up from an average of $1, 778,000 at Q4 ending last year. Total commercial sales increased 21.1% but increased 14.1% on a 16 week basis. In the quarter commercial represented 22% of our total sales and grew approximately $103 million over last year's Q4 on a 16 week basis. ","We are excited to highlight for the quarter our domestic commercial sales averaged $10,700 in average weekly sales per program, the highest quarterly average weekly sales in our history. This was an increase of 10.6% from last year's $9,700 and average weekly sales per program for our fourth quarter, a very strong acceleration. For the quarter sales were $2.5 billion, a great result. We now have our commercial program in 4,893 stores or 85% of our domestic stores. As Bill mentioned earlier we remain committed to gaining market share with our commercial customers and we are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further growth sales and market share.","Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 28 new stores during the fourth quarter ending the quarter with 604 stores. Whenever I visit our stores in Mexico I'm always impressed by our talented team and how well they have executed our model and in particular embraced our culture. It's always an inspiring visit. Regarding Brazil we now operate 35 stores. Our team in Brazil opened an impressive 15 stores in fiscal 2019 off a base of only 20 stores at the beginning of the year. This took tremendous efforts especially on hiring, training, and developing our newest AutoZoners. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long-term future of this market. While we cannot claim success yet as we are incurring an annual operating loss, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So while challenging, the potential size of the market is significant. ","Gross margin for the quarter was 53.4% of sales down 20 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the lower margin of goods sold primarily from the shift in mix of two more commercial business during the quarter. While our accelerated pace of commercial growth is weighed on our overall gross margin rate we continue to see opportunities to lower our costs through direct sourcing. While we see opportunities to increase our gross margin rate, we should encourage folks to buy similar to recent trends with the pressure from the mix shift to commercial. I do want to stress we remain committed to taking cost out of our business where appropriate and feel we can make improvements from here. Our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment and we've been pleased with our growth driven by the acceleration we've experienced in commercial.","SG&A for the quarter was 33.8% of sales lower by 316 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Last year however we had a large expense for termination of our pension plan. Excluding this $130 million charge from last year's numbers our operating expenses this year were higher than last year but in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter were up 7.6% on an adjusted basis up -- 0.7%. ","On the cost front we highlighted on the last few quarters conference calls the investments we have made specifically wage rates and technology for this fiscal year. The deleverage for this quarter was primarily driven by our planned domestic store payroll investments and continuing IT investments which negatively impacted operating expenses. For the quarter we want to remind financial milers that SG&A dollars will be up similarly as a growth percentage to this past quarter as we began the wage rate investments in the later part of Q1 last year.","EBIT for the quarter was $780 million. Our EBIT margin was 19.6%. Interest expense for the quarter was $61.2 million up from Q4 a year ago with the main difference the extra week. We are planning interest in the $44 million range in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $39 million last year Q1. Our higher forecasts in last year includes our costs associated with the bond issuance we had this past April. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.2 billion or approximately $200 million above last year's Q4 ending balance of 5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR while in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter our tax rate was 21.45% and benefited approximately 105 basis points in our rate from stock options exercised during the quarter. Excluding this benefit our rate was 22.5%. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 we are modeling 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity we remain committed to reporting what the stock option benefits mean to the cumulative tax rate. ","Net income for the quarter was $565.2 million up 41.2% over last year. Our diluted share count of 25 million was down 6.1% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $22.59 up 50.4% over the prior year's fourth quarter. Now adjusting for the extra week this year and the pension expense taken in the fourth quarter of last year earnings per share grew 13%.","Relating to the cash flow statement for the fourth quarter we generated $842 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 4.3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $182 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 124 net new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub, and mega hub remodels or openings work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores open we finished this past quarter with 5,772 stores in 50 states and this is Columbia and Puerto Rico and St. Thomas. 604 stores in Mexico and 35 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,411. Depreciation totaled $118.8 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $108 million. This is generally in line with the recent quarter growth rates.","We repurchased $692 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter versus $665 million in last year's quarter. At quarter end we had $477 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again I want to stress we managed through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each trading firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Next I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 9.5% over the same period last year driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was 674,000 versus 636,000 last year and 688,000 last quarter. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories of accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $85,000 versus a negative $75,000 last year and a negative $58,000 last quarter. As a result accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 112.6%. ","Finally as Bill previously mentioned our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 35.7%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. ","William C. Rhodes","Thank you Bill. We are pleased to report a solid fourth quarter and fiscal year. At 3% same store sales our fiscal 2019 was our best comping year since 2015. For the New Year we must continue to focus on executing at a high level which we believe can and has been a competitive advantage. To execute at a high level we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate we must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. ","For 2020 we have a lot of deliverables from our IT initiatives and we will remain focused on simplifying our store AutoZoners workloads, to reduce clutter and unnecessary tests that get in the way of making the customer experience better for both the Do It Yourself customer and the professional customer. We believe our industry's fundamentals will remain strong as miles driven are expected to increase over the remainder of the year and while there's been many forecast otherwise the vehicle part has continued to age and the internal combustion engine remains the dominant vehicle of choice.","Before I conclude the call I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2019. We were able to build on past accomplishments and deliver some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion, and commitment of our AutoZoners I want to highlight what they as one very strong team delivered in 2019. Both retail and commercial experienced positive same store sales in every quarter. Our total sales grew by 5.7% on a 52 week basis and set an all time sales record at 11.9 billion.","Our commercial sales aggressively accelerated from 7.3% growth last year to 13.4% this year on a 52 week basis with growth in mature customer sales and productivity per program, the highest in our history. We made significant and meaningful investments in our tenured store hourly AutoZoners and it has improved our performance. Research confirms impressively that \"more technicians choose Duralast parts\" and we continue to leverage the power of the Duralast brand expanding into new categories or product types. On the back of a stellar performance of our mega hubs we expanded our vision of the future more than doubling the ultimate plans to 70 to 90 mega hubs.","We opened our 600th store in Mexico and we opened 15 new locations in Brazil off of a base at the beginning of the year of only 20. We continued to accelerate our investments in technology, leveraging technological enhancements in every facet of our business. Leveraging our very strong and predictable cash flow we repurchased a record $2 billion in AutoZone stock in fiscal 2019. Since inception in 1998 we have now repurchased a cumulative 21.4 billion and we have reduced our share count from a 152.1 million to 24 million. Most importantly our team has continued to live our pledge and leverage our unique and powerful culture to deliver exceptional service to our customers who rewarded us with incremental business. ","I'd like to take this opportunity to again recognize and thank our team of talented, dedicated, passionate AutoZoners for what they do each and every day for our customers which expands opportunities for AutoZoners, allows us to support the communities we serve, and ultimately rewards our shareholders. We're excited about our balanced model for growth around domestic retail and commercial, international, online, and pick up in-store. We believe our hubs and mega hubs, Mexico, Brazil, ALLDATA and digital can all grow their top line this upcoming year. To execute at a high level we must adhere to living the pledge, we cannot and we will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and thoughtful execution. Service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will be long into the future. Now we would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Seth, your line is open. ","Seth Sigman","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress this quarter and for the year. I wanted to just follow-up on the point on the cadence in the quarter. You talked about some challenges earlier in the quarter, and then obviously an improvement later in the quarter. Can you just clarify was that specific to DIY or did you also see that trend in commercial? And then as we think about that trend in the second half of the quarter, is that more representative of the run rate of the business and how we should be thinking about the first quarter here, thanks? ","William C. Rhodes","Yeah, fantastic question, thank you. A couple of things; one, weather effects are always more exaggerated in the retail business at least for us at this stage in our development than they are in the commercial business. So commercial will see weather implications, but not nearly to the same extent that retail will see them. So, the ones that we were talking about specifically were more retail oriented. Part of what happened was we had a very late spring, and so May was particularly soft and then June was soft too not on a comp store basis because we had a really strong June the year before. We think July and August were much more normalized, and we hope that they are indicative of what we're going to experience in the first quarter. But we don't know what's going to happen with weather or other effects, but we feel very good about our performance in Q4. ","Seth Sigman","Of course, okay. And then you did mention that prices have started to increase, can you guys give us a sense of the impact it may have had on comps this quarter. And in general, how is the consumer responding in your view. I know you talked about raising prices in waves, but if you could talk about how you're seeing the consumer respond initially, that would be helpful? Thank you. ","William T. Giles","Yes, so far, I would say that we're seeing a good response from the consumers, and I think that the merchandising organization is doing a great job of kind of measuring these increases in as they roll through our weighted average cost. And so, it's still early days, and so I would say that we haven't seen a significant impact from a sales perspective or from a margin perspective necessarily from the tariffs, but we'll continue to monitor and continue to manage it that way going forward. ","Seth Sigman","Okay, great. Thanks guys. ","William C. Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Seth. And our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman your line is open. ","Simeon Gutman","Thanks, good morning. So, I wanted to ask first on gross margin. I have two related questions. So, Bill Giles, I think you mentioned that our gross margins should be similar going forward I think to recent trends, and I think you also said you want to make improvement. So, can you reconcile those two and then in terms of the time frame that we should extrapolate that, is that for Q1 or is that for the whole year? And then as tariffs roll in, does it make it harder to show improvement in that trend line or it all depends on the elasticity? ","William T. Giles","Well, that's a good question. Let me try to unpack that a little bit. We always believe that we have opportunity to improve our gross margin. We're always looking for opportunities to improve sourcing so that we can lower our cost. And then as Bill mentioned before, we recognize that the Duralast brand is an incredibly strong brand and there are further opportunities for us to continue to roll that across other categories as we continue to evolve that brand. Secondly, I would say that I'm thinking more on a shorter-term basis and not trying to extrapolate out the entire year, but as we continue to accelerate our commercial business at a double-digit rate, that's going to continue to apply pressure on gross margin. So that's kind of the way we're thinking about it, and the impact this quarter was around 20 basis points or so. So, we're all about growing the business, we're all about gross margin dollars and EBIT growth, and that's our primary focus, and we'll let the margin -- we will continue to manage the margin hard and we'll continue to look for opportunities to reduce cost. But as our commercial business grows, that will continue to put a little pressure on our absolute gross margin rate.","Simeon Gutman","Got it, okay, that's helpful. My follow-up is on SG&A and I guess trading profit for growth maybe. So you stepped up a lot in fiscal 2019 and you seem to be getting a pretty good return. And you've invested on a steady pace over time. Are you debating whether it makes sense to spend even at a higher rate and trade a little more profit for growth? ","William T. Giles","I would say that the investments that we've made have been very specific and very targeted. So, our investments to this point have been on wage adjustments that we believe were appropriate and we believe we're getting benefit from those wage adjustments. As we move forward, we recognize that we will continue to have some wage pressure mostly from regulatory activity that is taking place across the country. So, we recognize that wages will continue to be a little bit of a pressure point, maybe not as high as it was when we proactively invested in wages. And then technology and that's a smaller component, but it's still an investment. And so, those are the specific areas and we will continue to invest in technology, and as Bill mentioned in our prepared remarks, last year was probably one of the highest years we've spent on technology, and we expect to continue to invest even more in technology as we move forward. So those are the two areas, and yes, you're right, we will play in the environment that we are in and sales have been strong and we've been able to manage our way through that and continue to generate earnings results.","Simeon Gutman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question is from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Zach, your line is open.","Zachary Fadem","Hey, good morning. First one on the commercial growth, curious if you could speak a little more about the makeup of the growth in the quarter, what would you attribute to new commercial programs and then on the comp component to what extent would you categorize the growth as independent mom and pop versus national or regional accounts and maybe could speak to some of the puts and takes here around the various customer categories?","William C. Rhodes","Yeah, terrific question. First of all we were very excited about the growth that we had in the commercial business across all different customer segments. I did say in our prepared remarks that the up and down the street customer which are those small mom and pops grew at a faster rate than the rest of the commercial business. And we want to make that point clear to make sure you know that this is a widespread growth. Our growth in mature customer sales I also said was at an all time high level. So we were very excited about how it came across different markets, different customer segments just across the board which tells us that all the different things that we're working on from getting our store managers and district managers more engaged to the hub initiatives that we've had, to the inventory initiatives that they're all working in tandem which is exactly what we were hopeful of.","Zachary Fadem","Got it, and on the investments you called out for 2020 curious if you could speak a little more about what you're doing differently versus the investments in 2019? And Bill on your SG&A comment I just want to confirm that that we should think about SG&A growth up in the seven and halfish range similar to what we saw this quarter on a 52 week basis. And if there's any extra commentary that you would add on cadence or duration of that spending in 2020? ","William T. Giles","Yeah, I would say that the 7.5% is the right number to think about and give you more update as we move along through the year. But certainly for the next quarter that's the way I would be thinking about it. Relative to what we did last year and how we're thinking about it moving forward and as I said I think we'll continue to invest in wages much of it will be in response to regulatory pressures. And then we will continue to escalate some of our technology investments and they will occur both on the commercial side of the business and the retail side of the business. We have made some good investments on commercial in order to be able to be an easier place to do business with through our commercial customers and provide better service there. And we recognize that there are opportunities on the retail side as well to improve customer service through technology. And then obviously like any mature company we're also changing our legacy systems as we move along and we've had a big effort on that over the last couple of years.","Zachary Fadem","Got it, makes sense. Appreciate the time guys. ","William C. Rhodes","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael, your line is open. ","Michael Lasser","Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my questions. Bill Rhodes historically AutoZone has been mid single-digit operating income grower and buying back enough stock to get double-digit. Now your operating margin has been down [indiscernible] it sounds like between faster commercial growth and domestic investments we should have guarded expectations around the operating margin, were these the near-term. So is this still reasonable to expect that AutoZone can achieve this type of growth algorithm\u2026?","William C. Rhodes","Yeah thanks, another great question Michael. If you look at it over time we had a remarkable streak I believe of 41 straight quarters where we grew at double-digit EPS growth. A lot of things have changed since that point in time while lot of things haven\u2019t changed. We still want to grow our EBIT in the low to mid single digits and with our share repurchase program we hope to push our growth close to if not over 10%. But I don't think we'll have another streak like we had, we had 41 straight quarters. But that's within the reasons of the model. As we grow commercial we will have without a doubt pressure on our gross margins and pressure on our EBIT margins and we are not focused on what is the overall operating model -- margin for the company, we're focused on what are we going to do to grow operating profit dollars at a reasonable growth rate and get very good returns on the capital that we deployed to get that growth rate.","Michael Lasser","And just a follow up to that, you mentioned that things have changed, when you're alluding to that you mean that the business is now being driven by commercial -- transparency if needed or it is both push up your gross margin, what exactly were you alluding about change?","William C. Rhodes","I would say that the changes are really the acceleration of our commercial business and so as we've seen that grow from a mid single-digit to high single-digits to low double-digit that's a significant component of the change certainly that we've seen in the past and that's what we expect in the future. So, from that perspective and back to your margin question is that that continues to put a little bit of pressure on margin but we're all about taking market share and growing the business and growing dollars. And so that's really where our primary focus is and so far we've executed on that on both fronts but particularly in commercial.","Michael Lasser","And Bill Giles can you clarify something for the investment community, there's been a lot of debate about the impact of price increases and inflation in response to tariffs with the skeptics being look the industry is growing fast as it has but it has been pushing forward to completion and more price increases, so the units aren\u2019t growing as fast or the consumer is not responding nearly as positive as it has been, so perhaps within that can you maybe quantify what impact your comp was from inflation and how do you respond to that point? ","William T. Giles","Yeah, it is hard to tell a little bit on the inflation part of it. I mean there's absolutely a component of inflation that\u2019s baked into our comp store sales improvement whether or not that inflation resulted any pressure points from a demand perspective, it's hard to tell. So it's kind of two dimensional there. But look I would say that there is definitely a component of the same store sales that is somewhat driven by inflation but overall it was a healthy growth overall. And keep in mind also that our inventory return is a 1.3 so the costs are coming through at a relatively slow rate. And so we're increasing our retails as we're seeing that cost go through. So, it is a double edged sword. We wish inventory return was faster but in this particular case it's been a little bit of a benefit for us. So we've been able to kind of measurably improve our retail prices in order to offset those costs as we move along and we will continue to do that going forward. So it won't be as lumpy as increasing our retail prices all at once.","Michael Lasser","Thank you and good luck. ","William T. Giles","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question is from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Chris, your line is open.","Chris Horvers","Thanks, good morning guys. Couple of follow-up questions here as you think about the commercial business and the strength that you saw in July and August would you classify this past summer at the end of the day to July and August period as normal and so there's no sort of headwind nor tailwinds as you think about what could happen over the this fall period? And more on the weather as you think about the fall, if we have sort of like a warmer September and October is that just -- does that really have any impact to the business given that it is sort of temperate or could that create a headwind to the business? ","William C. Rhodes","I will start with the second part of it. The weather effects in our business are generally very muted in the fall. There's not a lot of rainfall that happens in the fall generally. The temperatures are maybe warmer than last year but they're not extreme temperatures that would put excess stress on our vehicle parts. So I don't think if we called out weather as a major initiative outside of hurricanes in the past. So if we get a hurricane like we did in Houston or in South Florida then that can be a bigger issue. And what was the first part of your question Chris. ","Chris Horvers","How would you classify the weather this past summer, July-August, June, July? ","William C. Rhodes","I don't think it had a big effect on our commercial business. As we went into and you were asking is there something coming headwind or tailwind, as we went into the fourth quarter the real question for us was how could we lap the accelerated growth that we had last year in Q4. That's really when our growth started to begin to grow or build and we will have the same impact in Q1, Q2, and Q3 where we will be up against stronger and stronger comps. But our momentum has been pretty consistent.","Chris Horvers","So that's my follow up. So obviously May and June did have some moderating impact on your commercial comps but yet you did accelerate the stack. So how are you thinking about modeling that business going forward and your ability to sustain comp stacks against those harder comparisons or even potentially accelerate them, continue to accelerate them? ","William C. Rhodes","I'll go back to one thing that I said earlier in the call and that is that the effects of weather in the commercial business are very small in comparison to the retail business. So I don't want you to think that May and June were very soft because they weren't in the commercial business, they were softer in the retail business but the commercial business has been strong every period of 2019. And what's in front of us we don't know. We don't give guidance but we feel very good about the level of execution that we have, we feel very good about the initiatives that we have in place. So far they worked really well.","Chris Horvers","Understood, best of luck. ","William C. Rhodes","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question is from Bret Jordan. Bret, your line is open. ","Bret Jordan","Hey, good morning guys. I got a question on the tariff side as well but kind of a reversal. I guess we've seen some exclusions granted on one and two and do you have anything for sort of what that might be as far as alleviating some of the tariff pressures and how you might experience some rebating from suppliers who have taken price increases but we'll see those reversed?","William T. Giles","You know Bret to give you an honest answer I don't know the answer to that as far as I don't think it's significant necessarily. It certainly hasn't been something that we've talked about a lot. We have spent a lot of time here so I don't think it's a material number to us. ","Bret Jordan","Okay and then a question on your accounts payable. Obviously we're getting north of a 110% on inventory. What's the upper bound on that, how high can you take that as you build the inventory balances? ","William T. Giles","As we've talked about this in the last several quarters maybe year or so I think at some point in time we're trying to maintain that number at around that level. And so as we make investments in inventory and you heard Bill talk about it on hubs and mega hubs that we continue to open and that really helps drive a little bit of our overall inventory balance. But it does get inventory closer to the customer and it benefits both the retail and the commercial side of the business. So that's what puts pressure a little bit on the inventory and you've seen our inventory return go down slightly over time from 1.5, 1.4, 1.3 [ph]. And so our goal is really to kind of maintain that accounts payable to inventory balance at around that level. And we'll be able to -- may be able to improve it slightly but our objective is really to maintain it around that level.","Bret Jordan","Right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question is from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Scot, your line is open. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Hey guys, Scot Ciccarelli. I know you have made a lot of changes to the commercial business over the last few years especially on the product availability side. I also know you got your store managers much more involved really over the last year in trying to cultivate some of those relationships. So operationally can you help us understand specifically how the store managers have become more involved on the commercial front and is that something that starts to slow now that you're kind of reaching the anniversary point of that or do you think you can maintain that double-digit growth rate in commercial because that's something that builds over time? Thanks.","William C. Rhodes","Thank you Scot. We believe that our store managers and our district managers are much more involved in the commercial business today than ever before. We started with our store managers beginning to make sales calls in the fourth quarter of last year and they're out making sales calls. But the real thing that they're doing is they're learning from the customer what's important to them and they're learning how we are executing it. When they get back to the store with their teams they can do what they do like nobody else. They can enhance our service for our customers. Before because they didn't have a direct connection to those commercial customers they really didn't know where our service advantages were and they didn't know where our service shortcomings were coming from. Now they have direct line of sight to that. I think we had a significant benefit out of that last year. I think we will continue to benefit from that for the next few years as some of them got very quickly -- got up to speed very quickly, others not so quickly. And they're all in different places on their understanding of the commercial business and their comfort with the commercial business. ","Scot Ciccarelli","So, there should be a pretty long tail to it sounds like. I appreciate it, thanks. ","William C. Rhodes","I would think so. It is the first time we've done it so we don't have empirical evidence that said that it has a three tail on it. But as I'm out in the stores and I'm talking to the commercial or to the store managers their level of knowledge is vastly different than it was 18 months ago. And that's what gets me excited.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it, thanks Bill. ","William C. Rhodes","Alright, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. There is no more time for the question-and-answer. I will turn the call over back to Mr. Bill Rhodes. ","William C. Rhodes","Before we conclude the call I want to take a moment and call out that we are hosting our National Sales Meeting here in Memphis this week. This week we will be recognizing our company's very best performers and announce our new operating theme for the year. We will celebrate this past year's successes and focus on where we didn't meet our objectives. This week is for our field AutoZoners and we enthusiastically welcome them to our hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. As our business model continues to be solid and we're excited about the New Year we don't take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We will continue to execute on our game plan but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we're confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. Thank you all very much for your interest in our company and for participating on today's call. Have a great day.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Rhodes","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2014 First Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another very solid quarter. This morning, we reported our 29th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. That's an amazing accomplishment, and it highlights the consistency in our industry, our impressive business model and most importantly, the dedication and superior execution of our team of more than 70,000 passionate AutoZoners.","Regarding the quarter, we've embarked on several key initiatives and tests and we are proceeding aggressively. As we discussed in our last quarterly call, we are testing several new inventory initiatives. I also mentioned we would be introducing a new version of Z-net that has now been deployed.","Over the last couple of years, we've reset our expectations in regard to technology investments in an effort to leverage technology to enhance the customer experience and leverage operating efficiencies. The enhanced Z-net is the first of those efforts to be implemented.","Finally, I mentioned our goal is and remains to be growing market share in 2014 while continuing to deliver solid earnings. Our organization understands the importance of balancing investments and returns, and we have to invest our time and capital accordingly.","Over the last several months, we have significantly increased the pace of strategic assessments, design of potential enhancements, deployment of tests and implementation of new concepts or initiatives. This is vitally important work. It is intellectually stimulating but it's also very hard work.","I want to say a special thank you to the many AutoZoners across the organization who have redoubled their efforts to complete these very important efforts. Each of these AutoZoners has a full-time job in addition to this work. They have worked very hard, are doing a great job and are leaving no stone unturned. Their pace of progress has been amazing to me.","For the quarter, we reported a total sales increase of 5.1% while same-store sales were up 0.9%. This overall sales performance was generally consistent with our Q4 results, but our DIY performance was a bit worse than Q4. Part of the deterioration in DIY was due to a calendar shift resulting from our 53rd week. Our DIY same-store sales would have been 87 basis points higher if we were comparing to the same weeks last year.","In Retail, we experienced stronger trends in our failure-related categories, while we saw weaker trends in the sales floor and more discretionary categories. These trends were pretty consistent nationally.","In Commercial, our business accelerated nicely and the trends were generally consistent throughout the quarter and regionally. Our Commercial business is predominantly a hard parts business and consistent with our DIY results, these categories also performed well in Commercial during the quarter.","Our consumer remains under pressure. We have yet to anniversary the reinstatement of payroll taxes, which occurred at the beginning of the calendar year and the government shutdown during the quarter was not helpful. However, there are some macro factors that have been helpful. Gas prices have begun to abate and we believe this can have a positive effect on our customer's ability to spend on routine maintenance. With approximately 10 billion gallons of gasoline consumed monthly in the U.S., any sizable move in price can have a material stimulus on the economy.","Currently, gas prices are approximately $3.30 a gallon or about $0.15 a gallon below last year at this time. As we are heading into what is forecast to be a more normal winter weather pattern, we are optimistic. We would assume the most pronounced effects would be felt in the Midwest and Northeast markets.","We mentioned during our last quarterly conference call that we lost some share in retail. I'm pleased to report today our data is telling us we're slightly gaining share in retail. While the data reflects only the last couple of months, we feel the initiatives we're working on are making a difference.","We've enhanced our electronic catalog to better serve our customers by further highlighting related items necessary to do the complete job. We believe these enhancements will improve the customer experience and will complement the knowledge of our AutoZoners.","This new system was implemented throughout our domestic store base in Q1. While training on the new system is ongoing, the feedback we are receiving from AutoZoners is very encouraging.","Regarding DIY ticket and traffic trends. Our trend didn't change materially from last quarter. Our traffic counts continued to be challenging, but improved from the trends we experienced from April 2012 to April 2013.","The more significant change from historical trends has been a much slower growth rate in average ticket than we have experienced over the last several years. We haven't experienced the same rate of growth in commodity-based inflation that we have seen in recent years. Currently, we don't see any indications of that trend changing materially in the short term.","While that is very good news for our customers, it has certainly challenged our results. If the winter weather projections come to fruition, that could certainly benefit our traffic trends. Overall, we can't control the macro factors that impact our business and that is why we have intensified our efforts on enhancing our offerings. Ultimately, we control our destiny and we are excited about the many initiatives we have underway or intent.","We're pleased with the progress we are making in our Commercial business, which showed an acceleration in growth versus last quarter. Our sales increased 13.9% from last year's first quarter. And as you can see, we opened more programs this quarter. The 125 programs we opened this quarter marks the largest number of openings we've had in a first quarter in the last decade.","While some of these openings simply reflect a pulling forward of program openings from Q2, we expect to open a similar number of programs throughout the year as we did last year.","Our all other businesses increased approximately 75% over last year as a bulk of this increase was driven by the yet-to-anniversary acquisition of AutoAnything we completed at the end of the calendar year 2012. To remind our listeners, this segment of business includes AutoAnything, autozone.com and ALLDATA.","Regarding all these businesses, we've introduced the idea of being more digitally integrated. As the auto parts landscape continues to evolve, it's important we think more broadly. Therefore, we've made this one of our 4 strategic growth priorities along with Retail, Commercial and International.","We have a tremendous amount of data and content available to us across all of our segments. We are making a priority to combine forces across the board and look at our customers, their opportunities and challenges on a more holistic basis. This remains an early-stage effort, but we believe this can be an important and significant opportunity for us to deepen customer relationships and grow sales.","I'd like to spend a few minutes updating you on some of our newest initiatives and test their focus on improving inventory availability. We have several tests underway at various stages. It is important to note that some of these tests compete against each other as we are working to identify the most economical means of increasing our ability to fulfill our customers' needs.","Our first initiative was tested last spring in summer and it is in the process of being implemented. We have improved our algorithms that determine store SKU placement. This includes adding additional inventory while simultaneously removing unproductive inventory. Net-net, it will increase our store level inventory. In the first quarter, about 40% of our per store inventory growth is attributable to this initiative. We are deploying these new assortments by category and it will take about a year to complete, but the majority will be in our stores by the spring-selling season.","We've also been testing additional inventory in our hub stores. We continue to find the opportunities to add productive inventory to all of our hub stores and we expect this to continue, especially as we further penetrate the highly fragmented and hard parts-focused commercial market.","Additionally, we are testing a much deeper product offering in a select few hub stores and these locations are leveraging that inventory across a wide network of additional hubs and satellites. This allows us to significantly broaden the depth of the product offering closer to the customer.","We are also testing both broader SKU assortment in our distribution centers, as well as more frequent deliveries to both select hub and satellite stores. All of these efforts are designed to assess the most effective way to service our customers' needs and to reduce the amount of unproductive activity we have transferring products from store to store.","It is still very early, but we have learned, as expected, that more inventory closer to the customer increases sales. We don't yet know if it is a wise financial decision or the most economical way to accomplish this objective. That's why we're running these tests. We expect to continue these tests for the majority of this fiscal year.","We will modify some, expand some and likely implement others. Ultimately, we believe we have opportunities to improve, but it is important that we find the optimal solution. We will keep you abreast of developments in this area as we progress.","We continue to execute on our strategies to improve the customer shopping experience. We expanded 8 additional hub locations during the quarter to take our total remodeled hub locations to 100 locations. These remodels entail expanding the size and capacity of these locations, ensuring they're in the right physical location and adding additional inventory into the market that benefits both Retail and Commercial.","We also opened 2 new hubs locations, finishing with 157. Over time, we do expect to open more hub locations, but we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level.","With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past few quarters, we have seen those traded-in vehicles be resold to new owners, who are repairing or enhancing their \"new vehicle.\"","With gas prices declining a bit recently on a year-over-year basis, we believe miles driven can increase heading into 2014. Historically, lower gas prices and an improving economic outlook have led to more miles being driven. We expect that trend to reemerge.","We remain bullish on our industry sales growth opportunities on both the Retail and Commercial fronts over the long term. As the vehicle population remains at an all-time high and consumers continue to look for good values while maintaining their vehicles, we see AutoZone's opportunity to sell to those customers only growing.","Now let me review our operating theme priorities for 2014. Our overarching theme this year is Creating Customers for Life and the key priorities for the year are: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our Commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability.","On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continue with our intense focus on improving execution. With the rollout of our new Z-net software, we spent a great deal of time training AutoZoners on the system enhancements. We've tried to make the system as intuitive as possible, but along with change, we have to spend time teaching and discussing those changes.","We also learned from our store AutoZoners how to improve the way the information is presented on the screen. This mutual respect for operations and technology will lead, in our belief, to a superior selling tool in our stores.","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we finished Q1 at 32.7%. While slightly below last year's Q1 ROIC, excluding the acquisition of AutoAnything, we would have been slightly higher than last year. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retail.","However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce, we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investor's capital.","Now let me turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?","William T. Giles","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our 4 stores in Brazil, increased 3.6% over the 12 weeks.","Regarding macro trends, during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.61 a gallon and ended the quarter at $3.29 a gallon, a $0.32 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased similarly at $0.35 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $3.78 and ending at $3.43 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles and we will continue to monitor prices closely in the future.","We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven data, reported by the Department of Transportation, are available only through September. However, for July through September, the data shows positive trends, up between 1.3% and 1.6% each of the 3 months.","The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-old and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.","Another key macro issue facing our customers today is the reinstitution of payroll taxes back to historic norms. This reduction in our customers' take-home pay began at the beginning of the new calendar year and it has been difficult to objectively quantify the ramifications of this change. However, we believe this is -- and will continue through December to be a headwind to our consumers' spending habits.","For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales for auto parts stores was $1,744,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.","For the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 13.9%. And for the first quarter, Commercial represented 16.7% of our total company sales and grew $43 million over last year's Q1. Last year's Commercial sales mix percent was 15.4%.","As we have said previously, overall, we have been pleased with the progress we are making in our Commercial business, both operationally and financially and we remain on track with our plans. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings and, therefore, we are optimistic about the future of this business.","We believe we can grow revenues in existing stores while opening additional commercial programs. This past quarter, we opened 125 new programs versus 37 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,546 stores supported by 157 hub stores.","Approximately 1,070 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. With only 73% of our domestic stores having the commercial program, we believe there is further opportunity for additional program growth in addition to improved productivity opportunities in current programs.","Further, we recognize that our Commercial sales productivity per program is well below our peers. However, we believe the maturation of our marketing programs, plus the inventory assortment additions we are making, will allow us to close the gap.","As we look forward, we're focused on building upon the commercial initiatives that have been in place for the last few years. We have a very talented sales force and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends.","We've also seen, with our inventory assortment tests ongoing, an improvement in hard parts sales to commercial customers. Historically, we've seen retail sales impacted as much or more by inventory additions to stores. The more recent tests are showing commercial customers are disproportionately taking advantage of these inventory additions. This is exciting to us, as we believe we're on the right track when it comes to our ability to climb the call list to become the customers' first call.","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our commercial programs, having opened over 1,000 programs over the past 36 months. Effectively, 30% of the programs are 3 years old or younger. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share.","Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 1 new store during the first quarter. We currently have 363 stores in Mexico and our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations.","Regarding Brazil, we opened 1 new store in the quarter and have 4 stores opened at the end of the quarter. Our plans remain to open approximately 10 stores over the next couple of years and then reevaluate our development as we refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. At that point, we will talk more on our long-term growth plans.","Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company. In total, our sales were $2,094,000,000, an increase of 5.1% from last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year, were up 0.9% for the quarter.","I will point out here, on a shifted basis, our same-store sales were slightly higher at 1.5%. While this is a larger percentage than the unshifted comp number, we feel over the year, things even out and probably not worth making a large point of. The difference of approximately 0.5 point of comp came from the retail portion of the business, due mainly to losing a summer week comparison this year and picking up a late fall week in November.","Gross margin for the quarter was 51.9% of sales, up 3 basis points versus last year's first quarter. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs that were offset primarily by the inclusion of the recent acquisition of AutoAnything.","In regards to inflation, we have seen modest decreases in costs year-over-year. This is different than in past years. At this point, our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing heading into the calendar year and therefore, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the Retail and Commercial business. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our Commercial business has been the steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have not specifically called out the headwind quarterly. But rather, we recognize that it is an integrated part of our business model.","Additionally, AutoAnything has been a drag on our gross margin as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. As we anniversary our acquisition of AutoAnything during Q2, our margin comparisons will become more consistent. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.","SG&A for the quarter was 33.5% of sales, lower by 5 basis points from last year's first quarter. The slight improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a shift in the timing of advertising expenditures.","I just want to take a moment to thank our entire team for their diligence on cost control, which has always been a key part of our corporate DNA. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.","EBIT for the quarter was $384 million, up 5.6% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 18.3% or up 8 basis points versus the previous year's first quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $42.4 million compared with $41.1 million in Q1 a year ago.","Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,174,000,000 or approximately $370 million more than last year's Q1 balance of $3,802,000,000.","Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While on any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 36.1%, lower than last year's first quarter of 36.8%. This quarter benefited from the settlement of certain discrete tax items.","Net income for the quarter of $218 million was up 7.2% versus the prior year's first quarter. Our diluted share count of 34.7 million was down 7.7% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $6.29, up 16.2% over the prior year's first quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement, for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $357 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $83 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 9 new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2013, our CapEx was approximately $415 million and we'd expect our CapEx to be in line with that for fiscal year 2014.","With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,843 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 363 stores in Mexico; and 4 in Brazil for a total store count of 5,210. Depreciation totaled $55.8 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $50.7 million.","With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $292 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had $177 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our leverage metric was 2.5x this past quarter. Again, I want to stress we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria.","We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 116%.","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $2.9 billion, up 9% versus the Q1 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth, along with additional investments and coverage for select categories. Inventory per store was up 5.4% at $566,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in the hard parts coverage.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 32.7%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. We are pleased to report our 29th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers.","We focus on executing at a high level consistently, which we believe can be a competitive advantage. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.","Before I conclude, I want to reiterate that our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, E-Commerce and Brazil are all very exciting to us. We feel these initiatives will lead to increasing sales for 2014. While our industry sales, according to NPD data made available to us, have been slower, we expect the less robust growth is more from the near-term macro pressures than long-term structural change.","It didn't surprise us that our retail sales results remained sluggish this past quarter as several macro headwinds had yet to lap themselves. Based on our read of the trajectory of the macro influences, combined with our existing and exciting new initiatives, we are optimistic about our sales for the balance of the year.","Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. As we continue to execute on our financial model, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength.","And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief of solid consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, is a formula for success.","We are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.","Before we move to the question-and-answer period, I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize and say goodbye to one of our great leaders. In early January, Harry Goldsmith, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, will be retiring. Harry has provided sage advice to our company and its leaders for the past 20 years, and his contributions have been invaluable. He will certainly be missed. But he has built a strong team that will continue to prosper after his retirement. As we thank him for his service, we want to wish Harry and his family all the best in their future endeavors.","Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Simeon Gutman with Credit Suisse.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bill, just curious what you're thinking in terms of competitive response to some of the changes that are happening around you. Does AutoZone need to accelerate its position in the Commercial arena? Or is it sort of pay-as-you-go and slow and steady as far as just trying to build the business and then benefit from potential disruption?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. All right. I don't know what's going on with that phone. Great question. Simeon, would you mind going on hold if this is on your line?","[Technical Difficulty]","William C. Rhodes","Terrific question. And Simeon, I'll come back to you once I answered to see if you have any follow-ups. There are some pretty significant changes that are going on in our industry. Frankly, when we look at those, number one, we have terrific competitors, both on the retail side and the commercial side across-the-board. And our retail and commercial competitors are going to get better over time. It doesn't matter whether there's a major transition -- transformational acquisition or if they're just out there doing what they do everyday. We will certainly monitor what happens on the landscape. There's a lot yet that we don't know how that acquisition is going to be implemented. We'll certainly monitor and stay close to it. But the bottom line is we have what we believe is a very robust strategy. And regardless of what others are going to do, it's more important that we focus on what we're going to do and how we get better. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, we really have taken on kind of a step-change in looking at new initiatives and tests and we're very excited about those. I think we need to focus on what we're doing and let everybody else do whatever they're going to do. Simeon, do you have a follow-up?","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. One follow-up but it's not to that, it's a different question. I'm sorry if the phone is coming in choppy. So 2013 turned out pretty solid despite some choppiness on the DIY side. Everything is pointing to that maybe we'll see a little bit of a pickup here in the near term. But if we don't, playing the other side of that, if things stay choppy, could the business still see a mid-teens type of earnings growth or high single-digit EBIT growth if the DIY business stays under pressure next year?","William C. Rhodes","Well, I think I'd go back to one of the things that I said towards the end of our comments, is that our approach going in is we're going to grow square footage in the low single-digit range and then grow Commercial on accelerated rate, which we believe is a formula to drive mid-single-digit growth rate in EBIT. And then we're going to add our share repurchase on top of that, which will comfortably get us in the double digits. Whether or not we can grow in the teens or the mid-teens, that's always an uphill battle for us. But I'd say when you step back and look at what we've done over the last several years, we've been able to accomplish that. Following up on that, though, one challenge that we do have this year is the second quarter last year was particularly challenging for us and we very aggressively managed our expenses. As the sales environment has improved a bit, we think it's important that we get up -- get caught up on a little bit of the things that we're behind on as we make sure that we don't slow down the momentum that's building in this. So I think you can look for us to be a little bit less aggressive than we were last year this time on the operating expenses.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","[indiscernible] I guess at the expense of reining in some of the costs, that will stay on plan?","William C. Rhodes","I'm sorry, I didn't hear the first part of that.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","New store growth, new store openings.","William C. Rhodes","New store growth, we're a little bit behind as we enter the year. That's not atypical for us. We'll be on the 150 stores range in the United States and roughly 40 in Mexico and still progressing in Brazil, although that's a little harder to forecast.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC","It's Aram. Chris, maybe I should have you ask the question because I've, obviously, got some problems.","Can you do me a favor and just talk about the gross margin a little bit? Your competitors have made huge amounts of inroads getting gross margin rate closer to yours. And I know you said earlier you don't manage the business to a gross margin rate, but if we were to adjust the income statements for the warehouse and distribution costs that you both include, I would say the O'Reilly's gross margin is probably higher than yours even though they've got a lot more commercial and a lot less private label. Wondering if you can talk about whether you've got an opportunity to improve that over time or if there's some other reason I should think about as to why that spread might exist?","William T. Giles","I think the way we're looking at our gross margin is that we've had some improvement in this past quarter and, frankly, over probably the last 3 quarters on lowering some of our acquisition costs. Clearly, we haven't seen some of the inflation aspects that we have experienced in years past, which helped drive a little bit some of the retail increases, which can be beneficial to gross margin. As we mentioned before, AutoAnything has probably a drag to the tune of 37 to 40 basis points per quarter for the last 3 quarters. So that masked some of the productivity that the merchant organization has done in terms of improving their overall gross margin. And then keep in mind that we're, obviously, growing our Commercial rate -- Commercial business at an accelerated rate, which also, as that we mentioned in the prepared comments, continues to be a little bit of a headwind on our gross margin rate overall. That business gets to be a bigger piece of the pie, but we've dealt with that for several quarters, several years and we've done a good job of being able to demonstrate improvement in gross margin in spite of that. So we look at our gross margins relatively healthy, it continues to grow. I think we're doing a great job from a sourcing perspective. I think we -- our supply chain organization runs a pretty tight ship. We clearly had some headwinds from AutoAnything, but again, we're kind of focused on dollars and not so much the rate.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC","So Bill, I appreciate that comment. I guess I was just trying to make sense more of the level than the pace of change and I just would have thought that kind of level-for-level, that you guys would be, with the private label and the commercial mix difference, I guess I would have thought that you guys would be kind of head and shoulders above but -- so that was kind of one thing. And then the second question I had is around the average ticket moderating. Can you talk to us about kind of the age of the vehicles that your parts are servicing and maybe the size of job if that's been the issue or if it's really more like-for-like price deflation or disinflation?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, I don't think it has anything to do with the mix of products that we're selling based on the age of vehicles. It's really, in the last several years, we had fairly significant inflation in commodity-based products, oil-based products, steel-based products, lead-based products, and really at an accelerated rate over what we've seen in the past. And so we had some fairly significant average ticket growth. That has not only waned, it's basically ceased. And in some cases, as Bill just mentioned, it's going backwards. And so it's put a short-term, or mid- to short-term headwind on the average ticket. We don't think it's something that's structural over the long term once we anniversary it in another couple of quarters. We think it will probably go back to a more normalized rate.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm curious about how you are communicating some of the changes you're making to your business, to your customers. So with the inventory investments, are you messaging that to the Commercial customers? And if not now, do you plan to do that over time, especially as there should be or potentially could be some business up for grabs in the dislocation following some of the M&A activity?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, I think that's a terrific question. Number one, a lot of the changes that we are making are tests, so they're discrete tests in discreet markets. And while we don't want to go out on a macro basis and talk about it, because we don't know if those tests are going to be successful, we don't know what the ultimate outcome will be, the people on the ground in the local market are certainly going out and sharing with their customers what the changes are. Once we finish and I've talked about the inventory availability tests we have going on, it's going to take us about the balance of this fiscal year, I think and we believe, until we have that figured out where we're going. Once we have that solved, then we will have a more robust communication plan and marketing plan, either leveraging our very talented sales force or other mechanisms. But it's too yet -- it's too early yet to do that.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. My follow-up question was on the inflation topic. Given that it's just been such an important theme this year, is there a way you can, potentially, quantify what the impact has been over the last few quarters to your comp? And do you -- how do you expect that to unfold as we enter calendar 2014?","William C. Rhodes","I mean, it's been between 1% and 2% off of its historical norms. Sometimes, in the last couple of years, it's even higher than that. But over what the long-term trajectory of average ticket growth has been, it's been between 100 and 200 basis points off of that. As far as winter debates, we've been dealing with it now in a big way for the last couple of quarters. Once we anniversary that, hopefully, it will subside some and start increasing back at more normalized rates.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first question relates to your comment on advertising spending. I know you spoke about SG&A sort of more theoretically as you thought about the year. You did talk to a shift in ad expenses out of Q1. Can you talk about, perhaps, when and how you intend to redeploy those dollars? And any rough sizing will also be very helpful.","William T. Giles","Yes, I think we probably called down, if I recall, in the press release, it was somewhere around 10 basis points or so. And it's really just a shift, Matt, from Q1 to Q2. So I suspect some of those dollars will be spent more in Q2 and it's really just more of a timing shift than anything else.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And in terms of your inventory investment, to date, the incremental inventory has been basically completely funded by your payables ratio and I guess you have yet to find a ceiling as to how long that can continue. As you continue to build the inventory and it sounds like it's working for you, would you expect to continue to have neutral working capital implications from that decision?","William T. Giles","I think we'll have to see exactly how these tests work out and how much inventory we will continue to add and we will continue to add inventory over the next several quarters. So our -- we would love to have it to be a neutral working capital impact, but we'll have to see how that shakes out. It may have a little bit of pressure on working capital, but I would suspect if it does, it will probably be a year or 2 from now.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then third and finally, you spoke explicitly about your retail or DIY market share and I realize that there might be third-party data sources that made that a bit more accessible to you. The real pickup, to your point, in rate of change seem to be in commercial, where you saw some nice acceleration in the underlying commercial same-store sales. Do you have a sense as to whether that is a market share dynamic for you? Or would that, in your view, relate to some pickup in the market overall?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, I'd say a couple of things, Matt. Number one, we've been gaining commercial share very consistently over a long period of time. Over the last 12 months before this quarter, our rate of growth had slowed in Commercial. That reaccelerated in this quarter. However, on the Retail side, where we had grown market share for 3 years, over the last 12 months, we were not growing market share and we were losing some market share. We began to reemerge with growing market share over the last couple of months. That doesn't make a trend yet, but we're encouraged by it. So I would say it was really a pickup in share in both is what we saw.","Operator","The next question is from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A couple of questions on the inventory build that I think you commented that some of the less productive inventory in the store was being replaced with some of the new inventory. And I guess as we look at maybe expectations on inventory turn, as you're building this, can you offset what in theory, I guess, would be slower-turn inventory because it's the incremental product that it was not the high velocities that you would normally stock. Will you be able to offset some of that slowing inventory turn off the build by taking out some of this unproductive inventory you're finding in the stores?","William T. Giles","I would say, in fairness, probably not completely. I think if we can make a tradeoff in order to be able to have more inventory locally in the marketplace to be able to say yes on a more frequent basis, that's ultimately what we're trying to do. We believe that on a long-term basis, that will improve market share. So I wouldn't say that we are going to do exactly what you just said, but I would not necessarily think that it's going to increase our inventory turn.","William C. Rhodes","I would add one thing too, Bret. As these new algorithms that we've created, we have a high degree of confidence in them. But we're being more aggressive on the inventory adds than we are on the deletes. If we add inventory too early in the life cycle of the vehicle, it's no big deal. It will be in the life cycle 2 years from now. We want to -- we're doing about 1\/2 of the deletes now and we'll come back and do the other 1\/2 next year. So that will also be a little bit of a pinch point for us over the next 12 to 18 months.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And I guess have you said, what you think, logistically you can get personal or inventory updates. It sounds like we're going to build for a few quarters now. I guess, inventory up 9% year-over-year. Is that sort of a growth rate we might see for the next -- for the balance of the year? Or give us a sort of an idea where we might shake out at the end of the day.","William C. Rhodes","I wish I could give you more clarity. The inventory growth that we had this quarter, we said about 40% of it was due to the new rollout of algorithms. We anticipate that will continue -- that portion of it will continue for the next 3 quarters. The big unknown is we have these big tests that were out there trying to understand increasing inventory in hub stores, trying other hubs -- increasing the assortment in hub stores even farther and they will service other hub stores and these daily or -- excuse me, more frequent deliveries out of our distribution centers. We just don't know where that's going to go right now. As we get towards the end of the tests, we will be as clear as we can be with you where that's headed, but it's just too early to make that call right now.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On that -- follow-up to that inventory per store question, is there a way to track how much of that inventory investment, let's say, attributed to Commercial comps or DIY comps or overall comps this past quarter?","William T. Giles","Internally, yes. Externally, we wouldn't disclose that necessarily. So we're going to be able to track, what we believe, the lift in sales is for that incremental inventory by channel. But we're seeing, as we always have when we've added inventory, improvement in both sides of the business. So it's not an effort to improve inventories strictly for one particular side of the business. Both Retail and Commercial, both benefit from the increase in inventory.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But you did mention that the Commercial side seems to be responding more to the hard parts. So it sounds like there's a little bit more lift on the Commercial side.","William T. Giles","Well, they're concentrated on the hard parts side of the business, so yes.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And on the DIY share side, is there a way to -- can you look at that data regionally to see where -- were you losing share in certain regions and is that -- is it coming back and stemming and then coming back in those similar regions?","William C. Rhodes","The market share information that we have has changed over the last couple of years. We used to have very detailed information of very broad set of our direct competitors that allowed us to see very granular information at the category level and at the regional level. That went away, I guess almost 2 years ago now. So in that data set, we can only see national information based upon hard parts and nonapplication-specific parts. There is another data set that is a broader group of retailers, includes some mass and other sectors outside of us that's sales floor only. And we can see on the sales floor-only things on a very large regional basis. But because the data is not that big, it's not that helpful for us to dig in on a regional basis.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. And then on the -- that 10-basis-point advertising shift out of 1Q to 2Q, just so we understand, is there more expenses on top of that shift that you're referring to or the pressure on expenses, I guess, versus what you saw this quarter year-over-year. Is it strictly related to advertising or is there also more payroll and other expenses coming in?","William T. Giles","I think the way we articulated is think about the advertising as kind of a standalone and there should be a little bit of a shift from Q1 to Q2. I don't want to anticipate our overall advertising expenditures to be dramatically different this year versus last year in totality, but there may be a shift between the quarters. I think one of the things that Bill was highlighting earlier was that we were aggressive on some of our expense control in Q2 last year that as we look back on it and know some of the things that we're doing now with the initiatives, with a more normalized winter, with a little bit of sales momentum, that we want to be able to keep that in track. And so we're going to manage our expenses mindfully, but at the same time, we're going to want to be able to deliver great customer service and continue to focus on capturing market share.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. And then the last one, just in terms of AP to inventory, I mean, how high is high? Did you ever think that you would get to 115%? Obviously, the inventory per store additions is actually diluting that down a bit, so the underlying trend seems to be higher there. Is there an upper boundary of where you think that number can go?","William T. Giles","Again, no problem. I don't know if there's an upper boundary per se. Although we're mindful of the fact that again, we want to be able to say yes on a more frequent basis. So winning for us is going to be driving commercial sales and driving retail sales and not necessarily getting to a specific AP to inventory ratio per se. I think as we look over time and we determine what the appropriate inventory levels are, it's really going to be a function of whether inventory turns slows a little bit. And if inventory turns slows a little bit, then the AP to inventory ratio will begin to cap out at some point in time and moderate. So we feel great about what we've accomplished. The merchandising organization has done an outstanding job of helping them manage to those kinds of industry-leading numbers and we'll continue to push it. But I don't expect to see a significant amount of upside to that just yet.","Operator","The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","You guys mentioned a moderation in average ticket on the DIY side. But help me understand better what's going on in the Commercial side as you're adding inventory? Are you seeing average ticket increasing? And is that being driven by number of units in the basket or price or something else?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. Number one, we don't focus nearly as much on average ticket and customer account in Commercial. We're trying to bundle as much as we can in every single delivery. And so that can have some fluctuations that aren't necessarily demand-based like they are on the Retail side. What I would tell you is that the commodity piece is certainly a much smaller part of the business than the commercial piece. So the loss of that commodity-based inflation would not be seen at the same -- to the same degree in Commercial.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Understood. I guess the reason I asked is because if you're getting more units from that basket, your profitability on each delivery is probably going to move up. I want to understand, as you make these inventory investments and get additional sales, how does profitability coincide with that incremental capital you're spending and what's going to happen to returns on capital over the next 2 quarters?","William C. Rhodes","We can barely hear you.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Sorry. Let me repeat that. What I'm trying to understand is as you're making investments in inventory, at the same time, you're trying to grow your commercial sales, you're going to make more profitable sales if you had more units in that basket per transaction. And I want to understand that balance. Are you going to see returns on capital moderate over time or are you going to be able to offset that with improved profitability on your commercial sales?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, obviously, any growth that we get into Commercial business is, in and of itself, very additive to return on invested capital. The real question is going to be what comes out of these inventory investments that we make over time. And as I said earlier, some of that's yet to be known. The bigger piece to me on the broadening the inventory assortment is not necessarily that it's additive to the basket. What we're trying to do is be able to answer our Commercial customers' call and say yes every time. And in some cases, it's not about a basket play as it is about getting that next phone call when they have an odd part. And so I don't necessarily think it will be as much about basket as it will be about just moving up the call list for that Commercial customer.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. Lastly, a follow-up on SG&A. You guys mentioned incremental expenses in the next quarter. Does -- do any of those expenses have to do with plans for the Affordable Care Act? Did you make any changes to the way your labor mix is between part-time and full-time or do anything else that might impact your health care costs going forward?","William T. Giles","That's a good question. No, we're not really doing anything structurally in response to the Affordable Health Care Act. I would say that overall, though, in the short term, we expect to have some increase in costs as a result of the act. I don't think it's going to be material. We're more interested to see how the legislation plays itself out over the next couple of years. I think it will have a bigger impact 2 to 3 years from now than it will for the next 12 months. So we don't expect it to be a big storyline in the fiscal year 2014 for us.","Operator","The final question today is from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I want to start with just a housekeeping one, Bill. The weak shift that impacted DIY, which quarter does that come back in? I assume the second or third quarter, just given the seasons?","William T. Giles","Yes, it will kind of mute itself out over the year, but kind of pick up a little bit of it in the second quarter. It's just that the bigger impact of that fourth quarter, which is the summer month, swapping that out for a November week is the biggest or the most dramatic switch. But it will kind of mute itself out throughout the year.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then another comment you made about the leverage ratio, the 2.5x net-to-EBITDAR, you mentioned that you managed through a credit rating and not a leverage number. And I just wondered if your discussions with the rating agencies have shifted at all, especially given advance and the sort of leverage they're taking on and the rating they've kept while doing that?","William T. Giles","No, no changes. I just wanted to be clear that we want to be at around this BBB stable credit metric. That's what we focus on. Predominantly, each of the credit agencies have their own individual metrics as they determine how they're going to rate us. And so we just used 2.5 as a rounded number for you guys in order to do your models.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the inventory increase, it sounds like your -- I can see why it wouldn't hurt AP-to-inventory ratio today. But if it's slow-turn inventory and you're now buying it, the reason you mentioned 1 to 2 years is that's sort of on the back end. If the stuff hasn't sold in a year or 2, it's because it's slow-returning. Is that how we should think about it when we model it out?","William T. Giles","Yes and just keep in mind that we're talking in test mode at the moment. So we'll determine exactly how much we wind up adding and where it is and what the impact is going to be and have more knowledge about it as we begin to roll it out. And as Bill said, we'll probably spend the next several quarters working through the test, determining what works well. But the quick answer is yes, that would be one way to think about it. If it plays out that way, that if it does slow-turn, it would probably happen a year or 2 from now just given the nature of our overall turn. But again, we're all about putting inventory into the local market in order to say yes on more frequent basis. We want to drive sales.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then lastly on Commercial, sort of to tie that together, if I take the program growth and the total dollar growth, I get that they're pretty much the same. And I know new programs have less productivity. But assuming that, that encompass sort of low to mid-single digit in Commercial, if that's the metric to watch, when would you expect this inventory if the test is working to actually start to inflect that upwards?","William C. Rhodes","I think it's going to take us a while to, number one, get this inventory into the marketplace. As I've mentioned, it's going to take about a year even to get it out there. Once we get it out there than we can have a more comprehensive campaign -- marketing campaign to talk to our customers about it. So I think we need to be careful not to be looking forward in the next quarter or 2. I think it will build over time, but it may not be as material as being able to highlight it at the macro level.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference over to Bill Rhodes for closing comments.","William C. Rhodes","Yes, before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that we have a long and strong heritage of consistent impressive performance. We are currently working on a variety of exciting new initiatives and tests that we believe will enhance our performance over time. Ultimately, our AutoZoners have delivered year in and year out and I'm highly confident they will continue to do so.","Thank you for participating in today's call and we'd like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year.

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their hard work, dedication and commitment this past quarter and year. Our sales results for the fiscal fourth quarter improved from last quarter with May and August outperforming June and July and all months experienced positive comp store sales in both retail and commercial. Sales results as many of you would expect were stronger in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern markets and our harsh winter created parts failures in these markets. Our sales results, however, were noticeably below our expectations in several Western markets. We attribute this sluggishness out west to comparatively mild and rainy weather for much of the summer versus last year.","Our sales performance improved, we have certainly felt we had opportunities to do even better. We executed a significant amount of changes in the second half of fiscal 2018 including product category changeovers, supply chain changes and we stopped our digital ship-to-home promotions. In hindsight, this was a tremendous amount of simultaneous change and our execution while terrific in many areas didn\u2019t meet our standard of flawless and negatively impacted our business. As we enter the new fiscal year most of these are behind us, we are improving quickly. While we continued to gain share, the more robust market share gains we experienced in the first half of the fiscal year subsided in the second half and we are committed to regaining that momentum very quickly. We remain encouraged by the health of the consumer and the health of our business. We are bullish on our business for the New Year.","We continued to make good progress on our initiatives that are aimed at improving our ability to say yes to our customers more frequently, drive traffic to our stores and accelerate our commercial business. To remind everyone those initiatives for the past year included improving local market inventory availability, growing our U.S. commercial business, leveraging the Internet and investing in IT at accelerated rates across the entire enterprise. ","Regarding enhancing parts coverage in the United States, we continued expanding our supply chain network in the quarter adding three new mega hub stores and 78 new stores. In addition to opening two new domestic distribution centers over the last five quarters and expanding another, we are extensively leveraging our hub network to provide expanded parts coverage at the local level where the customer demands are immediate.","As you would expect we study our sales results in markets that receive additional parts coverage with hubs and we see noticeable increases in comp store sales when we open these locations. We rely on our mega hubs to act as distribution nodes for hard-to-find parts for their network stores. We ended the year with 24 mega hubs, have been very pleased with their performance and expect to open many more in fiscal 2019. In our commercial business, we saw our best quarterly sales performance since Q1 2016 improving nearly 9% while having opened fewer than 150 net commercial programs for the year. Our productivity for commercial program was very strong year-over-year. We were encouraged that this growth was from both winning more business with existing customers and gaining new customers. We are gaining momentum driving more sales through existing programs and customers, while still adding new customers all along the way.","And our accelerated investments in technological enhancements to improve our service and grow all of our businesses continues at a strong clip. We are investing at the highest levels ever for our company to deliver on some pretty aggressive internally established goals. One of those goals that we have been focusing on is next-day delivery. At quarter end customers in 83 major metropolitan markets can place in order as late as 10 PM and have their orders delivered by early afternoon the next day. Our expectation is the majority of our shipped home orders will be fulfilled this way in the future. Although this is not a significant part of our sales mix today, it is growing rapidly and we believe it\u2019s another example of providing wow customer service and enhancing our value proposition to our customers. As we gain confidence in our ability to execute we will begin more aggressively advertising this unique and differentiated service offering.","Before getting into more detail about the quarter I want to share our perspective on some of the trends and tailwinds that our industry and specifically our business have seen. First, the customer appears to be getting healthier and the rebound in our industry sales this summer illustrated that improvement. Some of this stems from the cold winter in a large part of the country that in turn increased demand of failure and maintenance related parts. Our business in cold weather markets easily outperformed the remainder of the country with the spread in comp sales between 200 basis points and 300 basis points throughout the quarter. Surprisingly, we did not do as well out west, with comp sales noticeably weaker than other parts of the United States. We can attribute some of this weakness to a milder summer than last year, but we also believe we have some considerable opportunities for improvement. As I had said earlier, our quarter began very well in May. However, it softened in June and July only to reaccelerate again in August. While our overall sales improved for the quarter, we believe they should have been more robust. We had some significant vendor transitions in the second half of our fiscal year and several of those transitions did not go as planned, resulting in unacceptable in-stock positions and sales shortfalls in those particular categories. We have addressed those challenges and feel we are better positioned heading into the new fiscal year. We also believe once these transitions are successfully completed we will be in improved competitive positions.","And as we opened our Ocala distribution center, re-optimized our supply chain and implemented our final multiple frequency of delivery schedule changes that too was a significant amount of change for the organization to absorb and we decided back in February, at the end of our second fiscal quarter, to eliminate online promotions for ship-to-home sales. We were concerned about the potential channel conflict. After several months of being dark in promos, while competitors continued to promote, we became concerned that we potentially were or could negatively impact our customers\u2019 value proposition of us. As a result of eliminating promotions, those direct sales went from adding about 10 basis points to our comp to becoming a headwind in the quarter of roughly 30 basis points or approximately 40 basis points lower comp in the second half of the year. While we were intentional with our removal of the promotions and believe long-term it may create more channel conflict, we recently reinstituted promotions to better assess their overall impact on traffic both online and in-store and overall sales.","Combined, all these various issues negatively impacted our sales performance in the quarter. While we will never flawlessly execute in every aspect of our business, this quarter we believe we had a disproportionate amount of opportunities and believe we have resolved most of them as we begin the new year. Over the last year, we have been highlighting accelerated wage pressures and the impact those pressures have on our operating expenses in the upcoming year. We plan on investing in wages for targeted positions across our hourly store teams this fall with specific emphasis on the most critical positions and our most tenured AutoZoners. It is important to note, those wages changes will go into effect midway through this, our first quarter of fiscal 2019. It is also important to note that means the first full quarter with the incremental expense will be our second quarter, which is always our most challenging profitability quarter. In addition, we accelerated our investments in employee benefits and information technology. These investments will cause operating expenses as a percent of sales to increase. However, we do expect these investments over the long-term to improve our performance.","In fiscal 2018, our results included many moving pieces, the sale of two businesses and related impairments, the new tax law and this quarter, the termination of our pension plan and related settlement charge. Our expectation for 2019 is it will include far fewer unusual items or moving pieces. However, it will include two significant items. In fiscal 2018, we enjoyed only a portion of the lower effective tax rates as our fiscal year straddled the tax reform changes. Next year, we will receive the full benefit and our blended tax rate will decline from roughly 30% to closer to 24.5%. Additionally, we will have a 53rd week and our fourth quarter will include 17 weeks instead of the typical 16 weeks. To model the extra week, I encourage you to review fiscal 2013 and specifically the fourth quarter. We broke out the financials for that week in our earnings release showing how the extra week contributed to the quarter.","To conclude my comments on the macro economy, I would say the consumer is healthy and we think 2019 can be a solid year for us and our industry. Now, let me provide more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, our sales increased 1.3% and our domestic same-store sales were up 2.2%. During the quarter, we opened 78 net new stores in the United States. For the year, we opened 153 net new stores and expect to open approximately 150 domestic stores in 2019. Our commercial business expanded by 8.8%, while opening 149 net new programs this year. Our commercial growth accelerated from last quarter\u2019s 7.3%. We again expect to open approximately 150 net new commercial programs for this fiscal year. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continued to expand in Mexico, opening 28 new stores and we opened 4 new stores in Brazil. While we would hope to have up to 25 Brazil locations open by the end of the year, we expect these stores to open in fiscal 2019. We have been doing business in Brazil since 2013 and we expect to accelerate our location expansions in 2019.","Regarding the internet, we will continue to invest in our capabilities and customer experience. Our goal is to create a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers, meeting them where, when and how they want to interact with us. We remain focused on improving our closure rates meaning converting customer requests for pricing and availability into sales. In the spirit of satisfying our customers, we are making ongoing system investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers\u2019 shopping patterns across all of our platforms both domestically and internationally. We understand we must be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences to meet all of our customers\u2019 needs. We expect our loyalty program and its vast membership to continue to help us mine customer shopping behaviors and grow sales materially in the future. This remains a significant focus for us in 2019.","As our primary objective remains growing our domestic retail and commercial businesses, we continued with our inventory availability initiatives to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts proliferation in this industry. This past quarter, we opened 3 additional mega hub locations and now have 24 in operation. We are working diligently on the development of future sites and we expect to open approximately 10 more in 2019. We now expect to ultimately operate a larger number of hubs and mega hubs than we previously planned. This number will evolve over time. However, we feel a hub network for us is the most efficient way to provide enhanced local market availability. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work, with opportunities for investment and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers\u2019 needs regardless of how difficult the request.","Regarding Mexico, we opened 28 new stores this quarter and ended the year with 564 stores. We are planning to open another 40 stores next year. In the local currency, Mexico experienced a solid quarter, while the exchange rate was a headwind to the reported U.S. dollar sales. The peso exchange rate was 7.3% higher than last year\u2019s Q4 ending rate. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 48% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter due to the divestiture of our AutoAnything business and lower e-commerce ship-to-home sales. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses make up this segment of sales. We recognized that most of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase. And our e-commerce platform represents an important part of our omni-channel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us, the omni-channel experience is very important for our customer experience and we will continue to invest in this platform.","With continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for the industry both in DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle sales are near all-time highs and gas prices while higher than last year remain range sound in the $2.80 a gallon area, miles driven continue to increase. We not surprisingly desire lower gas prices as the lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. There have also been many questions about the impact tariffs could have on our business in 2019. Up to this point, we have not experienced material cost increases from tariffs. As for those SKUs impacted, we have successfully passed the cost along in higher retails. However, a larger number of tariffs are slated to be imposed in the next couple of weeks. These tariffs should be more significant. In the short-term, we expect to be able to manage our way through any changes and we continue to expect to ultimately pass these costs along as the entire industry would be affected similarly.","Regarding commercial, we opened 58 net new programs during the quarter for 149 for the year. This was down from last year\u2019s 202 open programs. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 150 in 2019. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings, we expect that our sales potential from this market will grow. Commercial continues to be the most significant mid-term growth opportunity for the company as we currently have approximately 3% market share and we are determined to substantially grow that over time. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our fourth quarter at 32.1%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be, that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I would like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are to our entire team\u2019s efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers\u2019 wants, needs and desires. All credit goes to our AutoZoners as we could not achieve our goals without their exceptional efforts they give each and every day. We are bullish about 2019 sales potential, because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners.","Now, I will turn the call over to Bill Giles.","Bill Giles","Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which include our domestic retail and commercial business and our Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 3%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,778,000. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 8.8%. In the fourth quarter, commercial represented 21% of our total sales versus 20% last year and grew $59 million over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This past quarter, we opened 58 net new programs versus 99 new programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year.","We now have commercial program in 4,741 stores or 84% of our domestic stores supported by 198 hub stores. In 2019, we expect to open again approximately 150 new programs. As Bill mentioned a moment ago, we remain focused on growing this business. We are committed to having a great sales team supplemented with a stronger engagement of our store managers and district managers. We remain confident with the initiatives that we have and will have in place and we expect we will continue to gain market share in this sector. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well on a local currency basis. We opened 28 new stores during the fourth quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 564 stores in Mexico. We again expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2019. While the exchange rate worked against us this past quarter, the Mexico leadership team continues to do a fine job managing the base peso denominated business.","Regarding Brazil, we opened 4 new stores and currently are operating 20 stores. Our plans are to grow an additional 19 stores over the next year. While Brazil is run at an operating loss, we are encouraged by the sales per store being generated. We expect Brazil will grow its store base and may even surpass Mexico\u2019s store count over time as we prove the operating model produces sufficient returns.","For the quarter, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 53.6% versus 52.8% the same period last year. The increase in gross margin was attributable to the impact of the sale of two business units completed during the year and higher merchandise margins partially offset by higher supply chain cost. Our supply chain expense de-leverage was mainly due to diesel fuel costs being higher. However, there was some de-leverage from the opening of the new DC in Ocala, Florida. We continue to feel we can manage these expense categories throughout fiscal 2019. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.","Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 37% versus 32.6% same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the pension settlement charge of $130.3 million and domestic store payroll. While we incurred significant charges related to the termination of the pension plans in the quarter, we are pleased to have terminated our qualified and nonqualified pension plans, eliminated any future expenses related to those plans and most importantly eliminated all risk associated with the plan\u2019s asset performance. Our team worked at this very hard and did a terrific job on this endeavor.","While our reported EBIT for Q4 is $591 million, our adjusted EBIT calculated by removing the charges related to termination of the pension plans for the quarter was $722 million, up 2% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our adjusted EBIT margin was 20.3%. Interest expense for the quarter was $54.3 million compared with $51.4 million in Q4 a year ago. The higher expense was due to higher rates we are seeing on our variable rate debt. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5 billion or approximately $75 million less than last year\u2019s balance. Our adjusted debt level metrics finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR, while in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter our tax rate was 25.4% versus last year\u2019s Q4 of 33.9% and as Bill said earlier on the call we expect the tax rate of approximately 24.5% in 2019.","Net income for the quarter decreased 7.7% over the same period last year to $400 million while diluted earnings per share decreased 1.6% to $15.02 per share from $15.27 per share in the year ago quarter. As previously disclosed during the quarter we terminated our qualified and nonqualified pension plans that have been frozen since fiscal 2003. Adjusted for the charges related to the termination of the pension plans of $93.7 million net of tax, adjusted net income for the quarter increased 13.8% over the same period last year to $494 million while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21.4% to $18.54 per share from $15.27 per share in the year ago quarter. Our diluted share count of 26.6 million was down 6.2% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement for the fourth quarter we generated $824 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 4.6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $195 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 114 new locations. This quarter capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened we finished this quarter with 5,618 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 564 stores in Mexico and 20 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,202.","Depreciation totaled $108 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter expense of $103.1 million. This was generally in line with the recent quarter growth rate. We repurchased $665 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At quarter end we had $232 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5x. Again, I want to stress we managed to appropriate credit ratings and not anyone metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Next I would like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company\u2019s inventory increased 1.6% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new store openings. Inventory per location was $636,000 versus $644,000 last year and $658,000 last quarter. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $75,000 versus the negative $48,000 last year ear and a negative $48,000 just last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 111.8%. What I would like to call out is that last year\u2019s first quarter experienced several natural disasters that impacted our sales and operating profit results. We called out 50 basis points to 60 basis points of comp tailwinds we received from the storms and $9 million of cost in last year\u2019s first quarter. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 32.1%. We have and we will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now, I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. Before I conclude I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2018. The year certainly was an improvement from 2017, but also didn\u2019t completely meet our expectations. However, our team continued to deliver some very impressive accomplishments and milestones. In recognition of the dedication, passion, innovation, and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that first our sales grew to a record $11.2 billion this past year. We grew same-store sales at 1.8%. We opened 150 domestic new stores and now have over 5,600 locations across the United States. We opened 40 stores in Mexico, a tremendous accomplishment by that talented team.","We are starting to ramp up our Brazilian operations as we expanded to 20 stores in and around Sao Paulo. Our supply chain after some significant changes is only getting stronger and is poised to leverage those improvements. Between the distribution centers and mega hub locations we are beginning to see real sales traction of being able to say yes more than ever before. We expanded our highly successful mega hub strategy opening eight new mega hubs this year ending with 24. And our team has done a wonderful job of introducing new out-of-the-box ideas like our market leading next day delivery option up to 10:00 PM. Most importantly, our customers are visiting our website at accelerated rates and using that research to inform their in-store visits. And lastly we sold two businesses in AutoAnything and IMC to focus our resources on our core business, but we will continue to challenge ourselves our decisions, processes and strategies, we will always invest to reinforce our guiding principles, leveraging our methodologies of evolution over revolution and superior execution with consistent strategy is a formula for success.","We have an exceptional team that executes extremely well. Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level we must consistently adhere to living the pledge, we cannot and will not take our eye off of execution, but we must continually challenge ourselves to think differently and move more swiftly once conclusions are reached. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.","Our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us. We are fortunate to operate in one of the strongest retail segments and we continue to be excited about our industry\u2019s growth prospects for 2019 and beyond. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end delivering strong EPS growth and RIOC each quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last 39 years and we continue to be excited about our future.","Now we would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. One moment please ","Matt Fassler","[Technical Difficulty] will have disruptions at any point in time puts and takes in any given quarter, can you frame the magnitude of what you were trying to get done in this past fiscal year particularly the second half you spoke about the vendor changeover, etcetera, just to get a sense as to whether the ask you made on yourselves was that much greater than it had been in prior quarters, that would be question number one?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. It\u2019s a terrific question, but I knew you didn\u2019t come through that first, but I think I understand it, if I didn\u2019t get it or don\u2019t address it please clarify it for me. I think you got to look at two different things. First and foremost we made a strategic decisions on discontinuing the e-commerce promotions that didn\u2019t have anything to do with execution or transition that was a strategic decision that we made and that cost us about 40 basis point of comp. We want to make that clear, we turned them back on. We will see where we go from here. We did not want to be in a competitive disadvantage position. On the transitions we just in hindsight I think we would look back on and say we took on a disproportion amount and too much in the second half of the year. We always have vendor transitions going on and we always have distribution changes going on and hub stores and mega hubs opening we just had a little too much. And frankly several of these didn\u2019t go as planned. And they were challenging during the implementation. As we get finished with the implementation we are very excited we will be in a better competitive position and in most cases we already are. But it hurts a little bit in that six months period of time.","Matt Fassler","Thanks. And then my second question relates to the next day delivery effort, can you talk about how you are going to fulfill these orders and what is this about what you are doing that would suggest that next day delivery should be proprietary as to you or to your channel and perhaps tougher for pure play e-commerce firms to execute if you think that that\u2019s the case?","Bill Rhodes","I think I have to let you answer the latter portion of that. I will tell you that we have a world class logistics organization that we are working with. We have been working with \u2013 on this for some time. And we are really excited to be in a position to have this differentiated offering out there. How long will it be differentiated, I think that\u2019s yet to be determined, certainly we don\u2019t know, but we are taking advantage of it. I am amazed that our organization from the time we had our first conversation about doing this. We were up and running in a store in six months, that is remarkable and a great sign of the innovation that our team can drive. And now here we are a year later than that and we have it in 83 markets and 80% of the United States population can order as late as 10 PM and get a product on their doorstep tomorrow. I think it just shows Matt that innovation doesn\u2019t only rest on the West Coast, but there is a lot of people that are doing a lot of different innovations and leveraging technologies to improve customer service.","Matt Fassler","Thank you so much. I appreciate it.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Lasser","Good evening. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. At the risk of asking an obvious question, you mentioned Bill that you are bullish on your sales in the industry environment in the upcoming year, does that mean it\u2019s reasonable to expect that you will see an acceleration in both your DIY and your DIFM same-store sales results in the upcoming year?","Bill Rhodes","I think as you know Michael we don\u2019t give guidance, so we don\u2019t leave that you to guys, the experts. We are trying to tell you what we think is going on in the industry. I think Bill was very clear that in the first quarter we have something that we have to lap as pretty significant and that was the hurricanes last year. Unfortunately, we got a large part of Carolinas that are going through that issue right now as well and we are certainly sympathetic towards all the people that are dealing with that. And I congratulate our team out there for doing a remarkable job, taking care of our business and our customers more importantly. But as far as whether or not we are not going up or down from here, think there is a lot of moving pieces and we are not in the projection business.","Michael Lasser","With that being said, what do you anticipate inflation is going to contribute to the industry for the upcoming year both from underlying raw material and cost of doing business going up and then the potential for tariffs as well?","Bill Rhodes","Tell me what the tariffs are going to be, are they going to be 10% or 25%. They are 25% or if things stay for a long period of time that\u2019s going to drive some significant inflation in our industry. And I will tell you over the long periods of time marginal inflation in our business is good. And by the way, we are seeing inflation at accelerated rates in wages. So, we are not scared of marginal inflation, what we don\u2019t want to see is shocks that shock the consumer.","Michael Lasser","Are you seeing inflation pickup as it stands today?","Bill Rhodes","Not materially. The categories that were impacted back in July with the tariffs, certainly those categories have seen inflation. On a broader level, we are not seeing it, but you are seeing it in various parts of the economy. So, fuel prices are up. Wages are up. So we are later in the economic cycle and by the way things that normally happen later in the economic cycle seem to be showing up.","Michael Lasser","Okay, thank you so much and good luck.","Bill Rhodes","Yes, thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good morning. First for Bill Rhodes, I want to talk about the online promotion and the next day delivery. So, you made the strategic decision to drop it and then in the not-so-long-after period it looks like its back with one of the better shipping or next day delivery programs in the industry. Can you just talk about what caused that abruptness? Was it either the mass more tolerable or is there something that you are anticipating in the industry?","Bill Rhodes","I think it\u2019s we have been out there for 5 to 6 months by ourselves. It\u2019s not lost on us that our competitive sales position that we are not growing share at the robust rate that we were for about 8 to 10 months before that decline and we want to make sure and prove to ourselves if it was only the 40 basis points of what was happening with online promotions, I don\u2019t think we would have changed it, but we have got to make sure that it\u2019s not changing the value perception of our consumer as they are beginning the shopping experience. The vast majority of our customers begin their shopping journey whether they buy in-store or online. And so if that was changing the value perception, we have got to make sure that that\u2019s not the case.","Simeon Gutman","Right. And now your offer in theory leapfrogs what\u2019s out there in the marketplace. I mean is that fair or you were expecting this at some point from your competitors anyway, so you just might as well get there?","Bill Rhodes","I think we have a very differentiated offering right now, very different.","Simeon Gutman","Fair enough. Okay. And my second question for Bill Giles, to the extent we can talk about it on a 52-week basis, because you have I think the extra week, can we talk about just EBIT dollar growth? Are you planning for that for next year? I think you reiterated some of the comments around expense growing, but I just want to talk about EBIT dollars in totality?","Bill Giles","Yes, I think that to be honest with you I am just going to come back to the SG&A growth, I think that we had articulated that a couple of quarters ago and it seems as though the Street has digested that in the numbers that that they have got out there today and so no change from that perspective. And I think you guys have to figure out what you believe comp is going to be etcetera and go from there, but I would say that to reiterate some of the things Bill had talked about before is that we do expect to make some of those investments. Some of those are going to be in wage rates and some investment in technology and that will ramp during the year. And a big chunk of that was the wage rates and that will come in play towards the middle to end of Q1 and then in full force in Q2. So think about it that way as you are ramping your SG&A.","Simeon Gutman","Okay, thanks for that and good luck next year.","Bill Rhodes","Thanks, Simeon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kate McShane from Citi. Your line is now open.","Kate McShane","I was curious I think it was mentioned in the comments about the composition of comp growth and wondered if you could you maybe differentiate how DIY versus DIFM did during the quarter, how much was from new customer acquisition or a bigger basket or both?","Bill Rhodes","I would say in the call, number one, we said both retail and commercial were positive every period throughout the quarter or every month throughout the quarter. We gave clarity that commercial grew at 8.8% and we got that growth from new customers as well as existing customers and that\u2019s accelerated from 7.3% last quarter. We are quite pleased the productivity on per program basis was the highest we have seen in some time, the growth in productivity.","Kate McShane","Okay, thank you. And just to nail down the vendor transition piece, can you tell us what the timing was with regards to when it started to get a little bit more aggressive with the transition and when that will end?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. I mean first of all it\u2019s one thing within, there were six or seven of these kinds eventually all happened in different times. But they really culminated over the course of the fourth quarter, had a little bit of the impact in the third quarter, most of the impact in the fourth quarter. We still have a little bit going on now as we are finishing some of those transitions, but for the most part that\u2019s behind us.","Kate McShane","Okay. Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Mike Baker","Thanks. A couple of follow-ups, one the online promotions that you got \u2013 that you did well how \u2013 did that positively impacted your gross margins and so now as you put those back into play should we expect less gross margin gains ahead?","Bill Rhodes","Michael they definitely favorably impacted them slightly. But keep in mind these are relatively low volume in general, so not enough to really move the needle per se.","Mike Baker","Okay. And then the vendor transitions, so you \u2013 thank you for quantifying the impact of the online change to your comps, could you quantify the impact of the vendor transitions?","Bill Rhodes","Michael, we really can\u2019t because it happened in different categories, different weeks, it\u2019s just very, very difficult. We think it certainly had an impact, a negative impact on us in the quarter. We also think it\u2019s pretty much behind us at this point in time, but calling out a specific, it\u2019s very easy on the online promotions we can put back behind that one, this one is more difficult.","Mike Baker","Okay. And then to sort of put these questions together, so presumably they were some one the 56 basis point maybe 70 basis point impact when you consider what you quantified for online plus the vendor issue, that seems to then offset the hurricanes, so is that a fair way to think about it, do you have some positives coming because those disruptions and changes are behind you offsetting the tougher comparison from last year\u2019s hurricanes?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, I have no idea if they are going to perfectly offset, but you are absolutely right, we have some things in the quarter that we believe that we are going to execute better on going forward. We\u2019ve made a change in the promotional activity online and we think that\u2019ll be a benefit. Obviously, we have some headwinds from Q1 last year and then TBD on what the impacts of the current year hurricanes will be.","Mike Baker","Understood. Alright. Thank you for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. First a question on the gross margin outlook going forward, you have had some very nice sourcing benefits over the past few quarters, it looks like the supply chain, the fuel aspect turned sort of negative in this quarter and that offset that, but at the same time the benefit from the divested businesses accelerated, so could you piece those apart? How do you think about that 70 basis points going forward on the divested businesses? How do you balance out, is the sourcing benefit still going to outweigh the fuel supply chain headwind? How should we think about that?","Bill Giles","That\u2019s a good question. I think that basically you are right, we had about a 70 basis point impact this quarter I think it was about 40 basis points, last quarter with just kind of a transition in third quarter. We had 40 basis points. So when you go forward on Q1 and Q2 you would probably have something similar to what you had in Q4 and maybe little bit less. But you are right we did have some headwinds on supply chain specifically diesel fuel, so I suspect that that will continue to be a headwind for the next quarter or so. We continue to make benefits from sourcing, merchandise and organization continues to do a good job of lowering acquisition costs, etcetera. But I think that will probably be a little muted versus what it had been particularly given some of the tariffs that might be coming on place etcetera. So that\u2019s on how I think about it going forward, I think up 70 basis points or so of benefit by not having the two business units and then some headwinds in the supply chain.","Christopher Horvers","Got it. And then in terms of the next day delivery, I think right now it\u2019s free if you spend over a certain amount, how do you think about the cost of that to the consumer going forward, what you are going to charge versus if you had a standard 2-day delivery free over 35 or something like that? And also in terms of the \u2013 is this being sourced from stores and hubs or distribution centers, just curious how it\u2019s being pushed out to the consumer?","Bill Rhodes","So, on the first part on whether or not we will charge for it, we don\u2019t know the answer to that yet. We have charged for it in the past, a marginal amount, $1.99 and free next day delivery. Right now, it\u2019s on there at zero. Right now, we have promotions out there on certain amounts. We were going to work on modifying those over time to find the right sweet spot for our customer and for our business. As for where it\u2019s being sourced, it\u2019s being sourced from the local markets. That\u2019s the only way that you can get it there for the next day. So it\u2019s coming out of those hubs and mega hubs, which is really a great opportunity for us to activate that inventory even better. If you think about it, 3 or 4 years ago we didn\u2019t have any mega hubs. Today, we have got 24, if I might add 10 more next year and that really gives us, it puts us in a very different competitive position going forward.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. Best of luck.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Bill Rhodes","Operator, shall we go to the next person please?","Operator","One moment please.","Bill Rhodes","Operator, is there another question in the queue that we can go to?","Operator","Excuse me. Seth Sigman\u2019s line is now open.","Seth Sigman","Can you guys hear me?","Bill Rhodes","I am sorry about that.","Seth Sigman","My question was around market share, so you guys had talked about market share gains subsiding in the second half of the year. I am just curious was that more about specific challenges that AutoZone was grappling with or did you actually see something different from some of your competitors? And then the other question would be just around the improvement in August as you started to address some of the issues you had earlier in the quarter, did you actually start to see market share gains reverse, start to accelerate again?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. For the latter part of that question, we have not seen August market share data completely yet, although I wouldn\u2019t expect to see it in August. I think we are really improving, I think one of the questions we got earlier was did your market share change from May to June and July. The answer is no. And I want to make this real clear. We continued to gain market share all throughout this, but we had more robust market share gains for 8 to 10 months before the safe February time period. What happened in February? We changed our cadence on online promotions. That clearly impacted us 40 basis points. Did this customer value perception change and did that slow us down too, maybe, maybe not. That\u2019s what we are testing to learn today. And then that\u2019s also when we started hitting these vendor transitions. Our competitors are always great competitors, whether or not they improve themselves or not, I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but I know that we weren\u2019t at our finest during that period of time. And I know we are in the process of correcting that.","Seth Sigman","And Bill, we are talking mostly about the DIY business, because the commercial business has continued to perform pretty well?","Bill Rhodes","No, I think the underlying trends in the commercial business are better. The vast majority of the vendor transitions would have impacted commercial just as much as they impacted DIY if not more, because it\u2019s more of a hard parts business and several of these were major hard part changeovers, which are very complex and very challenging and they just didn\u2019t go flawlessly.","Seth Sigman","Okay. And my follow-up question is on the commercial business specifically, I think there was a period last year where you were using a third-party to help assess the strategy and there was a little bit of uncertainty at that point. Obviously since then, the business has continued to improve. Can you discuss the changes that have been made that you think are helping drive that improvement? And then as you think about 2019, I think you have talked about getting to double-digit growth for the commercial business at some point, what will it take to get there?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, I wish I knew the answer to the last question. We can do it tomorrow if we knew what it would take. I think yes, we did a commercial study, a strategic review of our commercial business and we concluded it about a year ago. It came with some new concepts and we are trying some of those new concepts. And we don\u2019t know if they are going to work yet or not. We are very complicated and we are doing great things and I am proud of our team. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s driving our business today, what\u2019s driving our business today is our inventory assortment changes that we have made over the last 3 years with hubs and mega hubs and improved assortments in the satellite stores. We have also got our store management teams both the district managers and the store managers much more involved in the commercial business so that they are not thinking about DIY first and commercial second that they are coming to work every day thinking, I am the store manager of both the retail and the commercial business. And I think those things are just the blocking and tackling of what\u2019s making the improvements in our commercial business today. I certainly hope to return to 10%. I am very encouraged by going from 7.3% to 8.8%. I am also encouraged by some of the strategic changes that we are looking at but it\u2019s way too early for us to talk about any of those.","Seth Sigman","Okay. Thanks, Bill.","Bill Rhodes","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","Good morning. My first question is around inflation, sorry if I missed this, but did you try to quantify what the impact on your comps for this quarter from inflation?","Bill Giles","We didn\u2019t necessarily quantify the impact from inflation. We think inflation \u2013 there is a little bit of inflation in certain categories, but it hasn\u2019t been significant. Obviously, marginal inflation as Bill talked is helpful for the industry and for us specifically, but we have seen moderate inflation.","Seth Basham","Moderate inflation, okay. And if we assume that the tariffs that are proposed to go through later this month, would you expect that the inflation environment will still be moderate and manageable or do you anticipate some transitional headwinds?","Bill Giles","Well, we think it\u2019s manageable. I mean, one of the things in this industry is that we are very slow churn inventory business. So, whatever tariffs do arrive, we will have an opportunity to see what the impact is going to be on each of the categories, etcetera. And historically, the industry has been very successful in being able to pass those cost on to consumers. So, that\u2019s how we see it playing out.","Seth Basham","Thanks. And my follow-up question is just around the overnight delivery offer that you have now, initially when you put this out you were leveraging FedEx to deliver these packages overnight. Are you no longer using FedEx for this purpose?","Bill Rhodes","I think you can see that we are using a world class logistic operator in FedEx if you look at our website and they have done a wonderful job of helping us innovate on this front-end.","Seth Basham","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matt McClintock from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Matt McClintock","Hi. Yes, good morning everyone. Just real quick follow-up on the tariffs or more broader inflation, can you help me understand the elasticity of price increases for the DIY side versus the commercial side, how to think through that? I would assume DIY would be more impacted, but from a volume perspective, but I would just love to get your perspective? Thanks.","Bill Giles","Historically, we haven\u2019t seen that necessarily. The elasticity is not as great as you might imagine on many of the parts. Also consider that a big chunk of our business is failure related parts. So, those are required parts to operate your vehicle. But, I would say historically, when you look back over time, the elasticity, even on maintenance side and even to some extent discretionary is not as great as you would think.","Matt McClintock","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then just another follow-up on the overnight delivery, is this the missing piece to being able to have a real inflection and broader consumer acceptance of purchasing these products online?","Bill Rhodes","I don\u2019t think there is any silver bullets that are out there. I think this is a normal part of the evolution of leveraging new technologies and new innovations. As we said in the call, this is a very small part of our business and we anticipate it remaining relatively small. It\u2019s growing fast right now and we are going to accelerate it as best we can, but at the end of the day, we believe the omni-channel experience is the most important. We believe coming into our stores and engaging with our incredibly knowledgeable AutoZoners and having them help our DIY customers figure out how to maintain or repair their vehicles, is the most important part. This is just another avenue for us to meet those customers where, when, and how it\u2019s most convenient for them. So, I wouldn\u2019t overdo it, but it is a great new innovation.","Matt McClintock","Thank you very much. Best of luck.","Bill Rhodes","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I will now hand the call back to Mr. Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","Alright. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very, very successful. We thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2020 first quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the first quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the entire organization for their dedicated, passionate service to our customers. I\u2019m routinely reminded of the tremendous links AutoZoners go to meet and exceed the needs of our customers, whether that\u2019s helping a retail customer, determine the cause of their problem, finding an extremely hard to find part for a commercial customer, or an ALLDATA ASE Master Tech walking the customer through an incredibly complicated repair, our AutoZoners across the Americas serve our customers with compassion, care and confidence.","Our AutoZoners intense focus on the customer is the reason that I believe we have momentum and while we were able to deliver solid results this quarter. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in Q1.","This morning, we will review our major themes for the quarter. Specifically, we\u2019ll talk about same-store sales performance across months, regions and customer segments. Secondly, we\u2019ll update you on the initiatives we have in place to drive sales in both retail and commercial, including our ongoing investments in technology and inventory assortments that we believe continue to be a core reason for our sales growth. We\u2019ll also touch on the subject of tariffs and the impact of those on our business.","Our total sales grew 5.7% this quarter versus last year. This was faster than Q4\u2019s growth of 5.4% adjusted for the 53rd week. This growth was in line with our expectations and was encouraging considering we knew we were up against accelerating commercial growth this same time last year.","We gained traction in our retail business, as our DIY sales comp was just shy of 1%. Because of a shift in the timing of our quarter versus last year\u2019s first quarter, we knew this would cause a headwind in the results for our overall comp. But even with the shift, we were quite pleased with our results.","Also, the data we have on market share indicated, we were growing nicely versus the remainder of the market included in this competitive set. We feel we are well-positioned for our DIY business to deliver strong performance for the remainder of the year.","Regarding our domestic DIFM business. Our sales grew 13.6% year-over-year. We were very pleased with this result considering we were up against growth of 11.3% in the first quarter last year. Considering this was the first quarter with a DIFM business had the lap double-digit sales growth, we knew this would not be an easy task.","It has been encouraging to see our two-year commercial comps continue to build our team across the organization, from our sales team to our operators, merchants, technologists, marketers credit team to ALLDATA and on and on, have really bought into providing a compelling, differentiated, comprehensive experience for our customers. And with that approach, we are being rewarded with incremental business in the marketplace by our customers.","While we remain smaller than many of our peers in absolute sales volume, our growth rate has been very robust, growing about three times the industry growth rate. This growth has come from a combination of many initiatives that have been in development for years, including inventory management, our inventory assortment improvements, hub and megahub store expansions, the ever-strengthening reputation of the Duralast brand across our professional customer base, technology enhancements, increased engagement of our very strong store operating teams and tremendous efforts on the part of our entire sales organization to effectively convey our value proposition.","We also grew our commercial sales per store at a higher clip than we did in last year\u2019s first quarter. Although we are averaging fewer annual program openings, as approximately 85% of our stores already have a program, the programs we have opened continue to produce for us.","The first quarter marked our third consecutive quarter of averaging more than $10,000 in weekly commercial sales per program. And we continue to grow our sales with mature customers in mature programs at a substantially improved growth rate, the last two years versus previous years, indicating our offerings, products, coverage, customer service and the ability to enhance the customers\u2019 overall shopping experience are improved and have been recognized and rewarded by our customers.","Finally, our up and down the street business, otherwise known as the independent repair shops, grew faster than our overall commercial business, indicating that the improvements we are making are broad-based across different geographies and customer types.","Our AutoZoners have taken ownership of our success and are adding value to our commercial customers, which has and will continue to have a very positive impact on the business. That said, we believe there\u2019s still considerable growth opportunities for us in commercial, as our market share remains small.","Regarding our domestic DIY business. We generated another positive same-store sales result for the quarter and an improvement in percentage growth year-over-year versus last quarter. Retail remains a very consistent, predictable story for us, as it is definitely a more mature customer segment than commercial, but a predictable revenue stream and substantial profit and cash flow generator. All months of our quarter showed positive DIY same-store sales and we saw our best performance versus the previous year in November.","On a two-year basis, our performance was very consistent each month. Last quarter, we mentioned the sales impact we were seeing with our Hispanic customer base. This quarter, we do not believe this impacted results, either across the country or specifically out in the Western and Southwestern U.S. markets.","Regionally, we did better out West and we\u2019re a little softer in the Northeast. We believe the sales results in the Northeast were being impacted by weather and weather comparisons to last year. Overall, we were pleased with the performance and consistency in our retail business in Q1 and feel good about the remainder of the year.","With that said, as is our historical practice, as we enter our second quarter, we believe it is prudent to remind everyone that weather patterns in this quarter can change significantly from year-to-year and, in particular, week-to-week. The second quarter is always our most volatile quarter from a sales perspective, both positively and negatively. But over time, weather effects normalized, as does our sales performance.","In our discussions with investors, there seems to be heightened questions regarding the stability of our retail business and its trajectory. While we cannot predict the future, we certainly can learn from the past. We have routinely said that our same-store sales generally trade in a pretty tight band and that remains true.","To add a touch more specificity to that discussion, we\u2019ve had periods of underperformance and overperformance in our retail same-store sales. But over the last 25 quarters, our retail same-store sales have been positive for 21 of those 25 quarters.","While many casual observers of our industry believe retail is contracting and commercial is accelerating, the facts according to Auto Care, our industry association do not support that notion. Their data has shown both sectors of the industry with very long-term consistent growth in the low to mid single-digit range, with commercial growing slightly faster. For us, we believe in the health of both our retail and commercial business.","So if we sound upbeat about our sales opportunities for the remainder of 2020, we are, and I\u2019ll explain some of the reasons for our optimism. We have a number of initiatives we\u2019ve been executing. One major ongoing one is availability. Once again, we learned that adding inventory and additional parts coverage matters in local markets.","This quarter, we set records for the highest in-stock position in our company\u2019s history. Congratulations to our supply chain team, merchant and operators. Great work. Additionally, we opened 11 new hub stores this quarter and now have 216 hub locations, 37 of which are megahubs.","We continue to see sales ramping in markets where hub stores are added. We see it, of course, in the hubs themselves, but also in the surrounding market service by the hub. We are seeing these larger stores paying for themselves faster and faster in the maturation curve. And we\u2019re seeing them growing well past the first or second-year open.","Our first couple of megahub locations opened in 2013, and they are still comping above the overall chain comp. We\u2019ll continue to open hubs for the foreseeable future, as we are utilizing them as distribution nodes for hard to find parts, adding to our local market inventory availability.","Hub stores are also helping us with our online orders for next day delivery. It is an efficient way to have and leverage all the product in the local market and improves our ability to meet customer demand, regardless of channel in a very cost-effective manner.","Next, we have been spending a significant amount of time, effort and resources to leverage technology to enhance the customer experience. We\u2019ve invested a great deal in both operating and capital expense to benefit our DIY and DIFM businesses. Our IT spend has comfortably increased by double digits for the last few years.","At the end of the quarter, we began to roll out after a considerable amount of time, due diligence and testing a new point-of-sale system to our stores. This system leverages new architectures and technologies that will expedite the transaction by making the workflow more succinct and logical, with touchscreen capabilities, and will allow us to make future changes much quicker as we replace very old legacy code, all to enhance the customer experience.","We\u2019ve also done some important work behind the scenes that should help our agility by updating our store operating system, expanding the number of available skews our systems can handle and updating our human capital system.","We\u2019re also investing a great deal in our commercial systems as we continue to test these new technology. We remain confident that allowing our customers easier means of doing business with us will help commercial continue to grow at an accelerated pace for the future.","On last quarter\u2019s call, we highlighted what we were seeing with tariffs. We noted that as the result of the tariffs, we had experienced a small amount of inflation, a departure from the norm. As the tariffs were introduced, we began to pass those costs on to our customers. We were successful in negotiating with certain vendors, reducing the impact of the tariffs.","However, we did have to raise some prices. As some of the tariff increases are considerable, in particular, select product lines, we\u2019ve been intentionally passing those costs along in tranches, as we absorb those costs through our weighted average cost accounting method.","If the tariffs remain, we intend to pass additional cost increases on through increased retails. The tariffs has \u2013 have resulted in SKU-to-SKU inflation, which differs from our historical experience. To date, tariffs and their impact on our cost and retail has been manageable and not a significant driver of our business results one way or the other.","Turning to our omni-channel efforts. We continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they want to shop. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites, autozone.com, autozonepro, mobile, the new duralastparts website and alldata.","We continue to see growth in website traffic and rapid growth in our shift to home next day delivery and buy online pick up in store sales. But omni-channel will \u2013 still represents a very small percentage of our business substantially below 5%.","Last quarter, we discussed our next day delivery program that allows customers in over 85% of the U.S. markets to order as late as midnight in some markets and received their products at their home the very next day. We continue to see buy online pick up in store is our largest omni-channel business by a pretty wide margin. This BOPIS model is also growing faster than our ship to home businesses highlighting the importance of our high-touch operating model, where customers place a high value on the trustworthy advice our AutoZoners deliver to them.","Regarding our annual operating theme for 2020 40 years of wow customer service, we continue to push for a relentless focus on what matters to our customers, exceptional service, fast deliveries, high-quality parts and products, trustworthy advice, and flawless execution across the enterprise.","In 2020, we continue to challenge our leadership teams to reduce the time of redundant or non-customer-facing activities for our store AutoZoners. By removing or streamlining these tasks, we know we can improve our levels of customer service. This will continue to be a major focus for us in 2020.","Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with substantial opportunities for advancement and work to ensure we are providing strong returns for our shareholders.","In summary, we were pleased with our performance and remain encouraged with our industry stream in both DIY and DIFM and our prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year. We believe macro factors, such as a relatively low gas prices and increasing miles-driven remain largely in our favor and we remain committed to growing our market share in both our DIY and commercial businesses.","For the quarter, total sales increased 5.7% and our domestic same-store sales were up 3.4%. This performance was generally in line with our expectations, but we did have an unfavorable comparison in sales due to a calendar shift resulting from our 53rd week this past year.","Our same-store sales would have been 68 basis points higher if we were comparing to the same weeks last year. Regionally, the markets West of the Mississippi outperformed the Eastern half of the U.S. The Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic markets were our lowest performance, but we see in our underperforming markets consistent performance on the two-year stack basis.","During the quarter, we opened 18 new stores in the U.S. and our commercial business opened 24 net new programs. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program and the vast majority of our international stores have a commercial program.","During the quarter, we continue to expand our international footprint opening two new stores in Mexico and two in Brazil. We should once again highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our first quarter at 35.5%. We continue to be pleased with this metric, as it is one of the best in all of hard lines retailing.","However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to again thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our AutoZoners\u2019 efforts to again deliver solid results for our first fiscal quarter of 2020.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?","William Giles","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results.","For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores increased 5.8%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,864,000. This is up from an average of $1,792,000 at Q1 ending last year.","Total commercial sales increased 13.6% in the quarter. Commercial represented 22% of our total sales and grew approximately $75 million over last year\u2019s Q1. We are encouraged to highlight for the quarter, our domestic commercial weekly sales averaged approximately $10,600 per program, the third quarter in a row of sales above $10,000.","This was an increase of 10.2% from last year\u2019s $9,600 in average weekly sales per program for our first quarter. And that $9,600 was up 8% over the year before, a very strong acceleration. We now have our commercial program in 4,917 stores, or 85% of our domestic stores.","As Bill mentioned earlier, we remain committed to gaining market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share.","Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened two new stores during the first quarter ending the quarter with 606 stores. We remain committed to open stores for many years to come.","Regarding Brazil. We now operate 37 stores. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long-term future of this market. While we cannot claim success yet as we are incurring a substantial per store annual operating loss, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So while challenging, the potential size of the market is significant.","Gross margin for the quarter was 53.7% of sales, up 8 basis points versus last year\u2019s first quarter. The slight increase in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins. While our accelerated pace of commercial growth is weighed on our overall gross margin, we continue to see opportunities to lower our costs through direct sourcing.","I do want to stress to remain, we remain committed to taking costs out of our business where appropriate and feel we can save on costs from here. Our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total Auto Parts segment. And we\u2019ve been pleased with our growth, driven by the acceleration we\u2019ve experienced in commercial.","SG&A for the quarter was 35.8% of sales, deleveraging 65 basis points to last year\u2019s first quarter. This was in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. On the cost front, we highlighted on last few quarters\u2019 conference calls, the investments we have made, specifically wage rates and technology for this fiscal year.","The deleverage for this quarter was primarily driven by our planned domestic store payroll investments and continuing IT investments, which negatively impacted operating expenses.","EBIT for the quarter was $500 million. Our EBIT margin was 17.9%. Interest expense for the quarter was $43.7 million, up 12.1% from Q1 a year ago, but in line with our expectations. We are planning interest in the $44 million range in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $41.4 million last year Q2. Our higher forecast than last year includes our costs associated with the bond issuance we had this past April.","Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5,287,000 million, or approximately $130 million above last year\u2019s Q1 ending balance of $5,156,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR, while in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was 23.2% versus 21.7% in last year\u2019s first quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate only benefited 33 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 250 basis points. Unfortunately, stock option exercises aren\u2019t predictable and they can come in waves driving substantial fluctuations positive and negative in our tax rate and ultimately in our net income and EPS.","For the second quarter of FY 2020, we suggest investors model us at 23% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises, because we cannot effectively predict this activity we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate.","Net income for the quarter was $350 million relatively flat to last year\u2019s first quarter because it was depressed by previously discussed higher tax rate due to the reduced stock option exercises.","Our diluted share count of $24.5 million was down 6.1% from last year\u2019s first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.30, up 6.2% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Assuming a consistent tax rate in both periods, EPS would have increased 8.3%.","Relating to the cash flow statement. For the first quarter, we generated $447 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5.2% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $101 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 22 net new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and megahub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.","With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,790 stores in the U.S., 606 stores in Mexico and 37 in Brazil for a total store count of $6,433. Depreciation totaled $89.8 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s first quarter expense of $82.5 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates.","Effective the first day of this fiscal year September 1, we adopted the new lease accounting standard that required the company to recognize operating assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. You will see that we have recorded just under a $2.6 billion in operating lease right-of-use assets to the balance sheet, as displayed in our highlights pages attached to our press release. We do not expect this to have an impact on our leverage.","We repurchased $450 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $497 million in last year. At quarter-end, we had $1,277 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again I want to stress, we managed the appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating agency has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total. The company\u2019s inventory increased 9.1% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $694,000 versus $658,000 last year and $674,000 last quarter.","Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis was a negative $71,000 versus a negative $59,000 last year and a negative $85,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at a 110.3% versus last year\u2019s Q1 of 108.9%, a solid improvement.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital. For the trailing four quarters of 35.5%, we have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. We are pleased to report a solid first quarter, delivering 3.4% same-store sales growth, while strong was in line with our expectations. Over the last five quarters or so, we have made incremental operating expense investments in our business with an expectation that we would improve our competitive position and therefore, increase market share in both sectors accelerating our sales growth.","We\u2019ve been pleased with those investments, which were primarily in labor and technology. Our labor investments have resulted in reduced turnover of our most tenured knowledgeable customer-facing AutoZoners. And as we begin to deploy these new technologies, we expect them to enhance the customer and AutoZoners experience.","In fiscal 2019, we shared well in advance that we would have accelerating SG&A expenses, which would lead to reduced EBIT growth for the fiscal year. We delivered on that commitment and slightly overperformed our expectations regarding EBIT in 2019.","As we embark on fiscal 2020, we still have elements of our expense structure that are growing faster than historical rates. But our expectation is to have higher than historical sales growth like we have experienced in the last several quarters.","For fiscal 2020, our expectation is the higher expected sales growth, will lead to EBIT growth rates above the last four quarters and approaching our more typical low to single \u2013 mid single-digit levels.","For the New Year, we must continue to execute consistently at a high level, which we believe is in our line of sight. We understand we must adhere to living the pledge and doing what is right for customers. We cannot take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must keep managing to our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.","For the remainder of the year, we have a lot of deliverables from our IT initiatives and we will remain focused on simplifying our store AutoZoners workloads to reduce clutter and unnecessary task that get in the way of making the customer experience better, both for do-it-yourself customer and the professional customers.","We believe our industry\u2019s fundamentals will remain solid as we see positive year-over-year miles-driven statistics and the aging vehicle characteristics in our markets continued to encourage us about the New Year. We remain focused on growing our DIY business and continuing to grow our commercial business well in excess of industry growth rates.","We believe our balanced earnings and cash-generating model allows us to deliver steady growth as our history suggests. We promised to remain committed to both executing our strategies and getting better every single day. I would like to take this opportunity to again recognize and thank our team of talented, dedicated, passionate AutoZoners for what they do each and every day for our customers, which expands opportunities for AutoZoners, allows us to support the communities we serve and ultimately rewards our shareholders.","Now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Seth Sigman","Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to talk about commercial a little bit. I mean, obviously a lot of progress over the last 12 months. When you look at the growth of commercial, how do we think about growth coming from existing customers versus progress winning new customers? And then as you look out over the next 12 months, maybe you just talk about some of the incremental drivers that give you confidence that you can sustain the momentum in that channel? Thanks.","William Rhodes","Yes. Thank you. Well, regarding the \u2013 where the growth is coming from, I\u2019m even mentioned in our prepared remarks that we\u2019re seeing significant growth from mature customers who happen to be in mature programs.","So most of the growth that we\u2019re seeing and most of the change in the growth that we\u2019re seeing is coming from existing customers that we\u2019ve had, whether they were up and down the street or national account customers. We\u2019re just penetrating those customers much deeper than we were before.","Regarding where we go from here. Obviously, we don\u2019t have a crystal ball. But I will tell you when we look back over this acceleration over the last five quarters, it has not been one thing. It has been due to several different initiatives that we\u2019ve had in place and frankly, been in the works for several years, whether that\u2019s inventory assortment improvements, where that\u2019s getting our store managers and district managers involved, whether it\u2019s they building the reputation and the brand of the Duralast products that we sell, there has been a whole host of different things that we believe have contributed to this growth.","We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the future, but we do know that we have several other initiatives in front of us on the commercial front, particularly technology initiatives that we have not rolled out yet and we\u2019re excited about what the prospects of those initiatives will mean in the future.","Seth Sigman","Okay. Thanks for that Bill. And then just a follow-up question on pricing trends. I think you had talked about raising prices this year in phases or tranches. I assume there\u2019s more starting to come through now. Can you just talk about the consumer reaction, any signs of elasticity? And it sounds like your tone on the consumer overall is very healthy. Just curious what you\u2019re seeing in terms of elasticity? Thanks.","William Rhodes","Yes. It\u2019s really hard to see it. Certainly, in certain product categories, we\u2019ve seen the tariffs come in and they\u2019ve been meaningful. But we have not taken the full cost impact because of our weighted average cost accounting model. So those costs come in over time as the inventory turns. So we have moved our retails up, as I said, in tranches. And when we\u2019ve seen them go up, we have seen some elasticity of demand in certain categories, not a ton.","At the end of the day, when we look at the impact of the inflation in the retails and the elasticity, we don\u2019t think net-net, it\u2019s having a significant impact on our business yet. But again, we still have a long way to go, because we haven\u2019t absorbed all those costs and then who knows where the tariffs go from here.","Seth Sigman","Great. Thanks, Bill. I appreciate it.","William Rhodes","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill Rhodes, in your prepared remarks, you expressed a lot of optimism about the outlook for the DIY business. Is that A, what factors are driving that enthusiasm? And B, do you think that\u2019s more of an AutoZone specific story, or a broader industry story? Because some of your competitors are either seeing decelerating DIY traffic and\/or more volatility in the results of their DIY business?","William Rhodes","Yes. Michael, I would say, I had the same optimism I have had for about 25 years. I believe in the retail business. There \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of people, as I mentioned, that think that the retail business is going away that it\u2019s declining and the commercial business is rapidly growing.","If you go back to our 1991 Annual Report, we are trying to dispute the myth that the retail business is declining. I\u2019m trying to continue to dispel that myth. And the easiest way for me to do is talk about what has transpired over the last 25 quarters. 25 quarters, 21 of them have had positive same-store sales for AutoZone. Now I don\u2019t know what other people are experiencing.","But I also mentioned enough, continued to mention that our retail business, in particular, it does not fluctuate that much quarter-to-quarter. It- our performance is in a pretty tight band. Now this quarter, we did particularly well, especially if you consider the shift, the calendar shift that impacted us, that would have been one of our stellar quarters.","We\u2019re also going to have quarters that aren\u2019t as strong. That\u2019s just the nature of the business, but it trades from slightly down to up one or two points. And it\u2019s been doing that for as long as I\u2019ve been in this business.","Michael Lasser","Over that last 25 years, there has been a market share shift from smaller independent and regional players to the larger players. Over time, should we see more share being shifted between and amongst the larger players just because there\u2019s less consolidation and fragmentation within the market?","William Rhodes","I think you\u2019re going to continue to see it come from those smaller folks, it\u2019s what\u2019s happened overall. When I got in this business, there were about 35,000 auto parts outlets. Today, there\u2019s about 35,000 auto parts outlets. Now a lot more of them are in the hands of us and our close-in competitors. But there\u2019s still a whole lot out there that aren\u2019t by us.","Michael Lasser","Okay. And then my second question is, you\u2019ve deployed a lot of investment, a lot of technology. And I think you\u2019re seeing good returns on that and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving some of the very healthy growth within your DIFM segment. How much more opportunity and you mentioned further technology investments you are going to be rolling out? How much more opportunity is there to deploy investments to generate these types of returns? And should \u2013 how should we think about the growth rate of SG&A dollars, specifically in the next couple of quarters as a result of that?","William Rhodes","As I\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re going to continue to have elevated SG&A expenses. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time working on some substantial new technology-oriented initiatives that frankly you haven\u2019t seen yet. And therefore, we haven\u2019t begun to expense them yet. They\u2019re showing up through the capital expense line. But because we haven\u2019t deployed them, we\u2019re not depreciating them. Those are coming. There\u2019s some on the DIY side, like I mentioned, the new POS system. We also have several on the commercial side that will be coming over the next six months or so.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Good luck and have a good holiday.","William Rhodes","Thank you, too, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simeon Gutman","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just want to follow-up on Michael\u2019s question. I think the first one on the DIY business. Bill, I think you said, we expect the strength or strong results to continue specifically around DIY. I know you don\u2019t really give guidance, especially by segment. But does that suggest that the run rate of DIY should improve going forward, or that the consistent healthy trends continue going forward?","William Rhodes","Yes. What I\u2019m trying to say is, remember, DIY does \u2013 it trades in a very tight band. We had a strong quarter this quarter. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next quarter or the quarter after that. But overall, we believe in the long-term health of the DIY business. That\u2019s the message that I\u2019m trying to make sure that we convey.","I also want to put an exclamation point of something else that I said in the script. And that is that the second quarter is always very volatile. And part of it has to do with when the quarter ends, it ends right around Valentine\u2019s Day, which is when the season shift, when tax refunds begin to hit the marketplace. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the second quarter. It\u2019s always volatile and we just want to make sure everybody realizes that.","Simeon Gutman","Got it. Okay. My follow-up is, you also made a comment towards the ending of the call about how EBIT growth should approach some of that \u2013 your historic rates over time. If you look at the balance right now, where your comps are growing nicely, you seem to be taking share in the industry. You are investing, but your implication that it\u2019s going to approach it over time means that these investments can subside and the top line momentum should continue.","In another way of asking it is why not maintain the current algorithm in which EBIT growth continues to grow steadily maybe at a lower rate and \u2013 but you continue to take market share, which seems like you\u2019re able to do and there\u2019s lots of it. So I guess, how much debate is there? Why not continue a higher level of investment to continue growing at an appropriate rate and as long as the market is giving you credit for it?","William Giles","Yes. I think overall, I mean, our objective, as Bill said, is over the long-term to grow our EBIT at a low to mid single-digit rate. We\u2019ve got a fair number of investments that were current that we\u2019ve made and that we\u2019re currently working on, as Bill highlighted, many in technology. And many, for example, in the hubs and megahubs, which we\u2019ve had terrific results on and we\u2019ll continue to invest in hubs and megahubs, which will also elevate some of our inventory levels as well.","So we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the business as we gained momentum. I think, we have a fairly long track record of being able to manage, both margin and expenses in light of this kind of sales performance that we\u2019re producing and we continue to expect to do that over the long haul.","Simeon Gutman","Okay, thanks. Happy holidays.","William Rhodes","Yes. You too.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matt McClintock from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Matthew McClintock","Yes. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter as well. I was wondering if we could just follow-up on Seth\u2019s question just about commercial \u2013 the commercial business in general. I think, you said that\u2019s the bulk of the gains have been coming from mature markets, mature customers. I was wondering is the growth rate from new customers or the contribution from new customers accelerating as well? That\u2019s my first question.","William Rhodes","I think it\u2019s accelerating as the entire business accelerates. The point that we\u2019re trying to make sure is that the biggest change that we\u2019ve seen over the last six quarters or so has been our mature customer growth has changed significantly.","Matthew McClintock","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, as you look today now that you\u2019ve actually comped the comp or compared against more difficult growth rates within that business. Taking a step back a year ago versus today, would you say that you\u2019re more optimistic about the growth potential for that business than you were a year ago? And meaning, longer-term, do you think that your comp algorithm could actually accelerate from here simply from that confidence that you just sold this quarter?","William Rhodes","Well, our confidence isn\u2019t going to determine whether we\u2019re successful or not unfortunately. I think, we certainly have a higher level of confidence, because we\u2019ve done it for five quarters. I would say more importantly than that, we are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in front of us. Now you said something I want to make sure that I\u2019m not saying. I\u2019m not saying our sales are going to accelerate from here in commercial, I don\u2019t know.","But I feel like we will continue to outperform the industry by hopefully a substantial margin. That\u2019s 10% or 15%, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m really excited about the initiatives that we have in front of us. And the \u2013 basically, the momentum that we\u2019re building in the marketplace from our inventory availability to the power of the Duralast brand to service that our customers are seeing from our AutoZoners just, as I\u2019ve talked to customers, I see a whole different level of confidence that our customers have in us and our ability to service their needs.","Matthew McClintock","Perfect. Thanks for the color. Happy holidays, guys.","William Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Liz Suzuki of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Elizabeth Lane Suzuki","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about private label penetration broadly? And what percentage of your sales is in private label currently? And what the next initiatives are for the Duralast brand?","William Rhodes","Yes. I mean, we feel terrific about the Duralast brand, which is the largest brand \u2013 about the largest brand in aftermarket auto parts and we have over 50% of our sales come from our private label products. And the merchandising organization has done a terrific job of continuing to expand that brand across categories. And it continues to have a very high penetration and it\u2019s very well received by the customers, both on the DIY side and on the commercial side both.","And so our expectation is that we\u2019ll continue to develop the brand, broaden it out, continue to find further opportunities in other categories where we can do further line extensions on Duralast and Valucraft and Duralast Gold brand all together.","Elizabeth Lane Suzuki","And are there certain product categories, where Duralast is not currently high in your lineup of products, and where do you think there\u2019s a big opportunity?","William Rhodes","I think on some of those would be, some of the ones that are more dominated by national brands, for example, in oil and those kinds of categories that maybe they\u2019re already is an existing dominant national brand. But in many categories, we find that there continues to be significant opportunities from both Duralast and other private label products that we have.","Elizabeth Lane Suzuki","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Baker of Nomura. Your line is now open.","Michael Baker","Thank you. Within the margin outlook, it sounds like your sales have been up 5% each of the last few quarters adjusting for the extra week in the fourth quarter and you\u2019re talking about profits up low-to-mid single digits. So I guess that might imply some chance for margins to still be down. Is that right? And can you talk about your expectations of gross margins versus SG&A?","William Rhodes","Yes. I mean, your math is right. And I would say that gross margin, we feel good about. I mean this quarter, we had a relatively flat, I think, was up 8 basis points on gross margin. So we feel pretty good about our ability to be able to continue to manage gross margin. Obviously, we get continued pressures from tariffs, et cetera. But the merchandising organization has done a great job of continuing to find opportunities to lower our costs.","So we feel pretty good about the health of gross margin. And yes, on the SG&A front, we\u2019re going to continue to make the investments that we have made, many of which are focused on wages, as well as technology over the long haul. And so we expect there to be a little bit of pressure on that. But again, as Bill mentioned before, and we\u2019ve mentioned, that our goal is to continue to grow EBIT on a low-to-mid single-digit over the long-term.","Michael Baker","Okay, understood. And then a quick follow-up. Just on the calendar shift, how does that impact 2Q where I think you pick up a February week, but lose a November week?","William Giles","Yes. I think it depends on what happens in that week in February, as I\u2019ve talked about a couple of times already. That particular point in the calendar is very volatile. The last time we had this, it was very favorable to our second quarter results. We don\u2019t know what will happen this time. But we\u2019ll let you know, it could easily be favorable or it could easily be unfavorable, just depends on that \u2013 what happens right around Valentine\u2019s Day.","Michael Baker","Understood. I appreciate that. Thank you.","William Rhodes","Yep. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Zachary Fadem","Hey, good morning. Could you talk a little more about the comp impact in markets where megahubs are added? And how that compares to the overall fleet? And then just as the hub presence matures, could you walk us through the comp trajectory and how those markets tend to perform after the opening?","William Rhodes","Yes. I would say on the megahub markets, I mean, we continue to see good performance out of them and not to dissect it too much. But it depends on how broad the market is and how close then the market is. And keep in mind that we only have 37 megahubs today. And frankly, the vast majority of them are relatively immature.","So I think, we\u2019re still identifying what we believe to be the maturation curve from a sales perspective on megahubs. But we continue to be encouraged by the year-over-year improvements that the megahubs perform. Hubs have a little bit more maturity to them. But again, we\u2019re doing things that are helping drive the business overall adding more inventory, et cetera.","So it becomes a little non-comparable when you look at some of the hubs today versus where they were like maybe five years ago in terms of what we\u2019ve done inside the box to be able to drive sales. So the short answer is that, the maturation curve of both hubs and megahubs is still evolving. We continue to be very pleased with the investments that we\u2019re making and see that the improvements that we can drive and we will continue to invest in that category.","Zachary Fadem","Got it. That makes sense. And could you also speak to the margin trajectory of the commercial business, whether you\u2019ve seen any improvement in incremental margins, as that business has gained scale? And are there any opportunities that you think are out there to drive higher commercial margins now that you\u2019re slowing the new commercial program investments?","William Rhodes","Yes. I would say, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re \u2013 I think the margin for commercial continues to remain healthy and there are obviously opportunities for us to improve margin on both sides of the business. But at the same time, keep in mind, that we\u2019re growing commercial at a rapid rate, but we\u2019re also making some investments and that\u2019s helping drive that. So over the long-term, I would expect margins to improve as some of those investments become more mature. But over the shorter-term, I would expect our margins to remain stable.","Zachary Fadem","Got it. That makes sense. I appreciate the time.","William Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian of Citi. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. This is David [indiscernible] on for Greg. Thanks for taking my questions.","William Rhodes","Sure.","Unidentified Analyst","So I want to talk about the DIY business a bit as well. So if we just take a step back and look at the big picture, so employment level was still strong, coupled with low gas prices across most of the country. So at this point, should DIY potentially be comping at the higher-end of that tight band that you talked about maybe 0% to 1% or so. I\u2019m just trying to gauge where that business is now and what\u2019s the correct run rate for comps in DIY. for where we are in the cycle?","William Rhodes","All great questions. I just keep going back to \u2013 it trades in such a tight band that it\u2019s really hard to say. We certainly think lower gas mileage is beneficial. We think miles-driven increases are beneficial. But there\u2019s so minuscule that they\u2019re just not big drivers of the business overall. We think the most important driver of what happens with the DIY business is what our AutoZoner do to provide great service to our customers. And I think we\u2019re doing a really, really good job of that right now. The morale of this organization of our teams in our stores, in particular, they know they\u2019re winning. They feel like they\u2019re winning. They feel good about it. And I think that that\u2019s translating into better service, which is translating into better performance.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then my follow-up on the expense growth. So up high-single digits again here in Q1 and you\u2019ve been clear that that\u2019s going to remain elevated. But with the acceleration in comp sales we\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters, is there any thought as to pushing on these tech and store-based investments even further and above your initial plans now that we\u2019re seeing the benefit come through the top line?","William Rhodes","Yes, that\u2019s a great question. Most of those investments take time. And so there\u2019s a lot of things in the pipeline. So we might like to accelerate some of them, but there is a certain amount that we can digest as an organization. There\u2019s a certain pace at which we can develop those initiatives. So we will continue to work hard. We will continue to drive them where we can. But I expect it to be a little bit more steady state.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thanks, again, and congrats on a nice quarter.","William Rhodes","Thank you.","William Giles","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Gregory Melich","Hi. Thanks. So I\u2019ll make a count. So first, I want to circle back. Thanks for your \u2013 the incremental on the tariffs. I know we\u2019ve started to see some exemptions coming through and also \u2013 but we still have the timing of pricing through what\u2019s already happened. Could you help us understand, is that any potential benefit maybe from refunds coming from any exemptions on certain products? And then when we think about further price increases, is it just as simple as taking when the tariffs went up and then thinking about your inventory turning once a year as to when that would actually flow through?","William Rhodes","Yes. I think the second part of that is absolutely right, Greg, and it\u2019s going to depend on the categories. Certain categories turn faster or slower than other categories. So as we turn that inventory, the cost or the cost in our gross margin increase. And we\u2019re trying to manage that consistent with how we manage the retail increases.","For the sole purpose of not shocking the system, we\u2019ve had lots of different cost increases over the years for a variety of reasons, whether that\u2019s all based prices going up, lead, steel, whatever the case might be. But when it\u2019s 25%, that\u2019s a significant increase. And so we\u2019re trying to do that over three or four tranches, so not to shock the system and to try to provide the customer with as good value as we can for as long as we can.","So far, I\u2019m very pleased with how our merchants have managed those issues. What was the first part of your question, Greg.?","Gregory Melich","The first part was we started to see some exemptions from the USTR on certain product SKUs. Has that \u2013 does that happen in for you guys on anything material?","William Rhodes","We have filed some exceptions, don\u2019t know all the answers at this point in time. Some of them would impact us in a beneficial way if we were able to get them.","Gregory Melich","Got it. And then on inventory, I know that\u2019s been growing up 9%. Is that a timing issue, or is it just up against a lower comparison? What should we think about that as a normal growth rate back towards sales in coming quarters?","William Giles","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be back towards sales in coming quarters. You have some inflation baked in there as well on the inventory. And then again, I think a couple of points that I\u2019m going to refer that Bill pointed out highest in-stock level ever with a corporation, continued investments in hub and megahubs, again, inventory closer into the customer wins and we\u2019re going to continue to go down that path. We want to continue to maintain our AP to inventory ratio above a 100% and we have successfully. I think that we\u2019ll probably be at this level a little bit lower maybe, but not certainly at a sales growth rate.","Gregory Melich","That\u2019s great. Congratulations, guys, and have a great holiday.","William Giles","You, too, happy holidays.","William Rhodes","Thank you, Greg.","William Rhodes","Okay. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our business model continues to be solid. We\u2019re excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint.","As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we\u2019re confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. We thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. And we\u2019d like to wish our AutoZoners and everyone on the call a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous New Year. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Rhodes","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's Fiscal 2013 First Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another very solid quarter. Although we faced a difficult sales environment, particularly in the Northeast, Midwest and Plains states, our team did a great job of managing expenses while executing great customer service. We are committed to steady earnings performance and efficient capital deployment, and we delivered on our commitments this quarter.","On this morning's conference call, Bill Giles and I will provide color on our initiatives and our domestic DIY, Commercial Mexico and ALLDATA businesses, as well as our efforts in Brazil. To begin, I'd like to highlight the key events during the quarter. Just after our last conference call, we held our national sales meeting here in Memphis. At this event, we hosted our senior field leadership, along with the recognized best and brightest store managers, those we call our President's Club members. We reiterated our objectives to improve customer service store by store and grow our Commercial business.","But we also recognize the selling environment could be challenging for a period of time. We understood the macro factors affecting our business would not be solved overnight. We stressed managing expenses carefully, but not at the detriment of customer service. To this end, our team did an outstanding job with execution. I am very pleased to report we were able to again deliver share gains in both our Retail and Commercial sectors. This data now is only available at a high-level, national basis, but it helps us monitor our progress and we continue to be pleased with the results.","Just a few weeks ago, several members of our team flew to Sao Paulo, Brazil for the official grand opening of our first store in Brazil. Everyone was very excited, as our store AutoZoners epitomized what it means to deliver WOW! Customer Service. I must say, it was so incredibly exciting to see that familiar AutoZone brand standing tall in Sorocaba, Brazil.","Finally, we held our annual sales and leadership council, where we recognized the best of the best at AutoZone. The council consisted of the top 136 sales and operation leaders from across the United States. This team of incredibly talented and committed leaders is amazing to me. Their enthusiasm for their customers, AutoZoners and the performance of this amazing company is infectious. These are the current and future leaders of this organization, and I left that event feeling even more enthusiastic about our future.","Regarding this past quarter's results, Q1 marked our 25th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. We're very pleased with our ability to consistently deliver strong EPS growth through our financial model of steady, mid-single-digit EBIT dollar growth or better, along with high single-digit reductions in diluted share count. Our goal quarter-over-quarter continues to be to provide consistency to our shareholders, our AutoZoners and our customers. We feel this targeted consistency in both financial performance, as well as execution of our key initiatives, results in stability and confidence for our stockholders and AutoZoners.","Next, I'd like to highlight our sales results for the past quarter. Our sales were up 3.5% and our same-store sales were up 0.2%. This quarter, same-store sales results compared to last year's first quarter comps of 4.6%. Our same-store sales results are a combination of both our Retail and Commercial businesses. I should point out, our total Commercial sales were up 12% over last year's first quarter, driven by a combination of existing programs and the addition of 357 net new programs over the trailing 12 months.","Our overall sales performance for the quarter was softer than we'd hoped, but we were not entirely -- but they were not entirely unexpected. Our results were consistent -- were inconsistent from month to month. However, we did finish the quarter stronger than it began, in spite of Hurricane Sandy impacting a large portion of the Northeast.","The substantial differences in sales by regions, like our fourth quarter, continued for us during this first quarter. The 3 regions of the Northeast, Midwest and Plains states continued to track materially below the remainder of the country for the quarter. In fact, 5 percentage points difference in same-store sales between the remaining 7 regions and the 3 affected regions. This slowdown continued to surprise us, as this area of the country has been where a fair percentage of our new stores and new Commercial programs have been opened in the last couple of years.","Certainly, this wasn't the only story affecting sales, but it continues to be a challenge for us. What I can say is we began to see some improvements in these areas after Sandy and it may be directly related to Sandy's effects starting in November. It is nice to be able to say these markets' DIY sales turned positive the last 2 weeks of the quarter.","We continue to feel our initiatives are having a positive impact, but the challenges we experienced in the Northeast, Plains and Great Lakes appear more macro in nature and less about specific actions we or any of our competitors have taken. We understand we're competing every day with very good, well-established competitors, but we remain confident in our current business model and the initiatives we have undertaken to continually provide improving customer service. We continue to feel our selling proposition is a real differentiator to our customers, and when customer traffic improves, we will be well positioned to further capture market share gains. Additionally, based on national industry sales data that is available, results show we continue to outpace our total competitive base in both the DIY and Commercial sectors.","With this said, I want to mention again some other points we're asked regularly about auto parts sales. We're asked if the lack of new car sales the last few years or the ramp in new car sales this year puts pressure on your business. Clearly, new car sales for 2009, '10 and '11 were lower than the preceding years. This may prove to be a headwind as those vehicles age, as there are less of them. However, data shows this can be offset by the average age of vehicles -- as the average age of vehicles continues to increase and the population of cars older than 11 years becomes a majority of the vehicles on the road. Therefore, we do not see this metric as a key factor in our current sales performance.","Also, we appreciate what the more recent new car sales can mean to the impact on our business. We're asked if people are forgoing repairs in anticipation of buying a new car. What really matters to us is what's happening with those old cars at the time new cars are purchased. As long as those cars are resold, we're not losing any business. From very preliminary data on 2012, our position is the absolute car registrations will increase in 2012.","Speaking in regard to our DIY business. As we've discussed in the past, the bigger issue is the types of products we're selling and where our opportunities lie. We break product categories into failure, maintenance and discretionary purchases. As we've also said previously, maintenance products have not had the sales growth the other sectors have had in recent quarters. Maintenance routinely represents about 40% of any quarter's sales, and this category for us has been growing over the last year in a low-single-digit range, versus the failure and discretionary categories growing in the mid-single-digit range.","The products we sell categorized as maintenance are typically those an owner's manual says should be changed at some select mileage intervals. This past quarter, these 3 regions had much weaker-than-expected sales, specifically in this category. And even more specifically, the handful of merchandise categories challenged in the fourth quarter remains challenged this quarter. Excluding these categories, our results in these areas and in total would have been consistent with the other regions.","Now, it is important to note, there are always better and worse performing regions across the country. Because we've not been able to come up with a better explanation to this divergence than unseasonable weather patterns over the calendar year, we continue to believe the only way we'll know for sure what is driving the difference is time: time to compare these regions' results against the upcoming winter and spring. At this point, we don't believe any sales correlations to miles driven, new cars sales or gas prices in these parts of the country exist to explain the sales falloff.","This morning, we want to call out some key accomplishments for the quarter. We completed 7 additional hub projects this past quarter, taking our hub resets life-to-date to 67. We continue to be quite pleased with the sales benefits from the reset hubs, as we have increased the size and\/or improved the location, allowing us to expand the number of SKUs offered on a same-day basis in the market. These SKUs have benefited both Retail and Commercial customers.","Due to our hub strategy and, more specifically, what the additional hub space offers, we were able to place additional hard parts inventory in the local markets, allowing us to better meet the ever-increasing needs of our customers. I know many of you have read how inventory per store has increased within our industry over the last few years and not in a small way. This is due to the proliferation of unique makes and models constantly being rolled out each year. Our listeners should expect us to talk about proper inventory placement for years to come. We believe our hub strategy better positions us to address this need.","Regarding Mexico, we opened 4 stores this quarter and finished with 325 stores. Sales in our other businesses achieved very solid sales results. Our ALLDATA and E-Commerce businesses continued to perform well, increasing 5.3% over last year. There are great opportunities for E-Commerce sales growth on both a business-to-business basis and to individual customers or B2C. While both businesses are relatively small for us, we are experimenting to understand where the most potential exists.","At this point, we still view DIY E-Commerce as supplemental to our walk-in business. What we do want to have is the best website possible for our customers to research their vehicle needs. We continue to spend our resources on this design element.","Also in our press release this morning, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the assets and select liabilities of AutoAnything. AutoAnything is a leading online retailer of specialty automotive products. Sales are expected to be approximately $125 million for calendar 2012. AutoAnything was initially founded by Selwyn Klein in 1979, incidentally the same year AutoZone was founded, as a manufacturer and retailer of sheepskin seat covers and custom carpet floor mats.","In the late 1990s, Selwyn was joined by both of his sons, David and Trevor, and together they set out to expand their company into an online retailer of automotive products. Along with the addition of many other talented and dedicated leaders and employees, they have built a sizable and profitable business.","When we first met with the Kleins and a few other members of their team, it was quickly evident that our business philosophies and values were closely aligned. At AutoZone, the first line of our pledge is \"AutoZoners always put customers first.\" At AutoAnything, their core belief is to always do what is in the best interest of the customer. We are very excited about this announcement and excited to finalize the transaction by the end of this calendar year. We believe, together, these 2 organizations can leverage each other's strengths and capabilities and improve the performance of both businesses.","Our plans are to continue to operate AutoAnything as a standalone entity located in San Diego, California. We very much look forward to finalizing this transaction and formally welcoming the talented members of the AutoAnything team to AutoZone. As this transaction is not yet closed, we are not announcing the purchase price, but once it is closed, it will be disclosed in our financial statements. Lastly, the acquisition is expected to be slightly dilutive to fiscal 2013 EPS and accretive in 2014 and beyond.","We continue to remain bullish on our industry sales growth opportunities on both the Retail and Commercial fronts over the long term. As the vehicle population continues to age and consumers continue to look for good values while maintaining their vehicles, we see AutoZone's opportunity to sell to these customers only growing.","Now, let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2013, one team delivering WOW!. The key priorities for the year are Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our Commercial business, leveraging the Internet, hub store improvements and leveraged technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies.","On the Retail front this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We continued to invest in training our store AutoZoners. We've completed the rollout of our new labor management system and replaced our legacy system.","In regards to Commercial, we opened 37 programs during the quarter. We elected to moderate our Commercial program openings during Q1 and instead pushed our planned openings closer to spring, when a more normal ramp in sales is expected. We did not feel we were missing anything by delaying some openings for a short period of time. We continue to see Commercial as a material sales growth driver for us for many years to come. Our results continued to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.","I'll take a moment now to talk more specifically about our first quarter performance in more detail. Our domestic same-store sales grew 0.2% for the quarter. Our first quarter, which ended November 17, did experience some variability in month-to-month sales results. More importantly, the impact on a regional basis continued to be our story. The separation of results began in April for us and continued through this quarter.","As we've said previously, the category of sales we define as maintenance had the most challenging comparison on the quarter. With approximately 40% of our sales in this classification, sales of this category were soft, particularly in the subset of geographic regions previously discussed. As weather and the mild winter experienced in these regions appear to be a contributor, as we've said previously, weather always evens out over the long term. So we never get too excited on the upside or the downside. We do not believe that the softness was due to any actions we or our competitors took.","This regional difference in results carried through to our Commercial business as well. Our small market share and current growth trajectory from our newer programs gives us confidence in our future build-out potential. We will continue to invest to grow our Commercial business and penetrate a larger percentage of our existing store base.","As I've said earlier, ALLDATA and E-Commerce had another fine quarter, up 5.3% in sales from this time last year. This portion of our business, while small as a percentage of our overall sales mix, continues to experience faster sales growth than the auto parts stores.","Regarding our ALLDATA product in Europe, we remain very upbeat on the sales potential in this area of the world. There are competitors to ALLDATA there today, but we feel there's a real point of differentiation with our product. The sales ramp for this business is planned to be gradual over 2013, but our hope is to have a material increase in sales within a 2- to 3-year time period.","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish the quarter at 33.0%. This statistic has shown steady improvement, reflecting our efforts to efficiently use the capital we deploy. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital is our investors' capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to state how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to plan and manage this business appropriately. When we entered this quarter, we anticipated that the sales environment would potentially not be robust. We communicated this possibility to the organization and explained that in more challenging environments, we have to be even more aggressive on cost controls.","It had been a few years since we had to use this muscle, but in typical AutoZone fashion, our team responded quickly and appropriately. I'm very proud of our team for their commitment to great service and for their commitment to success. As we look forward, we will continue to aggressively manage our cost structure while simultaneously execute our initiatives and drive productive sales growth. Now here's Bill.","William T. Giles","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and International results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales increased 3.4% on top of last year's first quarter's growth of 7.4%. This segmentation includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses and our Mexico stores.","Regarding macro trends during the first quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.78 a gallon and ended the quarter at $3.43 a gallon, a $0.35 decline. Last year, gas prices decreased similarly by $0.26 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $3.63 and ending at $3.37 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles, and we believe the recent declines in prices provide our customers with a much deserved increase in their disposable incomes.","During the quarter, prices declined on a national basis steadily, consistent with the prior year trends. While there were some regional disruptions in California and with Hurricane Sandy in the Northeast, gas did come down a bit. At the same time, with gas prices remaining at these overall higher levels, we continued to communicate through our marketing messages to our customers, the steps they can take to improve their gas mileage.","We also recognized that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven were down 0.3% in July, up 1.2% in August and down again 1.5% in September. At this point, we do not have data for October and November. Year-to-date through September, miles driven are up slightly 0.6% from last year.","The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-old and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.","For the trailing 4 quarters, total auto parts sales per average square foot were $264. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. This metric is up 1.1% over last year's first quarter. This improvement is the key contributor to our record EBIT margin percent and our record ROIC.","For the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 12.2%. For the first quarter, Commercial represented 15.4% of our total sales and grew $33 million over last year's Q1. Last year's Commercial sales mix percent was 14.2%. As we have said previously, overall, we have been very pleased with the progress we are making in our Commercial business, both operationally and financially, and we remain on track with our plan. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings, and therefore, we are optimistic about the future of this business.","Our sales growth has come from both existing and new customers. We continue to believe we can grow revenues in existing stores, and we will continue to open additional Commercial programs. This past quarter, we opened 37 new programs versus 100-plus programs opened in each of our third and fourth quarters of last fiscal year.","We now have our Commercial program in 3,090 stores supported by 149 hubs. However, it is worth highlighting that approximately 25% of our programs are 3 years old or younger. With only 66% of our domestic stores having the Commercial program and our average revenue per program materially below several of our competitors, we believe there's ample opportunity for additional program growth aside from improved productivity opportunities in current programs.","In regard to the current quarter, our growth rate was 12% versus last quarter's 16% growth rate. The effect of the 3 regions Bill mentioned earlier in the call had an impact on our Commercial results as well, in fact, materially more so than on the DIY business. These markets were a full 17 percentage -- 17% lower in growth rate than last year in Q1.","Our other regions were slightly below in total last year's results. Again, a similar subset of merchandise drove this material decline. We continue to feel weather probably had some impact on these results. It certainly had an impact, but not the full impact. We do believe if we experience a more normal winter from a weather perspective, sales will improve in these markets.","Our share is up from what we can see and customer feedback on our performance has been positive. What is not clear from our numbers is how the productivity from our newer programs is affecting our overall sales per program. New programs typically open slowly and therefore with lower volumes. With a 34% program increase over the last 3 years, they've challenged this overall sales-per-program metric.","In regard to our future, we're focused on building the Commercial initiatives that have been in place for the last few years. We continue to watch our sales force mature. We're also enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of our sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. We feel our product distribution model is scalable going forward, and we are continuing to test additional enhancements to our offerings.","In addition to our focus on further developing and expanding our sales force, we expect to continue adding additional late-model import and domestic coverage, both in satellite and hub stores. And what remains a validation of our ongoing strategy, our Duralast brand continues to gain traction with our customers.","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our Commercial programs, having opened over 778 programs over the past 36 months, a 34% increase. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share. The regional variances in our Commercial sales results give us comfort our underperforming markets are not solely the direct cause of something we have specifically done. We believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner. We continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.","Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 4 new stores during the first quarter. We currently have 325 stores in Mexico and we remain resolute on our strategy to open stores at a steady pace while managing our Mexico business for the long run. We have operated stores in Mexico for over 14 years and we continue to see great opportunity for growth going forward. Our returns and profit growth have been in line with our expectations.","Regarding Brazil, our store is up and running. We've had our formal grand opening. At this point, there's nothing noteworthy to report from a sales perspective, as we continue to learn more about the market and our customers. We're currently in various stages of development on future stores. Our plans are to open 12 to 15 stores over the next couple of years and then slow additional development as we refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and financially. Then, we will determine our long-term growth plans.","Recapping our first quarter performance for the company in total, our sales for the quarter were $1,991,000,000, an increase of 3.5% from last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 0.2% for the quarter.","Gross margin for the quarter was 51.8% of sales, up 71 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to higher margins on merchandise growth. The increased merchandise margins were due to lower acquisition cost. We also experienced slightly lower shrink as a percentage of sales during the quarter.","In regards to inflation, we have seen some increases in cost year-over-year, but at a much lower pace than last year at this time. At this point, our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing heading into the new year, and therefore, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. Like before, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the Retail and Commercial businesses; however, we do not manage to a targeted gross profit margin percentage. As the growth of our Commercial business has been a steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have to continuously work strategies to offset this.","Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars, and gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment were up 3.4% for the quarter.","SG&A for the quarter was 33.6% of sales, higher by 18 basis points from last year's first quarter. The primary driver on the quarter's operating expenses as a percentage of sales was 34 basis points of deleverage in store payroll. Partially offsetting this deleverage was lower advertising expense. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure for the foreseeable future.","EBIT for the quarter was $363 million, up 6.6% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 18.2% or up 53 basis points versus the previous year's first quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $41.1 million compared with $39.1 million in Q1 a year ago.","Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $3,803,000,000 or approximately $450 million more than last year's first quarter balance of $3,354,000,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease the leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 36.9%, above last year's first quarter of 36.7%. We expect our full year rate to run in line with this past quarter's results.","Net income for the quarter of $203 million was up 6.4% versus the prior year's first quarter. Our diluted share count of 37.6 million was down 8% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $5.41, up 15.7% over the prior year's first quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement for the first quarter of 2013, we've generated $318 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $80.4 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 24 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodel efforts and work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters. For all of fiscal 2013, our CapEx is expected to be approximately $400 million.","With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,703 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 325 stores in Mexico; and 1 in Brazil for a total store count of 5,029.","Depreciation totaled $50.7 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $48.6 million.","With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $317 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $788 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 112%. While we expect we have some room to increase this ratio going forward, we expect the rate of increase to remain modest.","Next, I'd like to update you on inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $2.7 billion, up 6.8% versus the Q1 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investments and coverage for select categories. Inventory per store was up 2.6%, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 33%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","As the last point, I'd like to point out that this year, fiscal year 2013, has an extra week in it. More specifically, the extra week will fall during the fourth quarter. Already our longest quarter in terms of number of weeks, this year's fourth quarter will have an extra week, taking us to 17 total weeks in Q4. As a result, our year will end next year on August 31.","The last time we had an extra week in our financials was fiscal 2008, and we would encourage you to review the impact this extra week had on our performance in Q4 2008 to better understand the impact this extra week may have on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 results. Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. Our company has been extremely successful over the long run. We remain committed to delivering WOW! Customer Service going forward. We continue to execute at a high level and it is our incredible AutoZoners, now across the globe, who work tirelessly to achieve these results.","As we've said earlier on our call, our results this past quarter were solid, but not as good as we would have liked. We continued to experience some unique regional performance differences that weigh on our results. Clearly, our business has experienced a slowdown over the last several months and we continue to believe a significant amount of that slowdown is likely due to the mild winter we experienced last year. But we are still cautious on discussing weather as the entire story. For one reason, we can't control the weather.","Our charge is to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering EPS growth of 15.7% and an ROIC of 33.0% for the quarter are great results.","As we look to the future, the past month's slowdown in industry sales remains a concern, and we will continue to manage our business accordingly. We believe some portion of it is due to last winter's mild winter. But that likely isn't the entire story. While we mentioned earlier that our more recent sales results have been better, we are careful not to oversell this point as we appreciate the challenging same-store sales comparison we have this quarter from last year's Q2. So while we cannot predict sales, what we do know is we will continue to effectively manage this business through good times and less good, as evidenced by our 25 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth, which included all kinds of macro trends.","As we think about our model, we grow new store square footage at an annual rate of approximately 4%, and we expect to continue growing our Commercial businesses at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share comfortably into double digits. This model has been quite successful for an extended period of time.","Before we close, I'd like to reiterate how excited we are about the upcoming acquisition of AutoAnything. The business and organization the Kleins and their team have built is impressive, and we look forward to working with them to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our collective customers.","Additionally, I want to again thank and congratulate our entire organization for their dedication to our customers, fellow AutoZoners, stockholders and communities. Our approach remains consistent. We're focused on succeeding in the second quarter of 2013, and we are optimistic and excited about the remainder of the year.","Before we move to the Q&A period, I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize and say goodbye to 2 of our great leaders. Over the next month, both Lisa Kranc, Senior Vice President of Marketing; and Bob Olsen, Corporate Development Officer, will be retiring. Both have been key leaders of our organization for more than a decade, and their contributions have been invaluable. They will certainly be missed, but they built strong teams and those teams will continue to prosper in their absence. As we thank them for their past service, we want to wish both Lisa and Bob and their families all the best in their future endeavors.  Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Christopher Horvers with JPMC.","Rachel Stubins - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Rachel Stubins for Chris Horvers. Could you provide some thoughts on what's driving the lower shrink and how long this can continue to last?","William T. Giles","That's a great question. I mean, I think our entire organization has really done an incredible job of really focusing on all the elements that we believe cause shrink. And so it starts both from an analytical standpoint; it starts at the distribution centers; and most importantly, it starts with all of our AutoZoners in the stores taking care of our customers. And so we believe that reducing shrink really starts with great customer service, as well as some system enhancements and better inventory management control, all things that we've worked on over the past, I'd say probably 2 to 3 years. Exceptionally hard, and I think you're starting to see those results in the last, probably, 5 or 6 quarters. And we had good results this quarter as well and we expect to have slightly favorable trends going forward. But at some point in time, I'm sure it will moderate out.","Operator","Our next question is from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First question, just focusing on the top line weakness, and especially in those 3 regions. Understanding the warm weather certainly impacts the need for maintenance and repair as you come out of the winter, but we're now sitting here in the November and it's -- the weakness in these markets is lingering perhaps a little bit longer than we might have expected and you might have expected. And do you have any thoughts on the persistence of it and why that weakness continues to linger so long?","William C. Rhodes","I think it does not necessarily surprise us, Colin. As we looked at it last year, use the brake systems or the chassis system, they didn't go through the wear and tear due to snow, ice, salt, all those different kinds of things. That just didn't happen last year. And so as we started seeing this divergence, we did anticipate that it would happen. I think even on our last call, we said that we don't necessarily anticipate we'll know the answer to it until we get into the spring. So I just think it just didn't have the rugged issues that it typically has in those areas during the winter, and we're going have to wait and see what happens next year.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So when you look at the categories -- and I think in the last call you did a really nice job of that. When you look at the categories of what's selling in the business, say in October, is that not dissimilar to what's selling in the business, say in March or April, as you're coming out of the winter? I would have thought that, given you had some very hot summer weather in those regions too, in the Plains especially, that just the natural mix of the business of what's happening in October is going to be a little bit different than what's happening in March. Or am I just confused?","William C. Rhodes","No, I think you're right. I think generally, you're going to do a lot of maintenance projects in March and in October, one coming out of winter, one going into the winter, to prepare for it. But there has been a step function change in our sales patterns and in even our demand patterns, which is where AutoZoners are looking up products, in these specific maintenance areas in those regions. And it is pretty dramatic in those regions, what we've seen, and it's persisted since about April. I think part of the winter last year was a little bit -- was disguised because it was so warm that people were doing some of those maintenance projects earlier than they typically would have, so we didn't really see it until April. But from that point on, it has been very consistent.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Well, that feeds into my second question that obviously, you have that tough compare coming up here in fiscal 2Q, again some of that pull-forward demand. So given the trend, it looks possible the comps could even struggle more. You mentioned aggressive -- getting that muscle back in action, aggressively managing the cost structure and you did a pretty good job this quarter. Advertising, you pointed out. What else are you thinking about either not doing, foregoing, reducing? When you talk about aggressively managing the cost, what specific areas are you looking at?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I would say every single area of the company. We're looking at headcount. We've slowed our Commercial openings a little bit. That will ramp back up as we come into the spring. But we're just -- we want to be cautious as we go into the second quarter. The second quarter is always the most financially challenging quarter because it has 3 different holidays in it. Our sales performance in those quarters are always the lowest of the year, so it's always a big concern. So we're just going to be very aggressive, managing every single cost of the company as we go through Q2. And I think by the end of Q2, we'll begin seeing some signs of what the sales environment is going to look like after we annualize this winter.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you talk about Sandy and what impact that may have had on your sales? And you mentioned that business has picked up since the end of the quarter and you attributed part of that to Sandy. Could you go into a bit more detail on that?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, Gary. First of all, number one, I apologize for everybody that had the impacts of Sandy. I know it's been traumatic up there for many of you on this call in the Northeast and I hope everybody is doing well. For our business, Sandy over, say, a 3-week period of time, was not a material event. We saw significant deceleration in sales the week of the event. It appears we picked those sales back up over the next couple of weeks. So I would say it was not a material event in the quarter. When we talked about sales performance, we said in the last couple of weeks of the quarter, we did not address the first couple of weeks of the new quarter because we just don't like to get into ever -- get into the sales pattern of the new quarter because we release earnings within 2.5 weeks and I just don't want people trying to develop trends off of those short periods of time. As we think about Sandy, one of the corollaries we have is when we see these kinds of storms in Florida and the Mississippi Gulf Coast and Louisiana, we typically see a pretty nice increase in our business in the region for, call it, 6 months or so after the storm because there is a lot of people that do our kind of work, that come to the area to do the repairs. There's also money flowing, whether it's insurance money or FEMA, and in a lot of cases we see a nice pickup on a regional basis as a result of some of these catastrophic events.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Following it up, I guess it\u2019s also weather-related. Like you constantly mentioned like the Midwest, Northeast and the Plains as being weather impacted. Are there any changes in the competitive environment, like for example, in where -- like in Chicago, it's become a little bit more aggressive? Are there other possible explanations? Or you're -- based on your analysis, you're pretty sure this is weather.","William T. Giles","Yes. I mean, I think one of the things that we look back on, Gary, is that we believe it's more focused on weather, just from the standpoint that we don't see a lot of changes in competitive behavior that would attribute the kind of sales performance that we've seen since that April time period going forward. And so we've done a fair amount of analysis on this, both from an external factor as well as an internal factor. And when we look at all of that analysis, there doesn't seem to be any action specifically that we are taking or that our competitors are taking that has resulted in the sales performance that we're experiencing. And we supplement that by looking at it from a category perspective. As Bill mentioned before, when you look at a lot of these maintenance categories, they seem to be hit harder than most.","Operator","Our next question is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","When you look at the stores that are collectively supported by the 149 expanded hubs, how are these stores on the Commercial side of the business doing, relative to the stores that are not yet supported by the expanded hubs?","William T. Giles","Yes, I think one thing to think about too is that virtually all of our stores are, at some level, supported by a hub. And you're right. We've got about 67 or so that have been expanded. And what's happening on those expanded hubs is that we we're able to introduce more coverage, and that really is the primary purpose of it, and we are seeing an increase in the sales performance of those satellite stores, as well as the Commercial programs. So it certainly gives us the confidence for us to continue to move forward with this initiative of expanding and relocating hubs where we think it's appropriate, so that we can get better coverage in those marketplaces.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And one more question, if I may. With the rollout of the labor management system, when exactly do you expect to realize results of this? And can you maybe shed a little bit more color on exactly what you are hoping the system will do for you?","William T. Giles","I think at a high level, what we really want to make sure the system does is allow us to allocate our payroll dollars on a more surgical basis so that we are matching our hours. Like any retailer, we're trying to match our hours with our sales demand, not just generically on a Saturday but more specifically, on this individual hours during the week and specifically on the weekend. And so, the system is up and running within the stores. Like any good IT system, we're working through issues during the first couple of months. But we're getting some benefits out of it. We're certainly being able to manage and control our models at a more surgical level than we have historically and we'll continue to see benefits. I can't give you a quantification of it right now but ultimately, what we're really focused on is improving our customer service by ensuring that we've got the right number of AutoZoners during the right hours of the day.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And one last question for Bill Rhodes, if I may. Bill, does the acquisition of AutoAnything accomplish what you believe you now need to grow E-Commerce? And how exactly are you going to integrate AutoAnything with ALLDATA?","William C. Rhodes","Well, great questions. We are very excited about AutoAnything, and I just want to spend one second to talk about the members of the management team that we've come in contact with, particularly the Klein family. It was amazing in the first meeting that we had with them. I believe it was back in July. The consistency of our business philosophies, the value structure and just -- there was a real chemistry there. So they are very focused on their culture, and I think they're going to be a phenomenal fit for us. One of the things that AutoAnything does for us is they allow us to reach into a customer segment that we really don't participate in very much even in our stores, much less over the Internet today. Their demographics are much higher-income demographics. They are very good at accessories and performance, which are areas where we don't excel at. We are fantastic on the parts side of the business. So I think that they are a very nice complement to us. We will continue to run them -- our vision is to continue to run them as a stand-alone company. Now, there are tremendous strengths that they have and there's tremendous strengths that we have, and we're going to work very collaboratively with them to find those areas of leverage and those areas of synergy so that we can improve the performance of both organizations. But we're really excited. As for ALLDATA, there's really probably not going to be any significant connections with ALLDATA. But really, the connections are going to be with our E-Commerce team here in Memphis, which is led by Jamey Traywick, who did a tremendous job working with AutoAnything and assessing this acquisition opportunity.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My 2 questions both relate to Commercial. It seemed like Commercial experienced a bit more of a deceleration on a per-program basis, the decel you saw on DIY. So I was hoping, if you boil down on those subcategories within maintenance, within those regions, sort of that real core of softness for you, how did those categories in those regions map to Commercial versus DIY?","William C. Rhodes","Almost identical, Matt, except the impact on Commercial, as you mentioned, was a little bit more significant than it was in DIY. But it's remarkable how focused it is in the same areas of the country and how focused it is in the same categories.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the next question, a follow-up question. Listening to Bill Giles, it sounded like you were starting to explore the notion that self-cannibalization in Commercial might be contributing to the deceleration that you're experiencing on that side of the business. And any sense you could give us as to the diagnostics that you're looking at and thinking about to make that decision? And what evidence might be leading you to think this?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. Look, clearly as we open new programs, we cannibalize existing programs to some extent, not a tremendous extent. But the bottom line is we have 2% market share. So the fact that we cannibalize in existing stores, open a new program, to start that new program and to grow in that other market area, that's something we're willing to compromise on over the short term. Over the long term, we need to have substantially more of our stores on the Commercial program and that's our vision. And I want to be really -- I want to hit this point crystal clear: we opened 37 programs in Commercial in the first quarter. We're not going to open a ton of them in the second quarter, but we're going to open a lot in the back half of the year. It just doesn't make a lot of sense, particularly when we're dealing with a softer sales environment, to open up a lot of Commercial programs going into the second quarter where a lot of the shops are going to be closed 3 to 5 days because of holidays and the sales volumes are lower.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then finally, well, I know you guys are always engaged in the process of self-improvement. Is there anything in particular that you're looking to do differently to drive the top line, given the results of the past couple quarters? Obviously, you've adjusted on the expense side and that has helped protect the bottom line, but is there anything else that you have in mind for the sales side?","William C. Rhodes","Matt, we are constantly looking for ways to improve. But at the macro level, we have great confidence in our strategy. We continue to see that we're gaining market share in both Retail and Commercial in every way we can look at it. And so we're going to stick to our knitting. That's been a big part of our secret to success over the long term. It is not to change strategies on a quarter-to-quarter, week-to-week basis, to stick to it and execute it in an exceptionally high level, and that's our plan going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Number one, following up on Matt's question about cannibalization, do you think that the self-cannibalization has -- there's been any more evidence that it's been more intense in the Northeast, as you've put more of your new stores, new Commercial programs in those areas -- in that area over the last couple of years?","William T. Giles","I don't think so. I don't think that the cannibalization has been really more intense per se. I think that obviously, we've opened more stores in the last fiscal year than we ever have, leading up to that point. The other thing that's also contributing to it is that we now have a much larger population of immature programs than we have had in the past. So to Bill's point, at the end of the day we've got a 2% market share so we need to continue to drive our business, both on existing programs, and some of that's going to come from expanding and relocating the hubs, getting more inventory into the market for same-day delivery, as well as being able to open more programs. We've got -- 65% of our stores today have a Commercial program, and obviously, we believe it can be significantly higher than that. So we're less focused on cannibalization, more focused on market share and just growing EBIT dollars.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And what are you seeing from your customers? How has the trend in customer turnover on the Commercial side been over the last few quarters? Did that grow more intense in the most recent quarter?","William T. Giles","I wouldn't say it grew more intense over the last few quarters. I do think that -- and we don't want to keep harping on it, but I do think that the sales performance of the 3 regions that we keep highlighting have just been a lot different than the rest of the country, both DIY and specifically in Commercial as well. And so we look at it from a geographic perspective and we see differences. But on an overall basis, I wouldn't say that we're seeing differences on our individual customers.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then my last question is, the improvement that you've talked about in the last few weeks, has that been driven by better performance in these 3 areas of the country that were particularly weak?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, and I want to be careful not to overdo that. I even said it in my prepared comments. I don't want to extrapolate 2 weeks' performance. It was post-Sandy and clearly, we saw improvements in that period of time. And particularly in the Northeast but also in the Midwest, where all of those markets actually turned positive for those couple of weeks. But I would just be careful. We said all along it's going to be spring before we really know, and I don't want anybody to try to extrapolate those couple of weeks that were promising to us. But it's also been 74 degrees down here over the weekend, so we're still looking for winter to hit.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of pricing in the Commercial side, as you've seen a little bit of a slowdown, and others might as well? Are your Commercial customers getting a little bit more focused on price as their business slows?","William C. Rhodes","I think anytime an organization is faced with a challenging sales environment, and clearly our Commercial customers are, they get focused just like we've been focused on, how do they improve their profitability? And yes, there has been a bit more focus on pricing. I don't want to over-extrapolate that either, but there's clearly focus on, how can they get the best value? And we think we provide them with a tremendous value.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So is this causing you guys to lower price? And what kind of -- how does that play into your gross margin trends going forward?","William C. Rhodes","I wouldn't try to say that it's going to have a material impact on our margins. It hasn't at this point in time. What we want to do is we want to make sure that we're conveying the complete value proposition. There's a lot of other things that we do. We've got great pricing today, always have, always will, but there's other elements that are important to our strategy.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And one more on this Commercial question. So your Commercial sales growth was up less than the growth in the number of Commercial stores, so in other words, sales per Commercial store was down. We could probably figure this out from all the data, but if you could just help us. Is that solely because of adding more immature stores? Or I guess, here's the question, Commercial store this year versus Commercial store of last year, the sort of like-for-like Commercial stores, are those negative year-over-year? Or are those positive?","William T. Giles","No. They're not negative. I think you got to look at a lot of the immaturity levels of the new programs coming in.","Operator","Our final question today is from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A couple of quick questions, and one of them being on AutoAnything. As you focus more into the performance, and especially parts, is that a category you might roll out physically into the stores as well? Or you intend to just keep that online?","William T. Giles","Well, we have some of it in the stores today, but the fact of the matter is that is a very SKU-intensive business. And so it really affords itself very well for online, and so we think there's real opportunities to be able to capture market share online. And AutoAnything does a really good job on accessories and performance.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So we shouldn't be thinking about planograms changing a whole lot...","William T. Giles","I wouldn't think about that, no.","William C. Rhodes","No, the one thing...","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","[indiscernible] one final question on the gross margin. You had talked about improving acquisition cost. Is that better pricing from same vendors? Or is that changing the supply chain, more direct, anything on that?","William T. Giles","It's a combination of both to some extent, but we're also getting better pricing. And when you think back over a year ago, we had a lot of price inflation that we're not necessarily experiencing today. That coupled with the fact that we're getting better pricing and our merchandising team is doing a great job on sourcing as well. And so...","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And is there a tradeoff there? I guess you're sort of flat on the AP-ed inventory at 112-ish percent. Is it -- as you don't take that up, do you get better pricing from the vendors in exchange?","William T. Giles","I don't think so.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Rhodes for closing comments.","William C. Rhodes","Okay, before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted, as we understand our customers have alternatives. Our culture remains our key point of differentiation from our competition, and we must not lose sight of the importance of basic store execution in order to remain very successful. We have a solid plan to succeed for the remainder of 2013, but I want to stress that this is a marathon, not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.","Lastly, I'd like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season, and a prosperous new year. We thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for joining. You may disconnect at this time."],"2626":["AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) Q2 2013 Earnings Call February 26, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Brian Campbell","William C.

Rhodes","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2013 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another very solid quarter, in spite of a great deal of volatility across the 12 weeks. We continue to execute on our strategies to improve the customer shopping experience, the initiative we call Great People Providing Great Service! We also grew our Commercial program count, sales and profitability. We expanded 10 additional hub locations during the quarter to take our total remodeled hubs to 77 locations. These remodels entail adding additional inventory into the market that benefits both our Retail and Commercial sales. Additionally, we accelerated our efforts to further leverage the Internet with the closing of our purchase of Autozone AutoAnything in December. We are very excited about having this wonderful business and team join our organization, and we believe their expertise in online retailing will help us grow this category. We believe combining their knowledge and the expertise with the AutoZone E-Commerce team, will create material sales growth in this sector in the future.","While we felt we made advances during the quarter, sales have remained inconsistent and below our desires and expectations. On the last call, we noted that the last couple of weeks of the first quarter showed improving sales trends in our Midwest and Northeast markets. However, we remained cautious on our outlook. We understood we were facing our most challenging same-store sales comparison for the fiscal year during the second quarter. Basically, this quarter felt very similar to last quarter on a sales basis through the first 10 weeks. Our same-store sales results through 10 weeks were basically flat. However, historically, we have experienced significant sequential week-to-week growth in sales during the last 2 weeks of our second quarter. This year, we saw some modest growth, but not to the level we had historically experienced, and during those 2 weeks, our total domestic same-store sales were down 8%. We believe the sharp fall off in sales for those 2 weeks were attributable, in large part, to the delay in income tax refunds being processed by the IRS.","According to Nick Colas, Chief Market Strategist at the ConvergEx Group, the delay in the IRS accepting returns for processing until January 30 compared to January 15 last year missed $30 billion less in refunds to individuals through February 9th as compared to last year. From all indications, we expect the same amount of dollars will be refunded this year as last, and we expect our sales to respond as more refund dollars are distributed into the economy. Unfortunately for us, our fiscal quarter finishes at an odd time in early February. Historically, we have benefited from a ramp in sales due to income tax refunds, and that ramp typically carries through to the usual increases from the spring selling season. This year, that was not the case.","Aside from the severely challenged last 2 weeks, our Northeast and Midwest markets, on a 2-year same-store basis, did show some improvement. However, they were still negative and approximately 500 basis points worse than the Western and Southern store markets. Before the last week of January, sales were sequentially improving in these markets. Maintenance categories, especially brake-related categories, continued to be our worst-performing categories. The merchandise that we sell under the banner of maintenance-related remains our biggest opportunity for improvement. This category experienced high single-digit percentage growth in 2009, '10 and most of 2011. But starting in 2012, this category slowed markedly. At approximately 40% of our merchandise mix on the Retail front, it has been the primary reason our sales have slowed over the last 12 months. Excluding the impact from the late tax returns, although we were not pleased by our same-store sales performance, we were encouraged to see our business stabilize and begin to show some signs of improvement.","As we look forward to the back half of our fiscal 2013, we're enthusiastic about the progress we're making on many of our initiatives. We've increased the availability of inventory throughout our hub network and satellite stores, we further expanded our Commercial program openings, and we continue to grow our Mexico ALLDATA E-Commerce and Brazil businesses. We are encouraged by our learnings and feel we can have improving sales trends for the remainder of the year. Our belief is, as stated on the last quarter's call, this past Q2 would be a low point, and we could see growth again in the back half of the year.","The most recent quarter's results marked our 26th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. We are very pleased with our ability to consistently deliver strong EPS growth through our financial model of steady, mid-single digit EBIT dollar growth or better, along with high single-digit reductions in diluted share count through our share repurchases. Our goal, quarter-over-quarter, continues to be to provide consistency to our shareholders, our AutoZoners, and of course, our customers. We feel this targeted consistency in both financial performance as well as execution of our key initiatives results in stability and confidence for our shareholders, AutoZoners and customers.","Next, I'd like to discuss our sales results for this past quarter in more detail. Our sales were up 2.8% and our same-store sales were down 1.8%. This quarter, same-store sales results compare to last year's second quarter comps of 5.9%. Our same-store sales results are a combination of both our Retail and Commercial businesses. I should point out, our total Commercial sales were up 9% over the last year's second quarter, driven by a combination of existing programs and the addition of 321 net new programs over the trailing 12 months. Commercial was negatively impacted by having Christmas and New Year's Day shift to Tuesday from Sunday last year. On average, Sunday is a substantially lower Commercial selling day than Tuesday. We estimate, excluding this shift, Commercial sales would have been up approximately 10%.","Our overall sales performance for the quarter was softer than we'd hoped. But aside from the last 2 weeks, it was not entirely unexpected. Our sales patterns for Commercial track basically in line with Retail sales trends. For the first 10 weeks, the correlation was tied to the regional performance differences between the Northeast and Midwest and the rest of the country. The last 2 weeks were correlated to, we believe, income tax refund delays.","On last quarter's conference call, we spent time discussing how we felt the differences in sales results experienced between the Northeast and Midwest were primarily a weather phenomenon. The substantial differences of sales by region, similar to the last 2 quarters, continued for us during the second quarter. The 3 regions of the Northeast, Midwest and Plains states continued to track materially below the remainder of the country for the quarter. In fact, the 5 percentage points difference in same-store sales between the remaining 7 regions and the 3 affected areas, was basically present through the first 10 weeks of the quarter. It was in the last 2 weeks where the whole country's results weakened.","As we have stated previously, we will know for sure about weather's impact this spring. As our business regionally weakened starting in April of 2012, we feel our comparisons are most favorable starting at that time. This morning, we want to call out some key accomplishments this past quarter. We completed 10 additional hub projects this quarter, taking our hub resets life-to-date to 77. We continue to be quite pleased with the sales benefits from these reset hubs, as we have increased the size and\/or improved the location, allowing us to expand the number of SKUs offered on a same-day basis in the market. These SKUs have benefited both Retail and Commercial customers.","Due to our hub strategy and more specifically, what the additional hub space offers, we were able to place additional hard parts inventory into the local markets, allowing us to better meet the ever-increasing needs of our customers. I know many of you have read how inventory per store has increased within our industry over the last few years and not in a small way. This is due to the proliferation of unique makes and models constantly being rolled out each year. Our listeners should expect us to talk about proper inventory placement for years to come. We believe our evolving hub strategy better positions us to address this need.","Regarding Mexico, we opened 9 stores this quarter and finished with 334 stores. Sales in our other businesses achieved very solid sales results. Our ALLDATA and E-Commerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and autoanything.com, continue to perform well, increasing 43.1% over last year. They are great opportunities for E-Commerce sales growth on both a business-to-business basis and through individual customers or B2C.","While both businesses are relatively small for us, we are experimenting to understand where the most potential exists. At this point, we still view our traditional autozone.com DIY E-Commerce business as a complement to our walk-in business, but we wanted the best website possible for our customers to research their vehicle needs. We continue to spend our resources on this design element.","I also want to officially recognize and welcome AutoAnything's wonderful team to AutoZone, as we closed on our acquisition at the end of calendar 2012. Thus far, I can unequivocally say, the management and philosophical fit could not be better. I am very excited about what we can do together going forward. For the second quarter, AutoAnything had 2 months of results in our consolidated financials.","With the continued aging of the car population and suddenly improving miles driven, we continue to feel positive trends exist for our industry. We continue to remain bullish on our industry sales growth opportunities on both Retail and Commercial over the long term. As the vehicle population remains at an all-time high and consumers continue to look for good values while maintaining their vehicles, we see AutoZone's opportunity to sell to these customers only growing.","Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2013: 1 TEAM Delivering WOW! The key priorities for the year are Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our Commercial business, leveraging the Internet, hub store improvements and leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiency.","On the Retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We also invested in technology to enhance information available at the point of sale as well as tools to better optimize our execution. In regards to Commercial, we opened 56 programs during the quarter. Year-to-date, we've opened 93 versus 166 through the second quarter last year. We rolled the majority of these additional programs after January 1. We do not expect to open quite as many programs as last year, which was the most we have opened in a single year in recent history. However, we're on track to open approximately 300 programs for the year, which is consistent with our annual plan.","We continue to see Commercial as a material sales driver -- growth driver for us for many years to come. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.","I'll take a moment now to talk more specifically about our second quarter performance in more detail. Our domestic same-store sales declined 1.8% for the quarter. As noted earlier, our second quarter which ended March 9, did experience some variability in month-to-month sales results. More importantly, the impact on our regional basis continued. This separation in results began in April for us and continued through this quarter. As we've said previously, the category of sales we define as maintenance have the most challenging comparison on the quarter. With approximately 40% of our sales in this classification, sales of this category were soft, particularly in the subset of geographic regions previously discussed. As we experienced more normal winter patterns in these parts of the country this past winter, we continue to feel there is upside opportunity as we move into the spring and summer months. This regional difference in results carried through to our Commercial business as well. Our small market share and current growth trajectory from our newer programs continues to give us confidence in our future buildout potential. We will continue to invest to grow our Commercial business and penetrate a larger percentage of our existing store base.","As I've said earlier, ALLDATA and E-Commerce, which now includes AutoAnything, had another fine quarter, up 43% in sales from this time last year. AutoAnything's inclusion in this bucket drove the majority of this growth. This portion of our business, while small as a percentage of our overall sales mix, continues to experience faster sales growth than the auto parts stores. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish the quarter at 32.4%. We strive to improve on this metric over time as it reflects our efforts to efficiently use the capital we deploy.","It's important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to state how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage the business appropriately the past few quarters. I'm very proud of our team for their commitment to great service and for their commitment to success. As we look forward, we will continue to aggressively manage our cost structure while simultaneously executing our initiatives to drive productive sales growth. Now here's Bill.","William T. Giles","Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and International results for the quarter.","For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and 1 store in Brazil, increased 1.9% on top of last year's second quarter's growth of 8.6%.","Regarding macro trends during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.43 a gallon and ended the quarter at $3.61 a gallon, an $0.18 increase. Last year, gas prices increased similarly by $0.15 per gallon during the second quarter, starting at $3.37 and ending at $3.52 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles, and we will continue to monitor prices closely in the future.","We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven were up in both October and November, 0.4% in October and up 0.8% in November. December showed miles driven were down 2.8%. For 2012, miles driven were up slightly, plus 0.3% from last year. The other statistic we highlighted, the number of 7-year-old and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.","Another key macro issue facing our customers today is the reinstitution of payroll taxes back to historic norms. This reduction in our customers' take-home pay just began at the beginning of the new calendar year, and at this point, combined with the delay in income tax refunds, it is hard to objectively quantify the ramifications of this change.","For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales for auto parts store was $1,715,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. Total Commercial sales increased 8.8% for the second quarter and represented 15.6% of our total sales, growing $23 million over last year's Q2. Last year's Commercial sales mix percent was 14.8%. As we have said previously, overall, we have been very pleased with the progress we're making in our Commercial business, both operationally and financially, and we remain on track with our plans. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings, and therefore, we are optimistic about the future of this business. We continue to believe we can grow revenues in existing stores, and we will continue to open additional Commercial programs.","This past quarter, we opened 56 new programs versus 92 programs opened in our second quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our Commercial program in 3,146 stores supported by 152 hub stores. Approximately 800 of our programs are 3 years old or younger, with only 66% of our domestic stores having the Commercial program and our average revenue per program materially below several of our competitors, we believe there's ample opportunity for additional program growth, in addition to improved productivity opportunities in current programs.","While we recognize that our Commercial sales productivity per program is well below our peers, we do not believe there are any structural impediments that prevent us from achieving similar productivity numbers. In regard to our future, we're focused on building upon the Commercial initiatives that we have in place for the last few years. We continue to watch our sales force mature, we're also enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of our sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. We feel our product distribution model is scalable going forward, and we're continuing to test additional enhancements to our offerings.","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our Commercial programs, again, having opened over 800 programs over the last 36 months, effectively 26% of the programs are 3 years old or younger. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share. The regional variances in our Commercial sales results give us comfort. Our underperforming markets are not solely the direct cause of something we have specifically done. We believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner and we continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.","Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 9 new stores during the second quarter, we currently have 334 stores in Mexico. We remain  resolute on the strategy to open stores at a steady pace, while managing our Mexico business for the long run. We've operated stores in Mexico now for over 14 years, and we continue to see great opportunity for growth going forward. Our returns and profit growth have been in line with our expectations.","Regarding Brazil, our first store is up and running and we look forward to opening another here in the third quarter. We are currently in various stages of development on future stores. Our plans are to open 10 to 15 stores over the next couple of years, and then, slow additional development as we refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and financially. Then, we will determine our long-term growth plans.","Recapping our second quarter performance for the company in total, our sales for the quarter were $1,855,000,000, an increase of 2.8% from last year's second quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year, were down, 1.8% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.9% of the sales, up 51 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The improvements in gross margin were attributable to higher margins on merchandise growth. The increased merchandise margins were primarily due to lower acquisition costs.","In regards to inflation, we have seen some increases in cost year-over-year but at a much slower pace than last year at this time. At this point, our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing heading into calendar year, therefore, we feel cost will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding the inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the Retail and Commercial business. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross profit margin percentage. As the growth of our Commercial business has been the steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have to continuously work strategies to offset this.","Additionally, AutoAnything had a slight drag on our gross margin this past quarter. AutoAnything runs at a lower gross margin than our base business, and we expect that it will be a slightly larger drag once they're in our numbers for a full reporting period. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment which, for the quarter, increased approximately $30 million.","SG&A for the quarter was 34.7% of sales, higher by 6 basis points from last year's second quarter. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased slightly due to the lower sales growth rates, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. As we entered the second quarter, we were mindful of the current sales environment and due to this cautious nature, we aggressively managed our cost during the quarter. I want to take a moment to thank our entire team for their incredible diligence on cost control which, ultimately, was a significant contributor to our performance in Q2.","We continue to believe we're well-positioned to manage our cost structure for the foreseeable future. Earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter was $318 million, up 5.6% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 17.1% or up 45 basis points versus the previous year's second quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $41.3 million compared with $38.9 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $3,998,000,000 or approximately $530 million more than last year's second quarter balance of $3,464,000,000.","Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6x EBITDAR, while in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 36.2%, flat with last year's second quarter of 36.2%. We expect our full year rate to be approximately 37%. Net income for the quarter of $176 million was up 5.6% versus the prior year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 36.9 million was down 8.3% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $4.78, up 15.1% over the prior year's second quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement for the second fiscal quarter of 2013, we generated $193 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $89 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 41 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, and work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters.","For all of fiscal 2013, our CapEx is expected to be approximately $400 million. With new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,735 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 334 stores in Mexico; and 1 in Brazil for a total store count of 5,070. We also had a cash outflow during the second quarter of $115 million due to the AutoAnything acquisition. Depreciation totaled $52.3 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $47.5 million.","With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $185 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $603 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our leverage metric was slightly above 2.5x EBITDAR this past quarter. We ran higher than usual this past quarter due to our completed acquisition for AutoAnything. We have traditionally remained right at 2.5x. Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each trading firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 110%.","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $2.8 billion, up 7% versus the Q2 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investments and coverage for select categories. Inventory per store was up 2.6%, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 32.4%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","As the last point, I'd like to point out that this year, fiscal year 2013, has an extra week in it. More specifically, the extra week will fall during the fourth quarter. Already our longest quarter in terms of number of weeks, this year's fourth quarter will have an extra week, taking us to 17 total weeks in Q4. As a result, our year will end this year on August 31. The last time we had an extra week in our financials was fiscal 2008, and we would encourage each of you to review the impact this extra week had on our performance in Q4 2008 to better understand the impact this extra week will have on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 results.","Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes","Thanks, Bill. We are pleased to report our 26th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth and reported EPS growth rate of 15% for our fiscal second quarter. Clearly, our sales performance has not met our expectations as we had experienced softer sales over the past few quarters. In large part, we believe it has primarily been attributable to macro factors.","Now regarding current sales trends, we report our earnings 2.5 weeks after the end of our quarter. Historically, we've had a practice of not discussing our results for the current quarter because it is such a short timeframe. It just isn't prudent to try to assess our trajectory off of such a short period of time. We did attribute our performance in the last 2 weeks to the 2-week delay in tax refunds. The reason we called out that 2-week periods performance was because it was such a significant change. Recently, we have begun to see some of those refunds show up in our performance. But from the information we have, tax refunds are still significantly below the prior year.","As an organization, we don't want to be victims of a challenging macro environment, nor do we want to be reliant on strong macro trends to drive our success. We must continue to modify our game plan in order to succeed in good and not-so-good selling environments.","We've historically been able to do that, and we're built to do that going forward. Our organization is well adept at quickly altering our activities to appropriately respond to the current sales environment. While doing so, we have also -- we also have a strong commitment to continue to deliver WOW! Customer Service and drive sales. We believe the initiatives we have outlined are accomplishing that objective and our customer surveys reinforce that belief. Keep in mind that roughly half of our product sales are failure-related. What's great about that statistic is, in good times and bad, we will sell those items. We cannot insist customers to proactively replace those parts.","Last year's mild winter, we believe, contributed to less failures and lower levels of maintenance. As we begin to experience the effects from a more normalized winter this year, we expect trends to improve. Again, we're excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, Commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, E-Commerce and Brazil. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance.","In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. Despite this quarter's sales weakness, we are quite pleased with our earnings per share growth and our return on invested capital for Q2. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage in a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single digit range, or better, in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and highly predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. This model had been quite successful for an extended period of time.","Finally, I want to, again, thank our entire organization for their dedication to our customers, fellow AutoZoners, stockholders and communities. Our approach remains consistent. We're focused on succeeding in the third quarter of 2013, and we are excited about the next 2 quarters' opportunities. Thank you for your time. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question is on the Commercial business. I think you had said during prepared comments that you expect 300 new programs for 2013, is that correct?","William C. Rhodes","That's correct.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Which sounds in line with what you did in 2012, so I was just wondering, with your investment -- your emphasis on investment in Commercial in the hub system and the sales force, why we can't see an acceleration in the program growth this year?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, actually, it's going to be down this year, but that's consistent with our plan. Last year, we opened 400 programs, this year, we're saying we're opening roughly 300 programs. We want to make sure that we -- the most important part of opening a Commercial program is to make sure that we have the right resources in place and particularly, the right people resources. One of the things we learned last year when we opened 400 programs, it was a strain to make sure that we had the right people in place to start those programs. This year, we decided to back off a little bit, but opening 300 programs is still a pretty aggressive growth trajectory. We just want to make sure that we can do it right. We're in this for the long term, and we think 300 program growth, which is over roughly 10%, is pretty aggressive.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And can you comment, at all, on any changes that may be different in the competitive environment in Commercial this year versus last year?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I don't think that there's any significant competitive changes in the Commercial environment. I think everybody's out there fighting in a pretty tough environment, particularly in the Northeast and the Midwest. What we hear from our customers on the Commercial side is, car counts are down. It's a tough business right now and so everybody's out there, we're out there trying to give our best to make sure we provide them great service.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First of all, obviously, lots of other retailers from Walmart to many restaurants and others have discussed tax refunds. But this is not the first time, I guess, in the history of your business that we've seen tax refunds fluctuate in the environment. So is there anything that you see about ticket or the kind of transaction that you're witnessing that would suggest to you that beyond the environmental influences, that this is actually the culprit for the recent drop off?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. Matt, first of all, as you know, I've been in this business for 18 years. I've never seen this, what we experienced in those last 2 weeks. Now we've always known that we had this huge ramp, typically, in the last 2 weeks of our quarters. So we've always been, frankly, pretty darn nervous. Always saying, \"What happens if that ramp doesn't mature at some point in time?\" Well, guess what? We found out this year, and it hurt us. Fortunately, we had very effectively managed our business before that point in time, and we still delivered pretty reasonable results considering the sales environment. Yes, in the last 2 weeks, we saw material degradation in the ticket because people are not doing the kind of jobs that they typically do when they get that flow of money, which is their tax refunds. That's the only reason we've ever been able to appoint for the reason our sales spiked so much in those last 2 weeks, and so I think we found out this year.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then, a second question, if you look at your Commercial sales per store from peak to trough, you probably have seen a bit of a bigger dip in growth rates than you have in DIY? And as you think about the maturation of your roll out, you think about the fact that the incremental stores you're opening might be in regions we've already achieved some initial penetration. What's your up-to-date thinking on the white space that you have and the ability to continue to comp in Commercial, say, once weather normalizes as a factor in your business?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I'd first of all say, we opened the most productive programs first. So as we get deeper in the cycle, those store -- programs, they're in the markets that don't have the same kind of potential as the ones we did in the first part. Now we still think they have great potential and we still have 2.5% market share, so we think that white space is amazing as we look out. Look, we -- our performance in Commercial has been disappointing. We've gone from growing 20% to growing roughly 9% this quarter, 10% when you adjust for those days. But what we've seen is, we're continuing to grow pretty significant market share in Commercial. We think we have a long-term plan to grow it, and we're going to be able to do just fine.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just lastly, I have to clean up. You obviously have the regional differences. If you could just update us, if you look at cold-weather markets versus the rest of the country, whether the Commercial DIY relationship is different in those 2 groups of markets.","William C. Rhodes","Yes, it is not different. The numbers are different because as you highlighted, the growth trajectory at Commercial has been different. But directionally, the trends are very, very similar.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Bill, you had noted that your productivity per program is 40%, 50% lower than some of your competitors, but there's not any inherent reason for it to run at that big of a discount. When we talked with some of the technicians and asked them, why do you choose AutoZone or why do you choose some of your competitors? The one pushback that we hear on AutoZone is the quality of the parts that are available and delivery times. Certainly, AutoZone has not had made the same investment in distribution as some of your competitors have with the exception of the hub stores. So when you think about closing that productivity gap, is it going to require a significant capital investment on the part of AutoZone?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. At this point in time, we think our strategy is fantastic. The biggest thing that we're working on is the continued evolution of these hub stores. Yes, in-local market availability is critical to our success, frankly, in Commercial and Retail. And so what we're trying to do is leverage our hub stores so that we can have the best in-local market availability in the industry. And we think when we do that, we'll be fine.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just as a follow-up question, your comments about the weakness in brakes and rotors and the other 3 cold-weather markets is consistent with your competitors. But can you draw a link between what happened with warmer weather last February and March to why brake replacement rates would be dropping so quickly in that region of the country? I mean, after all, the changes in gasoline prices are about the same in the North as they are on your sunbelt markets. Miles driven is not significantly different in the North than in the Sunbelt markets. You would think that the failure rate or the replacement needs for brakes would be almost identical?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. Intuitively, I would have thought that as well, Dan, and I have never seen this kind of an issue in the past. But as we've gotten out and talked to our AutoZoners, who were talking to their customers and talked particularly to our Commercial shops, what we're hearing is the road conditions had a big part of that last year, that the lack of salt and brine and the things that they do to deal with high levels of snow put less wear and tear on those brake components. The fewer holes and the potholes on road, the less wear and tear in chassis components and the like. And it's been remarkable how significant those -- how significantly poorer those categories have performed just in the Midwest and the Northeast. And so at this point in time, that's our best thinking. And as we've said before, we're going to know in April. Frankly, if we kind of get to April and they're not improving, we were wrong and we've got to figure out what it's going to take to grow in the future.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Are you working on a contingency plan now if sales still don't come back in April?","William C. Rhodes","No. As you talked about, everybody's saying the same thing. So I don't think we're standing on this island by ourselves.","Operator","We'll move on to the next question, Gary Balter with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's Simeon for Gary. You mentioned inflation in the prepared remarks, I think you said some cost increases for next year at a slower rate. In the past, we've also talked about innovation driving the ticket and granted that the recent trends are obscured by weather. But can you talk about where we are in that cycle? Is there more innovation coming through product so that when we see the maintenance repair or some of the deferred maintenance pick back up, you could get a bigger inflation or innovation lift?","William T. Giles","Yes, I think that's a good way to think about it, Simeon. I mean, we have not seen a lot of inflation and our expectation is that we will not see inflation, certainly, from a commodity-based product standpoint. But from an innovation standpoint, we continue to see that. As the newer cars continue to work their way through from an aging perspective, we continue to see some -- I'd hate to call it inflation, but inflation in the pricing from an innovation standpoint. So our expectation is that -- and it's very consistent with our model over time, is that traffic has been down consistently over time in this industry for a very long period of time, and we continue to see either commodity book price inflation, which we're not seeing a lot of now or product innovation inflation which we continue to see. But our expectation is that will continue in the future.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, following on to the question that was asked about infrastructure, I think Bill Rhodes mentioned that the speed to market and the end-market availability is important. And I think the speed-to-market that AutoZone delivers is pretty good, but what about the selection? Does the hub model give you the ability to go as deep as you want or as you can in terms of product selection?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, Simeon, and we spend a lot of times looking at that. And if you look at the sales trends of the SKUs, the percentage of sales that we get in the high velocity SKUs versus the tail SKUs, it's remarkable how quickly that tail goes down, how slow the slower-moving products turn. But we have to have those slow-moving products because we need them to be able to build a relationship with our customers. So we believe the thing that we need to do is continue to build out our hub stores. As I've said in our prepared remarks, we now have 77 hub stores that we've expanded the size of so we can significantly increase the assortment. And as we continue to build those larger expansions, we go deeper and deeper so that we can find where that sweet spot is.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And are you able to track -- if you don't have a product because it's either not carried, is that a number that you track? And is that number -- is it small number or trending down?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, absolutely, we can track it. And as we continue to improve these hub stores, yes, it goes down in those hub stores. Our hub penetration continues to grow and frankly, meet -- exceed our expectations.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I have a housekeeping question and a bigger picture follow-up. The AutoAnything acquisition, how much does that add in terms of sales in the quarter? Or help us back out how much that ALLDATA and E-Com line was, excluding the acquisition?","William T. Giles","Yes, I think AutoAnything was probably sub-$20 million for the quarter, overall, in sales. And from an earnings perspective, it was negligible impact overall.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if I just -- just backing out a little, if I put in $15 million, that ALLDATA and E-Commerce line, back that out, maybe 5% or 10% growth? Is that about right?","William T. Giles","Yes, it would be probably in the neighborhood.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second, maybe a little bigger picture is, I think in the release and Bill, on your prepared comments, you talked about getting back to a more normalized volume. What would you consider normalized volume?","William C. Rhodes","That's a great question, Greg. Obviously, over the last 4 years, our industry had seen significant strength and you've certainly seen it in our same-store sales performance over the last 3 years before the last 12 months. I think there were clear industry tailwinds during that period of time that benefited all of us. I think right now we've got some pretty significant industry headwinds. So my personal point of view is that it's probably somewhere in between.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So if we were to say normalized volume was slightly positive still, 1% or 2%, would you -- [indiscernible] up on that, some normal inflation?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I think the normalized volume is definitely positive. And I think on the DIY business, the components of that may be that customer count continues to be pressured, but is offset by the structural increases in average ticket due to the technological advancements in parts and the innovation that Bill Giles was talking about a few minutes ago.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And Bill, maybe on the inflation, a follow-up....","William C. Rhodes","Greg, I can't hardly hear you, I don't know if you can speak up.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, just a follow-up on Simeon's question on inflation. Just as a reminder, what was it a year ago? Right now it's basically flattish, was it a couple percent a year ago?","William T. Giles","Yes, I'd say it's probably just a couple of percent a year ago, maybe a little bit less than that. And I think the year before that, it was much higher.","Operator","Our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Nomura.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A question just around the types of vehicles that you're seeing. Is there a way to look at the business by class of vehicle, or SUVs versus sedans or age of vehicle? Just trying to get a sense on the shifting vehicle population effect on the business. And then, I had a follow-up.","William C. Rhodes","Yes. We don't look at it that specific on those things -- the thing we do look out the most is the age of the vehicles, but we don't see any material shift as you've seen from AAIA's numbers, that the average age of vehicles continues to eke up a little bit, I think it went from 10.6 to 10.8. So I don't think there's any material changes in the mix of products we're selling.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then, as a follow-up, I had once thought that ALLDATA could be kind of a useful tool in getting into the Commercial business, which you've kind of got your network kind of installed in the garages already. Can you talk about how you either decided to use that or not use that, and whether or not it's been effective, or maybe it wasn't quite as I -- as it laid out?","William T. Giles","That's a good question. I mean, we think that ALLDATA is a stand-alone business and it's been very effective for us. They've got a very high market share from a repair and diagnostic standpoint, and they continue to add additional products, whether it be shop manager -- market, et cetera. So they've done a great job and continuing to penetrate it. We continue to seek opportunities to be able to bridge some of the synergies that exist between ALLDATA and our overall Commercial business. They're not probably as problem as you would think intuitively because they're very different businesses and they're providing different things to the shops, very different sales force, very different skill set from the sales force perspective. So I would say that there are some synergies, probably, not as high as you're thinking.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMC.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I did want to just follow up a bit on the past 2.5 weeks, the commentary that you said, Bill. It looks like tax refunds have flattened out here in the past couple of weeks. So should we interpret that these weeks look a lot more like the first 10 weeks of the quarter you just reported? Or how should we think about that?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, I'm going to go back to what I've said in the prepared remarks. I don't want to -- we called out those specific 2 weeks because they were in the quarter and they were vastly different than our other experiences, and we felt like we had a good handle on what drove it. But this time of year, there is such volatility in our business because the weather patterns change day-to-day and week-to-week. What we see is that the overall tax refunds are still substantially behind last year, and we don't necessarily know what the trajectory of how people are going to spend those tax refunds are. I don't want to get in -- any further into that 2.5-week period of time except to say, clearly, we're not running the negative 8 that we called out before, but they're still a lot variability in our sales at this point.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Fair enough. So is there a way to say -- or how are you thinking about what you get back from these deferred refunds? So is there a way to say, is it simple enough to say, hey, discretionary is x percentage of sales this time of year and that's what we could potentially forego? Or how do you think about it?","William C. Rhodes","I think that we don't have a good way to think about it because we haven't experienced it before. We believe when market flows in the -- when money flows in economy, particularly, through our kind of customers, that they get caught up on a lot of their maintenance and repair work. And I see no reason that, that will happen again this year. But then, you do worry about the timing changes. Hopefully, that will benefit us even more. If we can get some nice breaks in the weather and people want to get out and work on their car, it might be to our benefit. We just don't know at this point.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's a good segue, on the warm weather side, do you think that, that sequential increase into weeks 11 and 12 last year and likely, February and March's, is there -- have you done the analysis to say how much of that just warm weather pull-forward out of that April, May timeframe?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. Clearly, the mix of business that we did last year in those weeks was very different. We were experiencing a lot of -- we talked last year about the fact that we -- a lot of the spring categories got pulled forward into that period of time. But the overall trajectory of the business in weeks 11 and 12 was very consistent with the last 5 or 6 years that we'd had. Now the mix, we might have been selling batteries, while this last year, we were selling brake pads. But overall, we have always seen that significant lift and it didn't happen this year.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then finally, Bill Giles, maybe, could you talk about how you -- the long-term EPS double-digit growth algorithm. I guess, how long would you have to stay flat or negative for that algorithm not to hold true?","William T. Giles","I think if you look back historically, I mean, the organization has done a very good job of managing our expense structure in line with our environment that we're performing in. And so I mean, this is a good example of our company and virtually every facet of the organization doing a really good job of assessing their expense structure needs and cutting back where they need to. And so if you look back even before our business took off in '09, we were successful in growing our EPS growth at a double-digit rate and a flat comp. And so obviously, we don't believe that flat comp is in our future. We believe the industry will remain healthy and that we will continue to gain market share. But we certainly believe that we can -- the model that Bill articulated in his prepared remarks is the model that we can operate into the future. And certainly, at a slightly positive comp, we can perform very well.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you provide us with the mix of business between maintenance, failure, discretionary, for the Commercial side versus, I think, you've provided the overall?","William T. Giles","Yes, we typically stick with the overall. In fact, I don't even have the Commercial numbers in front of me to give you a view of that. Although, that's going to be, probably, a little bit more weighted towards the failure than on the DIY side. But I don't have the -- we don't disclose those numbers exactly. Clearly, the discretionary side would be way down so that would change that.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","When you look at the performance of sales to existing Commercial customers, how did that compare -- how has that compared over time? Has that basically tracked the overall performance of Commercial? Or has that been higher or lower?","William T. Giles","I would say, it has basically tracked the overall performance in Commercial. I think that what we're seeing is that we're still gaining good traction out of our existing customers, and more importantly, our older programs continue to perform well. Obviously, we clearly have opportunities, based on this quarter's performance, to improve our overall performance. But existing customers continue to do well.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then, the last question on that. Are you also seeing -- because you indicated that some of the newer programs haven't been as productive, are you seeing any increases in cannibalization rates as a result?","William T. Giles","Yes. I think, over time, we will see some impact of cannibalization. That will probably affect the overall numbers, but the reality of it is, is that, as Bill said before, we've got a very small market share and we've got a lot of work to do in order to capture more and more market share. The one thing I would mention on the newer programs, I wouldn't so much say that the newer programs are less productive, it's that we have a higher percentage of newer programs in the mix. And as a result of that, from a math perspective, it winds up taking down your average weekly sales for the total 3,000 programs.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Rhodes for any closing comments.","William C. Rhodes","Great. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. Our culture remains our key point of differentiation from our competition, and we must not lose sight of the importance of basic store execution in order to remain very successful. We have a solid plan to succeed for the remainder of 2013. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.

Our commercial business continued to expand with 6.3% sales growth over last year's first quarter while opening 35 net new programs. We expect to open approximately 200 net commercial programs this fiscal year.","At the end of the quarter, 83% of our domestic stores had a commercial program, and we continue to expand in Mexico opening five new stores. We didn't open any additional locations in Brazil or IMC this quarter. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone business.","While the domestic business dominated our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S.","Regarding the Internet, we experienced a challenging quarter. When I discuss online, I am referencing business shipped directly to the customer and not buy online and pick up in store. Our pickup in store business sales are recorded in store sales and are not in our all other category.","While our pickup in store business continues to thrive and is growing rapidly, our ship-to-home businesses were softer than last year. Our objective is to provide our customers with exceptional service regardless of how they want to interact with us, and it isn't surprising to us that many of them want to research their purchases online and then purchase or pick up their products in store.","This allows them to have immediate access to their purchases and afford them the opportunity to get the trustworthy advice they had come to expect from our AutoZoners. While our sales shortfall on ship-to-home purchases is not surprising to us, we're continuing to invest at an accelerated rate to improve the online shopping experience to ensure that our customers\u2019 interactions with us through any channel are exceptional.","While our DIY operations remain our number one priority, we are focused on growing our commercial business where our share is smaller. To this end, we've continued with our inventory placement and distribution initiatives in order to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry.","This past quarter, we've expanded our multiple delivery frequency rollouts to an additional 161 net locations and now have approximately 2100 of our 5300 domestic stores receiving three or more deliveries per week from our distribution centers.","Regarding our Mega Hub rollouts, we are working diligently on the development of future sites but we did not open any incremental locations this quarter. We continue to operate 11 Mega Hubs and expect to open several more over the remainder of fiscal 2017. Our Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations.","Additionally, we are continuing to expand our distribution network. In the first quarter, we opened our second distribution center in Mexico and have two distribution centers under construction in the United States. Our current expectations are for the first facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the other will open 6 to 12 months later.","Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, and ensure that we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.","To this end, our national sales meeting held in Memphis at the end of September, was entirely focused on providing wow customer service with an emphasis on saying, \u201cYes, We've Got It,\u201d to all of our customers\u2019 parts, products and advice needs.","We demonstrated our enhanced abilities to allow AutoZoners to be able to see and excess inventory at their stores, nearby stores, hubs, mega hubs, and vendor stocked inventory. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers\u2019 needs regardless of how difficult the request.","Under the Yes, We've Got It theme, we're focused on improving our closure rates. It is always surprising and disappointing to see how many customers leave our stores every day not having completed their intended purchase because we didn't have or couldn't find what they needed within our network.","In this spirit to help the customer, we're making ongoing significant systems, investments, and enhancements to capture data about our customers\u2019 shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone, and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers\u2019 needs.","Before getting into specifics on the first quarter, I would like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are two very discreet and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores, and the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available in the market before.","In our tests when combined, the initiatives were increasing sales between $1,000 and $1,500 per store per week. It is easier to evaluate the mega hub's success, because we would have had to order the parts through our special order system or bought them from someone else historically.","The multiple frequency of deliveries initiative is more difficult to evaluate because we would -- we could have transferred the merchandise from a different store or sent the customer to another store.","Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we've implemented this enhanced service in roughly 2,100 of our 5,300 domestic stores, and these stores are receiving deliveries from their distribution center at least three times a week. Some stores receive more deliveries than three, but weekly volumes determine the need as the sales lift from delivering to every store every day can't justify the higher expense.","Therefore, we sell it on a more staggered approach. I should emphasize this was up from the usual once-a-week delivery schedules we had historically run. With approximately 23,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, our inventory turns had a relatively low rate around 1.4 times per year. The vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of one.","Over the next nine months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to roughly an additional 300 stores. We have moderated our rollout pace over the remainder of the year to temper the significant change our distribution centers have to absorb and to manage our cost structure.","This past quarter's deleverage was above our cost expectations. Once we open our new distribution centers, it will allow us to expand the service in those areas at lower costs. We continue to model 15 to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017.","The second ongoing initiative is the Mega Hub store concept. We are currently operating 11 Mega Hubs and will open or expand several more Mega Hub stores in 2017. We are very excited about what the Mega Hubs allow us to offer customers.","As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores, multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations.","Currently we have over 3500 stores with access to Mega Hub inventory. A majority of these 3500 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today, but as we expand our Mega Hubs, more of them will receive the service, same day and many will receive it multiple times per day.","We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a Mega Hub is on average 20,000 square feet to 30,000 square feet or more.","Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging and takes time. While there are incremental costs to these rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017.","In order to provide more frequent deliveries to new stores, as well as to Mega Hubs, we're moving forward on our planned openings of two domestic distribution centers over the next couple of years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million.","For 2017, we will incur a majority of these two distribution centers investments in our CapEx budget. However we don't expect any domestic distribution center to come online until late fiscal 2017 or early fiscal 2018.","Now let's turn to our first quarter's results. Our sales increased 3.4%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 1.6%. This quarter's sales were consistent until the last couple of weeks of the quarter. Our sales were challenged the week of the Presidential election, which slowed our performance.","We did experience positive comps in every month of the quarter, however November's first week was challenging for us. We also continue to see the lingering effects of last year's mild winter, hampering our growth in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets. This is similar to 2012 when we also experienced a mild winter.","While we saw over a 400 basis point spread between these three markets and the others in the fourth quarter, the gap continue to tighten this quarter, where we saw an approximately 250 basis point spread, but in the last few weeks, that gap shrunk considerably. Our expectation is that this overhang will continue until winter weather returns.","In regard to our three primary merchandise categories, failure maintenance and discretionary merchandise, we didn't experience any significant divergence of trends. Failure and maintenance for AutoZone represented approximately 85% of our domestic business's mix.","This was usual for this time of the year. While the failure and discretionary categories were positive for DIY, the maintenance category was slightly negative. Our results were driven really by geography. Also our ticket was positive for both DIY and commercial, we saw traffic slightly negative for our DIY business, again regional performance played a key role in this result as the Midwestern or Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern market underperformance was traffic driven.","We opened 35 net new commercial programs in the quarter versus 55 net new programs in last year's first quarter. Our sales grew 6.3% on the quarter and commercial and our programs opened grew by 5%. As our programs mature, we believe our sales potential remains strong.","Regarding Mexico, we opened five stores this quarter and now have 488 total stores in Mexico. In local currency, Mexico experienced a strong quarter. However Mexico sales in U.S. dollars were below historic growth rates, given the roughly 23% decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollars based on year-over-year quarter ending rates.","Additionally as I said earlier, our second distribution in Mexico opened this past quarter. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 4.2% over last year. As a reminder, our all data and e-commerce businesses, which includes AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment.","As I mentioned, we saw slight traffic and ship-to-home sales challenged during the quarter. However we saw strength in our pickup in store sales. The strength in pick up in store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience, pickup in store while smaller than home delivery is quickly catching up and sales volume.","We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to their purchase and our e-Commerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience.","We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us at less than 5% of our total sales mix for the quarter, the omnichannel experience is important and we will continue to invest in our e-Commerce platform.","With continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM, as new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices, relative to income. This trend is encouraging for us.","Regarding our expectations for the remainder of 2017, our second quarter results are our most difficult comparison. However we are optimistic we can grow sales in all of our upcoming quarters. While having underperformed in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic during the winter and beyond, we believe we should improve in those regions.","Our history has shown we manage this business focusing on both short and long-term performance. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth.","Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating plan theme for 2017; Yes, We've Got It. The key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, Yes, We've Got It and leveraging information technology.","On the retail front this past quarter, under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we've been adding store payroll this year, we're now enhancing our training to store level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the Yes, We've Got It theme.","We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us.","Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our business. The focus is on making sure AutoZoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization, not just their store swiftly and accurately.","In regards to commercial, we opened 35 net new programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 programs into 2017. Our sales growth rate slowed in recent quarters. The industry saw a similar slowdown.","Our data shows we again gain share this past quarter. We believe last year's mild winter continue to hamper industry sales growth as regional discrepancies played a big role in commercial as well as retail.","As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this very important growth initiative.","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our first quarter at 31.3%. We're very pleased with this metric at it is one of the best if not the best in all of hard lines retailing.","However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost to capital.","It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investor's capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team's efforts to continue to deliver on their commitments. We remain bullish on our future performance because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners.","Now turn it over to Bill Giles.","Bill Giles","Thanks Bill and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter.","For the quarter, total auto part sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and 26 IMC branches, increased 3.7%. Switching over to macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out $2.24 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.16 a gallon, a slight decrease.","Now last year, gas prices decreased $0.42 per gallon, during the first quarter, starting at $2.51 and ending at $2.09 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customer's abilities to maintain their vehicles and as cost reductions of all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.","We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 1.6% in July. 2.9% in August and 2.9% in September. Now we don't have October or November data yet, but year-to-date through September, miles driven are up approximately 3% and ahead of last year's increase at this time.","The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 52-weeks ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,781,000 million -- or $1,781,000 for the quarter for the 52 weeks ended.","Now for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 6.3%. In the first quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $27 million over last year's first quarter. This past quarter, we opened 35 net new programs versus 55 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year.","We now have our commercial program in 4,425 stores or 83% of our domestic stores supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 900 of our programs are three years old or younger. In 2017, we expect to open approximately 200 new programs.","As we've begun our fiscal 2017, our trends have accelerated modestly, which is encouraging to us. We are very focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams, particularly the store managers and district managers.","We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers. We're encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel 2017 should be a better sales growth year than 2016.","Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened five new stores during the first quarter. We currently have 488 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores. As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales and base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation of the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year.","The peso devalued over the course of the quarter, but moved materially post the U.S. Election in November, while devaluing 23% year-over-year and weakened 11% in just this quarter, with the majority of the decline in the quarter in the first two weeks of November.","This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than if rates had remained constant. The EBIT dollar impact on the quarter assuming constant currency with last year's foreign exchange rate was meaningful, a roughly $6 million impact to EBIT.","We do believe the Mexico leadership team has done an exceptional job managing the peso denominated business and we continue to feel like the moves will be manageable.","Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating eight stores. Our plans are to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next few years, while our sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged over time by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars.","Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company in total, our sales were $2,468,000, an increase of 3.4% over last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores open more than one year were up 1.6% for the quarter.","Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales up 23 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives.","In regards to inflation it was again slightly down year-over-year. Currently we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses, but our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins.","It is important to note, we do not manage the targeted gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries caused.","We'll work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 34.1% of sales, lower by one basis point from last year's first quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat to last year as favorability across several areas was offset by higher domestic store payroll.","We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $459 million up 4.8% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.6%.","Interest expense for the quarter was $33.3 million, compared with $35 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.997 billion or $243 million more than last year's quarter balance of $4.754 billion.","Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR, while in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter our tax rate was 34.7% versus last year's Q1 of 35.9%. The deviation results was primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose, but additionally I want to take a moment to discuss AutoZone's first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard. The new standard has us recognizing the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expense on the P&L previously at flow through stockholder's equity.","This past quarter it lowered our tax rate 74 basis points and benefited EPS accordingly. However, this accounting change also has an effect on the diluted share count calculation, resulting in higher or more dilutive share count. Net income for the quarter was $278.1 million up 7.8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.7 million was down 4.6% from last year's first quarter.","The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $6.36 up 13% over the prior year's first quarter. The new accounting standard just mentioned increased our diluted share count by 226,000 shares, reducing our reported EPS by $0.08 a share, netting the benefit in our tax rate with the impact from a higher reported diluted share count raised our EPS by $0.03 on the quarter.","While not a large impact on the EPS, we feel it is important for investors to know how the accounting change will affect results, we'll continue to keep you abreast of any impacts going forward in future quarters.","Relating to the cash flow statement for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $407 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter, totaled $98 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 23 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and Mega Hub store remodels and openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters, development of our new Mexico DC and some minor investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments.","With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,313 stores in 50 states, the district of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 488 stores in Mexico and eight in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,809. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,835.","Depreciation totaled $71.8 million for the quarter, versus last year's fiscal quarter expense of $66.3 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $363 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter.","At quarter end, we had $783 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at quarter end. Again I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria.","We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.3%.","Next I would like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 7.3% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $647,000 versus $624,000 last year and $625,000 just this past quarter.","Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis was a negative $67,000 versus a negative $66,000 last year and negative $80,000 this past quarter.","Finally as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. We're pleased to report our 41st consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth delivering an EPS growth rate of 13% this quarter. While we continue to experienced more regional sales differences than usual, our company executed exceptionally well.","Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge.","We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.","Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the exciting initiatives we have in store for fiscal 2017. We will continue to expand our AutoZone store footprint in the United States, Mexico and Brazil, opening approximately 200 locations combined.","We will open roughly 200 additional commercial programs, our inventory availability efforts will expand with the opening of another handful of Mega Hubs and with the further expansion of multiple deliveries per week to 300 or so more stores.","We've already opened our second distribution center in Mexico and we have two domestic distribution centers currently under construction. Our investments in technology continue to accelerate with an intensified focused on our online offerings.","And lastly, we are talking more, more about saying, Yes, We've Got It to our customers. We are determined to meet all of our customer's needs in 2017. Our offerings are the best they have ever been and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base.","At the end of the day, our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations. We're excited about our initiatives around inventory assortments and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, All Data, e-Commerce, Brazil and IMC.","Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength and we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits.","We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution is a formula for success.","Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and ensure and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC, each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.","Now we would like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alan Rifkin from BTIG. Your line is now open.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you very much. My first question relates to, Bill your commentary regarding e-Commerce. Not the buy online, pick-up-in-store aspect, but the e-Commerce that\u2019s transacted and shipped. You said that that business you felt was challenging. Can you maybe provide a little bit of color behind that, and as a bigger picture, do you think net-net, your industry really lends itself to e-commerce penetration in a significant way going forward?","Bill Giles","Thanks Alan. Actually, ladies and gentlemen first, just to level set, it's not a material amount of business being conducted from an e-commerce perspective for AutoZone overall.","Secondly during the quarter, we were little less promotional online, and we pulled back a little bit from some of our paid advertising as well. What we're more focused on is improving the experience for the customer; and as Bill mentioned before, we continue to drive a lot of sales through buy online and pick up in store, and that part of the business continues to remain very strong.","From a pure ship to home basis on both AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, those were little softer during the quarter, but like I said, we - that we were a little less promotional during the quarter, and we're also investing some things in the platform that will probably slow us down a little bit as we continue to migrate through that.","So when you think about e-commerce, we're not immune to sales through e-commerce, but at the same time, when you think about the experience that you have walking into an AutoZone store, there's a lot of trustworthy advice that\u2019s taking place, and so when someone walks in and wants to buy a battery which you can't buy online because you can\u2019t ship it, we\u2019ll likely test your entire starting and charging system in order to ensure that that is the problem that you are - we are going to solve for you.","So there's a lot of things that take place in the store between starters and alternators that are core - that have cores attached, that require those products to come back. There's an ability for an AutoZoner to walk out to the car and be able to assess and ensure that the customer is getting what they need and being able to resolve their issues and being able to see the part before they purchase it.","So there's a lot of things that experience inside of a store that you can't duplicate online. Again we're not immune to online sales, but we believe that there are a lot of attributes that make it unique inside the store, the experience inside the store.","Alan Rifkin","Okay, thank you Bill. My follow up is for Bill Rhodes. Bill you said that with respect to the increased delivery program, the frequency of delivery program, there will be a total of 300 in this fiscal year, more than half of which have already been opened.","It sounds like though you\u2019re slowing that program down just a little bit so that the DC infrastructure can be built. Is that a correct assumption in my part, and if so what would be the incremental savings with respect to just pulling back a little bit on the increased delivery frequency program. Thank you.","Bill Rhodes ","It's hard to say and to net out. So couple of things, one, I may not have been perfectly clear in my remarks. We\u2019ve opened roughly 161 so far this year, we opened 161. We're going to open 300 more. So think about 100 per quarter for the balance of the year where we had been running at about 300 stores per quarter.","So, we are deliberately slowing the rollout of multiple frequency of delivery. The biggest reason that we are slowing the rollout is because we put a massive amount of change on our supply chain over the last couple of years getting to these 2100 locations that are already on there. So just think about that, that\u2019s 4200 incremental deliveries for our supply chain in just two years alone and that has just been a massive amount of change, and we need to slow down and let them absorb that change.","We're also mindful that it does impact our cost structure, and so we want to slow it down mainly for the supply chain but also to make sure that we continue to have reasonable profitability, and as we mentioned it cost us roughly 15 basis points in the quarter but there are other costs that aren\u2019t in that number just from the amount of change that we\u2019ve had in our supply chain and those kind of things. So we're going to slow it down a little bit.","Alan Rifkin","Okay. Thank you both very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good morning. Bill, I guess without the - Bill Rhodes sorry, without maybe that election time frame or bump - that you mentioned you experienced, I guess we\u2019re left to assume that the business is running maybe around two or little better than that.","Does the business need weather to get back to that level sustainably or is that about sort of the right run rate, and I guess connected to it, can you tell us if the weather impacted markets, are they running in positive territory or are they at negative territory?","Bill Rhodes","Great question, Simeon. First of all, your assessment about what would happen without the week of the election is probably pretty accurate. We are running close to it two comp for the quarter. I do believe that there is still a headwind in our overall comp from the lingering effects of last year's mild winter. We said that it moderated but we still had a 250 basis point gap between what happened in those markets and what happened in the other markets.","So to do the math, if there's 250 basis points, we ran a 1.6 comp, clearly those markets ran negative comp for the quarter. I believe just as we saw in 2012, once the effects of a cold winter hit, we will see improvements in our overall comps in those markets clearly. But I would also want to be careful it is not going to happen overnight and I'll give you some examples.","Last year during this period of time in December, it was very robust and our sales were really strong but they weren\u2019t strong in the categories that we traditionally sold, we were doing really well with things like under car brakes and the like chassis because the weather was conducive for people to do maintenance projects that they normally don't do this time of year.","So we in essence, pulled brake business forward and we didn\u2019t get the failure business. So we had a pretty strong Q2 last year, it was really Q3 and Q4 and now into Q1 where we saw the bigger impact from the lack of serious winter last year.","So we\u2019re excited that we're about to see the first really cold snap of the year. We're excitedly to see what that will mean to us but it'll be really Q3 before we expect to see any rebound.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And my follow-up I think you mentioned that some of the supply chain costs were higher than what you would've liked and I think that's what you mentioned, if I\u2019m not mistaken the press release at 14 basis point to supply chain cost, that seems a little lower than the 20 basis point run rate that I think was in the long-term guidance and roughly where you been running. So why if that's all right, why is 14 basis points I guess disappointing?","Bill Giles","Yes, I would say that, the 14 basis point is really what we can tie specifically to more frequent deliveries. We definitely believe that there is some overhang costs that are occurring inside the distribution centers that are probably related to that.","We just didn't tag to it specifically, so our de-leverage on supply chain was in the mid-20s for the quarter but it was probably only 14 that we could specifically call for the actually -- more frequent deliveries.","But we recognize look based on the run rate that we were going as far as the rollout is just prudent to pullback a little bit and be able to improve the efficiencies of the organization as we move through this but still committed to rolling it, we\u2019re just going to roll a few left as we move forward.","But going forward I would think it would be around 15 basis points and hope for the overall de-leverage to be a little bit less.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Lasser","Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. First on your commentary around the Internet. Can you contrast the customer who would buy online and have a product shipped either at home versus the customer that would quote your store and either buy there or initially by it online and pick up it in a store.","Are they the same customers that you're migrating customers from one channel to another or is the profile different.","Bill Rhodes","I think that in many cases the customers are saying, they\u2019re probably omnichannel customers overall. They just may have different shopping needs at the moment so think about things like accessories et cetera, those might lend themselves a little bit more tuned online because they're not needed at the moment and there may not be a significant amount of advice required for making that purchase versus it could be the very same customer who wants to do a great job or wants to do engine management job but also wants to make sure that they know what they're doing.","So they walk into the store and be able to see the product make sure it matches up with the exact fit et cetera, they may also want to get some repair instructions that they can get at the store and they may also need a tool that is very specific to that job that quite frankly they don't want to go out and spend the money to buy that tool for a one-time usage and they can come to the store for a longer tool.","So I think that it's because it can be both the customer using both channels overall, just different purposes.","Michael Lasser","And you had indicated that both your AutoAnything and your core AutoZone business decelerated is that right, can you just size the relative difference of those businesses within the e-commerce portfolio?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, I would say that the AutoAnything business is obviously larger than the AutoZone e-commerce businesses from a shift to home perspective. AutoZone.com is really about being able to again create an omnichannel environment for a customer to come and be able to do research on products ensure that it's in stock and then possibly either buy it online or pick it up in store, buy it online have it shipped to home or just gain the information which is typically what happens and then go to the store for the purchase.","So both sides were down and the number we reported is probably close enough for both and again different reasons but we did pull back from our sales perspective and also from paid advertising perspective.","Michael Lasser","Let me add one last follow-up question. On the difference between the weather and the non-weather affected market, do you see, you saw the spread narrow and trends were improved a bit from last quarter, could it be non-weather impacted markets decelerate over the course of the quarter or was the gap narrowed only because the weather impacted markets got better?","Bill Giles","Remember our comps this quarter were about 60 basis points ahead of where they were last quarter, I think it's fair to say I don't have it right in front of me but the balance of the chain ran about the same that they ran last quarter plus or minus 20 basis points.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot, good morning to you. So my first question most likely for Bill Giles, your SG&A dollars were up I believe 3.4% year-on-year year which is a very mild increase relative to trend and I know you had acquisitions were part of that time, so the dollar growth is an apples-to-apples but that\u2019s still a very tight kind of quarter from an expense control perspective.","Can you talk about how expense dollars trended versus your budget and if we can give about expenses per store or whatever the appropriate metric is whether this is a good benchmark or whether as the sales recover presumably what compares and weather et cetera that expense growth rate would pick up a bit from here.","Bill Giles","Yes, that\u2019s a great question Matt, and I think as we've always said you know we\u2019re going to play the environment we operate in, so we have managed costs tight during this quarter and the whole organization quite frankly has done a really terrific job of pitching in and finding opportunities for them to reduce cost during this quarter and as you know we get harsher weather as we progress through the year and sales get back to higher numbers than they are today, then we probably will invest a little bit back more into the SG&A and be able to support some of the things people may wanted to do this quarter that they were unable to do","So I think will continue to manage it really tight and we\u2019ll continue to play in an environment we exist in.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks for that. A question related to expenses there is obviously a court ruling a couple weeks back about some of the adjustments to overtime laws which I know has attended some of the planning a lesser companies have done, we\u2019re going to have to maintain just the compensation structures.","Can you talk about what kind of contingencies you have put in place to accommodate what we're going to be to new laws and what you're planning is from here going forward on that front?","Bill Rhodes","It's a great question Matt. First of all based upon our compensation programs and where we were, we didn't have terribly material changes to have to make. Certainly there were some people that we had to move up on the scale and we had already communicated that to them and so we're living up to that communication and we're sticking with the changes. You will not hear us call that out as a material driver of our labor going forward but there's a little bit of an impact there.","Matthew Fassler","And then finally you had this accounting change with stock option exercise tax treatment et cetera, will we see that anymore or just a one-time adjustment and do we have tax rate and share count moving around in all from here on it.","Bill Rhodes","Actually we will. Unfortunately, I mean - from an accounting perspective that came through that, I think will just create a little bit of volatility on the EPS number but we are committed to basically breaking it out for you guys so you can see in just as we did this quarter and our highlights page so you can see the breakout but yes it's basically a function of when options are exercised and there'll be an impact so we\u2019ll report as we go forward.","Matthew Fassler","So that's depending on activity in any given quarter rather than to having a new baseline tick to put in place?","Bill Rhodes","100%.","Bill Giles","It was pretty muted this quarter by the way, so it will increase volatility going forward.","Matthew Fassler","Understood. Thank you so much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Seth Sigman","Thanks a lot and good morning. I just have two follow-ups. First just on the online business, if you look at the pure online sales plus whatever is bought online and pick up in the store, so sort of the omnichannel sales, what sort of growth are you seeing and like how would you size up the omnichannel business in aggregate?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, I would say in fairness it's not a material dollar amount to the organization and so we can quantify et cetera but it's \u2013 it's not significant to the organization overall. But we\u2019re more focused on as making sure that we have a great experience for our customers when they come to the website so that they can get all the information that they want, they can learn about product, find-out whether it tends stock pricing et cetera and then learn if it showing good, better, best et cetera and then go to the store and be able to purchase it or ship it to their home or buy online and pick up and store it.","At the moment, many people come to the website to gain information before shopping at the store so that - what we're looking for is to ensure that we've got a great shopping experience in all different channels that the customers coming to. At the moment, many of them are coming to get information and then shopping at the store. However our buy online and pick up at store program albeit small is growing at a quick rate.","Seth Sigman","And Bill given that earlier you discussed how most SKUs in the store have maybe a quantity of one on hand and given the popularity to buy online pick up in store obviously the consumer wants to come to the stores in these situations, how do you effectively manage the availability to serve that trend?","Bill Giles","I think that\u2019s no different, that trend is no different than the trend that we have in people that are walking in the store today. It is very challenging to make sure that we're in stock when we have roughly 70% of the skews and the store have one piece on the shelf and frankly that's why we're doing this multiple frequency of delivery.","Before if you bought at the first day we get the truck, we would be out for seven or eight days or trying to get it back in stock quicker for whether it's for the walk-in customer, the commercial customer and the online customer.","Seth Sigman","Okay. And just one follow-up on the gap in regional trends, so if the gap this quarter was 250 basis points and then last few weeks, you said that gap shrunk considerably, it doesn't seem like weather really changed meaningfully over that period. So is there something else that would be causing that improvement?","Bill Rhodes","No I think we probably don't need to be focused too much on a week or two and what happened. What we did say was we had closed at the end of the quarter. There was a lot of things going on at the end of the quarter, including the election.","What we did say was we anticipate there will continue to be a gap this quarter, hopefully beyond that of close.","Seth Sigman","Understand. Thank you very much.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Brian Nagel","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning.","Brian Nagel","I wanted to follow-up on your election comment and with a number of retailers across sector had discussed this selection back lately. So the question I have is, if you look at the AutoZone data, do you think that the weakness we saw heading in June and around the election was just simply reflection trepidation on the part of the consumer or did AutoZone pull back on marketing as some other companies have eluded to that may have maybe impacted the call to action for consumer spend.","Bill Rhodes","We absolutely didn\u2019t change our game plan one bit and won't change it going forward. When we talk about the election, in fact yes it was a little bit softer going into the election.","A couple of days after the election, there were a lot of people -- there were a lot of people who were surprised by outcome of the election and we saw it clearly in our sales and then it kind of rebounded from there. So I don\u2019t want to overplay that, but it clearly was a -- it was a meaningful difference for two or three days.","Brian Nagel","Thank you. And then the follow-up question I had, going back some comments you made in your script regarding closures and that opportunity within your stores, we discussed this before. So a two-part question, we wonder are you seeing with the initiatives behind improving closures from the store, are we seeing some progress not front.","And then maybe help us reframe again frame just the what the magnitude of the opportunity is to improve that closure metric?","Bill Rhodes","I think clearly the closer we get the parts to the customer, we see improvements in closure rates and clearly the easiest way for us to see it and measure it definitively is with the Mega Hubs and the Mega Hubs are really performing well and that\u2019s why we're pushing as hard as we can on the them to get that inventory closer and closer to the customer.","Brian Nagel","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore\/ISI. Your line is now open.","Greg Melich","Great. Actually I have a couple follow-ups. How much did inflation or deflation impact the COGS and the topline in the quarter and then I've a follow-up?","Bill Rhodes","I would say not significant Greg. We have a little bit of deflation, a lot of its oil related to some extent, but I would say there is a mix between category. Some categories did have inflation but let's just answer the question quickly and I would say not material.","Greg Melich","Got it. And then the second question I had was where are we now in terms of private label penetration? If we were thinking about your sourcing and put in the three buckets, how much has sourced domestically, how much do you think comes from outside the U.S. and I know that like how much is your own sourcing versus the vendor finding them and bringing it in just rough numbers?","Bill Giles","Yeah, I would say our private label product is probably in the over 50%, probably in the 50% tile 50% to 55% overall. I would say that direct imports is probably in the teams kind of a number. As far as products that are sourced overseas that we sell in its entirety, it's got to be now with our around 70% I don\u2019t know the number exactly, but it's probably pretty close to around that 70% number.","Greg Melich","Okay. Great. Nice summary. And then last and this is shifting on inventory, but more about where you put it and why, as you put them the more inventory in the stores, I think you mentioned that it gets picked up by everybody. It helps sales in both DIY and Do It for Me.","What is the percentage like when you find that you're in stock, are you with these additional SKUs closer to the customer? Is it still 80-20 DIY versus commercial or a 50-50 or helpful about how that's progressed?","Bill Giles","I would say it's between those two. It's not the traditional 80-20. Generally when we're doing particularly with the Mega Hub inventory, that is newer vehicle inventory. So it skews towards commercial, but we're always amazed at how much we actually sell in DIY.","So it's probably and it depends by category that\u2019s hard to give you a generic answer, but it's probably in the 60-40 range.","Greg Melich","Interesting. Thanks a lot. Good luck guys.","Bill Giles","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Wewer from Raymond James & Associates. Your line is now open.","Dan Wewer","Hi. Thanks. Bill Giles, you noted that commercial sales growth should accelerate in 2017 compared to 2016, how would you look at the outlook for the do-it-yourself channel? Do you think it accelerates as well?","Bill Giles","I think when you think about some of the impacts that we've had from the weather overall, I think that it was an overhang for both sides of the business quite frankly and so I think that we're optimistic as we head into fiscal 2017 with a normalized winter. I think the business overall should improve.","Dan Wewer","And I just want to clarify, Bill Rhodes your comment that perhaps the Thursday or Friday after the election, you did see business return back to that 2% same-store sales run rate.","Bill Rhodes","I wasn\u2019t that specific Dan to be more specific than I appear to be. What I said was there was a notable meaningful drop in our sales call it Wednesday, Thursday and even into Friday. I think it's more driven by weather and other impacts but you can clearly see it for two or three days.","Dan Wewer","And then the last question going back to Bill Giles, with the sharp change in interest rates since the Election, how does that impact the performance and profitability of the vendor financed inventory model?","Bill Giles","We've always looked at -- as you know we always look at interest as an input cost overall. So there's a variety of input costs that it takes to manufacture a product whether it's the dealer energy or an interest as another component of that. So we'll just continue to manage that with our vendors like we do all other costs.","Dan Wewer","Okay. Thank you.","Bill Giles","All right. Thank you, Dan.","Bill Rhodes","Okay. Before we conclude the call, I would just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be very solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year.","We will not take anything at all for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We've a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint.","As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call and we would like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year. Thanks for joining us today.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

Rhodes","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's Fiscal 2012 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Store Development and IT; and Brian Campbell, Vice President and [ph] Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another very solid quarter and strong fiscal year. This is the first time in our history that we've had AutoZoners living outside of North America. We now have AutoZoners working on 2 new continents: South America, with our upcoming first store opening in Brazil; and in Germany, with our recent launch of ALLDATA Europe. We welcome these new AutoZoners to this great team, and we look forward to working closely with them to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities in these new geographies.","This quarter marked our 24th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. We're very pleased with our ability to consistently deliver strong EPS growth through our financial model of steady mid-single-digit growth in EBIT dollars or better, along with high single-digit reductions in our diluted share count. Our goal quarter-over-quarter continues to be to provide consistency to our shareholders, our AutoZoners and our customers. We feel this targeted consistency in both financial performance as well as execution of our key initiatives results in stability and confidence for our stockholders and our AutoZoners.","Two weeks from today, we'll be hosting our National Sales Meeting here in Memphis, where we'll celebrate our best-performing AutoZoners and celebrate our successes. As usual, the new objectives for 2013 will be introduced during this session. We have some very exciting growth opportunities ahead in the new year, and we're all very excited about the opportunity to discuss them with our field organization.","Next, I'd like to highlight our sales results for this past quarter. Our sales were up 4.6%, and our same-store sales were up 2.1%. This quarter's same-store sales results compared to last year's fourth quarter comp result of 4.5%. While same-store sales results are a combination of both our Retail and Commercial businesses, I should point out our total Commercial sales were up 16% over last year's fourth quarter, driven by a combination of existing programs and the addition of 394 programs over the last fiscal year.","Our sales performance for the quarter was a little softer than we were expecting when we began the quarter. Our results were generally consistent from one month to the next. However, the sequential results were not what defined this quarter's sales results.","There were substantial differences in sales by regions. This regional discrepancy led to the difference in same-store sales results in this year's Q4 from last. This year, the stores in the areas we'll define as the Northeast, Great Lakes and Plains underperformed materially compared to the rest of our store base. While representing about 1\/3 of our total store base, their results affected our overall story in both Retail and Commercial. To put some context on the separation of results, while our comp -- our overall comp was 2.1% for the quarter compared with 4.5% last year, stores for all other regions exceeded their equivalent same-store sales results from last year.","As we analyze our results regionally, we believe that our initiatives are having a positive impact. The challenges we have experienced in the Northeast, Plains and Great Lakes appear more macro in nature and less about specific actions we or any of our competitors have taken. This part of the country's sales results are behaving in a different manner.","Additionally, based on industry sales data that's available, results show we continue to outpace our total competitive base in both DIY and Commercial businesses.","Speaking in regard to our DIY business. As we've discussed in the past, we break product categories into failure, maintenance and discretionary purchases. As we've also said previously, maintenance products have not had the sales growth the other sectors have had this year. Maintenance routinely represents about 40% of any quarter sales, and this category for us has been growing over the last year in the low single-digit range versus the failure and discretionary categories growing in the mid-single-digit range. The products we sell categorized as maintenance are typically those an owner's manual says should be changed out at some select mileage interval.","As we reviewed at a more detailed level, we noticed this maintenance category weakness was pronounced in the 3 areas of the country previously mentioned, and that was the primary contributor to our overall same-store sales weakness for those regions and the country. This past quarter, the 3 regions we've mentioned had much weaker-than-expected sales, specifically in this category. And even more specifically, just a handful of merchandise lines made up the primary reason for these challenging same-store sales results, not just the negative maintenance results but the overall negative results for these regions.","Excluding these categories, our results in these areas and in total would have been consistent with other regions. Now in saying this, I should point out there are always better and worse-performing regions across the country. And not so coincidentally, we usually don't discuss those items with you. But because the results this quarter were so distinctive on a geographic basis, we decided to call this out.","These categories, to probably no one's surprise, are weather-sensitive categories. It would be easy for us to say a mild winter and lack of wear would cause these parts to not be replaced during the summer. But it might not be the entire answer. We don't exactly know the answer, and we believe the only way we'll know for sure is time, time to compare these regions' results against the upcoming winter and spring. At this point, we don't believe any sales correlations to miles driven, new car sales or gas prices in these parts of the country exist to explain the sales fall-off.","This morning, we do want to call out some great milestones achieved this past quarter. We opened our 5,000th store in Alaska this quarter, entering our 49th state. We also opened our 3,000th domestic Commercial program as we now have Commercial programs in approximately 65% of our domestic stores. We also completed 18 additional hub projects, taking our hub resets for the year to 40. Including last year's, 60 hub projects have been completed. We continue to be quite pleased with the sales benefits from the reset hubs as we have increased the size and\/or improved the location, allowing us to expand the number of SKUs offered on a same-day basis in the market. These SKUs have benefited both Retail and Commercial customers.","Regarding Mexico, we opened our 300th store this quarter and finished with 321 stores. Sales in our other businesses achieved very solid sales results. Our ALLDATA and E-Commerce businesses continued to perform well, increasing 6.3% over last year. There are great opportunities for E-Commerce sales growth on both a business-to-business basis and to an individual customer or B2C.","We continue to remain bullish on our industry sales growth opportunities on both Retail and Commercial over the long term. As the vehicle population continues to age and consumers continue to look for good values while maintaining their vehicles, we see AutoZone's opportunity to sell to these customers only growing.","Now let me review our highlights regarding execution on our operating theme for 2012, 1TEAM Driving our Future. The key priorities for the year were Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our Commercial business, leveraging the Internet and hub store improvements.","On the Retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We continued to invest in training our store AutoZoners. We continued to enhance and update our Z-net software, and we began to roll out our new labor management system that will replace our legacy system.","In regards to Commercial, we opened 107 programs during the quarter and ended the year with an additional 394 programs. This easily exceeds last year's 235 openings. We continue to see Commercial as a material sales growth driver for us for many years to come. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.","Finally, in regard to initiatives, I'd like to highlight the progress that we've made on our hub stores this quarter. This past quarter, we expanded or relocated 18 hubs, allowing us to expand our assortment in these markets and continue to increase our yes percentage for both Retail and Commercial. As part proliferation continues to expand and vehicle technology advances continue to occur, in many cases it results in more inventory dollars and lower turns. We continue to see the hub store as our central strategy in expanding our distribution abilities going forward. We believe our hub strategy allows us to have very strong local market coverage available for the same-day delivery, and we believe our distribution strategy is highly efficient. We have been and will continue to add incremental inventory to our local market hub stores to meet this demand. The constant SKU proliferation in our industry has driven the remodels of existing hubs we've been talking about this year.","I'll take a moment now to talk more specifically about our fourth quarter performance in more detail. Our domestic same-store sales grew 2.1% for the quarter. Our fourth quarter, which ended August 25, did experience some variability in month-to-month sales results. But the differences were not the story for our results this quarter, though regional inconsistencies were much more the story. This separation in results began in April for us and continued through the end of the quarter. As we've said previously, the category of sales we define as maintenance had the most challenging comparison on the quarter. With approximately 40% of our sales in this classification, sales of this category were soft, particularly in a subset of geographic regions.","Although it's not possible to know with certainty the cause, the simplest explanation we have to these results is it appears mostly weather driven. As we said previously, weather always evens out over the long term, so we never get too excited on the upside or downside. We do not believe that the softness was due to any actions we or our competitors took.","This regional difference in results carried through to our Commercial business as well. The magnitude of the slowdown was similar across both businesses on this regional basis. However, we continue to be very excited about our growth opportunities in the Commercial business. We continue to open Commercial programs very aggressively across the country. Our small market share and current growth trajectory from our newer programs gives us confidence in our future to build out potential.  We will continue to invest to grow our Commercial business and penetrate a larger percentage of our existing store base.","I'd like to also mentioned the other businesses. ALLDATA and E-Commerce had another fine quarter, up 6.3% in sales from this time last year. This portion of our business, while small as a percentage of our overall sales mix, continues to experience faster sales growth than the auto parts stores.","Over the last year, we have been very focused on leveraging the Internet across our businesses. We've been expanding our product offerings and aggressively building our capabilities to serve our business-to-business customers more effectively. An example of this is our launch of the ALLDATA product in Europe.","While there are many stories on the economic challenges facing Europe, we remain very upbeat on the sales potential in this area of the world. There are competitors to ALLDATA there today, but we feel there's a real point of differentiation with our product. While in the very early innings of tapping into these growing customer segments that utilize the Internet for researching or ordering their parts and products, we continue to have a healthy runway for growth by leveraging the Internet across the enterprise.","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish 2012 at 33%. This statistic has improved each quarter this past year, reflecting our efforts to efficiently use the capital we deploy. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital is our investor's capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to state how excited we are to start our new fiscal year. We felt 2012 was a very good year, marking our third consecutive year of comparable 20%-plus EPS growth. As our business model allows us superb sightlines into cash generating capabilities, we feel we can have a very solid new year. We remain deliberate in our expense and capital management in order to deliver consistent financial performance while positioning the business to succeed for years to come.","Now I'll turn it over to Bill.","William T. Giles","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and Mexico results for the quarter.","For the quarter, total auto parts sales increased 4.6% on top of last year's fourth quarter's growth of 8%. This segmentation includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses and our Mexico stores. During the fourth quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.79 a gallon and ended the quarter at $3.78 a gallon. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.34 per gallon during the fourth quarter, starting at $3.97 and ending at $3.63 a gallon.","We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles, and the more recent higher prices are unfortunate. During the quarter, prices had dipped at the end of June to the $3.40 a gallon range nationally but increased sequentially starting in July. Gas seems to be comfortably locked in this mid to high $3 a gallon range for unleaded.","At the same time, with gas prices remaining at these overall higher levels, we continue to communicate through our marketing messages to our customers the steps they can take to improve their gas mileage. Miles driven were down 0.4% in April, up 2.3% in May and then up 0.4% in June. Year to date through June, miles driven were up 1.1%.","The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-old and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear.","For the trailing 4 quarters, total auto parts sales per average square foot were $263. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry, and this metric is up 2.1% over last year's fourth quarter. This impressive improvement is a key contributor to our record EBIT margin percent and our record return on invested capital.","For the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 15.9%, and for the quarter, Commercial represented 15.6% of our total sales and grew $59 million over last year's fourth quarter. Last year's Commercial sales mix percent was 14.1%.","As we have said previously, overall, we've been very pleased with the progress we are making in our Commercial business both operationally and financially, and we remain on track with our plans. There remains ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings, and therefore, we are optimistic about the future of this business. We believe we can grow revenues in existing stores, and we will continue to open additional Commercial programs.","This past quarter, we opened 107 new programs versus 104 in our fiscal fourth quarter of last year. We expanded the number of stores with the Commercial program by 3.6% during this quarter and 14.8% over last year's fourth quarter ended. We now have our Commercial program in 3,053 stores supported by 149 hub stores. Approximately 33% of our programs are 3 years old or younger. With only 65% of our domestic stores having a Commercial program and our average revenue per program materially below several of our competitors, we believe there is ample opportunity for additional program growth aside from improved productivity opportunities in current programs.","In regard to the current quarter, this was the first in 9 quarters we fell below a 20% growth rate. The effect of the 3 regions Bill mentioned earlier in the call had an impact on our Commercial results as well, in fact, more so than on the DIY business. These markets were a full 15% lower in growth rate than last year in Q4.","Our other regions were in line with last year's results. Again, a similar subset of merchandise drove this material decline. And we feel like weather probably had some impact on these results, certainly not all, but we believe if we experienced a more normal winter from a weather perspective coming up, sales will improve in these markets.","In regard to our future, we're focused on building upon the Commercial initiatives that have been in place for the last few years. We continue to watch our sales force mature. We're also enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize productivity of our sales force. We've increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. We feel our product distribution model is scalable going forward, and we are continuing to attach [ph] additional enhancements to our offerings.","In addition to our focus on further developing and expanding our sales force, we expect to continue adding additional late-model import and domestic coverage both in satellite and hub stores. In what remains a validation of our ongoing strategy, our Duralast brand continues to gain traction with our Commercial customers.","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our Commercial programs, having opened over 750 programs over the past 36 months, a 33% increase. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share. Our performance and current model demonstrate an ability to scale this business in a profitable manner. We continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business.","Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 24 new stores during the fourth quarter and finished the year with 42 new stores. We currently have 321 stores in Mexico. We remain resolute on our strategy to open stores at a steady pace while managing our Mexico business for the long run. We have operated stores in Mexico now for over 13 years, and we continue to see great opportunity for growth going forward. Our returns and profit growth have been in line with our expectations.","Our efforts to open new stores in Brazil are progressing, and we expect to open our first store during first quarter of 2013. We've also expanded ALLDATA to Europe. Both of these initiatives remain in the early stages and will be implemented in a measured fashion. Neither should have a significant impact on our financial results over the midterm planning horizon.","Recapping our fourth quarter performance for the company in total, our sales for the quarter were $2,764,000,000, an increase of 4.6% from last year's fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 2.1% for the quarter.","Gross margin for the quarter was 51.8% of sales, up 64 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher margins on merchandise growth. The increased merchandise margins were primarily due to lower acquisition costs.","In regards to inflation, we've seen rising costs in commodity-related products throughout the year, although at lower levels than last year. However, we have generally been able to pass along this cost inflation. At this point, we expect subdued producer pricing heading into the new year, and therefore, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we will make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the Retail and Commercial businesses. However, we do not manage to a target gross profit margin percentage. As the growth of Commercial business has been a steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have to continuously work strategies to offset this. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars, and gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment were up 5.9% for the quarter.","SG&A for the quarter was 31.6% of sales, higher by 20 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The primary driver on the quarter's operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 45 basis points of deleverage in store payroll and 39 basis points of deleverage from higher self-insurance costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation.","This year, self-insurance was a material headwind for us. The exposure we're seeing in this area, made up of medical, workers' compensation, auto and general liabilities, remains a concern for us. We believe what we've seen in these areas is extreme for us relative to past years, and we continue to work to better manage these costs going into 2013.","While we've experienced higher operating expense percentage growth this past couple of years, higher than our historic growth rates, we've been deliberate with our expenditures. We have purposely invested dollars in our strategic Retail and Commercial business initiatives to position the company for future sales and profit growth. This organization takes great pride in the disciplined approach to managing our cost structure and leveraging our culture of thrift, and we remain committed to appropriately managing expenses in line with our overall performance.","Our current expenditures have been made to better position our company for future growth, a good example being the acceleration in opening Commercial programs. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure for the foreseeable future.","Earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the quarter was $560 million, up 6.9% over last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 20.3% or 44 basis points versus the previous year's fourth quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $58.1 million compared with $53.8 million in Q4 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $3,768,000,000 or approximately $417 million more than last year's fourth quarter balance of $3,352,000,000.","Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease debt levels based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.5%, below last year's fourth quarter of 35.9%. While the company's tax rate has benefited us the last few years, finishing at approximately 36% on a full year basis, we would like to let you know we expect our full year rate to be approximately 36.8% this upcoming year and most likely 37% in the first quarter. These higher rates are due to the expiration of employee tax credits which have not yet been extended by Congress. And we just want you to plan accordingly for a slightly higher rate in Q1.","Net income for the quarter of $324 million was up 7.4% versus the prior year's fourth quarter. Our diluted share count of 38.3 million was down 8.9% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $8.46, up 17.8% over the prior year's fourth quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, we generated $420 million of operating cash flow. On a full year basis, we generated $1,220,000,000 in operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 7% versus last year, and capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $150 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 96 new stores and relocate 2 stores this quarter, also capital expenditures on existing stores, out store remodel efforts and work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters. For all of fiscal 2012, our CapEx was $378 million.","With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,685 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and 321 stores in Mexico for a total store count of 5,006.","Depreciation totaled $66.7 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $62.9 million.","With our excess cash flow, we purchased -- we repurchased $480 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we purchased $1,363,000,000 of AutoZone stock. We've now bought over $1 billion in stock in each of the last 4 years, totaling approximately $5.3 billion in those 4 years. At the end of the quarter, we had $356 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 111%, basically flat with last year's fourth quarter. While we expect we have some room to increase this ratio going forward, we expect the rate to increase at a modest rate.","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $2.6 billion, up 6.6% versus the Q4 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investment and coverage for select categories. Inventory per store was up 2.5%, basically in line with our 2.1% domestic same-store sales growth.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 33%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","As the last point, I'd like to point out that fiscal year 2013 has some extra week or a 53rd week in it. More specifically, the extra week will fall during the fourth quarter. Already our longest quarter in number of weeks, this upcoming year's fourth quarter will have an extra week taking us to 17 total weeks in Q4. As a result, our year will end next year on August 31. Last time we had an extra week in our financials was fiscal 2008. We would encourage each of you to review the impact this extra week had on our performance in Q4 2008 to understand the order of magnitude this extra week will have on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 results.","Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. Our company has been extremely successful over the long run. That success can be attributed to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing intensely on meeting and exceeding the wants, needs and desires of our customers. Our approach is one of consistency, where flawless execution is a key competitive advantage. To have that high level of execution, it is critical to have consistent strategies, consistent communications and to consistently live up to our pledge and values. This organization has and will continue to do just that.","I'm very proud of this organization, and more importantly, our incredible AutoZoners, now across the globe, who work tirelessly to continue to deliver great service and great results.","Before we conclude the call, I wanted to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2012. Our organization continues to build on the successes of the last several years, and we were able to deliver great results for the year, highlighted by our third consecutive year of 20%-plus earnings per share growth. We're very pleased with our accomplishments, and I'd like to review a few of those in recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners.","We grew both our Retail and Commercial businesses this past year, all while continuing to gain share. We opened our 5,000th store last month, entering our 49th state. The store is located in Alaska, and we couldn't be more excited about being there. I met some outstanding AutoZoners, and I know our culture of WOW! Customer Service is being fully embraced in Alaska.","We opened our 300th store in Mexico this year, really an amazing success story. We've done it all organically. From our first store 13 years ago to today, our product offering is outstanding across the country, and I couldn't be prouder of our past accomplishments or more excited about our future potential for growth.","We opened our 3,000th U.S. Commercial program this past quarter. This was a program that experienced slow growth for many years here at AutoZone. Not today. We grew our program count by 394 this year alone. And with such a small share of the industry's business, we remain very excited about our opportunities heading into 2013.","I also want to congratulate our ALLDATA and E-Commerce teams. The strides we've been making with these businesses have been material to our overall operating model. And now with the launch of ALLDATA Europe, we have the opportunity to service an entirely new set of customers.","And as evidenced by the upcoming opening of our first store in Brazil, AutoZone continues to break new ground and find new opportunities to leverage our terrific business model and our culture in new geographies.","In regard to the numbers, we grew EBIT 9% on top of last year's 13%, and we achieved another record return on invested capital of 33%. Congratulations, AutoZoners. Your efforts drove these successes.","As we said earlier on this call, our results this past quarter were solid but not as good as we would have liked. We experienced some unique regional performance differences that had a material impact on our results this past quarter. Clearly, our businesses experienced a slowdown over the last several months, and we believe a significant amount of that slowdown is likely due to the mild winter we experienced last year. But that may not be the entire story. The bottom line is we can't control the weather and market conditions will fluctuate from time to time. Our charge is to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance.","In the end, delivering 2.1% same-store sales, earnings per share growth of 17.8% and record return on invested capital of 33% for the quarter are great results. As we look to the future, the recent slowdown in industry sales is not lost on us. We believe some portion of it is due to last winter's mild weather, but that likely isn't the entire story. Today, we are uncertain if the slowdown we have experienced is temporary or an indication that the industry is slowing somewhat. We won't know until we annualize last winter. What we do know is we have very effectively managed this business through good times and bad, as evidenced by our 24 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings-per-share growth.","As we think about our model, we grow new store square footage at an annual rate of approximately 4%, and we are growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very predictable and strong cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share comfortably into double digits. This model has been quite successful for an extended period of time.","Finally this morning, I'd like to announce our theme for 2013 and discuss our key priorities for the new year. The new theme will be 1TEAM Delivering Wow. You will notice our theme and our key priorities haven't changed much, and that is intentional. We continue to be committed to a consistent approach that leads to flawless execution. Our key priorities for 2013 are Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably grow our Commercial business, leverage the Internet, hub strategy with relocations and expansions and leverage information technology to improve the customer experience and optimize efficiency.","Let me conclude by saying our financial and operational performance is strong in 2012. I want to again thank and congratulate our entire organization for their dedication to our customers, fellow AutoZoners, stockholders and communities. Our approach remains consistent. We are focused on succeeding in 2013, and we are optimistic and excited about the new year.","Thank you for your time. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just one question and a follow-up. Without spending too much time on the weather, the impact, it was very helpful to hear your discussion of the 3 regions versus the other 7. Given it sounds like most of this is weather, would you expect, if we have a normal winter that business will actually slow before it gets better because of the comparison against the easier winter last year. Is that complicated?","William C. Rhodes","Gary, I don't know that we're focused that intensely on what's going to happen over the immediate short term. What we're more worried -- more focused on is what do we think the long-term trajectory of this business is. And as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we clearly believe that there is some portion of our softness is due to the weather, the lack of winter that we had in Great Lakes and Northeast last year. We would anticipate annualizing that late winter, early spring. As far as whether or not it gets more challenging between now and then, we didn't do a great job of forecasting how our business was going to trend during the summer. We have not been through this before. We had such a mild winter. And frankly, we performed a little worse than we anticipated in the fourth quarter. So I have a hard time projecting what's going to happen in the first quarter. What I do know is we need to stick to our game plan. We need to obviously manage our expenses and capital very closely, but this is a time where we just need to stick to our plan and be consistent.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But it sounds like putting aside the weather side of it, you are sticking to it and the business was pretty solid or...","William C. Rhodes","That's correct, yes, yes. Again, 2.1% comps with 17.8% earnings per share growth, that's a pretty great result.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just your gross margin has been a standout each -- like all year and was particularly strong this quarter. And you talked about product acquisition costs. Is there also a mix issue? And as we look at product acquisition cost, is that something that we carry into 2013? Like what are you thinking about gross margin going forward?","William T. Giles","Yes, we were actually very pleased with gross margin. I think the merchandising organization did a very good job of managing and improving our gross margin rates overall. And it was highlighted by lower acquisition cost. So as we kind of look through -- forward to 2013, we remain relatively optimistic that we can continue to improve gross margin, as we said, in both sides of the business overall.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So it sounds like sales fell short of your expectations. Does that mean you're managing the operating expenses side of the business to around a 3% comp? And if that's the case, would you recalibrate that? If you don't see sales accelerate once the colder weather kicks in?","William T. Giles","Yes, I wouldn't say we're managing necessarily to a 3% comp. I think some of the things that we tried to articulate throughout the call is that we're very focused on some of the key initiatives that we have in place. And so the hub stores, the expansion of the Commercial programs, we believe those are all very important and create a very strong foundation for the organization going forward. So we're not managing it to 3%. Now having said that, we think we have historically been very good about managing our expenses in response to our overall sales trends. But we're going to continue to focus on our initiatives, particularly since we don't really see a fundamental change in the business today. We think that there's really nothing that's changed with our consumers significantly other than some of the things that Bill talked about relative to the regional disparities that we've had across the country.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, we're seeing one of your competitors move their distribution systems to look more like the other competitor, so having a deeper availability of parts within a quicker delivery time. Do you think if the industry moves in that direction, that you could be at a disadvantage over the long term if you only have a hub model for your distribution infrastructure?","William T. Giles","Yes, I mean, the way we look at it is that, and Bill talked about it on his prepared remarks earlier, the hub model allows us to have same-day delivery. We're trying to get inventory forward deployed into the marketplace on a more efficient basis and leveraging those 149 hubs in order for us to have inventory that we can say yes to the customer at that day. We also have, through our vendor direct program, overnight possibilities through our vendors being -- supporting us by delivering product on an overnight basis. So we think that we've got a model that is most effective and efficient both as we go forward. You've seen us continue to invest in the hub stores.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just last quick one. In the 7 markets that outperformed this quarter, were those -- was the comp trend in those markets pretty consistent throughout the quarter? Or was there some months that were better than others?","William C. Rhodes","I think overall, our performance both in those markets and overall, it fluctuated some. But it wasn't a material story one way or the other.","Operator","Our next question is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But just one follow-up, if I may. You spoke about the difficulties in the maintenance category, particularly in the 3 regions. Would you be able to give us some color on how both the failure and discretionary parts of the business performed?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I think the failure continued to perform generally consistent with how it was [ph]. Actually, discretionary has been a little bit positive -- more positive in the last quarter or 2. And I think that's because our team in the discretionary parts of the business have really done some great work and are improving our businesses in those areas. But the big story, obviously, was the maintenance items.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And Bill, collectively for the stores that are supported by the 3,000-plus desks or the 149 hubs, is the performance of those stores across all of the regions materially better than the stores that are not yet supported by one or both of those programs?","William C. Rhodes","Well, the stores that aren't in the 3,000, they don't have the Commercial programs. So they might do just a little snippet of business but nothing of any significance. As part of the stores that are supported by the hub stores, one of the things we've done is we've significantly expanded the number of stores that are serviced by the hub store. Some of them are serviced on a same-day basis, the vast majority of them, and some of them are serviced on an overnight basis when they're in very remote areas. We're continuing to work to try to reduce the number of stores that are on an overnight basis. And when we take them from an overnight basis to a same-day basis, we see a material change in the amount of products that they're able to sell.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just one point of clarification, if I may. With respect to inflation, you said that you're still seeing inflationary benefits albeit they're not as great as what you saw before, right? You're not seeing deflation across the board, are you?","William T. Giles","I would overall, no. But on a category-by-category basis, I'm sure there's some categories that have experienced some deflation.","William C. Rhodes","I think the big story on inflation is last year in the fourth quarter, we had some very significant inflation due to the run-up in commodities. And now as we've lapped that, we don't have the same trajectory, and it has impacted us on our average ticket growth. One thing we didn't really hit on is our customer count trends have generally been fairly consistent with the last 6 quarters or so. The real negative benefit [ph] has been in average ticket, and a lot of that was not changes that happened this year but the lack of the significant inflation that we had last year once we annualized it.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I just want to clarify a couple of facts that you said. You said that the better areas of the country, the other 7 markets comped above the 4.5 you did last year in 4Q and that the underperforming markets were 15 points lower than those markets?","William T. Giles","Yes. Just to clarify, I would say that on the DIY side, that the markets were consistent with the prior year. And their performance was consistent. You indicated they were higher than, I think, the 4.5 or whatever. They were consistent with how they performed last year. And so we're not breaking out exactly what each region did from a comp store sales performance. And then on the Commercial side, 15% below, not 15 -- yes, 15% below.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So Advance had talked about some of the same regions comping 600 to 900-basis-point deceleration, is it fair to say overall that maybe the better markets were high single digit better from a comp perspective?","William T. Giles","I guess the way I would look at it is that those 3 regions performed differently than the rest of the country and materially performed lower than they did in the previous year. The other regions performed consistent with the way they performed the previous year.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Perfect. And then in terms of the maintenance product categories, and you mentioned that whatever in the owner's manual requires regular replacement. So presumably that things like batteries, wipers and exhaust, is there anything that we'd be missing there? And curious what you have seen in those underperforming markets in categories like oil change and break replacement. Presumably, these aren't necessarily weather-affected products and maybe there's some clues there in terms of what's going on in the market.","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I think first of all, the brake business has been a challenging business for us, and we do attribute some of it to the weather. You think about what happens in the winter when you have snow and ice, there's worsening of -- they have to remove the snow and ice. There's corrosion that occurs that impacts the brake pads and the rotors specifically, and then there's also bad road conditions, which will impact things like our chassis business. So I think there's a lot of areas where the weather does impact it. Clearly, oil changes aren't a significant one, and our oil change business is not -- it's done fine, but it's not one of the standout categories where we're challenged.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Fair enough. And then one final one, just to play devil's advocate on the hub versus DC supply chain. Do you think that some of what you're seeing in terms of not having a challenge using the hub network is a result of just having the lowest -- lower Commercial sales per store in that as you build that up, that potentially you would have to invest in more DC assets?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, the challenge that I have with that basic premise is it's not about overnight delivery. It's about same-day delivery. And so our focus is about getting same-day delivery on a multiple time per day basis. So we can get products in there overnight. We just don't have to run a distribution truck to the market. We do it via FedEx. So we'll see as we progress. Yes, we are smaller than everybody else. I think we're also growing much more rapidly than everybody else. I think we are very pleased with the trajectory that we have in that business and our strategy. And I'm sure we'll learn things as we go forward. But our expectation is that our distribution strategy will remain the same. The hubs have been an integral part of our -- in the build on our hub to our overall distribution strategy. And then the way we do it today is very, very cost efficient, and we also think being cost efficient is always incredibly important.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So you alluded to the notion that what you're seeing might not be all about weather. And to the extent that it's not, I'd like to delve just a bit deeper into conditions in the 3 regions that are a little bit softer and ask you whether, based on what you see, there've been many macro factors such as car age in those regions, car sales in those regions potentially being stronger. I'm just looking for something other than the weather that might be different in those parts of the country that would help explain what's going on.","William C. Rhodes","Yes, Matt. And we've been looking at this very hard. And admittedly, as we've said in our prepared remarks, we don't have all the answers. But we've looked at it very closely and very close in those regions based upon category performance. And every time we look at categories that are impacted by winter weather, those are the categories that are seeing the degradation. The other categories continue to perform fine. So that indicates to me that it's not being driven by age of vehicle. One of the challenges that we clearly do have is our consumer continues to be pressured. It's been a long economic cycle, and particularly the low end consumer is continuing to have very difficult challenges. Could they be deferring some of those maintenance items longer? Yes, but I don't know that they're necessarily that much more impacted in the Midwest and the Northeast than they are in the Southeast, for instance.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Bill, second question. As you look at the ticket pressure, I guess to clarify, is that happening across the country? Or is the ticket pressure more focused in those regions? And if you could disaggregate the ticket pressure, if not quantitatively then at least directionally into deflationary or disinflation, and then maybe any kind of mix shift from best to good and better?","William C. Rhodes","Sure. The average ticket deterioration, it's still very positive, but it's not as positive as it's been in the past. And the pressure on that is really not what's happened this year. It was much more what happened last year where we had some significant inflation in commodity prices. And then there are a few places where there was a drastic change. For instance, our 134 refrigerant had a massive price reduction in the marketplace this year, and that rolled through, particularly on the Commercial side of the business, and pressured us. You had a second part that I forgot.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is there anything on mix, for example? I know you have good, better, best across the board. Are you seeing customers move down market across assortments?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. We are not seeing that at all. I think our mix continues to be very similar to the way that it's been over time. We introduce certain mix category, in certain categories. And we'll see a change when that happens. But when we see the mix offering being consistent, then our sales continue to be very similar.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then finally for Mr. Giles, just a very quick clarification. So the 7 markets that did well, you said did better than they did in the fourth quarter last year. How did those markets do relative to the May quarter, please?","William T. Giles","The May quarter? They were up a little bit. Flattish, I guess, is what I would say. It's probably the easiest way to say it, they were flat.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So they didn't deteriorate the way the other 3 did?","William T. Giles","Yes. That's the point of the question, right. They didn't deteriorate like the other 3 did as much.","Operator","Our next question is from Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Going back to one of the previous questions with regard to discretionary versus maintenance, I know you highlighted that discretionary was doing a little bit more in the 3 challenged regions because of what your team has been doing. So is there an opportunity to employ maybe some of the same strategies that's been working in discretionary onto the maintenance category?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, let me make sure and clarify. I didn't say that the discretionary were doing in those 3 regions. They're doing better overall. But the things that we've done in the discretionary business -- number one, our discretionary business was very challenged in 2008 to 2011. So our team is working very hard to come up with new ideas, new products, new presentation techniques. And most of the tactics that they're deploying are very different tactics than you would deploy on trying to sell maintenance items. Number one, there's no presentation of them. They're all behind the counter. And the product extensions aren't as innovative, if you -- I would say.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then if I could just ask one question on your Commercial program acceleration. I know that's been a big strategic focus for the company. But I wondered if competitively if you can highlight anything that's changed that maybe has made it a little bit easier or anything that's changed in the environment to help you accelerate some of these -- the expansion of the Commercial programs.","William T. Giles","I don't think so. I think what's helped us to be able to accelerate the Commercial program are the investments that we've made in our overall infrastructure. I mean, we've got territory sales managers out there that continue to mature in their positions. We've added technology to help improve their productivity. We've added more inventory into the marketplace. The hub stores are a key part of that. So we're certainly far more competitive today than we were 3 years ago, and you can see by the number of programs that we opened this past year that we have a lot more confidence in our overall model and our ability to capture market share going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from John Lawrence with Stephens.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just quickly, Bill, on the expense line going forward. You talked about the tax rate. Some of the headwinds that you've seen last several quarters on the insurance line, et cetera, how should we think about that going forward, especially in light of the comps that could be a little softer?","William T. Giles","That's a good question, John. I think on the insurance one, certainly that was a headwind for the last 4, 5 quarters. We continue to work that one and hope to make some improvements on that. When you think about expenses overall, we expect to continue to be prudent relative to how we're going to manage our expenses. And so where we have opportunities to reduce expenses, we're going to do that. And at the same time, we're going to continue to manage payroll appropriately as well. And so as we have some softness in sales this quarter, obviously, we deleveraged payroll little bit. And so we'll continue to manage that. The most important thing, and obviously, everybody always says this, is that we want to make sure that we continue to provide the best customer service we can, and customer-facing expenses are the last thing to cut. But in the meantime, there are always opportunities within our organization, and our organization is very focused on that right now and making sure that we manage our expenses appropriately.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And last question. As far as ALLDATA's entry overseas, what could we read into that longer term, Bill, as far as understanding that marketplace?","William C. Rhodes","Well, I think number one, ALLDATA and the team in ALLDATA has really done great job since we've owned them since 1996. They've got a great differentiated product in the North American market, and now we're going to take it to Europe. As far as whether or not ALLDATA gives us insights into Western Europe in particular for new store growth or expansion on an international basis, I wouldn't really say that is driving it at all. We are just now planting a flag in Brazil, and that will be our first time to have stores outside of North America. We're very focused on how do we go down there with a small test and ensure that this model can expand even further. So that's our thinking at this point in time. But I was very -- I was over there last week at Automechanika for the launch of ALLDATA Europe. Number one, we've got a great team over there, both the team that's over there selling the product and the team that developed the product in the United States. But most importantly, the customer reactions to the live product at Automechanika were very exciting. And it's a very differentiated product over there, so we're bullish on how it will do. It's not going to be a material contributor to our financial results in the short term, but it can be a very nice business over the long term.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you talked about some things going on perhaps above and beyond weather. One thing I wanted to ask about is your thoughts on the aging of the vehicles, and I realized that the growth -- you're seeing growth in 7-year-old cars or older. My question is this: are you seeing that growth slow down at all? And then looking at even older cars, 10, 11 years old, are you seeing growth there? But is that growth slowing? The point of the question is where do you see the sweet spot in terms of aging? And what are the trends in growth in that sweet spot?","William T. Giles","Yes, I mean, it's hard to say where we see the sweet spot necessarily. I mean, we've had a real advantage, as you've seen. And I'd look at it over just the last year. But if you look at it over the last, maybe, 4 years, say, we've seen a pretty good change in the age of vehicles overall. That may moderate a little bit, but it continues to be a benefit. And so we always used to say that vehicles 7 years old or older are our kind of vehicles. And now with an average age of well over 10 years, that's a significant population of cars that are in our sweet spot.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But I guess at some point, do you see behavior where the car gets beyond that 7 years, a consumer might opt to trade in for a new car or a used car that's not as damaged and then scrap that car. What age does that typically happen?","William T. Giles","Well, obviously, that age has moved out over time. And so I think that, that is as much of an economic issue as it is anything else. And so I think that's availability, credit, economic turnaround, et cetera, relative to new car sales. But either way, it's been a slow movement to get to where we are, and I don't expect to see any abrupt changes in the future.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. So then just to finish, to close the loop, is that one of the factors that you think about when you guys talk about maybe something outside of weather?","William T. Giles","Not on the age of vehicles. Probably not the age of vehicles, Michael. When we talk about outside of weather, I mean, just to be clear, those 3 regions behave differently. At the same time, we don't want to sit here and just peg the quarter on weather. And so clearly, we can draw a lot of analogies to how those 3 regions performed overall, and we struggle to find any other macro corollaries to the performance of those regions. Having said that, we're always going to be conscious of the fact that maybe it isn't totally weather, and we're going to continue to take actions and strategies within our organization to be able to respond to any conditions that we have.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rhodes for closing comments.","William C. Rhodes","Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the new year. We cannot take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. Our culture remains our key point of differentiation from our competition, and we must not lose sight of the importance of basic store execution in order to remain very successful. We have a solid plan for 2013, and our team is positioned to succeed. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we will continue to focus on the basics and continue to focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value. We are confident AutoZone will continue to be incredibly successful.

I hope everyone had a wonderful Memorial Day weekend.","With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA, and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across our organization for delivering another solid quarter operationally and financially. This morning, we reported our 31st consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. While past success is no guarantee for future performance, this consistency in earnings is something we strive to attain each and every quarter. This morning, we\u2019ll discuss our sales results and provide you some details on regional and product sales trends. We\u2019ll also provide some detail on the cadence of sales throughout the quarter. Next, we will update you on our various initiatives. We\u2019re very excited about all the initiatives being worked and believe our progress can benefit the company\u2019s sales and earnings trajectory for years to come. ","For the quarter, we reported a total sales increase of 6.2% while same store sales were up 4%. In retail, we experienced same store growth in both traffic and ticket, although ticket growth continues to be subdued versus historical growth rates due to the lack of inflation. As expected, during the quarter the deferrable maintenance categories that were challenged during the harsh winter rebounded nicely, while the failure-related categories that were so strong during the winter continued to grow but at slower rates than in the second quarter. These category sales trends also existed in commercial as well but weren\u2019t as pronounced as they were in retail.","Overall, domestic commercial sales growth accelerated to 14% this quarter versus 12% last quarter. We continue to be pleased with our progress in commercial and we see tremendous opportunities for additional growth through further penetration of existing customers and acquisition of new customers. ","For the quarter, we opened 137 new programs to finish with 76% of our domestic stores operating commercial. This brings our year-to-date openings to 311. We expect to open approximately 400 programs this fiscal year. While weather has been a big topic throughout the retail sector recently, we felt weather in general didn\u2019t have a material impact on our results. We felt the bigger story was the rebound in the deferrable maintenance categories; however, our west coast markets were challenged for the quarter and we attribute that to milder, wetter weather conditions in those markets. ","During the quarter, our sales trends were strongest during the first part of the quarter when winter initially subsided and tax refunds began in earnest. Tax refund season has become a more important driver of our business in recent years as our customers\u2019 discretionary spending has been more challenged. During the latter part of the quarter, our sales fluctuated consistent with the weather patterns. We continually to believe our customers are financially strained. One recent additional pressure point has been the increase in gas prices. During the quarter, gas prices increased $0.29 and are currently $0.07 higher than the same time last year. Based on the dialog we see across retail, the low end consumer seems to be particularly challenged.","Our all other businesses sales increased 7% over last year. The deceleration versus the last several quarters is due to the annualization of the Auto Anything acquisition in December. The all other segment of businesses includes Auto Anything. AutoZone.com, and ALLDATA. These businesses performed in line with our expectations.","Now I\u2019d like to review our initiatives for the year. Our operating theme this year is creating customers for life, and the key priorities for the year are: great people providing great service; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability. On the retail front this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We continued to enhance our operating systems to make them as intuitive as possible. We also continued to invest more payroll in our stores. Last year, we managed expenses especially tight as our sales results were below our expectations. This year as we expected sales to improve with all of our initiatives, we wanted to make sure we represented our brand well, so we added payroll.","One area of specific emphasis the last few years has been on the safety of our AutoZoners. We felt our rate of injuries in our stores and in our vehicles were unacceptable. We owe it to every AutoZoner to provide a safe working environment. While these efforts are nowhere near complete, I\u2019m quite pleased and impressed by our team\u2019s relentless focus on safety, and our performance in this area has shown significant improvement. ","After a strategic review in the winter of 2012-2013, last spring we began to design, develop and implement tests focused on improving our local market inventory availability. Our markets are designed to improve inventory coverage in all stores, increase the frequency of replenishment from our distribution centers, offer broader assortments from our hub stores, leverage the broadest assortment in select hub stores, increase stores\u2019 inventory holding capacity, and finally improve our overnight delivery of hard-to-find products. I\u2019d first like to congratulate all the AutoZoners that are working on these initiatives. We have made more progress in the last 12 months than I would have expected. To date, we have learned a tremendous amount. Most of our efforts have had encouraging results, but this has led us to develop additional tests. We are in a position today to have a definitive point of view on the ultimate outcomes. It will likely take several additional quarters.","One of the initiatives was to improve the hard parts placement methodology in all stores. We completed our testing last spring and began implementing last summer. As of the end of Q3, the majority of this effort is complete. We have been pleased with our results to date as the new items we have added have performed generally consistent with our expectations. While this effort certainly adds additional product, it also removes unproductive inventory at an accelerated rate compared to our previous methodology. In this initial phase, we decided to be less aggressive with the deletes than the additions. Based on our performance to date, we anticipate deleting the balance of those unproductive items over the course of the next year, concurrent with our category reviews.","Regarding increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers and\/or leveraging select hub stores with expanded assortments, we have substantial work and testing to complete but the initial results are encouraging. These initiatives are somewhat competing initiatives and our current focus is to determine the optimal methodology. Additionally, we are beginning to test different delivery frequencies to determine the most effective approach.","Also this quarter, we opened a few stores with a quote-unquote new prototype. To the casual observer, not much has changed as the majority of the changes are in the back room and are focused on increasing the holding capacity in the hard parts area. This change significantly increases our holding capacity and we will be migrating to this new plan in the fourth quarter for new stores. The combination of these tests has led to increased inventory and additional costs. Again, we have learned a tremendous amount and we are encouraged by our results, but we still have substantial testing to complete. We will keep you abreast of developments in future calls.","Additionally, we expanded our total hub locations by one, finishing at 161, and we continued to expand or relocate hubs. We have now expanded or relocated 120 hubs. We expect to continue to open a modest number of new hubs and our expansion relocation efforts are also continuing.","As we mentioned on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we\u2019ve introduced the idea of being more digitally integrated and we made this one of our four strategic growth priorities along with retail, commercial and international. While in an early stage, we believe this can be an important and significant opportunity for us to deepen customer relationships and grow sales. At this point in the evolution of our online offering, we\u2019re focusing more on data compilation and building a knowledge portal than on current sales. Today, shoppers use our websites for educating themselves on what they need for their vehicles, and they continue to buy the vast majority of what they need from our stores. Our objective is to satisfy our customers\u2019 needs regardless of how they want to interact with us.","As we head into the final quarter of our fiscal year, we remain optimistic on our prospects. Although we have some concerns about the health of the consumer due to ongoing financial strains and increasing gas prices, we are pleased with our execution and excited about our ongoing strategies. We are encouraged by increasing traffic counts and the increases we have experienced in the deferrable maintenance categories, which we expect to continue through the summer. Additionally, our acceleration in commercial further builds our confidence in our strategies and tactics to address this vitally important growth vehicle.","Over the long term, we remain bullish on our industry\u2019s sales growth opportunities in retail, commercial, international and on the digital front. As our results highlight, we are intensely focused on delivering consistent performance, investing more aggressively in times of strength and managing our expense structure tightly during more challenging periods. ","We also reported another strong performance in return on invested capital as we finished Q3 at 32.4%, slightly ahead of last year. We are proud of this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best in all of hard lines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. ","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?","William Giles","Thanks Bill, and good morning everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our four stores in Brazil, increased 6.1% over the 12 weeks. Regarding the macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $3.38 a gallon and finished the quarter at $3.67 a gallon. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.07 per gallon during the third quarter, starting at $3.61 and ending at $3.54 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers\u2019 abilities to maintain their vehicles and we will continue to monitor prices closely in the future. ","We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven data reported by the Department of Transportation are available only through February. January was down 1.3% while February was down 0.8%. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry\u2019s favor. ","Another key macro headwind last year was the payroll tax reinstitution. While we do not expect to benefit this year, we simply are anniversarying a negative event from last year. It is hard to gauge what benefit this has had or will have on our traffic, but it won\u2019t be an additional pressure point like last year. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per auto parts store was $1,767,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. ","For the quarter, total domestic commercial sales increased 14%. Domestic commercial sales represented 17.3% of our total company sales and grew $50 million over last year\u2019s Q3. Last year\u2019s commercial sales mix as a percent was 16.2%. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings, and therefore we are optimistic about the future of this business. Year-to-date through Q3, we have opened 311 new programs versus 195 programs last fiscal year. ","We now have our commercial program in 3,732 stores supported by 161 hub stores. With only 76% of our domestic stores having a commercial program and our average revenue per program below several of our competitors, we believe there is further opportunity for additional program growth in addition to improved productivity opportunities in current programs. The tests on inventory that we have conducted provide us with information on how to close the gap with competitors that are more productive in commercial than we are today on a per-outlet basis. With the support of additional inventory available in markets and a more seasoned sales force, we believe we have long runway to grow both traffic and ticket with our commercial customer base. As Q3 showed improvements from Q2, we believe we\u2019re on the right track to continue to show growth.","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our commercial programs, having opened 1,200 programs in the past 36 months, which is 32% of the programs are three years older or younger. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share.","Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened seven new stores during the third quarter. We currently have 374 stores in Mexico. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations. Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating four stores and our plans remain to open approximately five more stores over the next year and the pause our development as we refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. At that point, we will talk more on our long-term growth plans. ","Recapping this past quarter\u2019s performance for the company, in total our sales were $2,342,000,000, an increase of 6.2% from last year\u2019s third quarter. Domestic same store sales or sales for stores open more than one year were up 4% for the quarter. As Bill mentioned earlier, this quarter\u2019s results were very much in line with last quarter\u2019s. We continue to evaluate our inventory additions and the impacts we\u2019re having on sales results. We feel we\u2019re well positioned for the upcoming quarter to grow sales. ","Gross margin for the quarter was 52% of sales, up 17 basis points versus last year\u2019s third quarter. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to the higher merchandise margins and lower shrink expense partially offset by the higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. In regards to inflation, we continue to see modest decreases in cost year-over-year, and this is different than in past years. At this point, our assumption is we\u2019ll experience subdued producer pricing for the foreseeable future and therefore we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and will make the appropriate adjustments, should they arise.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses; however, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our commercial business has been a steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have not bothered to call out the headwind quarterly \u2013 it is an integrated part of our business model. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars.","SG&A for the quarter was 31.5% of sales, higher by 39 basis points from last year\u2019s third quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the higher store payroll and the benefit recorded last year for the net gain on disposal of certain assets. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.","EBIT for the quarter was $479 million, up 5% over last year\u2019s third quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.5%. This represented a decrease of 22 basis points versus the previous year\u2019s third quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $36.2 million compared with $42.1 million in Q3 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,378,000,000 or approximately $380 million more than last year\u2019s Q3 balance of $4 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metrics based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.6%, slightly lower than last year\u2019s third quarter of 35.8%. This quarter benefited from certain discrete tax items. Net income for the quarter of $285 million was up 7.4% versus the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Our diluted share count of 33.7 million was down 7.7% from last year\u2019s third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $8.46, up 16.4% over the prior year\u2019s third quarter.","Related to the cash flow statement for the third fiscal quarter, we generated $463 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6.3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $102 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 37 new stores and four relocations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters, and information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2014, our CAPEX is expected to be approximately $440 million. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,901 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 374 stores in Mexico, and four in Brazil for a total store count of 5,279. ","Depreciation totaled $58.1 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s third quarter expense of $52.9 million. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $420 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter. At quarter-end, we had $307 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our leverage metric was 2.5 times this past quarter. Again, we want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 114%. ","Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.1 billion, up 12% versus the Q3 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investments and coverage for select categories. As we highlighted earlier, we have been focused on improving our local market inventory availability. There are several aspects of this initiative, including improving the placement methodology of hard parts at the store level which through Q3 is largely completed. This activity contributed to an increase in inventory per store which was up 8.6% at $594,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage. ","Finally as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 32.4%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William Rhodes","Thanks Bill. We\u2019re pleased to report our 31st consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Our company continues to be successful due to a long-term focus. We focus on delivering exceptional customer service and executing at a high level consistently which we believe is a competitive advantage. To execute at a high level, we have to adhere to living the pledge. Like our operating theme for this fiscal year states, we must focus on creating customers for life. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with strong attention to detail. ","The initiatives we are working on around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, ecommerce and Brazil are all very exciting to us. We feel these efforts will lead to increasing sales for many years to come. While our industry sales according to MPD data made available to us were higher than last year\u2019s results, we must remain focused on enhancing every facet of our business. While it is exciting to see our industry doing well, we cannot become complacent. We are just starting to implement our initiatives, and while encouraged, we still have a tremendous amount of work in front of us to determine the optimal approach.","Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. As we continue to execute on our financial model, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single digit range or better in times of strength, and we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share into double digits. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is a very thoughtful operating strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success.","We are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.","Now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator instructions]","The first question is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays. ","Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays","Thank you very much. Question for Bill Rhodes \u2013 can you maybe just provide a little bit of color on performance of the hubs that have so far been expanded relative to the ones that remain to be expanded? What do the productivity differences look like between the two? And then I have a follow-up, if I may.","William Rhodes","Yes, thanks Alan. They\u2019re fairly significant. Now, what happens in many of the cases is the hubs as they were didn\u2019t have the space necessary to have the entire parts assortment that we wanted to have in those hubs, and so when we relocate them we make sure\u2014or expand them, we make sure that they have the physical space to hold all the inventory that we want. That inventory, we\u2019ve already determined in the other locations is productive inventory, so it\u2019s just a function of getting the space. So they performed fairly significantly better.","Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays","Any quantification of significantly better? I mean, are the expanded ones doing 20% better than non-expanded, or is it higher or lower than that?","William Rhodes","I don\u2019t have the quantification in front of us. What I can share with you is like any other investment that we have, the expansions are generating a 15% after-tax IRR because that\u2019s what we hold them to, so that\u2019s not only the inventory load but also the expense that goes into the remodel or move as well as the additional square footage.","Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays","Okay, and one follow-up if I may. With respect to trying to increase the frequency of delivery, if you look at your product assortment, what proportion of your products would you say need to be available for delivery same day versus one day versus maybe two days, and where are you relative to that today?","William Rhodes","One of the interesting facts is 70% of the SKUs that are in our stores have one piece on the shelf, so what that means is if we sell it during the week, we\u2019re out of it for up to eight days. So what we\u2019re finding in the daily replenishment model is that the biggest benefit comes from the items that are stock one and stock two, and so the frequency of delivery allows us to be in-stock much quicker.","Now one of the things we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re testing five day a week delivery. Now we\u2019re going to go out and that\u2019s why we\u2019re saying, we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019re going to go out, we\u2019re going to test other cycles \u2013 two times a week, three times a week to determine what the optimal approach is.","Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Gary Balter from Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. Just following up on Alan\u2019s question, is there a way to measure with your customers the fill rate that you\u2019re getting in these expanded hubs?","William Rhodes","Are you asking are we able to\u2014","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse","Well I know you measure it, but could you give us some quantification that way in terms of what percent of the orders are you satisfying from the customers versus what you were before you added the inventory?","William Giles","I think one of the ways to think about it, Gary, from a hub perspective is what we look at is the lift that we get out of the satellite stores that are basically pulling merchandise and product from the hubs. In essence, that was product that they might not otherwise have been able to say yes to, so I won\u2019t be able to quantify that for you right now but the fact is that, as Bill said before, we\u2019ve got our return metrics that we are looking at to determine what kind of lift each satellite store gets as we expand the hub and add more inventory into the hub, and that\u2019s kind of how we measure it going forward, so that ultimately is showing up in your comp store sales performance as well.","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks, and then just to follow up and I\u2019ll get off \u2013 Bill, you talked about the seven-plus, like your type of vehicles has been growing and continuing growing, but there\u2019s some concern about the five- to seven-year-olds as the 2009\u2019s now start hitting the equation. What are your thoughts on that?","William Giles","Yes, there\u2019s a little bit of a dip in that five- to seven-year-olds, but the more important point is that the number of registered vehicles hasn\u2019t really changed significantly, so we still have the same number of vehicles out on the road and so you do have a little bit of a dip, if you will, if you look at the timeline. But for us, the advantage is that we do continue to see vehicles age and that\u2019s helpful for us, and so we\u2019re finding that our cycles or our lifecycle of product is actually getting expanded out a little bit further.","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks a lot. Good morning. Thanks a lot for the color that you offered us on the composition or the mix of business as you made your way through the May quarter. As you think about the August quarter and you think about the weather that you\u2019ve experienced year-to-date, particularly the after effects of the tough winter, and you think about failure and for maintenance product, how do you envision the mix evolving \u2013 I know it\u2019s somewhat forward weather dependent \u2013 and if you could talk about the gross margin implications of that outlook.","William Rhodes","Okay. The best analog that I think we have for what a harsh winter will or will not do for your business performance is two years ago, Matt, when we had a very mild winter. If you remember, we called out for some time that that mild winter really hurt us, and it particularly hurt us in the deferrable maintenance categories. Well, now we\u2019re coming off of a very harsh winter. When we came into this quarter, we said we anticipated that the failure items would slow down a bit, which they did, and we anticipated that we would see an increase in the deferrable maintenance categories \u2013 think about brake systems, chassis and the like. That\u2019s what we saw. Our expectation is that those trends will continue for some time and certainly through the summer months.","As to the ramifications on our gross margin, it\u2019s not material one way or the other. We typically \u2013 and I don\u2019t think we have ever called out \u2013 that we\u2019ve had a shift in product mix that has been a key driver of our gross margins.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, and then a second question that I want to ask, a brief one \u2013 so obviously you disclosed commercial total revenues and it\u2019s sort of to us to think about what the comparable store trajectory might be like, and to do that we need to think about the productivity of the new unit. Can you talk about as you\u2019ve moved deeper into the base with the commercial rollout, how the sales per new commercial program has been evolving over the past couple or three years relative to recent trend?","William Rhodes","Yes, I would say it\u2019s remarkable that the new stores \u2013 and we track them out period out to 13 periods, how are they doing on both sales and EBIT \u2013 and it\u2019s remarkable the consistency of those new store openings, although they are getting slightly better year-over-year-over-year, which is counterintuitive. You would think that they would be performing worse because hopefully we\u2019ve opened the best programs earlier on in the life cycle, but I think as we get better in commercial and as we learn how to open programs better, they are getting marginally better even as we go to the less desirable programs, although they are very desirable.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group","Hi, thanks. I have two questions, one on sales and a follow-up on inventory. You talk about sales through the quarter starting strong with tax refunds and weather and failure, and then getting more volatile towards the end. Could you help us with the magnitude of that? Was the early part of the quarter 2x what the end of the quarter was?","William Giles","Yes, I would say probably. I wouldn\u2019t say exactly 2x, but I think it certainly softened up a little bit towards the tail end of the quarter, and that\u2019s always an odd time of the year anyways. We\u2019re kind of past the tax season, before the summer season really gets started, so it\u2019s not unexpected for us to have a bit of sales volatility during that last period of the third quarter, and we experienced it this year. I think part of it was that we just started out very strong.","William Rhodes","I would also add, if you recall this quarter\u2019s call last year, we talked about a strong April and the fact that we maybe we were getting out of the challenges that we had experienced., so April was a particularly tougher comparison versus last year.","Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group","Got it, and would it be fair to say that traffic was positive through the whole quarter, even though it maybe got a little more volatile towards the end?","William Giles","Yes, I think that\u2019s fair to say.","Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, great. And then my follow up was, Bill, you mentioned your comments on inventory, that now were largely complete in terms of the additional items going in for commercial, and that we would now sort of flush out the slower turning SKUs in the ensuing near during normal negotiations. What does that do to gross margin and working capital as you go through that?","William Giles","Yes, and just to clarify, in some of these product placements we\u2019re largely done. We still have some more things to do from a hub perspective, et cetera, in terms of adding inventory, et cetera, so I still think we have some opportunities to improve our coverage overall. I think from a gross margin perspective, we wouldn\u2019t anticipate that the inventory additions would have a significant impact on our gross margin rate by themselves necessarily. I mean, obviously we continue to believe there\u2019s opportunity for us to improve gross margin rates, and I think from a working capital perspective we obviously reported AP to inventory of 114% this quarter versus 111% last year, and as we\u2019ve said before, we don\u2019t anticipate our AP to inventory percentage increasing significantly going forward. We do believe that there will be a little bit of pressure on AP to inventory or working capital as we move in the next six, 12, 18 months or so, but we believe that we can kind of maintain close to these levels. ","Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group","That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Thanks. A question for Bill Rhodes regarding inventory productivity. You noted that inventory per store is up a little over 8.5%, yet if you look at gross profit dollars per store they were up slightly more than 4%. So I guess my question, when you look at the, let\u2019s say the (indiscernible) ROI on these new SKUs, are you seeing diminishing returns from before you began the program?","William Rhodes","Clearly. The inventory that we\u2019re adding today is significantly less productive than the inventory that\u2019s in our base assortment \u2013 no question about it. But when we run our models, we are very confident that even though it\u2019s less productive, that it can be a productive investment for us and we\u2019re pretty pleased with how they\u2019re performing so far.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Then as a follow up, I believe this is the first instance since the fourth quarter of 2009 that operating margin rate declined year-over-year. Interestingly, you achieved very good sales growth in 4Q \u201909 as well, but it does raise questions that with your operating margins well above the industry average \u2013 obviously the highest in the industry \u2013 do you think we\u2019re beginning to see a peak in operating margin rate?","William Giles","In the spirit of full and fair disclosure, last quarter we had a declination in operating margin as well, so that\u2019s\u2014","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, oh yes.","William Giles","But you\u2019re right, though \u2013 \u201909 was the previous spot, Dan. At the end of the day, we\u2019re focused on growing operating profit dollars at high returns, so that\u2019s ultimately what we\u2019re focused on. We want to grow sales, gain market share, and we want to deploy our capital, which includes inventory and expenses, in a manner which continues to generate high returns, so that is ultimately our objective. So we\u2019re not 100% focused on just increasing our EBIT margin necessarily quarter-in and quarter-out, although we\u2019ve done a very good job of that consistently over the years.","So is this the peak? I don\u2019t know the answer to that question. We\u2019re not focused on the EBIT margin, per se. We\u2019re focused on operating profit dollars and generating high returns.","William Rhodes","If I may, I would add one thing \u2013 in 2005 when we created our reinvestment plan, our operating margins were at an all-time high of 17.5%. They went down to about 17% in 2006 and everybody was saying, okay, this is the beginning of the migration back to the mean in the industry. Clearly over time, we found ways to be more productive and increased our operating margin almost 250 BPs above that point in time, so I have a high degree of confidence that this team will continue to find ways to make this business more productive, but we\u2019re not going to get focused particularly on a quarter-to-quarter basis if we have some deterioration in the operating margin, as long as we\u2019ve got good returns.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks, good morning. I think when you started talking about testing changes that you\u2019re making in commercial business about two quarters ago, you thought it would take about a year to assess and complete the tests. Is this still the timeline, and once you do decide to take a direction, how long will it take to implement? And then just in addition to that, how does private label come into play with the testing of your commercial strategies and the increases in inventory?","William Rhodes","Okay. On the first one as far as the timeline, I think we\u2019ve been fairly vague about the timeline because we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, and I say that to say we had an initial test on daily deliveries. Now, we\u2019re saying wait a minute \u2013 we need to go test different frequency of delivery, so that\u2019s going to push out our timeline a little bit. But each initiative is not necessarily dependent upon the other, so we\u2019ve already finished what we call the optimal hurdle, which is store SKU placements. We\u2019ve now gone into a new prototype \u2013 we\u2019ve made a decision on that and we\u2019re moving forward, so every one of them is not necessarily going to be on the same timeline. But the bigger, broader ones, which by the way whatever decisions we make could have significant implications, we want to be careful and we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got the right amount of information, and that we have a long enough testing period so it\u2019s reliable.","As far as how private label plays into this, number one, we don\u2019t consider it private label. We think Duralast is the best and strongest brand in the automotive aftermarket, and I hope you\u2019re enjoying our new marketing featuring Chuck Liddell. But I don\u2019t see that any of this testing to date has proven to change any of our strategies. I\u2019ll remind you that we have some very strong brands that are national brands in our stores, both on the sales floor and in hard parts, and where we find that there\u2019s a good value proposition that the customer thinks is important, we will carry a brand, be it a Duralast brand or someone else\u2019s brand.","Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Chris Horvers from JPMC.","Chris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan","Thanks, good morning. So two follow-up questions \u2013 first on the gross margin, can you talk about the outlook there? And you had some pressure in the supply chain from the inventory additions that you put into the stores. Does that continue, and is it related to that deleting process that you mentioned earlier in the script?","William Giles","Not so much the deleting process as it is just the overall increase in inventory movement, if you will, and so I would expect us to continue to have a little bit of pressure on supply chain costs for the next few quarters.","From a margin perspective, we continue to believe\u2014we haven\u2019t had a lot of inflation in the last probably year and a half, and sometimes inflation can be your friend from a gross margin perspective, so we\u2019ve done better\u2014you know, our merchandising organization has done some really good things in order to try to improve cost from sourcing and optimizing how we\u2019re getting product into the country, so I think that there continues to be some opportunity for us to continue to grow our gross margin rate. Obviously the Duralast product continues to do well, and as we continue to increase its penetration that will also help improve gross margin rate overall. ","So although we have some pressures here and there, I think we feel pretty positive about our gross margin rate going forward.","Chris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan","And on the deleting side, does that create some sort of markdown risk at the store level that you need to clean out the SKUs that you don\u2019t want?","William Giles","Typically not. Many of the deletes, we\u2019re able to push through the system and sometimes we\u2019re able to push it back to the vendors as well, so historically deletes has not resulted in necessarily margin pressure.","Chris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan","And then the follow-up on the commercial sales per store, it was according to our calculation down a couple percentage points year-to-year, so just following up on that productivity question, was there anything else that would have driven it down on a year-to-year basis besides the comments provided previously?","William Giles","Not too much, other than just the number of stores that we\u2019re opening on a quarterly basis. I think we probably accelerated our commercial program growth rate on a quarterly basis higher this year than we did last year.","Chris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bret Jordan of BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret Jordan \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Hey, good morning. A quick question, a follow-up I guess on two questions around brand and Duralast versus national brand. Do you have more national brand inventory in stock this quarter versus a year ago? Is there any change in the weighting?","William Rhodes","I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s material. There\u2019s pushes and pulls in various categories, but I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s any material change. ","Bret Jordan \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, and then a follow-up \u2013 you commented on the new prototype store allowing more hard parts in the box. Could you describe that a little bit more, maybe how much incremental product can get into the store and what type of investment is involved in reformatting?","William Rhodes","Well number one, we haven\u2019t made any decisions to go quote-unquote reformat. These are for the new stores that we\u2019re going to be opening, some of them in the fourth quarter. Certainly after the fourth quarter, they\u2019ll all be opening with this new prototype. It has a little bit incremental capital and expense to open the new store, but not material, but it will carry more than 20% additional hard parts than the current prototype that we have today. ","Now over time, we\u2019re going to see how it performs. We have some stores that do very high volumes, so some of these elements we might want to go back and put them in there, but we haven\u2019t made any of those decisions at this point in time.","Bret Jordan \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, and then one last question. On your internet sales volumes, did Auto Anything or the online initiative grow at a faster rate than the category? I guess all other was up 7%. Did the online sales exceed that?","William Giles","I\u2019d say a little bit, yes.","Bret Jordan \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer","Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the inventory issue as well. I think a couple questions ago, someone asked about the productivity of the new inventory you\u2019ve put into stores, but maybe I\u2019ll ask the question \u2013 if you look at the incremental inventory you\u2019ll be continuing to put in the stores for a longer period of time now, is there a way to think about what type of sales benefit should be derived from that? Maybe said another way, what type of sales are not occurring because the inventory is not there?","William Giles","Yes, I think in essence, Brian, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to figure out at some level, so obviously we can quantify internally the productivity that we\u2019re getting out of our adds to date, but the real question will be is when we\u2019ll be more expansive on our rollout of inventory and execute some of these tests that we\u2019re talking about as to what that will ultimately mean in sales. So I couldn\u2019t give you a number today as to exactly what that would be, but obviously we\u2019ll continue to monitor it internally.","Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer","Got it. Then just as a follow up to that, you continue to\u2014the AP leverage is quite remarkable. Will that change or will AP leverage kind of stay where it is, even as you put more inventory in?","William Giles","I think as we put more inventory in, the question is going to be the productivity of the inventory as a group overall, and so as inventory turns slow a little bit, if they do, then that will put a little bit of pressure on your AP to inventory ratio slightly. Obviously our merchandising organization continues to work with our vendors in order to optimize turns so that we\u2019ll continue to work hard at maintaining our AP to inventory ratio where it\u2019s been historically. But I think looking forward, we don\u2019t necessarily expect it to increase at the levels it has historically.","Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Had a question around labor \u2013 I think you mentioned in the release you were adding labor to some stores. Can you help us think if that\u2019s more DIY oriented, more commercial oriented, and then I had a follow-up for you. Thanks.","William Rhodes","Yes. Number one, I would say it\u2019s both, and we\u2019ve really moved to managing our labor more on a holistic basis rather than just DIY or commercial over the last year or so as part of our one team strategy to make sure that we\u2019re serving all of our customers exceptionally, regardless of how they interact with us. When you think about the labor increase this year, and it happened in the second quarter and it happened in the third quarter, the biggest reason for the labor increase is we really managed labor very tight last year, and in some respects we are annualizing that very aggressive management of labor because we had very tough sales trends. One thing I\u2019m proud of this organization, we\u2019ve performed very well regardless of industry headwinds or tailwinds, and last year we had to be very aggressive. So we\u2019re just annualizing that \u2013 there\u2019s no change in strategy really.","Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research","So there\u2019s no change in where you\u2019re, let\u2019s say, sourcing your parts pros from? Is there a mix of internal versus external, and if that should change? And then the follow-up I had was also around just the general harsh winter that we had, as you were coming into this quarter, I\u2019m just wondering whether or not you thought the harsh winter weather would have given you kind of even more benefit than you ended up getting, or how it compared to the expectations you might have had coming in.","William Rhodes","Yes, I would say number one, we\u2019re not sourcing our people from any different sources than we have on a historical basis. Secondly, I would say that our sales performed a little bit better in the third quarter than our expectations, particularly when the winter subsided and the tax refunds were flowing. We had some tremendous weeks in that period of time, so I would say it rebounded quicker. And then, we\u2019ve been encouraged by the deferrable maintenance categories and how they\u2019ve continued to perform throughout the quarter.","Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research","In thinking about how to compare against the year from now, if this was more favorable than you might have thought, and then I\u2019ll hop off. ","William Rhodes","I\u2019ll say the second quarter is going to be a daunting sales quarter. I mean, we just had a tremendous weather pattern, and our failure categories were off the charts in the second quarter. Now on the other side, our deferrable maintenance categories were down, so it will be what it will be. We\u2019re up to the challenge, regardless of what we\u2019re lapping next year.","Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research","All right, thank you. Best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser \u2013 UBS","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. I\u2019m curious about what performance metric you\u2019re seeking to maximize with all the different initiatives you having going \u2013 the availability, inventory, payroll. Is it return, it is margin, it is sales? What are you seeking to maximize, and how do you think you\u2019ll get there?","William Rhodes","Well as we\u2019ve said for a long time, our two performance metrics are EBIT dollar growth and return on invested capital. That\u2019s been our incentive compensation program for 12 or 13 years now. It continues to be. So if you think about what we\u2019ve decided are the most important metrics, those are it.","Michael Lasser \u2013 UBS","Okay, and then my second question\u2014sorry, go ahead?","William Rhodes","Go ahead.","Michael Lasser \u2013 UBS","My second question was on some of the comments you made around productivity of your commercial programs. The new ones continue to do better, so I guess inherently that means some of the more mature ones are degrading a little bit. Is there any\u2014a, is that true, and b, are there any common characteristics about what\u2019s driving the degradation in performance in some of the older commercial programs? Thank you.","William Rhodes","I would not infer that the older commercial programs are degrading; in fact, they\u2019re continuing to grow. What\u2019s happening is we\u2019ve opened, what, 1,400 new locations over the last four years, so our maturity of the commercial programs is fairly significantly different than it was four years ago. So I would not read anything into the average weekly sales being relatively constant \u2013 they\u2019re all moving in the right direction. We just have a higher percentage of new programs.","Operator","Mr. Lasser, does that conclude your questions? We\u2019ll move on to the next question. The next question is from John Lawrence with Stephens.","John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens","Good morning guys. Bill, would you comment a little bit\u2014not to beat a dead horse with this inventory issue, but can we just talk a little bit about when you talk about those maturity of programs, I guess the other factor is now that you\u2019re at 76% hub sort of commercial program penetration, is what we\u2019re talking about is finding that optimization point to whether you can go to 90% commercial programs, or I guess the other way to look at it is how variable are these programs across the country when you open them in terms of breadth of inventory, say, compared to three or four years ago with import parts, et cetera?","William Rhodes","Yes, it\u2019s a great question, John. Number one, I wouldn\u2019t say across the country that there\u2019s great variation. I would say it depends on the market and the demographics, so they perform differently in dense urban environments than they do in suburban environments versus the way they do in rural environments. They do different in heavy Hispanic or African-American or Caucasian environments. But what we\u2019re finding as we go deeper and deeper is every\u2014more and more stores have the potential than we thought, so we\u2019re continuing to grow at a pretty rapid rate. We\u2019re not closing a lot of programs \u2013 in fact, very, very few, and I think as we continue to improve our commercial business, then we find that we can operate in places we didn\u2019t think we could before. ","So I don\u2019t think we know\u2014well, I will tell you, we do not know what the ultimate answer is. I think we suspect it\u2019s higher than we ever thought it was before, and the better we get, hopefully those expectations will continue to go up.","John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens","And the last question there is when you\u2019re in a new market, is that incremental part that we\u2019re talking about here that maybe stocked out today with this incremental inventory, can you move up on a call list when you have that incremental part? Does that help?","William Rhodes","Absolutely. You know, when you first engage with a customer, you don\u2019t start at number one, at least not on very many occasions. A lot of times, you\u2019ll start as fourth or fifth call. Well, if nobody else in town has it, now you\u2019ve got an opportunity to impress that customer, so they call you with something they didn\u2019t think you would have and you have it, and then you give them prompt, great service, and guess what? Now you\u2019ve got a chance to start moving up that list.","John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens","And all those tests are just trying to optimize the capital required to get that there?","William Rhodes","That\u2019s correct.","John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens","Thanks a lot.","William Rhodes","And the expense structure as well. It\u2019s a pretty heavy math problem, honestly.","John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rhodes for closing comments.","William Rhodes","Okay. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to reiterate what separates us from other players in our industry. It\u2019s of course our culture, which is very special. Being part of the AutoZone family is very unique across the retail landscape. We are currently working on a variety of exciting new initiatives that we discuss and test and that we believe will enhance our performance over time. Ultimately, our AutoZoners have delivered year-in and year-out, and I\u2019m highly confident with them leading the charge, our future is incredibly bright.","Thanks for participating in today\u2019s call.

Please go ahead.","William Rhodes","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2017 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their tremendous efforts during this past quarter. Our results for the fiscal fourth quarter were in line with our expectations and demonstrated steady improvement compared to our fiscal third quarter performance.","Sales results from month-to-month were relatively consistent. However, the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern markets remained challenged and underperformed the remaining parts of the country. As has been well documented following two consecutive mild winters, many of the categories that are influenced by harsh winter conditions continued to be pressured. Additionally, this summer\u2019s temperatures were generally mild and our category performance in many of the hot weather categories were softer than we expected.","Overall, we were encouraged to see our same-store sales return to being positive despite these headwinds, and market share data indicates that our shared gains have been accelerating. We continue to make good progress on our initiatives that are aimed at improving our ability to say yes to our customers more frequently, drive traffic to our stores and accelerate our commercial business.","Specifically, we saw improvement in our commercial business and in our supply chain. Total commercial sales increased 5.9% compared to 3.6% in Q3. While our supply chain expenses delevered versus last year, we began to make improvements in our network and are beginning to operate more efficiently again.","During the quarter, we opened a new distribution center in Pasco, Washington and expect to open an additional D.C. in Ocala, Florida in mid-fiscal 2018. We also continue to be encouraged by the sales increases we experienced from our mega hubs, which typically service several hundred stores.","The mega hubs act as distribution nodes for hard-to-find parts for their network stores. We opened two new mega hubs during the quarter and expect to open approximately 10 more in fiscal 2018. These mega hubs further our ability to say, yes, we\u2019ve got it to all of our customers.","Before getting into more detail about the quarter, I want to share our perspective on some of the trends and headwinds that our industry and specifically our business has recently been experiencing. There are certain factors present today some macro and others that relate to actions we have taken as part of our long-term strategy that have created challenges to us delivering the same level of profitability growth that we have been delivering.","We intentionally made the decision to invest in our business at an accelerated rate in inventory, capital expenditures and operating expenses. Unfortunately, as we increased our investment profile, our sales have been slower than we would have thought due to poor performance in several of our weather-sensitive categories and our multiple frequency of delivery initiative did not generate the benefits yet that we expected.","Additionally, as our commercial program openings have slowed, our overall commercial sales growth has declined as well. Simultaneously, we faced several other pressure points. Over the last year, we\u2019ve experienced accelerated pressure on wages significantly more than I have experienced in my nearly 23 years of Autozone. Some of this is attributable to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities, while the balance and probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers.","The regulatory changes are going to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years. Additionally, we are experiencing increased levels of shrink in our interest expense after years of lower rates is beginning to increase.","The collective combination of these factors have significantly hampered our earnings per share growth. Businesses, market trends and costs tend to run in cycles. This year, we unfortunately experienced a disproportionate amount of them working against us. At the same time, we\u2019ve made decisions to accelerate our investment profile.","Our management team has been in this business for a long time, and we\u2019ve been through many different cycles. Sometimes we\u2019ve had tailwinds and we\u2019ve benefited from those. Other times, we\u2019ve had headwinds and we fought against them. Ultimately, we manage this business for the long-term to provide great service for our customers and great opportunities for our AutoZoners ultimately delivering strong shareholder value.","While some of the current expense headwinds will remain for some period, we know that this business model has excelled over decades and we are confident with our AutoZoners leading the charge that will continue to be the case. We operate in a terrific industry with very good fundamentals, and we know our team can continue to deliver impressive long-term performance.","Now let me provide more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, our sales increased 3.3% and our domestic same-store sales were up 1%. June was our weakest period, as it was much cooler than normal. We continue to see our Northeastern, Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic markets underperform the balance of the chain as two consecutive mild winters continued to negatively impact these areas and particularly their hard parts sales performance.","This quarter, these areas\u2019 comp store sales were approximately 40 basis below the other markets. But on a two-year basis, at almost 500 basis points, this region of the country has materially underperformed the remainder. These regions represent roughly 25% of our overall sales.","During the quarter, we opened 85 \u2013 84 new stores in the U.S. For the year, we opened 168 stores and expect to open approximately 150 stores in 2018. Our commercial business expanded by 5.9%, while opening 99 net new programs this quarter. Our commercial growth accelerated from last quarter\u2019s 3.6% increase, as we did not have the same headwinds in Q4 as Q3 from the income tax refund timing.","We again expect to open approximately 150 net new commercial programs for this new fiscal year. Currently, 84% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continue to expand in Mexico opening 25 new stores, we opened five new stores in Brazil. This quarter marked the most openings we\u2019ve had in any one quarter in Brazil.","We\u2019ve been doing business in Brazil since 2013, and we expect to open several more locations in 2018. We didn\u2019t open any additional IMC branches this quarter. While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside of the U.S. as well.","Regarding the Internet, we experienced improving trends in web traffic, ship the home sales and commercial online orders. Additionally, our buy-online pickup-in-store continues to grow fairly rapidly. As we continue to make our online shopping experience better and better with ease of doing business improving, we would continue to expect these various channels to grow materially faster than in-store. Our goal is to create a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers meeting them where, when and how they want to interact with us.","Under the Yes! We\u2019ve Got It theme, we remain focused on improving our closure rates, meaning, converting customer requests for pricing and availability into sales. In the spirit of satisfying our customers, we are making ongoing system investments and enhancements to capture data about our customer shopping patterns across all of our platforms, both domestically and internationally.","We understand, we have to be able to share information and \u2013 seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customer\u2019s needs. We expect our loyalty program and its vast membership to continue to help us mine customer shopping behaviors and grow sales materially in the future. This will be a big focus for us in 2018.","As our primary objective remains growing our domestic retail and commercial businesses, we continued with our inventory availability initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry. This past quarter, we opened two additional mega hub locations and now have 16 in operation.","We are working diligently on the development of future sites and we expect to open up to 10 more in 2018. We continue to be very pleased with our mega hub performance seeing them outperform our initial expectations. Additionally, this past quarter, we opened our ninth distribution center in Washington State and we expect to open a Florida DC by the middle of fiscal 2018.","Both of these new DCs will reduce transportation radiuses and therefore lead times, while also providing much needed additional capacity to our distribution network. Each new distribution center cost us approximately $60 million in capital, and we incur some incremental operating expenses from preopening activities and maturation.","Now I\u2019d like to take a moment to go into more detail on our two inventory availability initiatives. These are two very different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores. While the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to local markets, meaning, adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our network before.","Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we had roughly 2,300 stores receiving more than one weekly delivery at the end of Q3. However, as we haven\u2019t been satisfied with the benefits today, we made significant changes in the fourth quarter to test differing scenarios to determine the optimal approach. We moved some stores from three time a week deliveries to one or two time a week deliveries.","We also made some significant changes to our replenishment algorithms. Many of these changes are made in the middle of the quarter and we don\u2019t have sufficient consistent results yet to make any long-term decisions, but there are indications that are very encouraging to us. Over the last two years, as we quickly ramped up this initiative, our costs substantially increased even beyond our expectations, as we put tremendous pressure on our supply chain.","During the fourth quarter, some of the pressure began to subside and our cost increases began to abate. We have much continued work in front of us to determine the optimal approach and to regain the efficiencies we have historically enjoyed. The second ongoing initiative is a mega hub store concept. We\u2019re currently operating 16 mega hubs. We continue to be quite pleased with what the mega hub allow us to offer our customers.","As a reminder, these supersized Autozone stores carry 80,000 to 10,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations, both for retail and commercial.","Currently, we have over 4,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. A majority or about two-thirds of these 4,000 stores receive service on an overnight basis today. But as we expand our mega hubs, more of them will receive this service same day and many will receive it multiple times per day.","We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a mega hub is 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging and takes time.","While there are incremental costs to these rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. We did not experience meaningful, noteworthy deleverage from this initiative during fiscal 2017.","Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.","We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fill our customers\u2019 needs regardless of how difficult the request. And to this end, in spite of a challenging fiscal 2017, we continued to be shared gainers over the course of the year.","Regarding Mexico, we opened 25 new stores this quarter and ended the quarter with 524 stores. Mexico now represents just under 9% of our store base. I\u2019m so very impressed by and proud of the business, team and culture of our team in Mexico. In local currency, Mexico experienced a solid quarter as for the first time since the U.S. election last November, the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar strengthened. While we cannot guarantee anything when it comes to exchange rates, we certainly hope 2018\u2019s comparisons to 2017 are more favorable.","Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 0.8% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter, showing sequential improvement each quarter since the start of the year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and E-Commerce businesses, which includes AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. This compares to being down 2.5% last quarter and reflects stronger performance in AutoZone.com\u2019s business in Q4.","Also, as I previously mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in our buy-online pickup-in-store sales. This strength in pickup-in-store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience. We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase and our E-Commerce platform represents an important part of our omni-channel experience.","We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us and less than 5% of our total sales, the omni-channel experience is very important for the customer experience and we will continue to invest in our E-Commerce platform.","With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle sales are near all-time highs and gas prices on average are quite low, miles driven continue to increase. The lower-end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend remains encouraging.","Regarding our expectations for 2018, if we return to more normal weather patterns, we expect sales performance to improve as the year moves forward. As has been well documented, Hurricane Harvey and Irma have had a material impact on our large portion of our country. Our thoughts and prayers go out to our impacted our AutoZoners, customers and all of those who have had to deal with the tremendous effects from these storms.","Lives have been affected and we are in those markets donating our time and resources to help everyone that needs us. We had more than 600 stores closed at some point as a result of these stores \u2013 storms. Through our team\u2019s heroic efforts, all of our stores were back open in the middle of last week. We did sustain damage to some stores and are still determining the ultimate cost that will be recorded in our first quarter. But at this time, we do not expect those costs to be material. Our efforts have now turned to Hurricane Maria, which appears headed directly to Puerto Rico tomorrow.","Now let me review our highlights regarding the execution of our operating theme for 2017: Yes! We\u2019ve Got It. The key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, Yes! We\u2019ve Got It and leveraging IT.","On the retail front, this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We are focusing on enhanced training to store-level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding ability to say Yes! We\u2019ve Got It..","We have been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these investments will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us.","Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all our businesses. The focus is on making sure, AutoZoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization, not just their store, swiftly and accurately.","Many question how susceptible our industry is to online encroachment, and how bigger the role that is playing in this current industry \u201csoft spot\u201d. Clearly, every sector of retail has been and likely will continue to be impacted by this new rule. We have certainly studied the ramifications and continue to do so. While some portions of our industry have migrated in small part to online, we believe that the trustworthy advice elements combined with the sense of immediacy insulates us much more than most sectors of retail and to-date that certainly has proven to be the case.","Our real focus is how we substantially enhance our omni-channel efforts to increase our competitive position with online and brick-and-mortar competitors. I think, we should also try to put some definition around our industry and specifically our sales performance in this soft spot. There\u2019s been tremendous dialogue around our and our industry sales performance in recent months.","Clearly, our sales growth while positive has been lower than the last three years, but our sales performance historically runs in cycles. We had one quarter in fiscal 2017 with a negative same-store sales. And the last time we had negative same-store sales for the year was 2005. Our same-store sales have averaged 1.9% over the last five years. This year, we ended the year with 0.5% growth, or 140 basis points below our recent average.","In fiscal 2013, our same-store sales were flat. By the way that followed a very mild winter. So, yes, we see our sales softer than normal, but still within a normal band and we have several contributors to the 140 basis point departure from average, two consecutive mild winters followed by a cooler summer, tax refund delays that never materialized in our sales, also the slower growth in our commercial sales, primarily due to lower new program growth has slowed the overall comp increases. We believe these items have been the drivers of our sales soft spot and not a substantial online encroachment.","In regards to commercial, we opened 99 net new programs during the quarter and 202 for the year. Our expectation is, we will continue to open new programs in the range of 150 in 2018, as we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings. We expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow.","As I\u2019ve said on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we embarked on a new strategic planning exercise focused solely on how we can profitably accelerate our market share growth in this very important sector of our industry. While while were quite pleased that we have been able to in essence triple our sales and more than triple our profitability in commercial in the last nine years, we know we have to continue to involve our model to accelerate commercial sales to the next level.","We are assessing how we can more effectively provide merchandise to our customers and reduce friction across all of our customer touch points. Commercial continues to be the most significant mid-term growth opportunity for the company, as we currently have approximately 3% market share and we are determined to substantially grow that over time.","We should also highlight another strong performance on return on invested capital as we were able to finish our fourth quarter at 29.9%. We continue to be pleased with this metric and this is one of the best in all of hardline\u2019s retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team\u2019s efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers\u2019 wants, needs and desires. We are bullish on 2018\u2019s sales potential, because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.","William Giles","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter.","For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores, and our 26 IMC branches, increased 3.5%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,756,000.","For the quarter, total commercial sales increased to 5.9%. Commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $37 million over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This past quarter, we opened 99 net new programs versus 116 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,592 stores, or 84% of our domestic stores, supported by 186 hub stores; approximately 750 of our programs are three years old or younger. In 2018, we expect to open again approximately 150 new programs.","As Bill mentioned just a moment ago, we remain focused on growing this business. We are committed to having a great sales team, supplemented with stronger engagement of our store managers and district managers. We remain confident we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers and we are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel we can further grow sales.","As previously mentioned, we\u2019re in the midst of a strategic review as we are supplementing our talented team\u2019s thoughts with those of a talented third-party, giving us the opportunity to look at our business through a new and more objective lens.","While our teams have done tremendous work and have developed tremendous insights and hypothesis, we haven\u2019t determined where we go from here. And once we do determine our new strategies and tactics, they won\u2019t be rolled to the chain, that\u2019s not the Autozone way, we will put manageable test in place to determine if these are the right strategies. And we are highly confident that they will have to be tweaked and some will work and others won\u2019t. We expect to be testing and refining those tests for a year or so, and we will keep you informed as these progress.","Our Mexico stores continue to perform well on a local currency basis. We opened 25 new stores during the fourth quarter. At the end of the quarter, we have 524 stores in Mexico. We again expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2018.","As Bill had said in the past, Mexico\u2019s business has been challenged throughout 2016 and 2017 by weakening peso foreign exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar. Fortunately, this quarter, the peso strengthened again and finished close to where it started the year. This fluctuation can have a more meaningful impact on earnings, as our store base continues to grow. The Mexico leadership team has done a terrific job managing the peso-denominated business.","Now regarding Brazil, we opened five new stores and currently are operating 14 stores. Our plans are to grow between 20 and 25 total stores over the next few years. While Brazil currently runs at an operating loss, we are encouraged by the sales per store being generated. We expect Brazil will grow its store base and even surpass Mexico store count over time if we can prove the operating model produces sufficient returns.","Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, down just 2 basis points. The slight decline in gross margin was attributable to higher supply chain costs, associated with current year inventory initiatives, partially offset by higher merchandise margins. While our supply chain and trick expense have been higher in support of our inventory availability initiatives, this past quarter showed tighter management of expenses.","We continue to feel we can manage these expense categories throughout fiscal 2018, and our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total Auto Parts segment.","SG&A for the quarter was 32.6% of sales, higher by 53 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales are primarily due to deleveraging of occupancy cost and domestic store payroll, driven by a higher wage pressure.","EBIT for the quarter was $708 million, a 0.6% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.1%. Interest expense for the quarter was $51.4 million compared with $45.8 million in Q4 a year ago. As we completed the $600 million 10-year bond deal during the third quarter, we\u2019re planning interest of $39 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 versus $33 million last \u2013 in last year\u2019s Q1. The higher expense is due to tenor and size of the bond issued this past April.","Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.081 billion, or approximately $160 million more than last year\u2019s balance of $4.924 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6 times EBITDAR, while on any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was 33.9% versus last year\u2019s Q4 of 35.1%. I want to take a moment and remind listeners of our first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard, the new standard requires us to recognize the tax benefit received from the gains, from employees have on stock options exercised as a credit to income tax expense on the P&L. This past quarter, it lowered our tax rate 62 basis points. This accounting change also increases the diluted share count calculation.","Net income for the quarter was $433.9 million, up 1.7% over last year. Our diluted share count of $28.4 million was down 4.8% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $15.27, up 6.8% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned change in accounting for stock option exercises, our EPS would have increased by 6.1% for the quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement, for the fourth quarter, we generated $561 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled about $196 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 115 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hubs and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters, investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments.","With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,465 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 524 stores in Mexico, and 14 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,003. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 6,029.","Depreciation totaled $103.1 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter expense of $93.9 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $227 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At quarter-end, we had $824 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.6 times at quarter-end.","Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. The company\u2019s inventory increased 6.9% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new store openings. Inventory per location was $644,000 versus $625,000 last year, and $653,000 last quarter.","Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $48,000 versus a negative $80,000 last year, and a negative $47,000 last quarter. As a result, our accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 107.4%.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 29.9%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2017. The year was clearly more challenging than recent years, but our team continued to deliver some very impressive accomplishments and milestones. In recognition of the dedication, passion, innovation and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that our sales grew to a record $10.9 billion this year, and we grew same-store sales at 0.5%.","We opened our 6,000 store and had the incredible honor to do so in our hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. In May, we opened our 500 store in Mexico, a tremendous accomplishment by that talented team. We restarted our store development work, as we enter the next phase of testing in Brazil and we expanded to 14 stores in and around Sao Paulo.","Our supply chain is undergoing tremendous expansion with the opening of our second distribution center in Mexico and the opening of our ninth domestic D.C. in the U.S. and Pasco, Washington. Additionally, our 10th domestic D.C. is currently being built, and we are significantly expanding one of our older DCs.","We continue to expand our highly successful mega hub strategy opening five new mega hubs this year, ending the year with 16. and our AutoZone.com online efforts continue to gain significant traction, most importantly our customers are visiting our website at increasingly accelerated rates and using that research to inform their in-store visits.","Unfortunately 2017 marked the year we broke out 10-year double-digit quarterly EPS earnings stream. And while that was disappointing, it is equally important to recognize the incredible accomplishment the Street represented. We\u2019ve done deep analyses to understand the key drivers of our profitability change, while some of them were sales related, the larger impact came from increasing costs. We made decisions to increase our investment profile and some of those investments haven\u2019t yet borne fruit, specifically the multiple frequency of deliveries.","At the same time, we had a disproportionate amount of changes that were working against us, increased wages and shrink, interest expense and the like. Our focus is to deeply understand the key drivers of our business and manage those factors that we control. Over time macro factors will work for you and against you and fiscal 2017 was one of those times that they worked disproportionately against us.","While we will continue to challenge ourselves, our decisions, processes and strategies, we will always invest to reinforce our guiding principles, leveraging our methodologies of evolution, over revolution and superior execution with consistent strategy is a formula for success.","After so many years of unprecedented performance, I\u2019m proud of our team for their steadfast commitment to our culture, strategy and approach and from their passion to deliver a materially better 2018. We have an exceptional team that executes extremely well, our focus remains on being successful over the long run that success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.","Our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us. We are fortunate to operate in one of the strongest retail segments and we continue to be excited about our industry\u2019s growth prospects for 2018 and beyond. As consumers continually look to save money while taking care of their cars, we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice that they need and expect.","It truly is the value-add that differentiates us from any faceless transaction. Customers have some to expect that advice from us. It is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our DIY and commercial websites and in-store experience to provide even more knowledgeable service. We don\u2019t ever expect an online experience to replace the advice our customers want, but today\u2019s customers do expect more information on repairing their vehicles. This aspect of service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will be long into the future.","Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each of every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last 38 years and we continue to be excited about our future.","Now I would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question is coming from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Seth Sigman","Good morning. My question is around the commercial strategy, I know you are in the midst of the strategic review right now, but what do you think is the biggest driver of the gap today versus your competitors, is it availability? Is it service? Is it brands? Or is it really just awareness and developing those relationships?","And then the second part of the question is, I guess I\u2019m just wondering what are some of the potential outcomes of the review and could it actually mean an acceleration in investments? Thank you.","William Rhodes","Yes, thank you Seth for the question. Unfortunately, I think it\u2019s too early, it\u2019s premature for us to get into those specific details. We are looking at all those individual factors that you talked about whether it\u2019s availability and enhancing our service model, how do we work with them digitally and on and on and on, there is a lot of different \u2013 we\u2019re are looking at leaving no stones unturned, but at this point in time, it\u2019s premature for us to really talk about where we see those improvement opportunities.","And as Bill Giles mentioned in our remarks, it\u2019s also once we decide what we\u2019re are going to do, we are going to have to go test it and put it in market and see what works and tweak things along that way, so I think it\u2019s going to be a year or so before we really have a solid game plan. We say here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to go do and what the cost of it will be. Will it have an increased investment? Potentially certainly, but I think it\u2019s too, too early for us to even put any kind of guard rails around that.","Seth Sigman","And you did see an improvement in the commercial business this quarter relative to past quarters even while reducing your frequency and I think you also mentioned that you think your market share gains are accelerating, so can you just help us better understand what you think is driving that, where that market share maybe coming from and is it retail and commercial, or is it really just commercial? Thanks.","William Rhodes","Boy, you have a lot of different things in that question, let me try to jump in. First of all, we grew our commercial business at 5.9% that is clearly substantially over what the market is growing, so that makes us happy. 5.9% also is not at our aspirations for how rapidly we want to grow this business. We have a 3% market share and we would like to grow at significantly more than 5.9%, which is why we are in the midst of this strategic review.","You also mentioned something about the fact we grew \u2013 well, this quarter over last quarter, one of the reasons and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks was Q3 had a big dividend for the tax refunds that we thought we would get in Q3 that never materialized, so I think it was more of the anomaly than Q4 at 5.9%.","You did mention that you felt like multiple frequency of delivery would be a headwind for us going to commercial business and that was something that a lot of people were concerned about after our last call and I look to addresses that for a second.","Multiple frequency of delivery is replenishing the merchandise it in the stores today. One of the reasons why it has not been a successful as we had hoped is because particularly in the commercial business, our commercial drivers, they don\u2019t have that part available in this store, they run to the store closest to them and still service that demand. I don\u2019t think that slowing down our multiple frequency of delivery has been a meaningful headwind to our commercial business growth. Now, that said, we\u2019re still trying to refine it, so that we can find a way for multiple frequency of delivery to be a contributor to both DIY and commercial growth at accelerated rates.","Seth Sigman","I think you hit it all, thanks so much.","William Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is open","Michael Lasser","Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill you talked about cost going up, the pressure that you are feeling from investments and the focus you still have on generating earnings growth, do you think based on all of those factors that you are going to resume a double-digit EPS growth any time soon, even if your comps recurrent to normal?","William Giles","Yes, I think a couple of things there, one of which is that, think about the model being broken down into two ways; one, EBIT growth and then share repurchase. We still have very strong cash flow generation and are able to generate EPS growth through share repurchase.","On the other side of the equation, and you are right, we have made some investments and we have some cost headwinds in the immediate term, but on a long-term basis, we\u2019ll anniversary a lot of those which is held in our investments and we\u2019ll get a more normalized growth rate in cost and as we resume to more normalized growth rate in comp store sales, our expectation is is that our EPS growth rate would certainly increase over where it is today. Now whether or not it gets to a double-digit number we\u2019ll wait and see, we won\u2019t going to need support both from the commercial side of the business as well as just a good expense management and I think we can achieve both of those things over time.","In the meantime we\u2019re making some nice investments and we\u2019re testing out the markets in order to continue to gain market share on both sides of the business, retail and commercial. So it remains an incredibly healthy industry with an incredibly healthy model and our expectation is it will continue to improve our earnings growth rate.","Michael Lasser","Understood, and my follow-up question is, there is not a lack of auto part stores in the U.S. between you and your competitors is, well into the double-digit thousands, you are opening another 150 this year, at point is the market just saturated with too many auto parts stores and you need to consider reducing, substantially reducing your throughput of growth? Thank you.","William Giles","Yes, thank you for that. We\u2019re opening new stores in markets that don\u2019t have the same competitive landscape as some of our more core markets. But if you look at many of the core markets, let\u2019s take Atlanta for example, it seems that the big four, AutoZone, O\u2019Reilly, Advance and NAPA, all have a tremendous amount of stores in that marketplace and we all seem to do just fine. Though our return characteristics are we\u2019re not going to open a store unless it does a 15% IRR or a 12% IRR in certain strategic markets and we continue to be able to find those stores, so that the cash flow characteristics of this business are tremendous and we\u2019re still able to open stores that far exceed those hurdle rates.","Operator, we can take the next call please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your like is open.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot, good morning guys, how are you?","William Rhodes","Good, you Matt?","Matthew Fassler","Good. My first question relates SG&A. So, you did have a bigger \u2013 a higher year-on-year growth rate than you\u2019d have over the first nine months of the year by about 250 basis points. At the same time, your growth rate, your SG&A growth rate in the fourth quarter was relatively subdued, so on a two-year basis there wasn\u2019t as much of a delta. As we think about the rate of SG&A growth and I guess, within the two year stacks and the SG&A growth is quite modest, was quite modest in the first nine months of this year, the first two quarters of this year, is the dollar growth rate that we saw in Q4 look like it\u2019s sufficient to do what you need to do for the business given that how low the SG&A growth was, particularly in the middle of the year when your shelves were quite soft?","William Giles","Yes, I would say that the Q4 is probably a reasonably good target number for us as you kind of think about it going forward. And so just to jump to chase, occupancy was a little bit higher this quarter, some rent pressure is there on some of the new markets that we\u2019ve gotten into and some of the investments that we\u2019ve made in technology which typically have a shorter depreciation life have driven depreciation cost, but I think that the Q4 is probably a good metric to look out.","Matthew Fassler","And then my second question Bill Giles, I assume mostly likely for you. So, it looks like definitely you disclosed on the buyback what we saw on the share count there are two kinds running on, one is that you must have bought back most of your stock quite early in the quarter to get that $622 mark? And secondly, even though the buyback was a bit smaller than we had modeled, the share count was lower presumably despite some of the stock price wasn\u2019t treasuring that, so can you just give us clarity on both of those items for the buyback?","William Giles","And one of the thing to think about too, by the relative to buyback overall for the year is that, man, I think we came in around $1.070 billion or so for total share repurchases this year, but keep in mind also we\u2019re kind of measuring or we\u2019re kind of metric-ing back to that 2.5 times credit metrics for EBITDAR and we wind up at 2.57 or so, so we\u2019re a little bit ahead of what our typical target is, which is also to maintain investment grade rating which we believe is the right place for us to be, so there\u2019s no change in the capital allocation strategy. We may have bought back the stock a little bit earlier in the quarter overall, but more importantly from the capital allocation strategy, we\u2019re maintaining that 2.5 times EBITDAR credit metric, maintaining investment grade rating and we\u2019ll continue to deploy capital methods.","Matthew Fassler","And did the treasury method kind of knock the share count down a little bit, in terms of options, valuations, and such? Was that part of the calculus for the share count being as subdued as it was?","William Giles","Yes, maybe just a little bit relative to the share \u2013 to the option accounting, this is \u2013 definitely has a little bit of an impact on that.","Matthew Fassler","Understood. Thank you so much.","William Giles","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Your line is now open.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you very much. First question is for Bill Rhodes. Bill you spoke about the expense headwinds and in particular higher wages, do you think that that\u2019s more just a 2017 phenomena or do you believe that that may continue going forward? And if so, would you contemplate maybe raising prices or is there inflation out there solely predicated on commodity prices and not other factors?","William Rhodes","Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Alan. First of all, I think, there\u2019s two different elements of it that have happened. First of all, there were a series of retailers that moved wages up in 2015 and 2016, and the effects of those wage increases by large retailers have had a trickle down effect to the rest of the market. That you would think would presumably be getting over in the next year, 18 months, as the market adjust to those rates.","The second element of it is the regulatory. And this is the smaller piece today, but it\u2019s going to get bigger and bigger over the next three or four years. There are municipalities like Los Angeles County that went to $12 minimum wage on July 1. The State of California is going to go to $12 minimum wage on January 1, and all these are going to be marching towards $15 an hour average wage, that will cause pressure on wages for an extended period of time.","Will that reflect an increased retail prices? Well, at the end of the day, inflation gets into businesses. And this industry has shown over time that as inflation comes in, we are able to pass along many of those costs, if not all of them to the consumer in increased prices. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it today. But it really is unprecedented in my career to see the wages go up to the extent that they have this year. So my sense is, they will continue to be up for a year or so and then it will be muted from where it is today, but still at elevated levels.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you. And then just a follow-up if I may. So, obviously, fiscal 2017 was a tough year. If that persists longer than what you anticipate, would you contemplate even slowing down your investment profile, or do you think that it\u2019s prudent in this environment to continue with building the mega hubs and the MSP program?","William Rhodes","Yes, I think unrelated to our performance, our investment profile will slow down just a little bit, because we opened a new distribution center in Mexico, a new one in Pasco, Washington and we\u2019re in the process of building one in Ocala, Florida and expanding one in Danville, Illinois. That\u2019s kind of one-time effort. So that much of that CapEx is rolling in over a two to three-year fiscal cycle, and that will go back to normal.","Based upon, I love the fact that, 2017 was a really tough year. We grew earnings per share by 6%. Now we would not change our investment profile based upon these kind of results. We believe in the long-term of this business, as I try to articulate earlier, this is not an unusual cycle for our industry to go through. We saw it back in 2013. We saw it in 2004 and 2005. We saw it in 1998 and 1999. So these things happen. And over the long term, this business is really, really strong and we expect it to continue to be so.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you, Bill.","William Rhodes","Thank you, Alan. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is still open.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good morning. My first question is clarification or a follow-up to some of the questions that have been asked. Maybe for Bill Giles, if for 2018 the comps return back to, let\u2019s say, 2.5% to 3%, just trying to ascertain the expense run rate and maybe margin for next year, will the EBIT growth look more normal on that basis, or there is still some elevated spending in the year? And as part of that question, if comps are 2.5% or so 3%, do \u2013 does that entice you to speed up some investments, such that you don\u2019t see the full flow through anyway?","William Giles","I don\u2019t know if it would speed up the investments. Obviously, we\u2019re going to make the investments on the places for which we believe that we\u2019re getting the adequate returns on. And as Bill articulated earlier on MFD as an example, we haven\u2019t seen the full results of that, so we pulled back on that a little bit and you saw that show up on some of the margin. So I think that, if same-store sales were to get to 2.5% or 3%, that obviously would improve our EBIT performance, there\u2019s no question about that and we\u2019ll manage expenses accordingly. And we\u2019ll make sure that we continue to provide great customer service along the way and we\u2019ll make the investments where we believe that we\u2019re getting good adequate returns on them and make adjustments along the way.","If we find opportunities where we\u2019re getting real benefits and it makes economic sense for us to accelerate investments, we\u2019ll do that. At the same time, we\u2019ve demonstrated that where it doesn\u2019t make sense, we\u2019ll pull back on those investments. So if we\u2019re getting hypothetical about the next year, but with the model still intact and it remains a relatively healthy industry and we feel good about our position out in 2018.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And then my follow-up for Bill Rhodes guarding the industry\u2019s top line, I don\u2019t know if what is sort of normal for this industry, whether it\u2019s two to three or three to four. So \u2013 but I\u2019m curious if the way you look at the last year is, if we\u2019re sort of on a glide path down to some new normal that maybe less than that three to four, or if the slowdown is cyclical and we should get back to the old normal run rate?","William Rhodes","Yes, I mentioned in our prepared remarks that our last five-year average same-store sales have been 1.9%. So, from \u2013 and obviously, same-store sales is different than industry growth rates, because you\u2019ve got new stores that are driving the industry growth rates. That seems to be what we\u2019ve experienced as normal over the last five years.","But with \u2013 in that number, we also had accelerated growth from commercial. We were growing during that period of time commercial in the low teens. We don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to be running the low teens in the foreseeable future. And so, I think, we\u2019ll be challenged even to get back to that 1.9%, but I think, we\u2019ll get close to it.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Bret Jordan","Good morning, guys.","William Rhodes","Good morning.","William Giles","Good morning.","Bret Jordan","A question on the quarter, I mean, I obviously heard a lot of negative feedback in the channel about temperature-related product sales in our air conditioning. Could you give us some color as to maybe what that AC and recharge product line would mean in your fourth quarter, and maybe how negative that category comp was year-over-year?","William Rhodes","I don\u2019t want to get into that specific numbers, but that if you put all the AC-related, so radiators, the whole cooling system combined with the air conditioning system, combined of AC, chemicals, it\u2019s a pretty significant part of our business, particularly in the summertime. In the \u2013 it\u2019s in the double digits for sure, and it had a very tough period during this summer.","We believe that \u2013 those things happen over time. We had a cooler summer, particularly June was really cool and that will normalize over time and it will come back. But we\u2019ve dealt with more weather impacts really this year and I hate to talk about them. But we can see them categorically in our business so easily. We\u2019ve seen the lack of winter weather coming through the maintenance cycle on brakes and chassis and the like, and then this summer with the cooler winter we saw it in those three businesses.","Bret Jordan","Okay, thanks. And then on the online question, you were talking about sequential improvement in the online traffic, at least, with it driving a fair amount of pickup in store volume. Could you give us a feeling for how much pickup in store volume you\u2019re actually seeing there, because obviously you\u2019re not getting booked into the other category? And then within AutoAnything, is that performance improving as well, or is it lagging AutoZone.com?","William Rhodes","Yes, I would say, it\u2019s on the pickup in store business. That that remains \u2013 it\u2019s a very small portion of our overall business, as you would imagine. But it is by far the fastest growing channel of distribution that we have and it has accelerated. And so we think we\u2019re doing a great job on that side of it. On the AutoAnything, it\u2019s had a little bit more of a challenging year. We\u2019ve made some management changes there and we are seeing trends improve there. So we see business getting a little bit better at AutoAnything.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And you\u2019re not discounting the online transaction with the pickup in store, right, that\u2019s happening at the store price not the ship-to-home discount?","William Rhodes","That is correct.","Bret Jordan","Okay, thank you.","William Rhodes","Thank you. All right. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We\u2019re excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives.","We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident Autozone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today\u2019s call.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"2770":["AutoZone, Inc.

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA, and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners' across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2014 was a very busy and productive year for us. We\u2019ve been growing our business on a variety of fronts. Our U.S. retail business expanded again in 2014 with the opening of another 148 new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction growing sales 12.8% on a 52-week basis with 424 net new programs opened. We now had a commercial program in 77% of our domestic stores, having opened 792 new programs in just the past two years alone, and we continued to expand our presence in Mexico. This quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 400th store in Mexico. We opened one additional store in Brazil and now have five stores in operation.","We currently have approximately 8% of our total stores outside of U.S. and we believe we have growth opportunities in the United States and beyond for many years to come. We also expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com website as well as AutoAnything in fiscal 2014.","ALLDATA introduced several new products and also continued its expansion in Europe this past year. Along with these strategic investments, we spent a lot of time on our core domestic retail business. Our DIY business remains the largest portion of our sales and continues to generate tremendous returns. We continue to see significant opportunities for new store growth and improved productivity in our existing stores.","This continues to be our number one priority. As our commercial business continues to grow and it is intertwined with our retail business, we continued to identify opportunities to optimize our inventory placement and distribution strategy in order to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts proliferation in our industry.","We began testing a new methodology last year to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. During this past fiscal year, we completed our testing and implemented this new approach. We\u2019ve been able to add additional products while removing unproductive inventory at an accelerated rate compared to our previous methodology. This has resulted in an increase to our store level inventory. This increased movement of inventory has also resulted in higher distribution cost. We\u2019ve been pleased with our results today, but continue to rely on the new process.","As we\u2019ve mentioned during our last quarterly call, we\u2019ve been testing different delivery frequencies, primarily from our distribution centers. We\u2019ve been encouraged by the preliminary results although we still have more work to do in order to determine the optimal go-forward strategy. Our tests have shown us that increased delivery frequency increases sales and improves inventory productivity by reducing safety stock. We now have implemented additional test to validate our initial findings and provide us with sufficient data to develop the optimal approach.","While we are more aggressive with our inventory additions this past year we feel future investments will be more targeted and refined. We believe our growth and inventory for our store will continue but in a more modest pace than last year. As we carefully analyze all of our test, we expect to have more to discuss in each of the next several quarters.","As we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, to provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancements. We must ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. This process requires us to have a higher degree of confidence in our plans before executing on a broad basis.","We\u2019ll be holding our national sales meeting in Memphis next week. All week and again during my address to the team as the conclusion of the events, we are introducing the idea of \u201cWhy every customer every where\u201d. We have always been focused on service, but this annual operating things adds intensity and renewed focus. We spent significant systems; we\u2019ve made significant systems enhancements and investments this year in order to capture data by our customers shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to toggle between the store, the shop, the phone and online in order to meet our customer\u2019s needs. We also emphasize our ongoing inventory availability test and what they will mean for availability in 2015.","I\u2019d like to take a moment to discuss our pending acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation doing business in the market place as IMC. They are the second largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian vehicles. While considerably smaller than the number one participant in the industry, IMC with 17 branches today offers an impressive growth opportunity for us. Not just because of the parts coverage, but also because of the strong management team. They are an exceptional team. We do not believe there is a significant overlap with our current commercial customer base and IMC. This new customer base is one of the reasons we are excited about this acquisition. This is a segment of the service repair population that demand OE quality.","While we are comfortable with our ability to grow our current business with our existing model, IMC will be a nice compliment our commercial strategy. We expect to open a handful of IMC locations in the new fiscal year while also making the IMC parts catalog available to our domestic store base as soon as possible.","We also believe we can help IMC improve its store level economics. I do want to stress we will be diligent with our growth strategies here and make sure our financial hurdles are reached as we grow. We look forward to welcoming the entire IMC team to the AutoZone family soon.","","Now let\u2019s turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales decreased 1.5% but on a comparable 16-week basis they were up 4.5%. Our domestic same store sales were up 2.1%. This quarter sales results can be summed up in one word, \u201cinconsistent\u201d. While May was quite strong and June was decent, July was not as strong. August improved but results were still quite inconsistent from one week to the next. We attribute much of this volatility to both unique weather and the belief that the low end consumer continues to struggle. We are happy to have run both positive retail and commercial comp sales for the quarter, but expected a stronger sales performance in Q4 than we delivered.","Regionally the Northeast and Midwest performed better than the overall chain; however these two markets experienced similar volatility to the rest of the country in July and August. While our failure-related merchandised categories continued to perform well, our maintenance related categories were below our expectations. We attribute much of this category\u2019s underperformance to an unseasonably mild weather in July and August.","Secondly, in regards to traffic versus ticket in the DIY business, traffic was negative while ticket was up. The decline in traffic was primarily attributable to the slow down of our maintenance product sales. After growing lower than our historical moments over the last year, average ticket growth accelerated in Q4.","Third, we opened 113 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 173 programs last year. For the year, we opened 424 net programs for the full year reaching 77% of our domestic store base. To put our growth in the commercial business in perspective, at the end of 2011 we reported $1.08 billion in total sales compared to $1.61 billion in 2014, up 50% in three years.","Lastly, I always like to recognize how effective our team delivers consistent earnings in good sales environments and not so good and that practice has allowed us to deliver an impressive 32 consecutive quarters of double digit EPS growth. That consistently allows us to be both shareholder friendly with solid earnings growth and bond holder friendly through a targeted investment grade rating and strong cash flow.","We continued to manage this business for both short term and long term optimum performance. As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter we opened five additional hub locations. Overtime, we do expect to open more hub locations, but we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level.","Regarding Mexico, we opened 28 stores this quarter and reached a milestone of surpassing the 400 store mark. Our sales in the other businesses for the quarter were down slightly year-over-year on a 16 versus 17 week basis; however, as a reminder ALLDATA and e-commerce which included AutoZone.com and AutoAnything make us this segment of sales.","Regarding online sales opportunities, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both the business to business and two individual consumers or B to C. While these businesses are small for us at just 3.6% of our total sales mix on the quarter, we expect these businesses to grow at a faster rate than our brick and mortar business for the foreseeable future.","With the continued ageing of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding the trends of the industry in both the DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past two years, we have seen those traded in vehicles to be resold to new owners who are repairing or enhancing their new vehicles. With gas prices on average flat year-over-year for the fourth quarter, we see miles driven relatively flat as well.","As prices at the pump have recently been declining, we expect this to benefit our customers especially those most financially strapped. The low end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income, this trend is encouraging. I know of [familiar] pumps many investors had asked us about our expectations for 2015 relative to the more difficult comparisons our industry will have in the upcoming winter months.","For us, our second and third quarter results are more difficult comparisons. However, we are optimistic we can grow on all our upcoming quarters, while certain markets outperformed during the winter, this past year others under performed. We believe we should improve in those regions.","As our history has shown we managed this business focusing on both the long term and the short term, and we felt our sales would be challenged in the short term if we felt ourselves to be shown in the short term due to difficult comparisons we wouldn\u2019t make material changes to our plan or operations. We will continue to balance short term and long term performance and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streaks of 32 consecutive quarters of double digit EPS growth.","Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating themes 2014 creating customers for life. The key priorities for the year were : one, great people providing great service; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability.","On the retail front this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. This past year we rolled out improvements to our electronic parts catalog. While this has rolled out to our chain earlier in the calendar year, we learned some things as the year went off. We made some modifications along the way. These changes were around how we displayed product on the screen and presented all the items necessary to do the job right.","These upgrades and our other ongoing ones to the systems we believe have created the best selling tool in our industry. And our store AutoZoners agree we look forward to updating you on the results in upcoming conference calls. Behind the scenes, we have reset our expectations on technology investments and challenged ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the way as they desire to interact with us.","Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all our businesses. In regards to commercial, we opened 113 programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 424 versus 368 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs and grow our percentage of stores with commercial programs although our pace of growth will likely moderate.","As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continued to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative, which also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish 2014 at 31.9%.","We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best if not the best in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deployed in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to thank and state how proud we are of our entire organizations efforts to manage this business appropriately and prudently. We have an amazing team and our initiatives for 2015 are exciting. With our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as an incorporation and expansion of our acquisition of IMC, we are ready to continue to provide wide customer service to all our customers and we are ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structures to providing our shareholders with a consistent feat we have exhibited in the past.","Now here\u2019s Bill.","Bill Giles","","Thanks Bill. Good morning everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our five stores in Brazil, increased 4.5% on 16 week per 16 week basis. Including last years extra week, our sales decreased 1.5%.","Now regarding the macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $3.67 a gallon then ended the quarter at $3.46 a gallon a $0.21 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.07 per gallon during the fourth quarter, starting at $3.54 and ending at $3.61 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers\u2019 abilities to maintain their vehicles and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to benefit from some increase and disposable income.","We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both May and June; July and August data is not available yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry\u2019s favor.","For the trailing four quarters, total sales per auto parts store was $1,724,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 5.3%. On a comparable basis, commercial sales increased 11.5%. For the fourth quarter commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $27 million over last years Q4. Last year\u2019s commercial sales mix percent was 16%. This past quarter we opened a 113 new programs versus 173 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year.","We now have our commercial program in 3,845 stores supported by 166 hub stores. Approximately 1,200 of our programs are three years old or younger. Let me take a moment and discuss our commercial program performance. While our average sales per program is below some peers in our industry at $8500 it has grown more than 30% since 2009. It\u2019s important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years as approximately 30% of our programs are younger than three years old. These openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. However our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers.","Looking specifically at our matured programs, those at least five years old, they averaged $10,000 in weekly sales this past year and also experienced steady growth each of the last five years. This year\u2019s growth versus last year slowed in these programs but were nicely positive. We still have significant opportunity to open additional programs over the next several years at the same time we will remain focused on improving the productivity of all our existing programs. But obviously -- we feel very good about the success we\u2019ve had and profitably growing the commercial business. With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisitions, we are well positioned to grow our base business.","Over the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs and that will continue to be the case albeit at a slightly moderated case. However, we are hiking our emphasis on increasing sales and our more mature store base in fiscal 2015. We have a very talented sales force and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and inside trends.","In summary, we remain committed to our long term growth strategy. We believe, we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. For the [trailing] at this point our assumption is -- I\u2019m sorry. Let me just move onto for Mexico for a second. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 28 new stores during the fourth quarter and 40 for the full year. We currently have 402 stores in Mexico.","Exceeding 400 stores, that\u2019s a terrific milestone and we congratulate all AutoZoners involved with Mexico on this achievement. We look forward to years of growth here. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now regarding Brazil, we opened one store in the quarter and have five stores opened at the end of the year. Our plans remain to open a few more stores and then we find our offering improved our concept works for our customers and is financially viable.","While sales growth has been very encouraging, we are operating currently at a loss. Business, that\u2019s expected to having such a small store base and carrying distribution center and overhead they can handle far more stores. Once we refine our offerings and operations and evaluate the performance we will talk more on our long term growth plans. Recapping this past quarters performance for the company in total, our sales were 3 billion plus $50 million and increased to 4.5% on a comparable 16-week basis from last years fourth quarter.","Domestic same store sales or sales for stores open more than one year were up 2.1% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.3% of sales, up 48 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition cost and lower shrink expense partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives.","In regards to inflation, it has been basically non-existent year-over-year. This is different than in past years. At this point, our assumption is we\u2019ll experience subdued producer pricing, pet events of the calendar year and therefore we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we\u2019ll make the appropriate adjustments, should they arise.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses; however, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our commercial business has been on a steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have not specifically called out the headwind quarterly \u2013 it is part of our business model and we understand we have to manage that headwind as the business grows.","Additionally, IMC will be a [side] track on gross margins as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total Auto parts segment.","SG&A for the quarter was 31.6% of sales, higher by 37 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a combination of de-leverage from the 17th week of sales last year, higher incentive compensation and planned information system investments. IMC will also have a slight impact on SG&A dollars in the upcoming quarters while these expenses will cause slight de-leverage and we expect they will have lasting benefits to the overall organization. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.","EBIT for the quarter was $630 million, down 0.9% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 20.7%. Excluding the extra week, our EBIT margin was up 22 basis points and our EBIT dollars grew by 5.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $49.4 million compared with $57.4million on a comparable basis in Q4 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,344,000,000 or approximately $160 million more than last year\u2019s balance of $4,187 billion.","Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metrics based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, and we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.7%, up from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. We expect our annual rate to be close to the 36.7% on an ongoing basis as the deviation result was primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise.","Net income for the quarter was $374 million excluding the extra week net income was up 7.4%. Our diluted share count of 33.1 million was down 7% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $11.28, up 15.6% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter on a comparable basis.","Related to the cash flow statement for the fourth fiscal quarter, we generated $370 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $176 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 113 new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters, and information technology investments.","For all of fiscal 2014, our CapEx was approximately $440 million. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,984 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 402 stores in Mexico, and five in Brazil for a total store count of 5,391.","Depreciation totaled $79 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter expense of $71 million inline with recent growth quarters. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $188 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. This is lower than last year\u2019s buyback as the extra week last year and the EBITDA it generated provided additional leverage capacity.","At year-end, we had $869 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 115%.","Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.1 billion, up 10% versus Q4 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investments and coverage. Inventory per store was up 5.8% to $582,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage. This first store amount was down from Q3 to $594,000 per store.","Finally as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.9%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. We are pleased to report our 32nd consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth and for the year to report an EPS growth rate of 16.3% on a comparable 52-week basis. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers.","To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off the execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must stay committed to executing day-in and day-out on our game plans. Success will be achieved with an intention to detail and exceptional execution.","Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2014. We were able to build on past accomplishments and delivered some impressive results in recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners. I want to highlight that in 2014 we grew sales in all of our businesses. With this growth, we were able to achieve and comfortably surpass the $9 billion annual sales milestone for the first time on a 52-week basis.","As previously mentioned, we opened our 400 stores in Mexico. We reached a definitive agreement to acquire IMC. We believe IMC is the right business at the right time for us. The management team at IMC is exceptional and we can\u2019t wait to grow the business for many years to come.","Our inventory availability testing and hub store remodels have been nothing short of incredible. We\u2019ve learned a tremendous amount and believe our findings will lead us to more productive models. We are talking more than ever about innovation as the industry leader, it is imperative that we stay ahead; making sure every aspect of our offering has improved from inventory assortments to our commercial offerings to leveraging the power of information technology enhancements.","We can leave no stone unturned. We invested more in information systems infrastructure this past year than in recent memory, an investment that will pay dividends for years to come.","At the end of the day, our customers have choices and we must innovate to ensure they turn to us for their vehicle needs. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, ecommerce, Brazil and now IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate.","Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single-digit range or better in terms of strengths. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flows to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share into double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue wining for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter.","Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our key -- our performance regardless of market condition and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance.","In the end, delivering strong EPS growth in ROIC each and ever quarter is how measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past year, but we much remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.","I can\u2019t wait to sit down and talk with our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our \u2013 while every customer, everywhere [same] and I know our leaders combined with our talented team of more than 70,000 AutoZoners will do just that.","Now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital","Thank you very much and congratulations on another nice year.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital","First question for Bill Rhodes, I mean, as you look longer term we suspect to IMC. How should we think of that company long-term as a proportion of your revenues and how will you integrate this at all in a little bit more detail with both your store base, as well as Auto Anything? Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. Thank you, Alan. It\u2019s a great question. First of all, I want to update everybody that as on last Friday we received HSR clearance. And so, we are working towards closing the deal and hopefully can do it in the next week or so. So, at this point in time our integration efforts as you would expect as we\u2019re going to the regulatory approval process has been minimal. But we\u2019ll start working that diligently as we go forward.","With respect to our growth plans, they currently have 17 branches and there are considerable opportunities for growth. You can look at the other key player in the industry and they have over 100 branches. So we look to rollout additional branches. Three of their branches are new this year and are off to a great start. So we\u2019re encouraged about the long term with them.","Additionally, we think that they can be leverage particularly with our other stores AutoZone stores on both the retail and the commercial side. They have a product offering that we don\u2019t have today. So, we are very excited about them joining the family and hopefully that\u2019s going to happen in the next week or so.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thank you. And one follow up if may for either of the Bills. Is there any structural reason why your less mature commercial stores which are doing 8500 a week cannot get to the level where some of your more mature units are doing which is over 10,000 a week?","Bill Rhodes","Yeah. Let me clarify that. The 8500 was on average all of our stores, Alan. So, we got the more mature stores are averaging 10,000. The newer stores are even below the 8500 level. But we\u2019ve been very pleased that we continue to grow at a very rapid pace opening almost 800 new programs in the last two years that those new programs are continuing to perform at or above where they start, where the older program started. So, we believe we have a long-term opportunity for them to be very productive. We also believe the stores that are doing over 10,000 are nowhere near where they need to be. We had continued growth opportunities with them.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital","Okay. But just to clarify, Bill, so even though some of the units which you\u2019ve added most recently, you still that collectively over the longer term that can achieve revenue levels and profitability levels of some of your more mature ones?","Bill Rhodes","Yes.","Bill Giles","Yes. That\u2019s absolutely fair.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital","Thank you very much.","Bill Rhodes","And hopefully beyond that, Alan.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from John Lawrence with Stephens.","John Lawrence - Stephens","Good morning, guys.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning.","Bill Giles","Hi, John.","John Lawrence - Stephens","Yeah. Bill, would you comment to follow on Alan\u2019s question just a little further. That gap of some of those clients or stores that where you don\u2019t have that merchandise or that line card available. Can you just give us a sense of some of those stores and what you have available for those that you don\u2019t have today and how big of any opportunity \u2013 how large of an opportunity is that?","Bill Rhodes","The IMC product offering is vastly different than ours. It is a branded offering that is OE quality, OE manufactures that we don\u2019t necessarily have in our product offering today. There are certain customers think about the high-end BMW or Mercedes shops that want to use those products and use them pretty much exclusively. We don\u2019t do business with many of those shops today.","However, we do have a lot of shops that are doing that kind of work and then in certain cases want those kinds of products. This will now allow us in our commercial program to sell those cases to our existing \u2013 those products to our existing customers as well.","John Lawrence - Stephens","Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up for Bill Giles. On the G&A as far as technology investments and incentive comp should those stay about the same level going forward?","Bill Giles","Let\u2019s say that obviously from a management team perspective, we hope the incentive comp continues to go up. But I would say that from an IT perspective, we will continue to expect to have some investments in IT over the next fiscal year or so. As Bill highlighted earlier, the several things that we\u2019ve done from a store system structure perspective in order to enhance the information that we\u2019ll provide in our AutoZoners which is ultimately providing to our customers.","So we think there\u2019s some real opportunity for that, as well as tying all of our customer information together, so we have a better visibility on the activities of our customers.","John Lawrence - Stephens","Thanks. Good luck and congrats.","Bill Rhodes","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","Thanks. Bill, we\u2019ve had five consecutive quarters that inventory per square foot is grown between call it 4.5% to 8.5%. I would have thought by now that these initiatives would have had enough time to get some traction and generate better sales productivity.","It sounds like you\u2019re continuing to refine the test particularly regarding distribution frequency. Just curious as to why you think that the payoff hasn\u2019t materialized by now and what kind of timeframe would you advice investors to take with a payback?","Bill Giles","Yeah. It\u2019s a good question, Dan and I think that\u2019s you\u2019re looking at the right way. I mean, we recognize the importance of hard parts coverage. And every time we add inventory we recognize that it benefits both the commercial side of business as well as the DIY side of the business.","You know, and keep in mind to, we\u2019re fortunate to be operating in an industry where there\u2019s very low [ops] to lessen inventory and there\u2019s very low financing cost at the moment. So, we think that this is a very good risk reward strategy that we\u2019re taking and it\u2019s an important one for us to continue to gain market share with our customers.","And then other leg of the stool is really the delivery of frequency. So, we\u2019ve added more inventory particularly at the store level. And then, we\u2019re also testing our optimization of the frequency of delivery and the method of delivery to both our satellite stores as well as ultimately to our customers. And so, there\u2019s more work to be done on there.","I think that the test would show that we\u2019ve gotten some good returns on the investments that we\u2019ve made. They\u2019ve been broad-based in some cases, but frankly not although across the chain. Many of the tests that we\u2019re doing are very isolated. And in those cases we\u2019re very encouraged with the results that we have. There\u2019s more learning to be done. There\u2019s more work to be done. But we think that adding inventory like I said before is a very good from a risk reward perspective.","We don\u2019t see a lot of exposure, but again, it\u2019s not fast and its not technology based. So we think it\u2019s a good way to continue to capture market share. And then, we got to continue to work with the delivery frequency to optimize our overall supply chain.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","Just to clarify is there is bottleneck so we\u2019ve added this -- we\u2019ve added inventory either at a distribution center or at a hub, but there\u2019s a bottleneck that\u2019s preventing it from getting to the store and effectively sold to your commercial customer?","Bill Giles","I think one thing to think about and we\u2019ve always talked about this is that 70% of the SKUs that we carry one on hand, and so there\u2019s an incredible randomness on the lot of sales of service inventory. So your ability to predict and to stay in stock is what\u2019s really become challenging. So I wouldn\u2019t consider it a bottleneck per say. I think we got distribution center, we\u2019ve got hub stores and we\u2019ve got our individual stores. And it\u2019s really where we have the inventory versus safety and then the frequency of delivery and those of the things that we\u2019re working on right now.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","And just a follow-up question. You noted that the year-over-year comparisons become a lot more difficult in your second quarter of fiscal year \u201915, but at the same time we do have some weaker markets that could recover. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about the West Coast given the drought conditions out there or can you expect it will continue next year. What makes you confident that those lagging markets would recovery this coming year?","Bill Rhodes","Well, obviously we can\u2019t predict the future. But we did have a lot of strength in the second quarter particularly in the Northeast and the Midwest. I would also say, it wasn\u2019t just the geography issue. In the second quarter of last year we performed particularly well on the failure-related categories, but even at the time we spoke to the fact that the maintenance-related categories, think about all the under car things that could be differed had saw significant decreases.","So, yeah, we have a strong quarter. We had strength in certain categories, in certain geographies at the same time. The West was weaker in certain categories or weaker.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","Okay. Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Good morning.","Bill Giles","Good morning.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","The first question I had is just regarding some of your distribution plans. It seem to me you\u2019re talking little bit more about testing more overnight, more frequent deliveries from the DCs to stores rather than focusing on utilization of the hub. Is that correct? And can you give us some more information on your thinking there?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. That is correct. We have several different tests that are going on. Let me go back and remind you. We talked about something we called optimal hurdle which was refining the store SKU placement across the entire store network. We finish that testing last summer and it rolled that out. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the results of that today.","A couple of the other key tests are would \u2013 an increase in delivery frequency from our distribution centers to our stores, the productive use and we\u2019ve been testing that for about eight or nine months now and so far we\u2019re pretty pleased with the results.","Now we\u2019re taking it the next level and saying, okay, let\u2019s vary the delivery frequency instead of five days a week what happens at two days a week, what happens at three days a week, so that we can find the optimal approach. We\u2019re also testing something which is an expanded SKU coverage even beyond our hub stores in a select number of we call mega hub stores and those mega hubs are also servicing the other hubs stores in the area further extending our same day local market availability.","So, we\u2019re still very much in test phase. We hope to be bringing some of these tests to conclusion over the next several months and then once we make those decisions, we will be communicating with you.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just thinking about some of the mature programs, you talked about the growth in these commercial programs, still improving but at a slower rate. What do you think is driving that slowdown especially given the fact that you\u2019re having lot of inventory and what not? Is the cannibalization going on or is it more market dynamics, how do we think about that?","Bill Rhodes","Yeah. I think a big part of it is the cannibalization. As we\u2019ve open these new programs, remember several years ago we have 51% of our stores that were on the commercial program. We\u2019re now at 77%. When we open a program in an existing market, we take the customers that are closer to the new program. We move into that program. So, there\u2019s a fairly significantly amount of cannibalization that\u2019s in there and that\u2019s impacting those growth rate. But overall, we want to make it clear to you all. We\u2019re making progress and have been over the last five years and are pleased with it, never going as fast as you want to.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Great. Thanks guys. Good luck.","Bill Rhodes","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. First on, what you mentioned on the prepared remarks that August was better but inconsistent. Can you touch on September as appropriate? And then looking at August, its maybe just the past few months whether it weather mix of business or some secular trends? Can you help sort of push that out and if there are markets that haven\u2019t had any weather noise, can you tell us where the underlying run rate is?","Bill Rhodes","Yeah. As far as August is concern, let me just this, every period for us in the quarter had a positive same-store sales growth. August was certainly better than July which was our weakness point. In September, we have a policy of really not talking about what\u2019s going on in the current quarter because we release our earnings so early in the quarter. We\u2019re just barely three weeks in and so we don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent for us to share what\u2019s going on in September so far.","As far as what was driving the trajectory, you could very easily see it in the weather and the weather-related categories. So, things like A\/C chemicals, A\/C and heating, cooling systems, all of those categories were weak for the entire quarter and particularly weak in July and in certain select weeks in August. So, to us it was very much. When the weather cooperated our sales were strong. When it didn\u2019t they didn\u2019t.","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then second about next year, we\u2019re mentioning those stuff compares. Can you talk about the comp that\u2019s required to lever the expense line. I think the business right now is doing great on the gross margin. So that\u2019s helping the gross profit dollars. So the composition had all change as the SG&A flex a little bit, I mean, what\u2019s the right level for next year?","Bill Giles","Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. And you know, its one that I think varies a little bit, I mean, the reality of it is if you look over time, we\u2019re going to adjust our expense structure based on the sales environment that we\u2019re operating in. So, we\u2019re ultimately focused on growing EBIT dollars, and so, we\u2019ll have some opportunities in gross margin. We may make some investment in SG&A, but we\u2019ll manage those over the long-term based on the sales environment that we operate on. So it\u2019s hard to give you a static number per say, because at times we leverage on very low comps and times we deleverage on higher comps.","And so, we\u2019ll just continue to look at the strategies that we have in place and the investments that we think we\u2019ll help us out on a long-term basis and will adjust based on the sales environment we plan.","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. The lower acquisition costs that were cited this quarter is that normal course of business or did something else change that triggered your ability to lower the COGs?","Bill Giles","I would say that that\u2019s probably more normal course of business. I think better work with the merchandizing organization and lower some of the acquisition cost either through sourcing. There\u2019s probably some deflation in certain categories and that\u2019s probably what\u2019s drove it mostly.","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks and good luck.","Bill Rhodes","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS","Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I was hoping you could benchmark where you think you\u2019re parts availability and your delivery frequency capabilities are relative to your peers? We know that you\u2019ve made good strives in the last several quarters, but I think the challenges we don\u2019t know really order of magnitude where you are today versus where you were and what you\u2019re trying to get to?","Bill Rhodes","Yeah. On the delivery frequency, we\u2019ve had a long strategy of -- we deliver the vast majority of our stores once a week. We have competitors that are out there that deliver their stores on a daily basis. We are in the process of testing delivery frequency. And I want to emphasize the word \u201ctest\u201d. We\u2019re talking about a few hundreds stores that are on this delivery frequency test. So what\u2019s going on in those stores is not shown up in our overall numbers in any material way.","We\u2019re going to go up and see what increase delivery frequency means as I mentioned earlier we\u2019ve been please with what we\u2019ve seen so far. And no surprise, as we get inventory closer and as Bill mentioned 70% of our SKUs have one piece on the shelf normally its in our current \u2013 we sell that piece. We\u2019re out of it for up to eight days. This allows us to put it back on the shelf within 24 hours. So we\u2019re encouraged, but we haven\u2019t made any final decisions yet.","Michael Lasser - UBS","Okay. And in those stores where you have increased frequency, what has been the profitability impact, presumably it\u2019s not more expensive to do that?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. It is more expensive and we\u2019ve got four or five different test in different markets throughout now and they have mixed results. The longest running test is showing that it\u2019s EBIT positive and then it\u2019s generating a 15% IRR or better. So, that\u2019s the threshold that we\u2019re going hold any investment too.","What we\u2019re trying to be careful of is these will be some decisions that have long-term ramifications. And so we are wanting to make sure that we prudently test them and we validate our test results. And then determine as what\u2019s the right number. Whether it should be twice a week or five times a week, we don\u2019t know that answer yet.","Michael Lasser - UBS","Okay. And just to tie all those things together. If you were to get to daily replenishment or multi-week, multi time per week replenishment would you have necessarily sacrifice your profitability rate in order to do that?","Bill Giles","I wouldn\u2019t say, well I cannot sacrifice our EBIT growth rate per se. But at the end of the day this is about driving EBIT dollars and driving unacceptable IRR which is up 15% for us. So that\u2019s kind of the way we think about it. That\u2019s the way we focus on. It\u2019s going to generate more profit dollars. Are we going to get an adequate return on the investment that we make? And that\u2019s kind of how we look at it. So we\u2019re not getting hung up on absolute margin rate per se.","Michael Lasser - UBS","Okay. Thank you very much.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I understand that some of the commercial businesses is kind of cannibalizing from your mature stores, but you\u2019re still at 18% of your mix is commercial, I\u2019m not sure where they have a particular goal of where they would like to be but it seems from just reading and studying the industry it seems like that wants to go a lot higher.","So my question is, is there\u2019s a reason that you can think of why we\u2019re cannibalizing from ourselves rather than taking business from others is seems to be growing there kind of constant at commercial program? And do you get a sense that we\u2019re all kind of just piling into the same strategy at the same time and maybe that\u2019s making it more difficult competitively?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. I would say the cannibalization is just a natural effect. If we open a store that is closer to a customer than the existing store that servicing, its just makes all the sense in the world for us to move that customer over to the new store so we can service him better, delivery times will be shorter and so on and so forth.","So I think it\u2019s not that that\u2019s the only way we can do, that\u2019s just the natural course of business. Yes, we only have 18% of our sales \u2013 I think that\u2019s up from 16 last year. It\u2019s no where near where we want it to be. We believe that we have a long term opportunities continue to commercial in aggressive way. We have not set any specific number, because we don\u2019t want to maximize or put a threshold on where we\u2019re going. We want to be as big in both businesses as we can be.","As far as the piece of that growing in this business. I think it just takes time. We\u2019ve been in this business the shortest amount of time. We\u2019ve really had a successful growth rate over the last six or seven years and we are very confident track that we\u2019re on and with the strategies that we have.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Thanks. And on the DIY side, can you tell us a little bit about your market share whether you feel like you\u2019re growing that market share or is that kind of stagnating or slipping. And then also where does ecommerce fit it into that market share equation on the DIY side, is that beginning to make any material inroads? Thank you.","Bill Giles","I think on the ecommerce side, when we look at the industry broad-based, we think that there is some opportunity for online sales, although it is in the significant penetration like it is in other industries. We recognize that a lot of people are coming for information relative it\u2019s to be a content of the product or repair information etcetera. So we think that\u2019s an integrated approach overall and that\u2019s how we\u2019re approaching it.","From a market share perspective I think we\u2019re holding our own. And so our growth seems to be close what the overall industry is growing at, at the same time we\u2019re growing square footage growth rate at about 3%. So overall I think we\u2019re holding our own from a market share perspective.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Thanks, guys.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thank you so much and good morning. My first question relates to the IMC acquisition. If you could shed a little bit of light on the economics of the business revenue per store compared for (inaudible) store and the roll of online in that business and then also just give us a sense to the pace and the impact of the perspective rollout of their catalog to AutoZone stores?","Bill Giles","I\u2019m seeing overall revenue is around $10 million per location, is about what they average overall. And so as far as what the overall impact would be on us on an ongoing basis as Bill mentioned before and so trying to get through the close and get our implementation ran, integrated and started we\u2019ll be able to give you a little bit more color. I think in terms of getting even to the catalog obviously we would expect that to transpire in fiscal \u201815. So expect that to happen some time in the fiscal year I will give you better idea of that in the next conference call.","But overall its good productivity, it\u2019s a great compliment from an inventory perspective and certainly from a customer perspective and it\u2019s a great management team. So we think that was a combination of things, so I hope the integration go even quicker.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","And Bill if you think about the role of ecommerce and your model compared to what you see for the core AutoZone stores as you discussed to the last question. Is it similar or greater, would you say vis-\u00e0-vis your core business today?","Bill Giles","I would say it\u2019s probably a little bit greater. I think that there\u2019s an opportunity from an online ordering perspective with the commercial customers out. I think there\u2019s probably a broader base from an ecommerce perspective for their product as well. So I think that that product probably has even more opportunities online.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then my second question relates to the pace of the buyback. In recent years, your buyback in the final quarter of the fiscal year has been the largest of the year, I guess some part till the length of the quarter and there might be other reasons associated with seasonality and as such this year that was not the case. How should we think about the way you managed the buyback in the quarter this year and will it tell us if there\u2019s anything about the pace of buyback going forward?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. We purchased about $1.1 billion I think we just borrowed $1.3 billion last year as we mentioned the extra week, as the quarter of last year certainly helped a little bit last year so that\u2019s some of the differential. If you think about it, we brought back about $1 billion over the past six years and so we think that that\u2019s a cash flow number that we can maintain going forward if not better. And we\u2019re also consciously trying to spread it out over the year as well and not make it as chunky as it has been. So those were some of the factors that go into that, but I wouldn\u2019t think about the fourth quarter as being light in terms of being a trend, I would look at it as 1.1 versus 1.3 and the 1.3 reduced a little bit with the extra week last year.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes the question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn it back to Mr. Rhodes for closing comments.","William C. Rhodes","","Great, thank you. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long term share holder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today\u2019s call.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining.

Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2017 second quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and IT; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their tremendous efforts during what ultimately resulted in a challenging quarter. Our results this quarter were below our expectations due largely to a delay in tax refunds this year compared to last.","Unfortunately, our performance this quarter ended our remarkable string of 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in earnings per share. While this is clearly disappointing, I want to recognize and acknowledge the incredible performance of our teams across the company for delivering this virtually unheard of level of consistent performance for over a decade.","Our sales increased 1.4% for the quarter and our domestic same-store sales were flat. It's worth highlighting, the first nine weeks' comp sales were up 2.2% while the last three weeks' comp sales declined 6.3%. And unfortunately, the last week was materially weaker than the other two weeks.","As a result of these weaker than expected sales in the last few weeks, we ended the quarter with flat same-store sales. In an effort to provide a little more color, our sales through the Christmas holiday season were quite strong. Remember, prior to Christmas, we had some significant winter conditions and our sales, as expected, were strong.","After Christmas, the weather was much more mild with minimal snow and ice in the Midwest, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. During this period, our sales growth moderated. Then, as noted above, in the last three weeks when we began lapping the beginning of last year's tax refund season, our same-store sales declined fairly significantly.","Late last year, the IRS announced that, in an effort to combat fraudulent tax refund filings, they would be delaying the issuance of refunds associated with returns claiming the earned income tax credit. Unfortunately, the timing of refunds typically begins in the last two or three weeks of our second quarter, and this year most of the refunds were delayed until after our quarter concluded.","As context, as of the end of our quarter this year, the IRS had issued $24 billion in tax refunds compared to last year when they had issued $70 billion. This delay clearly created a material headwind this past quarter, but all indications are that total tax refunds for the year will be generally consistent with last year. Our expectation is we have shifted some sales from Q2 into Q3.","Regarding regional discrepancies, our Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern stores performed slightly better for the quarter than the remainder of the country. As a reminder, our Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern stores represent approximately 25% of our overall sales.","Clearly, this year we experienced more winter conditions early in the quarter than we did last year, but we expected the winter conditions to be more pronounced and last longer. We are exiting this winter with two consecutive fairly mild winters.","In regards to our three primary merchandise categories, failure, maintenance, and discretionary merchandise, we experienced similar slowing trends across all three categories during the last three weeks of our quarter. The majority of our sales are in the failure category, and close behind is maintenance. The deterioration in the last three weeks also drove our retail traffic count down for the quarter, while our average ticket trends were consistent with Q1.","During the quarter, we opened another 33 new stores in the United States. We expect to open approximately 160 new domestic stores in fiscal 2017. Our commercial business continued to expand with 7.2% sales growth over last year's second quarter, while opening 12 net new programs. We expect to open approximately 200 net new commercial programs for the fiscal year, or approximately 150 additional programs in the last two quarters of the year. At the end of the quarter, 83% of our domestic stores had a commercial program, and we continued to expand in Mexico, opening three new stores.","We didn't open any additional IMC branches this quarter, but we did open one new store in Brazil. While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside of the U.S.","Regarding the Internet, we experienced improving trends versus our first quarter as our results improved sequentially as the quarter moved along. When I discuss online, I'm referencing business shipped directly to the customer and not buy-online and pickup-in-store. Our pickup-in-store business sales are recorded in store sales and are not in our All Other category. Our pickup-in-store business continues to grow rapidly, up over 20% for the quarter.","Under the Yes! We've Got It theme, we are focused on improving our store closure rates. While our winter quarter is a lower-volume quarter, we still see plenty of examples of not being able to say yes to product requests because we didn't have or couldn't find what the customers needed within our network.","In the spirit of satisfying our customers, we are making ongoing significant system investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs.","As our primary objective remains growing our domestic, retail and commercial businesses, we continued with our inventory availability initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry. This past quarter, we rolled out two additional mega hub locations and now have 13 in operation. We are working diligently on the development of future sites and we expect to open approximately five more over the remainder of fiscal 2017.","Our mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations. Additionally, we are continuing development on our two new distribution centers based in Washington State and Florida, and we are expanding our distribution center in Illinois. Our current expectations are for the Washington State facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the Florida facility will open six months to 12 months later. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million.","Now, I'd like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are two very discrete and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores. And the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our network before.","Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we had roughly 2,200 stores receiving three or more deliveries per week at the end of Q2. This quarter, we added just over 100 additional sites as we tempered our rollout to focus on standardizing our operations and refining some of our methodologies.","This has been a considerable change, and we haven't yet been able to fully achieve our desired results on a variety of fronts. As you remember, up until recently, we have serviced the vast majority of our stores once a week. All of our systems, processes and practices were focused on the cadence of these activities being once-a-week.","This past quarter's deleverage was generally as expected, but still a bit higher than we thought at the beginning of the quarter due to the softness in sales at the end of the quarter. Once we open our new distribution centers, it will allow us to alleviate some of the cost pressures. We continue to model 15 basis points to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017.","The second ongoing initiative is the mega hub store concept. We are currently operating 13 mega hubs. We are very excited about what the mega hubs allow us to offer customers. As a reminder, these super sized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis.","Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations. Currently we have just over 3,900 domestic stores with access to mega hub inventory. A majority or about two-thirds of those 3,900 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today, but as we expand our mega hubs, more of them will receive this service same day and many will receive it multiple times per day.","We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a mega hub is 20,000 to 30,000 square feet or even more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging, and it takes time.","While there are incremental costs to those rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017.","Along with improving local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request.","Regarding Mexico, we opened three stores this quarter and now have 491 total stores. In local currency, Mexico experienced another solid quarter. However, Mexico sales in U.S. dollars declined given the decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar. As our peso financial results are converted to U.S. dollars on an average rate over the quarter, we continued to experience headwinds to our net earnings as a result. Based on exchange rate differences this year to last, we experienced an $0.18 headwind to EPS this past quarter alone.","Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 3% over last year's second quarter. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and E-Commerce business, which includes AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sale. This compares to being down 4.2% last quarter and reflects stronger performance in AutoZone.com's business for Q2.","As I previously mentioned, we continue to see 20% plus growth in our buy-online pickup-in-store sales. This strength in pickup-in-store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience. Pickup-in-store while smaller than home delivery is quickly catching up in sales volume. We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase and our E-Commerce platform represents an important part of our omni-channel experience.","We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and on how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us and less than 5% of our total sales, the omni-channel experience is important and we will continue to invest in our E-Commerce platform.","With the continued aging of the car population we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average remain subdued, miles driven continue to increase. The lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend remains encouraging.","Regarding our expectations for the remainder of 2017, we expect performance to improve in Q3 if for no other reason than the shift in timing of income tax refunds. As we exit a disappointing performance in Q2, we are reinforcing to ourselves that we must continue to focus on both short-term and long-term performance, and we will be keenly focused on continuing to deliver consistently strong performance.","Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2017: Yes! We've Got It. The key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, Yes! We've Got It, and leveraging information technology.","On the retail front this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we've been adding store payroll this year, we're now enhancing our training to store-level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability and the Yes! We've Got It theme.","We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. The focus is on making sure AutoZoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization, not just their store, swiftly and accurately.","In regards to commercial, we opened 12 net new programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 programs in 2017. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will continue to grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding resources and new programs to this very important growth initiative.","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our second quarter at 31.0%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are to our entire team's efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers' wants, needs and desires. We remain bullish on our future performance because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial, and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores, and our 26 IMC branches, increased 1.6%.","Switching over to macro trends, during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $2.16 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.31 a gallon, a slight increase. Last year, gas prices decreased per gallon during the second quarter starting out at $2.09 and ending at $1.72.","While prices at the pump are higher today than they were last year at this time, we continue to feel the absolute price of $2.31 a gallon is not high enough amount to change the driving behavior of Americans as we continue to see miles driven increasing. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over seven years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear.","Miles driven increased 1.6% in October, 4.2% in November, and 0.5% in December. And for all of 2016, miles driven were up 2.8%. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year-old and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend at our industry's favor.","For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store was $1.775 million. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 7.2% and the second quarter commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $29 million over last year's Q2.","This past quarter, we opened 12 net new programs versus 32 programs opened in our second quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,437 stores, or 83% of our domestic stores, supported by 183 hub stores, and approximately 900 of our programs are three years old or younger. In 2017, we expect to open approximately 200 new programs.","As we have begun our fiscal 2017, our trends have accelerated, which is encouraging to us. We are focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams, particularly the store managers and district managers. We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel 2017 should be a better sales growth year than 2016.","Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened three new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 491 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores.","As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales and base currency were above plan this quarter, the devaluation in the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued over the course of the quarter and this has created a headwind and our EPS was negatively impacted by $0.18 a share. We do believe the Mexico leadership team has done an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business.","Regarding Brazil, we opened one new store and currently are operating nine stores. Our plans are to grow between 20 and 25 total stores over the next few years. And while sales growth has been very encouraging, we continue to refine our business model to make sure that it works for us financially.","Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales, down 9 basis points. The decrease in gross margin was attributable to higher shrink expense and higher supply chain costs associated with the current inventory initiatives, partially offset by lower acquisition costs.","In regards to product cost inflation, it was relatively insignificant. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable, and we remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments, should they arise.","Compared to the prior year, we have incurred more costs related to our supply chain in support of our inventory availability initiatives, along with rising shrink expense after several years of declining expenses. The merchandising organization has and will continue to work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lowering acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.","SG&A for the quarter was 35.9% of sales, higher by 9 basis points from last year's second quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were higher than last year due to higher domestic store payroll, offset in part by lower incentive compensation.","We are beginning to see an acceleration in average wage rates as certain states and municipalities have increased minimum wages and as some national retailers have also increased entry-level wages.","EBIT for the quarter was $384 million, up 0.3% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was 16.8%. Interest expense for the quarter was $34 million compared with $32.8 million in Q2 a year ago.","Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.152 billion, or $307 million more than last year's balance of $4.845 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy; and, share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was 32.2% versus last year's Q2 of 34.7%. And I want to take a moment to remind listeners of AutoZone's first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard. The new standard requires us to recognize the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expenses on the P&L. This past quarter, it lowered our tax rate 358 basis points. This accounting change also increases the diluted share count calculation.","Net income for the quarter was $237.1 million, up 3.7% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.3 million was down 4.7% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $8.08, up 8.8% over the prior year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned change in accounting for stock option exercises, our EPS would have increased by 3.8% for the quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement, for the second fiscal quarter, we generated $157 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 7.3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $118 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 37 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters, initial investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,346 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 491 stores in Mexico, and nine in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,846. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,872.","Depreciation totaled $72.8 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $68.7 million. This is generally in line with the recent quarter growth rates.","We repurchased $198 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter and, at quarter-end, we had $585 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.6 times at quarter-end. Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 8.7% over the same period last year, driven primarily by our ongoing inventory initiatives during the fiscal year and, to a lesser extent, by the deterioration of sales trends at the end of the quarter. Inventory per location was $665,000 versus $633,000 last year, and $647,000 just this past quarter.","Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis was a negative $36,000 versus a negative $57,000 last year, and a negative $67,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 105.5%.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Thank you, Bill. This quarter, our sales and profitability performance were not up to our standard. Much of the challenge was macro in terms of delayed IRS refunds, but we have also incurred rising operating costs, which include our initiatives. At the end of the day, we have had a remarkable track record of success and we will continue to focus on optimizing both short and long-term performance.","We have an exceptional team that executes extremely well. Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers.","To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.","Over the course of the last quarter, two topics have garnered a significant amount of attention and, before we move to Q&A, I would like to address those directly.","First, following the election, the border-adjustable tax has become a hot topic. As I'm sure many of you know, I was part of a contingent of Retail Industry Leaders Association CEOs who went to Washington, D.C. and met with President Trump, members of his administration, and various members of Congress to share our perspective on the potential harmful effects of this proposal. While we are concerned about the impact on retail business models, we are more concerned about the ramifications for hard working American families due to likely significant inflation that would ensue. Our key message is that we certainly support a pro-growth agenda, including corporate and individual tax reform, but we stress the importance of a thoughtful approach to tax reform to avoid any unintended consequences.","Secondly, there have been articles written and increased dialogue around online retailers encroaching on our space. Much of the information highlighted is not new news. There haven't been any significant changes in the competitive landscape, including suppliers' relationships with online retailers.","We are very aware of online threats and we are very focused on leveraging our longstanding strengths to effectively compete with all competitive sets. While clearly the online channel has grown their share in the automotive aftermarket and virtually every other retail sector, to-date our portion of the sector of the industry has continued to grow generally in line with the overall market.","While we can never take any competition lightly, we believe we have some clear strengths that allow us to more than effectively compete. Specifically, the trustworthy advice provided by our AutoZoners each and every day helps customers in many ways, in many cases where they don't know what parts or services that they need, and we provide basic services to get them on their way.","We also have the ability to test parts on cars to determine exactly what the problem is. With 80% of the U.S. population within eight miles of an AutoZone, the immediacy to resolve a customers' needs with trustworthy advice and having the right high-quality parts remains a competitive advantage for us.","Our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us. We are fortunate to operate in one of the stronger retail segments and we continue to be excited about our industry's growth prospects for 2017.","As consumers continually look to save money while taking care of their cars, we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice they have grown to expect. It truly is the value-add that differentiates us from any other faceless transactions. Customers have come to expect that advice from us. It is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our website and in-store to provide even more knowledgeable service.","We don't ever expect an online experience to replace the advice our customers want, but they do expect more information on repairing their vehicles. This aspect of service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone, and it will be long into the future.","Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double-digits.","We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is strong consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure our sales.","Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Alan Rifkin from BTIG. Your line is open.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Thank you very much. Bill Rhodes, based on your past experience with the delays in income tax refunds, is there any reason why we should not believe that the revenues lost in Q2 will be replaced dollar-for-dollar in your fiscal third quarter?","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","That's a great question, Alan. How are you? I would say, first of all, all indications that we see are that the total tax refund dollars will be the same as they have been the last few years, so that is a good thing. The piece that we don't know and which is unchartered waters for us is the timing is going to be delayed significantly more than it has been in the past. We've had times where it's been a week or a week-and-a-half. This time there was a full three-week or more delay for the most significant of those refunds. And so, one thing that we question \u2013 we don't have any facts to know whether it's good, bad, or indifferent for us is with the timing being in a different time of year, do more of those dollars come into our sector or do more of those dollars go into another sector. We don't know the answer to that, so we're somewhat going to have to wait and see what happens.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up, if I may. So, with respect to your three initiatives: increased delivery, the hubs, and the mega hubs, all of which are at various stages of maturity, can you just go through and assess your belief in terms of the potential progress of each of those three, and what the ultimate revenue gains and profitability gains and, most importantly, ROIC gains can be? If you had to rank the three initiatives, Bill, in terms of ultimately what would give you the biggest bang for the buck, how would you rank them? Thank you.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. Great. First of all, I would start with hubs. We've got 183 or so hubs that are out there today. They are tried and true. We first started them around 2000-2001. We somewhat deemphasized them in the middle 2000s and realized in 2008 or 2009 how vitally important they were, so we rejuvenated them in 2008 or so, and they have been humming right along ever since.","That gave us the insight that expanded parts coverage is a material differentiator in the marketplace. So, then we came up with the concept of mega hubs, which basically doubles the number of SKUs that we carry in the local marketplace that takes it to 80,000 to 100,000 SKUs. Ever since we began talking about the mega hub, every time we've talked about it, we've said they continue to exceed our performance.","I don't know that we could be more bullish or more open about how good that has worked for us so far. So, we're really excited about that. Everybody keeps asking us why don't we go faster. I promise you we're going as fast as we can, but a big part of this is finding really high-quality retail space that's 30,000 square feet. That's not easy to do.","I think our teams have done a great job getting the 13 that we have open. We have about five or so more to open in the second half of the year. We hope to be able to open 25 to 40. We're still trying to figure out what that right number is. As we continue to outperform, I think that makes the likelihood of the number being higher rather than lower. And then, the third one is...","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","(39:35)","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","I'm sorry?","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","No, I'm sorry, Bill. Please go ahead.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","The third one is multiple frequency of delivery, MFD, for us. And that one's been a little bit of a mix bag. So far, we absolutely believe it's the right thing to do. But we've gone and we've changed a significant amount forever. In our 37-year history, the vast majority of our stores we've delivered once-a-week and so our replenishment algorithms are based on once-a-week deliveries. Our DCs and the way they're structured are set for once-a-week deliveries. Our stores and the way they put up trucks are set for once-a-week deliveries and on and on and on. And as we've gone further, if you know, we kind of slowed this one down about six months ago. We slowed it down because we started to uncover some unintended consequences that were happening as a result of those changes.","We still believe, this, in some form, is going to be the right thing to do for our customer and for our business. We still got quite a bit of work to do to make sure that we optimize it. So, that one is still a little bit in flux, the other two are tried and true. They're in full implementation mode. We just got some work to do to refine MFD. Sorry, Alan.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","No, thank you very much. Does the potential exist for any of the hubs to be converted to mega hubs?","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah, that's what's happened with some of them. Some of them are on a piece of property where we can add another 15,000 square feet and so we've done that. Others of them are landlocked and it may be a great hub store that's in the right place, but we have to move it because we've got to get a bigger facility. It's strictly about the size of the facility.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Seth Sigman, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Good morning.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","A couple of questions on gross margin. First on the shrink issue, it seemed to be one of the biggest differences versus prior quarters. Have you seen a change in the actual losses or does that just reflect inventory growth over the last few quarters, and how do we think about that drag on margin rate going forward into the back half of the year?","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","That's a good question. I mean, we've had really a number of years of unprecedented shrink results, they've been really historically low, and now we're seeing that turn the other way. And we recognize, as you highlighted, we've made a lot of changes, as Bill just kind of walked through a little bit on some of the inventory availability initiatives, particularly on more frequent deliveries.","So, we've introduced a lot more activity in the supply chain and the store operations and suspect that that probably has contributed a little bit, but I would expect that headwind to continue for a little bit of time. It takes time for shrink to be able to turn around. It's not something that's going to turn around in a particular quarter, but I suspect it will continue to improve and the teams are working really hard to be able to bring it down.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then, I guess, more broadly, there has been some gross margin pressure across the space. As you think about pricing, have you seen any change in pricing behavior? I mean, it seems like most of the gross margin issues are company-specific or isolated, but just wondering if you've seen any sort of promotions or pricing changes across the group.","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah, that's a good question, because when you look at our gross margin, we've rifle shot at two (42:50) particular individual items, both supply chain, which is inventory availability initiatives that we're very conscious (42:57) about; shrink, which has been in the historic lows and now a little bit higher. Past that, our gross margin rate is very healthy.","We have not seen any kind of pricing activities in the marketplace that I would consider to be disruptive. Our merchandising organization continues to work very hard at lowering acquisition costs and have been very successful at it.","So, overall, I would categorize our gross margin is very healthy. It continues to be very healthy in rational industry. We've got a couple of items that are in our control, and we're working hard at reducing them.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin G. Zerman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. This is Ben Zerman on for Simeon. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to piggy back a little bit on the inventory initiatives and then ask another question related to miles driven trends.","Related to inventory initiatives, it looked like you actually slowed the multi-frequency delivery rollouts a little bit this quarter, yet the shrink expense popped up. Can you give us any color around what to expect in terms of gross margins for the back half of the year? Should we expect them to expand if the shrink in inventory headwinds persist or can you give us some color on that? And then I have one more question.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","I think, first of all, we did intentionally slow down the multiple frequency delivery rollout. We actually tipped that on the last call that we were going to move from 300, 350 stores a quarter to 100 stores in a quarter, and that's what we did. And we did that because it's causing quite a bit of change and with change comes some disruption in our supply chain and we wanted to slow it down so that we can work through some of those elements to change management. And honestly, it's had the desired result. I think things are settling down a bit in our distribution centers.","We added a tremendous amount of workload to them over the last couple of years, so we're pleased with that change. Clearly, that has resulted in some increased cost in our supply chain. You saw that called out in our press release. Part of that was due to MFD. Part of that was also due to the significant decline in sales that we had in the last three weeks. So, I think, as we think about it going forward, we've been sayings it's 15 or 20 basis points of headwind going forward.","Regarding the shrink question, I wouldn't necessarily draw a direct correlation in slowing down MFD and an increase in shrink. As Bill previously stated, I do think we've been moving a lot of inventory throughout our network over the last couple of years. And when you move inventory, the more times you handle it, the more susceptible you are to shrink. I again want to say what he said. We've had unprecedented improvements in our shrink expense over the last six years. It's going the other way now, but I am highly confident that our team will get back out in front of it and control it effectively. The only problem is, when shrink starts going one way or the other, it has a bit of a tail to it and takes some time to turn around; but, I think we would expect that to be a bit of a headwind for the balance of the year.","Benjamin G. Zerman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then, just one more question around miles driven. I know miles driven on at least a one-year, two-year basis decelerated a little bit in December. I don't know if you've seen this data, but if you were to slice the miles driven data by average vehicle age and look at each individual vehicle bucket, are you seeing any difference in trends between miles driven within your sweet spot of, say, 7-year old to 13-year old vehicles versus newer vehicles that tend to be with more the dealer while they're under warranty?","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","No, and I'm not so sure that we have access to slice it that way. I mean, from our perspective, the 2.8% increase for 2016 is a great number. I mean, for us to be able to be anything above a 1% on miles driven is a really solid number. And so, it's going to reflect more wear and tear, and we feel really good about where the age of the vehicles are and the increased wear and tear that they are incurring given the higher miles driven. So, I think, again, it points to a really healthy industry.","Benjamin G. Zerman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Goldsmith - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. It's Michael Goldsmith on for Michael Lasser this morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. My first question is on the tax refunds. And the delay in those tax refunds, did that have an outsized impact on particular parts categories or the DIY or commercial side of the business, and does the amount that you can recapture differ between these segments?","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. I think the second part of your question is yet to be determined. Historically, we think we've recaptured them. This time, as I said earlier, the timeframe is significantly different, so we'll have to wait and see a little bit.","I think \u2013 the parts categories, yeah, there's some differences. I don't think there's really any material differences in which categories respond differently. There's some of them deferred maintenance categories, like brakes, where you'll see a more pronounced difference. Failure category is a little bit less pronounced because you have to get the car up and running that day.","You asked specifically about differences between retail and commercial, and I would say it's definitely more pronounced in retail; but, as it lingered, we saw it increase in commercial. All of this is going to play itself out over the next three weeks or four weeks. We think it is transitory in nature. There's nothing we could have done about it. As we now look back on it, I don't think there's anything we would do differently as a result. We'll just somewhat have to deal with the consequences of them trying to deal with fraud, which I think is the right thing to do.","Michael Goldsmith - UBS Securities LLC","That's helpful. And then, as a follow-up, given that we had a little bit of a colder December than last year, but generally a milder winter overall, how does that impact the setup for the rest of the year for Zone and the industry overall?","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah, to me, that's the most germane question that we're talking about. We loved what happened in December. Last year, we didn't have that kind of winter weather, and it was very encouraging to us. All the long-term forecasts said that it was going to last longer and be more pronounced, but basically as soon as we got through the Christmas holidays, the weather got much more mild.","We would have preferred that December would have repeated itself in January. In the past, we've had a very mild winter followed by a more normalized winter, and we've seen those sales rebound in the spring and, particularly, in the summer. We're a little bit uncertain as we go into this year. We think, clearly, some of the deferred maintenance items that were pulled into December and January last year, that did not happen, so we would anticipate getting those deferred maintenance items in the third quarter and in the beginnings of the fourth quarter. But as far as failure items, because of the difficult winter, I think it's still yet to be seen, so \u2013 chassis parts and brakes and the like. So, we're going to have to wait and see if it's a little bit of a different cycle for us.","Michael Goldsmith - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, again.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Good morning.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","So, I hope not to beat a dead horse here, but first question quickly on the tax refunds; I think it's basically a follow-up to the prior question. If you look at, I guess, the results we saw today, it seems as though this delay likely had a larger impact on the DIY side. So, the question I have, is that \u2013 and I understand this delay is different than prior delays. But as you look back over time, is that usually what happens? Do you usually see a more pronounced impact on the DIY side?","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. I would say, number one, we're much more mature in our retail business than we are in our commercial business. So, any macro headwinds or tailwinds we see more pronounced in the retail business. But clearly, every time we've seen it, it has been a bigger impact on retail than it has commercial. This time, we clearly saw it in commercial; although, it lagged a week-and-a-half or so.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And the second question I have \u2013 and I appreciate your comments, Bill, in your prepared remarks regarding E-Commerce because that has been a topic lately. So, the question I have is, has AutoZone taken any proactive \u2013 any more proactive actions lately, such as pricing \u2013 more aggressively pricing against some of the online competitors or even in advertising to protect the business more from this type of competition?","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","I would say, no. I would say we are continuing to execute our strategy. And I also want to say our head's not in the sand. We're very much cognizant of what's going on in and around us, but I would say our pricing philosophies, our advertising philosophies to-date have not changed as a result of any competitive threat. I would say we're constantly looking for ways to optimize our pricing and we're constantly looking for ways to improve our advertising. And clearly, digital advertising is becoming more and more important, whether that's going up against an online-only competitor or going up against traditional brick-and-mortar competitors. That is becoming a more and more important element, but I don't see that as a shift because of online competition.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Thank you for taking my question. This is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. Most of my questions have been answered, but just quickly wanted to touch base on one or two topics. In terms of tax refunds, last week seemed to have seen a little bit of a pickup in the refund activity. Bill, could you talk if your comps also saw a bit of refunds in the last week or this week? Just curious there.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Last week, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday I think there was something like $70 billion of tax refunds that were released, not that we're paying attention. We clearly saw our sales increase as a result of that. I want to be really careful about getting into too finite of issues on what's going on day-to-day or even over a weekend. We're in this business for the long term. But clearly, as those large amount of refunds hit the market, we saw a pickup in our business. And I'll leave it at that.","Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. And then a follow-up on the lines of a question that Brian just asked in terms of the online business, the other category, ALLDATA, AutoAnything that declined 3% and was weak second quarter running, how are you thinking about improving trends in this business? Thank you.","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. I think on both very different businesses, by the way, and they have made some improvements since the previous quarter, so I think they'll continue to grow. I think AutoAnything has had some challenges over the last six or so months and there's some real opportunities for us to expand SKU assortments and also to increase our search engine optimization activities, et cetera, in order to drive traffic. So, I think that we'll continue to be competitive there. And ALLDATA continues to be a very strong business and a very important business in the commercial segment as well. So, both businesses are flattish at the moment, down a little bit, but they're making some improvements and we expect to see them continue to make improvements over the next few quarters.","Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. I guess, you had said you haven't really changed your pricing strategy, so I'll ask the question why not? How do you look at Amazon's pricing versus yours? I think a lot of us have done pricing studies and it does look like they are a little bit below you, so why wouldn't that necessitate a change to your strategy?","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think there's any question that they're priced below us in many different cases, but I think the value proposition is extraordinarily different. Number one, the convenience factor, you can walk into our store and the sense of immediacy, particularly if you have a failure part that's right at your hand, so you can get back on the road immediately versus having to wait overnight or a couple of days in most cases. I don't think many consumers today are willing to wait when their car is down for that. So, that's one element. There are many elements.","Another element is we've got tremendous trustworthy advice in our AutoZoners in-store. That comes with a cost and, therefore, it's part of the value proposition. But for an AutoZoner to help a customer figure out what is going on with their vehicle and what the solution is, there's value to the customer in that. We do core returns \u2013 a significant amount of our sales come with a core return where they're to take that core back and on and on and on.","So, I think we feel like there's a significant value proposition differential between us and any online competitor. And what happens with that over time, we'll see. We've dealt with price competition for years. And some of that price competition, for instance, is in mass merchandising, and we've effectively managed through that over the years because there's a different value proposition. So, we don't see it necessarily any different.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, I guess, to follow up on that \u2013 and those are good points, are there any way to quantify those points, whether it be the need for immediacy? You gave us the year-over-year growth in buy-online in-store pickup, but what percent of your total sales was that or maybe what percent of your sales come with some consultation rather than just someone grabbing an item and going percent of returns, anything like that? And by the way, can you help us what do you mean by a core return? I'm not familiar.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","So, a core return is, if you buy an alternator from us, we will sell you the alternator for, let's say, $100, and has a $25 core because the old alternator is \u2013 it's a remanufactured alternator and the old alternator is the raw material to make the next one, so there's a deposit, if you will, is what a core charge is. So, the point is there's a tremendous reverse supply chain in this business that doesn't exist in many other businesses. A lot other businesses can talk about returns, but this one has a significant reverse supply chain.","On buy-online pickup-in-store, it's not a significant part of our business today, so I don't want to overstate that. And then you asked how are we going to determine what this right price differential is over time. I think we're going to do it just the same way we've done the last 37 years. It's trial and error. We've had different competitive channels over the years and we have very effectively been able to optimize our pricing in light of the different competitive sets and I think we'll continue to do that.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Good. I think I'll turn it over to someone else now. Thanks.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Thanks.","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","The next question we have is coming from Dan Wewer, Raymond James. Your line is open.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Bill, one of the territories that did not achieve above-average same-store sales growth was the Southeast. We've seen a large number of O'Reilly stores opening in the State of Florida. Can you talk about how the growing competitive overlap in that state could be impacting sales growth?","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. Dan, I wouldn't overstate their role into South Florida. We have different competitors that are going into different parts of the country all the time. Clearly, Florida is a strong market for us, but we're not the most dominant player as far as store count in Florida. There are others that have significantly more stores than us. I don't think we're seeing anything different in Florida than we've seen as we've had competitive encroachments in other parts of the country.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just a second question and talking about Mexico. It sounds like that could be a longer-term challenge, given some of the political decisions being made in Washington. Is there anything that you can do to \u2013 whether it's hedging or pricing, anything to improve the profitability of your stores in Mexico?","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. I would start with, first of all, we're very pleased with the performance of our Mexico business. I think our team down there has done a superb job of managing in light of this significant devaluation of the peso. Frankly, this all started a couple of years ago and, if you recall, we were talking last year that we thought it would kind of be a one-time deal and then would have muted impact going forward. That clearly has not happened.","Post the election, the peso significantly deteriorated yet again. We can't manage the peso. We can go off and hedge, but we've elected not to do that. We've elected to try to do most of our hedging by buying in local currency and, therefore, we hedge the product cost versus hedging the profitabilities. But at the end of the day, if there's a deterioration in the peso, it hurts our U.S. dollar profits. But at the end of the day, we would be doing the same thing in Mexico that we've been doing all along, and it's been a good business for us and we anticipate it being a good business for a long time.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then the last question I have is on the better momentum in commercial. Do you think that's primarily the sales training that you alluded to earlier focusing on Yes! We've Got It? Are you expanding that message to a larger number of commercial customers or is it just going to your existing Platinum or Gold accounts and hitting them more aggressively?","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","I think it's multifaceted. Number one, yes, we're out communicating to our customers Yes! We've Got It in a way that we never have before. We believe we can do that because we're in a better position than we ever have been before. So, I would add a lot of the emphasis to just strictly the improvements that we have in inventory availability.","And then as we've talked over the last year, another big part of what we're trying to do is significantly increase the engagement of our store managers and our district managers in this business. Many of us, myself included, grew up with the retail business. And so, for lack of a better term, it's kind of our comfort zone or our fast ball. We've got to force ourselves to get deeper and deeper into the commercial business and I think we're doing that over time and I think that will pay long-term significant dividends.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Thank you, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have is coming from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Good morning.","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Good morning.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I wanted to focus on growth in the commercial segment, given the acceleration this quarter and maybe just high-level \u2013 some high-level commentary on how this business is progressing relative to your expectations in both segments, right, building existing customers and then also gaining new customers.","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","I think on both sides we've been very pleased overall, even with the recent performance of the quarter. I mean, we had an acceleration in our commercial programs overall. We're clearly gaining share, growing significantly faster than the industry. The team has put in several new programs in order to help drive both existing customers as well as prospecting and attaining new customers as well. So, that business does seem to be healthier and it seems on a track to continue to grow. So, I think on both sides, it's been healthy, but it's really more the existing customers that have been really strong, and that's the one area that we're really focused on.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then, maybe staying on that topic as a follow-up, I mean, is there anything to call out regionally? I mean, we talked about some of the regions so far this call from a performance standpoint within the commercial segment any one outstripping others? And then, do you know where you're gaining share from when you think about growing your existing customer base or is it really broad?","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","It's very broad and in fairness we have a low market share, so we believe that there's enormous greenfield opportunities for us across the country. All the regions performed reasonably well. Clearly, the weather-affected regions in prior years had been more challenged, but they weren't this year. They continued to perform well. So, we see it pretty balanced across the country, so we feel pretty good about the commercial team as a whole and how they're performing.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll hand the call over back to Mr. Bill Rhodes. Thank you.","William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I would like it take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be very solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the balance of the year. We'll not take anything for granted, as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.","Thank you all for participating in today's call.

Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2018 second quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their efforts that led us to deliver solid top and bottom line results for this quarter. For the last couple of years, we've discussed that the moderate winters have negatively impacted our business. As this winter was more severe, our performance certainly improved. And it's important to, again, highlight that there are multiple implications from the cold and wet winter we experienced.","In the short term, extreme cold results in immediate sales in categories like batteries, antifreeze, blower motors and the like, and ice and snow results in immediate sales of wipers, deicers, scrapers, et cetera. Additionally, we believe these conditions and the efforts to remedy them should have a lasting benefit in under-car categories like brakes, chassis and similar categories. We're optimistic that conditions could continue to be more favorable for the balance of our fiscal year.","In this morning's press release, we introduced adjustments to our GAAP numbers that are very unusual for us. But due to their significance, we thought they warranted increased visibility for investors. These include adjustments to the tax reform, impact from stock-option accounting and impairment charges related to two business units. I will give more details on these and provide some context regarding ongoing impacts of some of these adjustments.","Let's begin with the impairments. These charges were taken on both our AutoAnything and IMC businesses. As we stated in the press release, we determined these businesses were not core to our strategic priorities going forward and proceeded to begin a sale process. This process, along with our normal testing we do, led us to the conclusion it was appropriate to take a net of tax impairment charge of $147 million.","Now, I'd like to provide a little background on our strategic rationale for exiting these two businesses. AutoAnything, an online-only retailer that sells performance and accessory products, was acquired in the winter of 2012. We acquired AutoAnything to better understand the internet-only environment and to leverage those learnings on AutoZone.com. AutoAnything has always been run separate and distinct from AutoZone and AutoZone.com. Both the AutoAnything and AutoZone.com teams have learned from each other, but over time, as omni-channel has emerged and increased in importance, we've decided that our focus and efforts would be better spent focusing on AutoZone.com and driving our core business. This morning, we announced an agreement with Kingswood Capital who has purchased this business.","IMC, our import parts wholesale distributor business, was acquired in the fall of 2014, and our objective was to enhance our understanding of the WD model, while leveraging their focus on the import market. Our intention was to substantially expand their footprint, and we grew their branch count from 17 to 26. As we have grown this business, it has been increasingly challenging to grow quickly on a profitable basis. As our strategic perspective on the commercial marketplace has progressed, we have determined that our time, attention, focus and investments would be substantially more valuable centered on growing our core commercial business rather than focusing on a more narrow high-end import market. This morning, we announced an agreement with the Parts Authority for them to acquire this business.","Before leaving this subject, I'd like to thank all of the employees of AutoAnything and IMC. They have been terrific AutoZoners and have always put the customer first in everything they do. We believe both of these enterprises will be better suited to a different ownership structure, where they will get the time, attention and investments necessary to optimize their business model.","Next, we adopted the new stock option accounting standard in the beginning of fiscal 2017. This new standard can cause significant fluctuations in tax expense and diluted share count based on stock option exercise patterns. As this is inherently difficult to model and virtually impossible to forecast, we have elected to show the difference over the last year as an adjustment to GAAP earnings. This quarter, adjusting both years for the stock option accounting, the new standard increased our second quarter EPS by $0.72 a share.","Now, let's turn to Tax Reform. The implementation of the new tax laws requires us to recognize some one-time benefits and charges and to adjust our ongoing tax rate. There were two one-time events that generated a net tax benefit in Q2 of approximately $112 million: the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities which were reduced due to the change in the corporate tax rate and a one-time charge related to the repatriation tax on the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.","Our ongoing federal tax rate was lowered to approximately 26%, reflecting a blend of the old federal rate of 35% and the new federal rate of 21%. This blended rate reduced our tax expense by $59 million in the second quarter. For the balance of the year, we expect our global effective tax rate to be approximately 29% for both Q3 and Q4. Beginning in August 2018, the start of our fiscal 2019, we expect our ongoing global tax rate to be around 24.5%. We expect this lower rate in fiscal 2019 will benefit net income by over $200 million on an annual basis.","As we consider this enhancement in the profitability of the enterprise, we are exploring opportunities to proactively invest some of these proceeds in an effort to improve our business for the long-term. Importantly, we have not yet finalized our plans, but our primary focus has been on ensuring our wages and benefits are market competitive. And as we've mentioned for the last several quarters, we have been experiencing increasing wage pressure and we are exploring expediting our investments in technology to improve our service levels in DIY and commercial, both with an enhanced omni-channel emphasis.","Many of these investments are pull forwards of planned future investments. We currently estimate the investments to impact operating margin by 60 basis points to 90 basis points on an annualized basis once fully implemented. While some investments will begin in Q3, we expect these investments to really materialize over the next 18 to 24 months.","Now, for the business results and specifically sales. The Northeastern and Midwestern market results were much stronger than the remainder of our markets. As you would expect, our weather-sensitive markets improved materially as the harsh winter conditions began near the end of December. In those weather-sensitive markets, our comp store sales improved by more than 200 basis points as a result of the storms. As noted above, certain categories experienced substantially improved sales. However, other categories, like maintenance categories, were challenged and other markets like the West Coast also underperformed. Net-net, our same-store sales improved to 2.2%.","Our sales were strongest in the middle of the quarter when the first major winter storms arrived. As we get later in the winter, additional cold spells don't continue to benefit the business. As we have said for years, weather in this business matters over short periods of time. Over long periods of time, weather effects even themselves out. Aside from the weather, we should reiterate we continued to see positive growth in the industry for both retail and commercial and feel the underlying demographics of our customers' vehicle population and driving habits lead us to remain constructive for the future.","Regarding our internal initiatives, and specifically continuing improving inventory availability at the market level, we continue to see a nice pickup in sales from the markets with mega hub capabilities. Mega hub stores are our stores with approximately 100,000 unique SKUs and provide delivery to surrounding stores and other hubs. As our plan dictated this quarter, we did not open any additional mega hubs. However, we continue on track to have 26 locations opened by the end of the fiscal year.","Our supply chain team remained quite busy this past quarter as they were finishing construction on a new distribution center in Ocala, Florida, and a major expansion in Danville, Illinois. Ocala will begin shipping next month, and we're staging inventory in Danville's expansion now. Even while this activity was ongoing, our supply chain team was able to deliver leverage in our warehouse and delivery cost. This marked the second sequential quarter where we have leveraged our cost, and while we continue to be mindful of fuel cost increases year-over-year and labor shortages across several carrier lines, we remain encouraged with the direction of our business' cost are headed over the remainder of our fiscal 2018.","Additionally, we saw solid performance in our commercial business sales results in Q2. Total commercial sales increased 5.7% for the quarter. While this quarter's rate grew slower than Q1 at 6.7%, these results were encouraging considering both Christmas and New Year's fell on Mondays this year versus Sunday last year. Our commercial customers are typically closed on holidays, so we lost two selling days in the quarter. We estimate that it impacted commercial growth by more than 150 basis points.","We continue to grow our business faster than the overall industry by executing on our game plan. With fewer year-over-year program openings, more of our sales growth is coming from existing customers or new customers in older programs. We believe our inventory availability work is vital to these efforts and is enhancing our position in the market. I'll add a lot of credit here for our ongoing commercial performance goes to our store AutoZoners that are simply getting better at running our model. Commercial relationships take time to cultivate, and we are encouraged with their efforts.","Turning to our online efforts, we continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience in an omni-channel world. We continue to see growth in website traffic, particularly mobile, while it drives in-store traffic, ship-to-home sales and buy online, pick up in store. Our website has become one of our key marketing tools, and our first omni-channel objective is to leverage the website to drive in-store business.","Buy online, pick up in store growth rates remain much, much faster than ship-to-home as our customers value the convenience of immediate availability and the trustworthy advice our AutoZoners provide them. This also further highlights the importance of inventory availability at the store level.","We're also working to further enhance our digital capabilities with our commercial customers, and they continue to increase their interaction with us electronically. We will continue to invest in our omni-channel strategy to ensure we can conduct business with our customers in the manner that best fits their needs and desires.","On the cost front, I've highlighted on the first \u2013 the last two quarters' conference calls the impacts we are experiencing from accelerated pressure on wages. Those pressures continue to exist and are much more than our historical norms. The regulatory changes are going to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years. And more importantly, the current market forces in retail as we all compete for talented employees in a very low unemployment environment.","We are constantly working diligently to find new innovations to better manage our cost structure, and those efforts will continue. But we believe this particular area will have continued pressure for some extended period of time.","Our management team remains committed to managing this business for the long-term to provide great service for our customers and great opportunities for our AutoZoners, ultimately delivering strong shareholder value. We operate in an industry driven by, in many cases, inelastic demand. If the parts break or wear out, our customers need to fix it now to get to work and get on with their lives. Because of this predictability based on miles driven and an aging car population, we remain committed to continually improving our ability to aid our customers in saying yes to their needs.","Now, let me provide a little more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, our sales increased 5.4% and our domestic same-store sales were up 2.2%. During the quarter, we opened 34 net new stores in the U.S. and our commercial business opened 23 programs. Year-to-date, we've opened 49 net new stores and 53 commercial programs in the U.S., eight new stores in Mexico and two in Brazil. We expect to open approximately 150 new domestic stores, 40 in Mexico and approximately 10 in Brazil, for a total of roughly 200 new locations, and we expect to open about 150 net new U.S. commercial programs. Currently, 84% of our domestic stores have a commercial program.","Now, I'd like to provide an update on our inventory availability initiatives. As a reminder, multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores, while the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our network before.","We have completed our testing related to multiple frequency of delivery. We've determined that at certain volumes more frequent deliveries make economic sense, and at lower volumes, they don't. We will be implementing the new frequencies over the next several months. Once completed, approximately 25% of our stores, representing 40% of our sales volume and nearly 50% of our commercial sales, will receive distribution center deliveries three or more times per week. Implementing these changes will not have a meaningful impact on our current distribution cost structure.","I want to congratulate and thank the team that did all of this important work. They left no stone unturned in determining the optimal delivery frequency and ultimately devised a solid strategy that we will now implement.","Now, let's focus on our mega hubs. As a reminder, these super-sized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis.","Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations both for retail and commercial. Currently, we have over 4,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. A majority or about two-thirds of these 4,000 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today, but as we expand our mega hubs, more of them will receive this service same-day and many will receive it multiple times per day.","We continue to expect to ultimately operate up to 40 mega hubs. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a mega hub is 20,000 square feet to 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging and it takes time. While there are incremental cost to these rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increase market share.","Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work, with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request. With our commitments to service intact, we continued to be share gainers over the quarter according to the data we have available to us and in fact our share gains have accelerated over the last several months.","Now, let me review our highlights regarding execution of our ongoing operating theme from 2017 that we carried over into 2018. Yes, we've got it. The key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, yes, we've got it and leveraging IT. On the retail front this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we were committed to supporting our store AutoZoners, we're focusing on enhanced training to store-level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the yes, we've got it theme.","We remain aggressive with our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our second quarter at 30.2%. We continue to be pleased with this metric, as it is one of the best in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about financial results, I'd like to thank our AutoZoners for their efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers' wants, needs and desires. We are bullish on the remainder of 2018 sales potential because we have a great business operated by an exceptional team.","Now, I'll turn it over to Bill.","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Bill. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches increased 5.7%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales per domestic AutoZone store were $1,780,000. Total commercial sales also increased 5.7% in the quarter, and commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $25 million over last year's Q2.","We opened 23 net new programs versus 12 programs opened in our second quarter last year. We now have our commercial program in 4,645 stores or 84% of our domestic stores, supported by 188 hub stores. Over 700 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. For all of fiscal 2018, we expect to open approximately 150 new programs. While we continue to implement new tests in commercial, we are continuing with our existing strategies to grow commercial sales and profit. We are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share.","Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened three new stores during the second quarter, and year-to-date opened eight. We ended the quarter with 532 stores, and we expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2018. Mexico's business was challenged throughout 2016 and 2017 by a weakening peso foreign exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar. While 2018's exchange rates have come down versus last year and will potentially be favorable, the currency volatility is significant. Moves of greater than 5% from one quarter to the next mean we have to be extremely watchful of what the volatility means to the U.S. dollar earnings.","Regarding Brazil, we opened two new stores and now have 16 total stores open. Our plans are to add eight more locations over the remainder of the fiscal year. While still running with an operating loss, our performance continues to improve and gives us optimism about the long-term future of this market. With more economies of scales, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So, while challenging, it is worth our patience.","Gross margin for the quarter was 52.9% of sales, up 26 basis points from last year's second quarter. The increase in gross margin was attributable to lower distribution cost and higher merchandise margins. While we continue to be optimistic on gross margin rate for the remainder of fiscal 2018, our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our business.","SG&A for the quarter was 44.4% of sales. Now, excluding the impairment charge, SG&A deleveraged by about 53 basis points. Operating expenses before impairment charges as a percentage of sales were higher than last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation, higher advertising and deleverage on occupancy costs.","EBIT for the quarter was $205 million in the second quarter. Excluding the impairment charges, EBIT was up 3.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $39 million compared with $34 million in Q2 a year ago. We are planning interest expense of approximately $40 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 versus $35.7 million last year. The higher expense is due to the tenure and size of the bonds completed last April of $600 million at 3.75% coupon.","Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was approximately $5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax provision was a benefit due to the one-time Tax Reform items versus last year's Q2 tax rate of 32.2%. As Bill has already mentioned this morning, our taxes were impacted by four main components in Q2. The first one has been in effect for about a year now. The new standard on handling stock option expensing requires us to recognize the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expense in the P&L.","This past quarter, it lowered our tax expense by $32 million. This compares to last year's Q1 benefit of $13 million. This accounting change also increases the diluted share count calculation. Because it is impossible for us to predict when individuals exercise options, we encourage folks to model us on a rate assuming no stock option impact and we will report both rates.","Secondly, our rate was impacted by the tax benefit on the impairment charge taken. This was a benefit of $47 million in the quarter. We also had a benefit from the revaluation of our deferred tax liability and from the new, lower go-forward federal tax rate. Lastly, we incurred a one-time tax expense in Q2 for the repatriation tax on the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. To try and parse through all of these pushes and pulls, I will simply say we expect our global tax rate to approximate 29% for Q3 and Q4, and we expect our fiscal 2019 global tax rate to be approximately 24.5% going forward.","On a GAAP basis, net income for the quarter was $290 million, up 22% versus Q2 last year. Our diluted share count of 27.9 million was down 5% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $10.38, up 28% over the prior year's second quarter. Now, excluding the impact of the previously-mentioned adjustments, including impairment charges, Tax Reform and stock-option accounting to both this year and last year's numbers, our EPS would've increased at 9.3% for the quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement for the second quarter, we generated $187 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 7.3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $104 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hug store remodels or openings, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters, investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,514 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 532 stores in Mexico and 16 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,062. We also had 26 IMC branches open at the end of Q2.","Depreciation totaled $79.3 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $72.8 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $175 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter-end, we had $296 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at quarter-end. Again, I want to stress, we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 4.7% over the same period last year. Inventory per location was $671,000 versus $665,000 last year and $663,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandised inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis was a negative $46,000 versus a negative $36,000 last year and a negative $52,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 106.9%.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued, disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 30.2%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Thank you, Bill. While we are encouraged for the remainder of the year by the favorable macro environment and the traction we are gaining with our internal sales initiatives, we understand we must continue to execute on our game plan. We are optimistic looking at the back half of the fiscal year. Last year, we were impacted negatively by the delay in income tax refunds and the impact of a second consecutive mild winter. Timing of this year's income tax refund season is expected to be similar to last year, and therefore, we do not expect a material impact on the third quarter.","We're excited to intensify our focus on our core businesses because we see these core businesses as tremendously attractive and in strong markets. We will continue our domestic and international expansion efforts, growing roughly 200 locations annually. We will continue to focus on growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate to the market growth. We will accelerate our omni-channel efforts, and we will leverage ALLDATA as the premier tool our shops use in the automotive aftermarket.","To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.","Our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us. We are fortunate to operate in one of the strongest retail segment and we continue to be excited about our industry's growth prospects for 2018 and beyond.","As consumers continually look to save money while taking care of their vehicles, we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice they expect. It is truly the value-add that differentiates us from any other faceless transaction. Customers have come to expect that advice from us. It is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our DIY and commercial websites and in-store experience to provide even more knowledgeable service.","We don't ever expect an online experience to replace the advice our customers want, but today's customers do expect more information on repairing their vehicles. This aspect of service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will be long into the future. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance.","In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last 38 years and we continue to be excited about our future.","Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Your line is now open.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Good morning, Alan.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Hello?","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Hey, Alan. Hello?","Operator","One moment please.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Then, can we move to the \u2013 I'm sorry.","Operator","","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Operator, can we take the next call, please?","Operator","Thank you. Once again, Alan Rifkin, your line is now open.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Thank you. Can you hear me?","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah, we can. Sorry about that, Alan. I'm not sure what happened.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","I'm very sorry about that also. Bill, a couple of questions for you, Bill Rhodes. So the disposition of IMC and AutoAnything is the first time that I can recall you disposing of an asset. Is that a sign that you're now taking a more targeted approach to growing your business? And why do you think you couldn't make AutoAnything work, yet you remain confident in the AutoZone.com business? And then I do have a follow-up, please.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","That's a great question, Alan. First of all, it's the second time we divested of a business. We did sell the TruckPro business, if you recall, back in 2001 or 2002. In each of these cases, the first thing I'll tell you is as we get into these other businesses that are maybe half a step away from our core business, the profitability dynamics are just very, very different than what we experience in our core business, and it really makes us further appreciate the strength of this core business on a long-term basis.","Specifically on AutoAnything, we bought them to learn. Online-only retail at that time, this is 2012, was really emerging and we felt like it was important that we understood that business and understood it to see if we could grow it, but also to understand it and what its implications would be to the long-term of our business. As you can see from both of those businesses, they're not terribly profitable. In fact, we were operating both of them at a net loss.","And the more we've learned about both the online-only area and AutoZone.com, we have become more confident that we need to leverage the strengths of our business, particularly the knowledgeable people that we have in our stores. And so our decision has been let's go and double down on the core business, both AutoZone.com and our retail operations, as well as commercial. And we feel really good about those decisions. We do want to say thanks again to the people with AutoAnything and IMC, great AutoZoners and did a wonderful job for us, just tougher markets.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Okay. Thank you, Bill. And a follow-up, if I may. What proportion of the Tax Reform savings do you expect to be reinvested into the business? And what areas, in particular, will be earmarked? And what would be a reasonable time to expect a return from these investments? Thank you so much.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Thank you, Alan. Great questions, again. I've said this in our prepared remarks, and I want to emphasize it again. We have not made final decisions on that. And frankly, we haven't had a board meeting since the Tax Reform was passed. You know us to be very methodical in what we do. We're not going to go out and make quick decisions. We're going to evaluate what we think the right decisions are for the long term.","I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we're looking at wages. We've been talking about the increased pressure on wages over the last year or so. And one implication of Tax Reform is that those pressures on wages are intensifying. You've heard other retailers and other businesses talk about raising their minimum wages and the like. So we are very focused on making sure that we are market competitive with our wages. Our people are our most important asset, and it is imperative that we have the best people and it's imperative that we pay them appropriately. So I think that will be a big part of what we focus on.","As for when do those investments pay off, it's going to depend on when they come in. I've said in the prepared remarks, you know what, don't look for these all come in this quarter. They'll be feathered in overtime as we're prepared to execute them.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Okay. Thank you. And sorry for the mix-up on my end with the Q&A.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","I'm not sure what happened, Alan.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","I too.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Thank you.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you, Alan. And our next question is coming from Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks so much. Thanks so much, guys, and good morning to you. Can you hear me?","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Matt.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Beautiful. First of all, I want to talk a bit about the rate of sales growth. You gave us some color about the cadence during the quarter, the strength in the middle. Obviously we're coming off two years where you kind of had a perfect storm against you. You seem rather optimistic about the rest of this year based on all those \u2013 many of those factors reversing.","Is your sense that the run rate of this business kind of in a neutral state where things like car park and weather are one way or the other similar to where it's been in years past? Is the run rate you think lower than it's been in years past? Just thinking about the 2% comp in a quarter where it seems like you had more good guys than bad guys, how should we think about the run rate, not just here in the third fiscal quarter, but on a bigger picture go-forward basis? Any new insights would be great there.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Sure. And I would say this is probably not new, Matt, but if you go back to our conference call in September, if you remember last year this time there was a lot of anxiety that the market, the industry fundamentals had been disrupted and were going to be changed over a long period of time.","Back in September, I made a very intentional point to say that our five-year average growth in same-store sales was 1.9%. So this quarter, we ended at 2.2%. I don't think the industry fundamentals have changed significantly this year, last year, or over the last five years. I'm pretty pleased with the 2.2% comp that we had in the quarter. If you recall, we knew we were going to be up against a tough beginning of the quarter because the only weather we got last year was kind of between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we were a little challenged in that period of time. When the first cold weather hit, our sales absolutely performed and did wonderfully.","As we got later in the quarter, our sales softened. That to us was not a big surprise. It was cold and rainy, and as it gets \u2013 you get the sales pop when you get the first cold snap. You don't get continued failure of batteries and the like when you get continued cold spells.","What we are optimistic about for the balance of the year, and one thing we talked about for the last two years is our maintenance businesses in Q3 and Q4 have been challenged. The road conditions, salt, potholes and the like, help brakes and chassis and shocks and struts, and so we anticipate as we go into the back half of the year that our conditions should be pretty favorable.","One other thing that I want to make sure and reinforce is when you look at the two-year comp for Q2, I think some people were concerned about that, don't forget, last year, we lost the tax money in Q2. We did not pick that back up this year. So that was a fundamental shift in the business.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got you. And then one quick follow-up. If you could \u2013 you guys talked about a $5 million operating loss essentially associated with the two businesses that you're divesting. What does that look like on an annual basis? And can you share or do you plan to publish with your filings the parameters of that so that as we model out the upcoming quarters and years, we can do so accurately without AutoAnything in the mix?","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah, and that's a good point, Matt. And to be honest with you, we just want to be transparent and show you guys that they're not profitable, but they're very, very small businesses overall. But they're probably on an annualized basis combined single-digit, low-double digit EBIT loss, so, but we'll break that out as we go forward and you guys can model it in.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then finally, how much money did you get in these transactions? Is it meaningful at all?","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","No, it's an undisclosed number. But look, we feel pretty good about what we did with these two units. We're glad to move on and put them under different ownership and focus back on our core, because we're pretty excited about our core.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you, guys.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Following up on Matt's thread there, you have had more good guys than bad guys, and I know you talked about a 2% average over the past five years. But with more good guys in hand, do we tick-up a little bit from the 2%? And how would you \u2013 and then, as you think about the third quarter, compared to look easier here, so is there something unique why we shouldn't see some modest acceleration in light of those two factors, more good guys than bad guys, and then a real dip here in the third quarter last year?","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Great question, Chris. On the third quarter, I do want you to remember also last year we didn't get the tax money that we thought we'd get in the third quarter of last year, so that was part of the challenge. What happens with that tax money this year, we really don't know. For the most part, it didn't start arriving until last Friday. That was the first time a significant amount of tax money arrived in the marketplace, so we'll see over time.","As far as the forecast in the future, as you know, we don't give guidance. And we're talking about five years of 1.9% and this quarter at 2.2%. Those are very similar numbers. What happens on a go-forward basis? I think we've been pretty clear, we're optimistic about the second half, but I don't want to put a number on it.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. And then, within the quarter, last year, you provided some helpful context around, I think, December was down 6% and January, before the last three weeks, was \u2013 sorry, up 6% and then January before the last three weeks of the quarter, I think, was down 4%. So could you provide some incremental color in terms of sort of how we compare it against those?","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. I would think of it almost as a bell curve on the quarter to some extent. You're right. When we anniversaried some of that strong performance at the early part of the quarter given the weather that hit last year, business was a little bit more challenging. When we hit the heart of the quarter, business was really strong and a lot of that was weather related.","As Bill mentioned in the prepared remarks, as we hit the tail end of the quarter, we had a lot of wet, chilly type of weather throughout the country, and that was a little bit softer, but we think we're pretty well positioned as we head into Q3. And as Bill said, the tax money is now arriving. We don't know what the impact of that will be, but we feel pretty good as we start to head into Q3.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Guys, I realize that you don't give line item guidance. And my question is on operating income, which was fine this quarter. It grew nicely. I wanted to ask if the mid-single digits is the right run rate, and I heard a lot of commentary from Bill Rhodes about investment and potential reinvestment. And so I want to understand if the philosophy around that number has changed, meaning if comps do eclipse 3% in the next couple quarters, are you reinvesting faster or are you letting that flow through?","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","I think to a large extent it'll be timing. When we talked about making some of the reinvestments, as we mentioned, some of those may take 18 to 24 months as we go through and evaluate where the best places are and what the dollar amounts will be, et cetera. But I think that our philosophy relative to our operating model remains intact with the exception that as we have this benefit from the Tax Reform Act that ultimately will put more pressure on wages in the marketplace in general. But we'll respond to that. We want to get out in front of that, and so we'll take an opportunity to take a portion of those Tax Reform dollars and be able to invest them back in the business to continue to drive EPS overall. But I don't think anything's changed in our operating model excluding that.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then with regard to the current environment, are you seeing anything yet with regard to under-car repairs sort of bigger jobs or bigger part sales that relate to larger damage? And then, connected to it, anything yet as far as six to seven-year-old vehicles where this whole car part argument is starting to come through?","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. I'll start with the first one on are we seeing the maintenance items, the under-car items come up. Not yet, we aren't. But the weather has not been conducive to it and usually we see it at the time when the weather finally breaks and gets into the 50-degree, 60-degree range, when people can get outside and work on their vehicles and that really hasn't happened. So we're not surprised by any stretch of imagination that we haven't seen it materialize yet, and we're quite optimistic that it will materialize over time. On the six to seven-year-old car part, if you've listened to us, we haven't made that big of a deal out of it over time. Yeah, it was a minor headwind, but I don't think it was a \u2013 it was never one that we called out as a significant driver of our performance. So I don't think it'll be a significant driver this year either.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Bill. Good luck.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Simeon.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","It's Scot Ciccarelli. Two questions. First, can you tell us the size of your AutoZone.com business today? Number one. Number two, looking for a clarification on the comments on the disposed businesses. Bill, when you said high-single-digit or low-double-digit loss, was that an annualized number in millions for the two businesses in aggregate?","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. It was an annualized number from an EBIT perspective. And, like I said, we'll disclose that as we move forward so that you guys will be able to see it. We don't really disclose the volume on AutoZone.com because what's really important to us is the eyeballs that we get to the site. So we get a significant amount of traffic on a weekly basis, much of which we believe transfers itself into sales inside of our store. Certainly our buy online, pickup in store business, which is not significant but clearly the fastest growing channel of growth that we have continues to do really well. So that's where we really fall back to this concept that we really believe with the assets that we have that investing in the omni-channel is really our core strategy, and that's how we're going to move forward.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So maybe phrasing the question slightly differently, of your AutoZone.com orders, how much has picked up in the store versus sent to people's homes?","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","I would say probably 50% of what comes through online is picked up in the store.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. All right. Thanks, guys.","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Sure.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Thank you, Scot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Good morning.","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Good morning.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","First off, I guess a bigger picture question just with respect to the sales backdrop. We talked a lot about weather so far. With some of the shifts in taxes, particularly on the personal side, are you seeing evidence yet that the overall health or buying power of your core consumer has been improving?","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","We haven't seen that yet. This is a very volatile time of year for us. Every single year, the second quarter, the beginning of the third quarter is clearly the most volatile period of time. So to be able to pick up on those nuances would be pretty challenging. We've also done some work and are continuing to do some work on what does it actually mean to our customers? And if you look at it, it can be a meaningful dollar amount. Tax Reform can be a meaningful dollar amount over the year, but the change in their check on an every two-week basis is pretty small. And so we're kind of wondering how are we going to see that? It's really easy to see it when you get a tax refund. We can absolutely see that in our business. But if you're picking up $30 to $70 every two weeks in your check, I don't know how we're going to be able to ferret that out.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. And then the second question I have with respect to potential reinvestments of the corporate tax savings, so AutoZone's been aggressively buying its stock back for some time. I guess that's been a key source of investment. As you think about this, for lack of a better term, windfall of money coming in and how to allocate that, is the buyback still prioritized similarly, or...","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Yes.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Absolutely, the buyback is still a very important part of our structure. But our capital structure all along has been, number one, invest in the assets that we have today to make them perform at an optimum level. Secondly, invest in new assets. So think new stores in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, new commercial programs, and on and on. Thirdly, we repurchase shares with the balance of that excess cash flow. That will not change, has not changed. We are looking at are there some areas that we should invest at an accelerated rate, and that's what we called out this morning. But again I want to reiterate we have not made final decisions on any of that at this point in time.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Thank you, Brian. And our next question is coming from Kate McShane of Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hello. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Good morning.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Given the conclusion on the amount of deliveries to your stores, I'm not sure if I missed it, but can you walk us through how you reached the conclusion of what the ultimate level of deliveries for the lower volume stores should be? And should costs, therefore, be alleviating for some of those stores you're delivering less often to? And can you dimensionalize how that can impact your costs over time?","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Yeah. I think the way to think about it is \u2013 and you're right on the track there. It's really an economic decision, so we're looking at the volume of those stores in determining what kind of lift that they can get in order to support the incremental cost, and that's how we bifurcated the overall chain and determined what stores would wind up getting that more frequent delivery. As we realign that versus what we are doing today, we actually think the costs will be relatively consistent with where it has been. So there'll be some pushes and pulls, but the cost would be relatively consistent.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Greg Melich of MN Retail. Your line is now open.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thanks, guys. I had two questions, one on the understanding numbers and reinvestments of the tax cuts and then second is on the imported parts strategy. So first on the tax cuts, I'm not sure I got this right; it's about $200 million of savings, but we should expect 60 bps to 90 bps of margin investment which would imply sort of a 35% to 50% reinvestment of that. Am I thinking about that the right way and then...","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Yes.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","...would CapEx be on top of that? Okay.","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Yes, that's right, that's ballpark-ish, and the CapEx would still be its own separate strategy, and we'll continue with what we've done in the past. But think about that as $200 million-plus in Tax Reform money and the majority of that will go back to shareholders, per se, and less than the majority will be invested back in the business.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Got it. And that 60 basis points to 90 basis points, from everything you said, it sounds like it's basically SG&A?","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Yes, to a large extent, it would be. I don't see us investing necessarily in the supply chain or margin \u2013 or gross margin, so it likely will show up in SG&A over time. But as Bill said, it will probably be over a longer period of time of 18 to 24 months, and it's worthy of stepping back for a second and just saying that we haven't made determinations as to exactly what that number is going to be or how it is going to be spent. We're just giving you an idea of what we're thinking about now.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Got it. And that starts in the third quarter of this fiscal year, but it should build to that range by next fiscal year. Would that be a fair way to think about it?","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Yes.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Got it. And with the divestiture of IMC, how are you guys thinking about addressing that part of the market? That was a growing area, imported car parts. Is there a change in terms of vendors or SKU counts, or how are you thinking about that?","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Terrific question, Greg. First of all, I think, if you recall, when first bought IMC, we talked about the incredibly small overlap of the customers that we had, and that hasn't changed. But over time, we have, in our core business, we have gotten deeper and deeper in import coverage, primarily through the Duralast brand, and we will continue to do that. So I don't see any major shift in how we go to market. I think all of us and we at AutoZone in particular have constantly been enhancing our coverage on import parts.","When you think about the mega hubs and hubs, there's a lot of that there, but there's a lot of it in just those core satellite stores as well. So I think we'll continue to focus on the import market, but not a major shift. What we won't be doing is selling to high-end import market, which is where IMC is really good at. So think about BMWs and Mercedes in particular. And that's just a part of the market that we're not focused on.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Got it. Thanks a lot. Good luck, guys.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from Steve Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Good morning.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Maybe a follow-up here on the multiple frequency of delivery initiatives. So can you expand on what percentage of those stores that you mentioned, right, the 25% of the store base that are going to be receiving three times a week delivery have that type of frequency in place today to just give us some perspective on the amount of change that has to transpire here? And then for the remaining 75% on a net-to-net basis is, do you plan on reducing the number of average deliveries per week for this cohort? And any color on kind of timing? I know you said you're still kind of working through it here, but any color on timing would be helpful.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","We're still working through the timing. We made a decision last Monday, so this is fresh. It's going to take us a little bit of time as we rewrite delivery schedules to get in. But I'd say it will be in place over the next several months. So the net change is not going to be significant. We've been testing low volume stores at three times a week, high volume stores at one time a week and the like for the last year, year and a half in particular.","So the net change is not going to be significant. We're going to have lower volume stores that are getting three time a week delivery today that will go back to one time a week delivery. We're going to have high-volume stores that are getting once a week delivery to get three time a week delivery. We think it will have a marginal sales benefit and a neutral cost impact once it's implemented.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. And then just a quick, I guess, modeling question for a follow-up here regarding square footage growth within the quarter. If I'm doing this right, it looks like there was a step up in total footage, and it appears that it's really concentrated with international. Is that right? And then what would that be from?","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Yes. It's probably more timing than anything else, Steve, and I would say that on an annualized basis we should be pretty consistent with prior year. So there's probably a little bit of juggling in between quarters. That's all I would think about.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now turn the call over back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.","Great, thank you. Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We continue to execute our game plans to succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint.

Thank you, you may begin.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2016 second quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT, and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter. In the second quarter, we continued to execute our strategies to organically grow our business. We expanded our US retail footprint with the opening of another 30 new stores. Our commercial business continued to grow with sales increasing 8% and we opened 32 net new programs for the quarter. We now have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic stores and we continued to expand our presence in Mexico, opening nine stores this quarter. We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter and currently have 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened two new IMC branches bringing our total branch count to 24. ","While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we believe we have great growth prospects in domestic locations, commercial, international and our other businesses. If I could sum up the quarter in a short statement, I would call out our major highlights, I\u2019d say we continued on our game plan of executing our inventory availability and delivery frequency initiatives while adding more labor hours in our stores in an effort to constantly improve our customers\u2019 experiences. ","While winter temperatures were milder this year than last, we did not see a material change in business trends from one month to the next overall. Yes, certain cold-weather categories, those that have larger sales during these months were below last year's numbers while others balanced out our performance. And yes, as you would expect, our performance in the Midwest and Northeast were below other markets but they were in line with our expectations considering the weather patterns. ","Probably the biggest unknown for us this quarter was when would income tax refunds begin to be remitted to consumers by the IRS. By quarter end, total refunds were generally comparable to remittances last year but they were issued very very late in our quarter. We feel our retail business is benefiting from a continued focus on customer service, improving parts availability, and lower overall fuel prices. Lower gas prices, we feel, are contributing to Americans driving more. ","Regarding commercial, we saw colder weather markets growing sales at a slower pace than other markets. We believe the milder temperatures led the less failure related repairs being done in those particular markets. However we believe the mild temperatures will not have a material lasting effect on our sales performance heading into the summer. We feel a hot summer is the next thing we will be watching for in regards to sales performance. ","Getting back to DIY, our number one business priority, the business did quite well in the second quarter. We generated positive traffic and ticket on a same-store basis and performance was generally consistent across the country. While the macro-economy is favorable for DIY performance right now, we also continue to gain share and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store with every customer. ","Regarding commercial, we\u2019ve continued with our inventory placement and distribution strategies to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts proliferation in our industry. Over the past two years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued the rollout of more frequent deliveries to an additional approximately 300 net new stores in the quarter. We now have a total of 1300 locations out of our 5000 plus locations on multiple weekly deliveries. As we've been discussing, this rollout focuses on increasing from once-a-week deliveries from our distribution centers to either three or five times a week. Our results continue to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate. ","With the varying weekly sales volumes of our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. Over the remaining two quarters of the fiscal year, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 700 additional stores ending the fiscal year with approximately 2000 stores with this enhanced service model. The implementation of this initiative will create a gross margin headwind of approximately 20 to 30 basis points until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about two-thirds of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries. ","This past quarter\u2019s deleverage from deliveries was less than the previous quarter. I appreciate our team\u2019s efforts to manage these rollouts on a cost effective basis. This is a material change in how we do business and our teams are executing it well and managing the costs effectively. Our sales lift from this effort continues to show the investments make economic sense. ","Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the mega hub stores. We ended the quarter with 5 mega hubs with no new openings this quarter, although we expect to open \u2013 to add an approximately five additional mega hubs over the last two quarters of the fiscal year. As a reminder, these super-sized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. ","Our sales results thus far in our opened mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations and we are experiencing sales improvements from both our retail and commercial businesses. While there is incremental cost of these rollouts, including payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2016. ","Currently five mega hubs support approximately 700 stores on a same day basis and roughly 2000 stores in total, and once built out we would expect to have a network of mega hubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. Consistent with the increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our mega hub expansion over the next few years. ","Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. ","As I mentioned a few years ago -- a few minutes ago we continue to invest in store labor in order to say Yes, We Got It more frequently. Yes, We Got It is a new operating mantra for us in 2016. We\u2019ve made meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory and now it is time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change. ","As traffic has increased in our stores, we understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers\u2019 needs. When customers have request for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, Yes, We Got It. While still early in the implementation training phase, our team has enthusiastically embraced this notion, and with the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure AutoZoners have the tools and specifically the staff necessary to provide our customers with WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve. ","We also want to touch on the efforts that are ongoing with regard to capturing data about our customers\u2019 shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We believe it is essential to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers\u2019 needs. While still in the early stages of this work, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective on our customers will benefit us greatly over the next several years. This will be a significant endeavor for us over the next couple of years. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time mapping through the capture of this data in order to leverage it to better serve our customers. We think this will be a real differentiator for us over the next several years. More to come later on this initiative. ","Lastly, in order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as mega hubs, we continue to expect to open two or three distribution centers over the next two or three years. At present we\u2019re in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online until fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital on operating expenses related to development but a larger portion of capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and \u201918. ","To summarize our plans, we expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more mega hub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open two or three new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from past, we do expect to incur approximately 20 to 30 basis points of gross margin headwinds from these investments alone. ","Now turning to the second quarter's results. Our sales increased 5.3% on top of 7.7% growth in Q2 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 3.6%. Our growth in both sales and earnings were very consistent with our results from Q1. This quarter sales results were also very consistent throughout the quarter, excluding the last couple of weeks. During the quarter, tax refunds in total were generally comparable to prior year. However from a timing perspective, they flowed [ph] very late in the quarter. ","In regard to our three primary merchandise category splits in our US stores, failure-related product sales performed the best. Discretionary had the next highest growth rate followed by maintenance. While all three showed nice growth, we attribute the variance in sales trends between these businesses to the timing of winter events, for example, the polar vortex effects this year versus last. ","As I said earlier, both traffic and ticket were positive for our DIY and commercial businesses. For the quarter we opened 32 net new programs and have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic store base. While our total domestic sales grew 6% on the quarter, our domestic commercial sales growth was up 8%. The commercial sales growth rate while still impressive has slowed, some of the reductions in growth is due to opening fewer new programs in recent years and having a lower percentage of the programs on the maturation curve. Despite this expected change, our sales slowed a bit more than we expected and we are working diligently to gain back that momentum. ","In recent weeks, we\u2019ve executed incremental training and have enhanced the focus of our management teams, including store managers on reaccelerating our commercial growth. We believe our future in this business remains quite bright. ","As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter we opened one additional hub location and now operate 179. In addition to opening over time more mega hub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hub stores. ","Regarding IMC, we opened two new branches this quarter and continue to be excited by our opportunities. IMC parts catalogue is currently accessible to over 700 AutoZone locations today and we believe there are great sales growth opportunities in the future with both our retail and commercial customers. ","Regarding Mexico, we opened another nine stores this quarter and now have 451 total locations in Mexico. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done quite well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on our US dollar earnings from our Mexico business to begin to abate starting this summer in the June to July timeframe as we begin to lap the most significant exchange rate increases. ","For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than two percentage points. At the end of the quarter the peso was down 29% versus last year and 16% from the end of Q1. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 3% over last year. As a reminder, ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses, which include AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. Each of these businesses operate in increasingly competitive environment and our sales have slowed a bit. Again, while we understand weather this winter was warmer, we're optimistic for sales this upcoming quarter. The biggest tailwind at the moment in our opinion is the increased miles driven across the country. This leads to more failure and maintenance related demand and benefits both our DIY and DIFM businesses. ","While we focus on both the short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to delivering consistent strong earnings performance and extending our streak of 38 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth, which is an important milestone for us. ","While our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our mega hubs will add some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of fiscal 2016, our focus remains on growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels. ","Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016: LIVE the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, improving inventory availability, and yes, we\u2019ve got it. ","On the retail front this past quarter, under the great people providing great service priority, we increased staffing levels in our stores. We've also been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. ","On the Yes, We\u2019ve Got It front, we've added training, metrics, and most importantly share of voice to educate our store level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We're excited about this initiative. ","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish the quarter at 31%. We are proud of this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing. However our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. ","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to thank again our entire organization for executing on our many operating initiatives while providing our customers with great service and managing our expenses appropriately and prudently. ","Now I will turn the call over to Bill Giles.","Bill Giles","Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 24 IMC branches, increased 5.4%. ","Switching over to macro trends, during the quarter nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $2.09 a gallon and ended the quarter at $1.72 a gallon, a $0.37 decrease. Last year gas prices decreased $0.55 per gallon during the second quarter starting at $2.82 and ending at $2.27 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers\u2019 ability to maintain their vehicles and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. ","We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both October, November and December and we don\u2019t have January data yet. For all of 2015 miles driven finished up 3.5%, an incredible strong number on a historical basis. It represents the largest percentage growth in over a decade. ","The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven year and older vehicles on the road which continues to trend in our industry\u2019s favour. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per average AutoZone store was $1,780,000. For the quarter total commercial sales increased 8%. In the second quarter, commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $30 million over last year's Q2. ","While the sales trajectory of the business slowed a bit in Q2, some of this is due to slower growth from our lower mix of new programs, we've intensified the focus of our entire team, including our store managers on reaccelerating our growth in commercial and we have recently executed some incremental commercial training programs. This past quarter we opened 32 net new programs versus 29 programs opened in our second quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4228 stores supported by 179 hub stores. Approximately 1100 of our programs are three years old or younger, 26% of the base. ","With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well-positioned to grow our base business. Over the last several years, significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs and that will continue to be the case albeit at a slightly moderated pace. This year we plan on opening around 250 commercial programs, approximately 150 more programs over the next two quarters. ","We have a very talented sales force and we're enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We've increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. ","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we are well-positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. We believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner and we continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come. ","Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened nine news stores during the second quarter. We currently have 451 stores in Mexico. For the year we expect to open approximately 40 new stores and we are on target to open a new distribution center this calendar year. This will mark our second distribution center in the country and it will support further Central Mexico store growth. ","As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our company EBIT growth by over two percentage points. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, Mexico leadership continues to do an excellent job managing the peso denominated business. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our US dollar earnings for the next few quarters. ","Regarding Brazil, we opened no stores in the quarter remaining with 8 stores open. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to US dollars as well. While the peso devalued 29% year-over-year, the real devalued 41% this year versus last. This extraordinary volatility has managed as best as possible, remain in test phase in Brazil but have been encouraged by our improving operating performance. ","Recapping this past quarter\u2019s performance for the company, in total our sales were $2.257 billion, an increase of 5.3% over last year\u2019s second quarter. Domestic same-store sales, or sales for stores opened more than one year, were up 3.6% for the quarter. ","Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales, up 50 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. ","In regards to inflation, it remains subdued. In fact, in total slightly down last year. Currently we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and will make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. ","SG&A for the quarter was 35.8% of sales, higher by 40 basis points from last year\u2019s second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable credit card litigation settlement recognized last year's quarter and higher domestic store payroll. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. ","EBIT for the quarter was $383 million, up 6% over last year\u2019s second quarter. Our EBIT margin was 17%. Interest expense for the quarter was $33 million compared with $35 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.845 billion or approximately $415 million more than last year balance of $4.430 billion. ","Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy; and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter our tax rate was slightly lower than the last year\u2019s Q2 tax rate. This rate was lower than planned. Any deviations to our plan are driven primarily by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise. Net income for the quarter was $229 million and up 8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 30.8 million was down 5.4% from last year\u2019s second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $7.43, up 14.2% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter. ","Relating to the cash flow statement, for the second fiscal quarter, we generated $207 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled approximately $100 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 43 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. ","With the new stores opened we finished this past quarter with 5193 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 451 stores in Mexico and 8 in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5652. We also had 24 IMC branches opened at fiscal quarter end, taking our total locations to 5,676. ","Depreciation totaled $69 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s second quarter expense of $60 million in line with recent quarter growth rates. ","With our excess cash flow we repurchased $150 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter end we had $548 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at quarter end. ","Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 109%. ","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per location basis. The company's inventory increased 3.9% over the same period last year driven primarily by new stores over the last 12 months. Inventory per location was $633,000 versus $631,000 last year and $624,000 last quarter. ","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. We're very pleased to report our 38th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 14.2% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. We are confident in our initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis.","In addition, the performance of our mega hubs has been strong, and ahead of our expectations and we look forward to opening more later this year. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate. And we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leveraged our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits.","We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is, the solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution drives success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions, and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance.","In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must not be content. We have a lot of work in front of us over the next two quarters, but the future continues to look bright.","Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman ","Thanks, good morning. I have a quick question for Bill Rhodes on the commercial sales growth. You mentioned it was a little weaker even absent some noise, and you didn\u2019t mention whether in the same breath, but you mentioned training and labor. So can you share with us what you think the void is on why \u2013 what\u2019s not happening on the training or labor side that\u2019s causing a little like, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s slippage or noise in the commercial sales results?","Bill Rhodes","I would start with one of the things we made specific mention of was that we have fewer stores going through the maturation cycle, and also the stores that are in that maturation cycle were opened later in our development process, which means they had lower potential than the ones that were opened sooner. So we\u2019re seeing some of our slowdown and it\u2019s completely attributable to lower new program growth. But that said, we were still below our expectations for the quarter. Some of that we would attributable to some weather patterns particularly in the Midwest and Northeast but not all of it. Frankly we\u2019re not exactly sure all the reasons that we had a little bit of a slowdown, but we are very focused on taking our one team concept and getting our district managers and our store managers along with our sales team really reengaged in a big way and in a materially significant -- more significant way than in the past. And I think that will pay us dividends for the long term.","Simeon Gutman ","And then a follow up, somewhat related to that, if you look at the markets with increased -- stores that are benefiting from increased frequency, are you making the customers in those stores aware of that or are they just seeing it through improved parts availability?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, we're not marketing to them, number one, it\u2019s being done on a store by store basis. Clearly, the local markets will have it or not, but we\u2019re not marketing it to them, we\u2019re just showing it to them and they are yes percentage when they ask for parts. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler ","My question focuses on inventory. Your inventory grew, I believe, at a slower rate than cost of goods for the first time in quite a while. And this is, as you\u2019re ramping up availability. If you could talk about the moderation in year-on-year growth, whether you expect it to continue and impact, if any, would have had on sales as you went through the quarter?","Bill Rhodes","I think when you look over time we've actually increased our inventory quite a bit. And so now it\u2019s at a 630,000 per store location level, we feel pretty good about that. As Bill mentioned in the prepared remarks, we spend a lot of time on analyzing placements and so the merchandising organization has done a great job over the last, I would call it, 12 to 15 months, of better determining workplace inventory. I think the more frequent delivery will be able to optimize inventory location as well and obviously we will increase -- we've increased some inventories, we\u2019ve added some of these mega hubs. So I would expect our inventory levels on a per location basis to be approximately where they are now. They might have some increases as we roll out a few more mega hubs but not significant increases. ","Matthew Fassler ","So basically growing more or less in line with sales if the trajectory continues as it is?","Bill Rhodes","Exactly right.","Matthew Fassler ","And then my very quick follow-up, you quantified the impact of FX on EBIT and it\u2019s not an insignificant number relative to your algorithm. How much -- I'm not sure how much detail you\u2019ve given on that in the past, how much does that impact in the quarter you just reported or how does that compare it to recent quarters?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, what we said on this quarter was that we thought it was about 200 basis points or so, and I think last quarter if I remember right, we said somewhere around 100 basis points or so. And so it has had a big impact and we\u2019re going to anniversary that somewhere towards the middle to the tail end of Q3 relative to the spike that we saw in the peso. But I am sure there is a whole lot of other macro things going on at the same time that are impacting the peso, including lower gas prices et cetera. So there is a lot of what we call natural hedges going on. So it isn\u2019t singular but if we were to single that out, it did almost a 200 basis point impact on EBIT. So we expect that to probably impact us just a little bit in Q3 and then we will fully anniversary it in Q4.","Matthew Fassler ","And just for your closure on this point, it sounds like just probably both translational and transactional impact, up to the point \u2013 to the extent you\u2019re selling products sourced in the US south of the border?","Bill Rhodes","Not necessarily. I mean there is obviously translation transaction from a balance sheet perspective. But it\u2019s mostly transactional from just the Mexico results.","Operator","Our next question is Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer ","Thanks. Bill, your explanation about the slower rate of program growth makes sense. But then presumably that would benefit the sales per program because they are more mature. But again it looks they were up by less than 1% sales per program during the second quarter. So trying to reconcile that trend with the rollout and the apparent success with the mega hub and distribution frequency initiative?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, but first, I would start with -- one of the things that\u2019s happened in the quarter on the more frequent delivery program, we did not roll out any significant amount of stores on that program until very very late in the quarter. It just doesn't make sense to roll out things during the holiday season. So those over 300 stores that went on that program, went on the last couple of weeks to the quarter: So you weren\u2019t able to see that benefit up there.","As I said earlier, Dan, some of the slowdown in commercial was clearly the maturation cycle but some of it as we were frankly disappointed, marginally disappointed with our performance in commercial. Our team has all hands on deck and we had a spring sales meeting last week, and that was the predominant topic and I'm highly confident that our team will take the ball from here and reaccelerate our growth.","Dan Wewer ","That\u2019s a great opportunity to evaluate what\u2019s the benefits from the mega hub coverage, what\u2019s the benefit from the increased delivery frequency and then I think you also, what, 500 stores that have both the mega hub access and multiple delivery availability. When you think about those two different initiatives, what do you think to be getting the biggest sales payback?","Bill Rhodes","They were both performing at or above our expectations. Frankly the mega hubs are outperforming our expectations. And by the way, mega hubs which \u2013 a couple of them are multiple years old, are continuing to grow, so we\u2019re really excited that the maturation continues two, two and half years later. As we said before, the combination of those two programs is driving a benefit of between a $1000 and $1500 per program, or first store that they get [ph], and that holds true. In fact, if anything is a little bit stronger, are towards the higher end of that as we roll it out.","Dan Wewer ","Bill, just real quickly, can you give an example or two of what you're focusing on, the increased education or training in the commercial initiative, just an example of what kind of conversations or teaching will be taking place at the store level?","Bill Rhodes","I would say one big thing is a lot of our AutoZoners, myself included, grew up on the retail side of the business, we didn\u2019t grow on the wholesale side of the business. And so to use a baseball analogy, our fastball is retail. Well, we've got to develop a fastball that\u2019s also commercial and so we're really focused on getting everybody in the organization taking our whole one team notion to the next level, and that includes getting our district managers and our store managers along with the sales team even more focused on growing the commercial business. Those are a talented group of people and I am highly confident that they will embrace that notion and take us to the next level.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham ","My first question is just on the success of the delivery initiatives. When you think about the stores that received increased deliveries earliest in the development of this rollout, are they still out-comping control group stores?","Bill Rhodes","I would say as they anniversary that they are not comping on the delivery frequency. They are not comping at a higher level. They pretty much get that benefit very early, because it\u2019s all about the customer calling, and yes, we have the product at a higher level than we had it before. So the benefit is almost immediate. There's not a marketing halo except to the extent that, when we say yes on a water pump we may also get the hose sales as well but all those benefits are pretty much immediate. I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that they would grow year-over-year. ","Seth Basham ","So the mega hubs that are maturing \u2013","Bill Rhodes","Different than that. The mega hubs are continuing to grow. And I think that as the more we say yes for hard-to-find parts, the more customer calls us first versus somebody else for harder to find parts. ","Seth Basham ","And then secondly just looking at your gross margins on a really strong quarter, can you provide a little bit more insight into how you\u2019re reducing your product acquisition cost so much?","Bill Rhodes","There\u2019s a variety of things that merchandising organization is doing in order to improve quite frankly sourcing. And so one of the things we talked about last quarter is that we\u2019re increasing our global sourcing efforts and identifying opportunities there. I\u2019d say that\u2019s still early on, so there's more opportunity for that as we look out over the next several quarter, several years frankly. So I think there's opportunities there, it\u2019s mostly acquisition costs to be honest.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. ","Seth Sigman ","I just want to follow up on that gross margin point. So clearly a lot of momentum in gross margin helping offset some of the investments that you've made. How do you think about that playing out in the second half of the year? So just wondering if you'll see greater impact in Q3 and Q4 from the increase in delivery frequency, because you pointed out you\u2019re adding 700 stores in the second half, you only added 300 in that first half which was kind of late in the quarter. So I was just wondering how that plays out and if you will continue to see some of those offsets.","Bill Rhodes","We've added more than that. And so we will probably add \u2013 the way to think about it is we\u2019ll probably add about 300 stores a quarter on the more frequent delivery. And so we will probably have this ratable pressure of about 20 to 30 basis points from a supply chain perspective. We've had opportunities to offset that through merchandising tactics working with our vendors as well as lower acquisition costs. So it's difficult to predict out exactly what gross margin will do over the next couple of quarters. But I think we feel pretty good about this quarter's results and we\u2019d expect something similar maybe not quite the strong going forward. ","Seth Sigman ","Okay, that's helpful. And then just as we think about the strength in the retail side of the business, how do we think about the pace versus prior quarters? It\u2019s kind of hard to see with FX, just wondering did it accelerate versus prior quarters? And just in general, how should we be thinking about the drivers there between the inventory availability initiatives? Obviously there's a lot of disruption in the market as well. And then also I think you pointed out just improvements you're seeing within your customer base.","Bill Rhodes","I would say that it felt pretty steady overall I think from the performance of the retail business for the quarter, with the exception of the flow of the tax money and that created some volatility overall. And clearly as you pocket the United States, there was probably little bit of a weather impact up in the Northeast. And there is a minor impact in the south-central area from oil. But other than that it seems like it\u2019s been relatively stable and consistent throughout that. And then just, if I heard you correctly, I just wanted to make a footnote to one thing you said. The same store sales are domestic based so the foreign exchange rate wouldn\u2019t have had any impact on that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser ","Bill Rhodes, so you\u2019re making progress with the inventory availability initiative, your sales per commercial program billed several hundred thousand dollars below some of the other players in the industry. Do you think what -- the current initiatives that you have in place are going to be able to enable the company to meaningfully close that gap over time, or do you have to be something else to get there?","Bill Rhodes","I think we believe strongly in our current strategy. We believe these inventory availability initiatives are going to make a material difference in both our retail and commercial businesses. And I think this discussion we\u2019re having today about taking our one team approach to the next level is really going to get our organization which is an incredibly strong execution oriented organization, that will help take us to the next level. ","Where do we end up? When I sit back and think about it, a lot of people want to talk about moving from $9000 a week to $13,000 or $14,000 a week. If you think about it, the DIFM business is bigger than the DIY business. Over time I'd love for our DIFM business to be bigger than our DIY business. That\u2019s going to take years if not decades, but I don\u2019t want to set our sights to any short-term target that would limit our thinking. ","Michael Lasser ","Has the most immediate impact from the increased inventory availability been to the DIY business?","Bill Rhodes","No. I would say the most immediate impact is on both sides of the business. In fact, if anything, it is slightly disproportionate to the commercial business, which is what you would expect particularly on the mega hub because these are the later model products that are harder to find.","Michael Lasser ","And then my follow-up question is, so with that being said and the slowdown in growth on the sales per commercial program basis within the quarter, was that \u2013 was there any consistency or pattern that you saw because it doesn\u2019t sound like it was the stores that are getting the increased inventory availability, if anything, those are doing better than average. So I guess there's some other bucket of stores that is growing?","Bill Rhodes","I wouldn\u2019t say it some other bucket of stores. I would say it was generally across the board, certain markets where there were weather impacts were hit slightly more than others. But it was generally across the board.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Mark Becks ","Hi, it's Mark Becks on for Chris. I just want to come back to the commentary around the tax refund. I think you said it was comparable at quarter end. Just wanted to fully understand, so does that mean you wouldn't anticipate any sort of impact as you move into Q3? Or do you think there's still some lift from the delayed tax refunds for the next quarter? ","Bill Rhodes","What we said was, at the end of the quarter total refunds were generally consistent with where they were last year. But they really flowed very late in the quarter. There was a massive amount of refunds that were processed the Wednesday before our quarter ended. We obviously had a very nice weekend. Did we get all the benefit that we normally get in a quarter? Probably not, but it's really hard to say, in the past we\u2019ve called out two different times that we thought the tax refund timing either benefited us or hut us by 100 basis points in sales for the quarter. We didn't quantify it this time, so it was clearly \u2013 our thoughts are it was clearly than that. But there's probably a bit of it that\u2019s going to flow into the third quarter.","Mark Becks ","That's helpful. And then just one other quick follow-up, I will let Bill Giles jump in here. Maybe I'm reading a little too much into it, but the repo activity was a little bit of a modest deceleration in the quarter. I think historically that's followed your cash flow, and you've taken out that in the middle of the year to support a ramped repo in the back half. Maybe any insight you'd be able to give there. Thanks.","Bill Giles","You said it spot on, that\u2019s exactly right. The second quarter is typically a slightly lower cash flow quarter. We obviously bought more stock this quarter than we did last year at this time because of the IMC acquisition that we incurred last year but share repurchases is a little bit lighter in Q2 but we\u2019ll ramp up back up as we heads towards the back end of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan ","On the IMC you just mentioned, you said it's got catalog availability to 700 of your stores. Can you talk about how it's impacting those stores' commercial business? ","Bill Rhodes","Yes, as we said for a long time, the number one reason we\u2019re in the IMC business is for the IMC standalone business. It\u2019s a business that we\u2019re very excited about on a long-term basis. But it does provide for those customers, those AutoZone commercial customers that do some high-end import business it does provide us to increase our ability to say yes on those special needs. So when you think about that business today, it\u2019s maybe a couple hundred dollars per store per week in incremental sales, it's not a meaning -- huge difference in the commercial business but it is a nice help. And any time you can say yes to something that they really need, then that helps you move up the call list over the long term. ","Bret Jordan ","And then in other you mentioned that, between ALLDATA and e-commerce slowed a bit. Was it e-commerce, I guess, is there anything changing in that space or is it just sort of general slowing around the seasonal category, is RockAuto or Amazon having an impact?","Bill Rhodes","I would say that we are not seeing much different from an e-commerce perspective overall. And I think that\u2019s just some steady \u2013 I think ALLDATA had a little bit more competitive pressure in the marketplace and that probably slowed their growth a little bit. So that\u2019s kind of more of what you\u2019re seeing now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker ","Hi thanks. Two questions. One, just bigger question. You said at one point earlier in the call that the economy is favorable for DIY right now. Does that imply that you think it's more favorable for DIY than the commercial business? And if so, why is that, and has that changed at all? ","Bill Rhodes","I would say we're number one much more educated on how the economic cycles impact our DIY business than we are the DIFM business just because we\u2019ve been in that business for so much longer and we have a much more mature business. Clearly the economic cycle that we\u2019re with lower gas prices which are leading to really really high miles driven is very favorable for us. Those same impacts, those same indicators should impact the commercial business but we believe at this stage in our commercial business development it\u2019s much more on us and our development of that business than it is on economic matter of factors.","Mike Baker ","Understood, that makes sense. And I guess as a follow-up to that DIY and commercial growth, who do you think you're taking market share, and are you taking more or less share in DIY or DIFM? Clearly your DIFM business is growing faster, but is that indicative of the market growing faster or are you taking more share? ","Bill Rhodes","I think clearly we\u2019re taking share in both businesses, we\u2019ve probably taken a disproportionate share in the commercial business. But again because we\u2019re later to the party than many of our competitors and so we\u2019re earlier in the maturation cycle. As far as getting into specifics, I\u2019ll let you all look at individual companies\u2019 performance and make those determinations for yourself. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri ","The first question I had was, your gross margin has been robust. Obviously a lot of this is for the acquisition cost, but I'd think there are some other drivers. Just want to get your thoughts. How much of this directionally would be just oil-based products -- keeping pricing versus cost coming down, integration, benefits of IMC and general oil benefits on your transportation network? ","Bill Giles","Some of those in there, and so just to go backwards, there's a little bit of benefit certainly from lower gas prices and fuel cost that\u2019s going to impact supply chain and then frankly probably SG&A a little bit as well. And then in addition to that \u2013 actually inflation deflation has been relatively moderated, I mean there is more deflation a little bit in categories like oil. And frankly deflation typically is not helpful for us from a margin perspective. So inflation would be a little bit better for us on a long-term basis. But I would say that, I would give the credit back to the merchandising organization from an acquisition perspective working with vendors, optimizing where we are buying the inventory, going direct in certain opportunities as well, increasing private-label products where we have opportunities to do so. We\u2019re pretty well penetrated in private-label today but there continues to be opportunities for us to expand our penetration on private-label and that has helped a little bit. So many of the improvements that I would say that we have seen, not all but the majority are sustainable. And so I think we\u2019ve got a good playbook to continue to do that. And having said that, as you mentioned we continue to have headwinds from just lower margin businesses growing at a faster rate and then some of the initiatives that we have from an inventory perspective. ","Chris Bottiglieri ","And then just one follow-up unrelated question. So you guys were obviously well ahead of the rest of the party in terms of putting together a DIY program. And still on a monetary value, it seems you'd exceed your competitors. Are you seeing any impact from some of these traditional DIFM customers on competitors using DIY programs in terms of rewards? Can you talk about retention rates or number of members, anything to give context to how your own rewards loyalty program has performed? ","Bill Rhodes","Our loyalty program which we\u2019ve had in some form for basically a decade continues to perform very well, it\u2019s an important part of our value proposition to our customers. As other people have gotten into the loyalty program, we obviously paid very close attention to it. But at the macro level our DIY business is performing very well right now. And so we\u2019re confident with what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re confident with the benefits that we\u2019re getting out of the loyalty program, and look forward to continuing to perform well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI.","Michael Montani ","It's Mike Montani on for Greg Melich. Just had a quick one, on CapEx, can you guys give a little more color on what you think this year will be and then the outlook for the next couple years given the expectations for the DCs and mega hubs? And then I had a follow-up. ","Bill Giles","I think that we probably said that -- somewhere around $600 million or so for fiscal year \u201916, at this pace it will probably be a little bit lower than $600 million for next year, probably closer to that 600,maybe a little bit over that depending on how we finish up this year and then the following year I think we\u2019ll probably migrate down into mid 500 or so once we get the distribution centers opened. But that would really be the only aberration if you\u2019d call it, from a CapEx perspective. Other than that we\u2019re opening square footage at around 3% and continue to invest in our existing base stores to make sure that they look fresh and current every day and then also to invest in new technology in order to make sure our platform can support our business as we grow.","Michael Montani ","And then if I could just on the margin side, you mentioned obviously higher wage costs. Can you help understand how much of that is really headcount per store, increased hours versus wage rate and then any kind of healthcare expense that you guys might be seeing or not seeing? ","Bill Giles","Yes, I think mostly of our payroll is really intentional investment in our payroll dollars in the stores in order to improve customer service as well as the training that Bill talked about earlier. From a wage rate perspective, I would say that we\u2019re continuing to see an increase in wage rates but not anything different than what we had expected to see and frankly not much different than what we\u2019d seen in prior year. Obviously around the country there is pocketed areas, but for the most part it\u2019s been steady as she goes. From a health medical perspective, we\u2019re not seeing any significant changes necessarily to our current cost rates, so that seems to be pretty much in check as well. ","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. At this time I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Bill Rhodes for closing comments.","Bill Rhodes","Okay. Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We'll not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we're confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.","Thank you for participating on today's call.","Operator","Thank you.

Sir, you may begin.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2016 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2016 was a very busy and productive year for us. We continued growing our business on many fronts. Our U.S. retail business expanded again in 2016 with the opening of another 156 new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction growing sales 7.1% for the year with 249 net new programs opened. We now have the commercial program in 83% of our domestic stores having opened 969 net new programs in just the past three years and we continue to expand our presence in Mexico.","This quarter we celebrated the opening of our 483rd store. We didn't open any additional stores in Brazil this quarter and opened one for the year ending the year with eight stores in operation. Lastly, we opened six new IMC branches during the year with one opening in the fourth quarter. We continue to see significant opportunities to open new stores and commercial programs in all of the geographies where we operate. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores.","While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S. for many years to come. I would expect the international mix of our business to only grow from here. In 2016, we expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com website as well as on AutoAnything.","Along with these strategic investments, we spend a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic retail business. DIY operations remain our number one priority. Our DIY business continues to grow and remains the largest portion of our sales. Also, DIY continues to generate tremendous returns. We continue to see opportunities for new store growth and improved productivity in our existing stores, which positions us well in this business for years to come.","As our commercial business continues to grow and is intertwined with our retail business, we have continued with our inventory placement and distribution initiatives in order to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. This past year, we opened six additional hub locations and expanded our mega hub count to 11 increasing by six for the year. We have also continued to expand our multiple frequency of deliveries from our DCs to over 1,900 stores and we are continuing with our new distribution center strategy with an expectation of having two new domestic DCs open over the next three years. Our current expectations are for the first facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the other will open six to 12 months later.","Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure that we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. To this end, our National Sales Meeting in Memphis next week will be entirely focused on providing WOW! Customer Service while focusing on saying, Yes! We've Got It, to all of our customers' parts, products and advice needs. Like everything at AutoZone, our pledge starts with putting customers first and we will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request.","Last year we made the Yes! We've Got It theme a key priority. For 2016, we focused on literally getting the merchandise SKUs into our network of DCs, mega hubs, hubs and stores. This year is different and requires a different message because we have more ways to solve our customers' desires than ever before. This year is about ensuring our store AutoZoners are able to utilize the significantly enhanced availability and close the sale.","It is also surprising and disappointing to see how many customers leave our stores every day not having completed their intended purchase because we didn't have or couldn't find what they needed within our network. In this spirit, to help the customer we are making ongoing significant systems enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs.","Before getting into specifics on the fourth quarter, I would like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are two very discreet and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores. And the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available before.","We tested these two enhancements for a couple of years before beginning our implementation. In our test, when combined, the initiatives were increasing sales between $1,000 and $1,500 per store per week. It is easier to evaluate the mega hub success because we would have had to order these parts through our special order system or bought them from someone else historically. The multiple frequency of deliveries initiative is more difficult to evaluate because we have transferred the merchandise from a different store or sent the customer to a different store.","We been very pleased with the implementation of both of these initiatives to-date, but we are still working on methods to quantify their exact benefits as it is not lost on us that it's hard to see the benefit showing up in our 1% domestic same store sales increase. However, we are confident that we are providing better customer service and our in-stock positions are noticeably higher. Additionally, as is our custom we are studying our performance on various elements and as we complete these reviews we are optimistic we will find optimization opportunities to enhance our performance even further.","Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we have implemented this enhanced service in roughly 1,000 additional stores during fiscal 2016 and now have over 1,900 of our nearly 5,300 domestic stores receiving deliveries from their distribution center at least three times per week. Some stores receive more weekly deliveries than three, but weekly volumes determine needs as the sales lift from delivering to every store every day can't justify the higher expense. Therefore, we have settled on a more staggered approach.","I should emphasize, this is up from the usual once-a-week delivery schedules we have historically run. With approximately 23,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, our inventory turns at a relatively low rate, around 1.4 times per year. The vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of one. Therefore, given the randomness of demand, there is potential for out-of-stocks. It is important to note that our current plans do not contemplate providing this level of service to all stores. It just isn't currently economically viable everywhere.","Over the next 12 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to roughly an additional 1,000 stores. We are targeting to have around 3,000 stores receiving this level of service by the end of fiscal 2017. We continue to model 15 to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017.","The second ongoing initiative is the mega hub store concept. With 11 now open, we will open and\/or expand another handful of mega hub stores in 2017. We are very excited about what the mega hubs allow us to offer our customer. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis.","Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations. At the end of the year, we had over 3,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. Now, not all of these 3,000 stores were having mega hubs SKUs delivered the same day, a majority of these stores received overnight deliveries from mega hub locations and will continue until we open more mega hubs. We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete.","While there was incremental costs to these rollouts in payroll and fuel to manage the extra deliveries to surrounding stores, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. Our assumption for this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017. In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the mega hubs, we are moving forward on our planned openings of two domestic distribution centers over the next few years.","For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million and those expenses began to flow in a small way in our CapEx spend in 2016. 2017 will have a more substantial amount of the spending. We don't expect any distribution center to come online until late fiscal 2017 or early 2016.","Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales increased 3.3%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 1%. This quarter sales result were stronger at the end of the quarter. While every month had positive comp performance, it was clear to us that the lingering effects of last year's mild winter hampered our growth, especially in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic markets. This is similar to 2012 when we also experienced a mild winter. We highlighted on last quarter's call, our belief that a hot summer could offset the mild winter. Clearly, later in the quarter the heat helped as our heat related categories performed well for the quarter, but we weren't able to completely offset the mild winter's effects.","Last year, we mentioned roughly 500 basis point spread in comp store results between the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic markets and the rest of the chain. While it was less than 500 basis points this quarter, it was still over 400 basis points. At the end of the quarter, the spread tightened a bit. However, our expectation is that this overhang will persist until we get a robust winter weather pattern again.","In regard to our three primary merchandise categories, failure, maintenance and discretionary merchandise, we didn't experience any significant divergence of trends. Failure and maintenance for AutoZone represented approximately 85% of our domestic business. This was usual for this time of year. Again, all categories were positive but their performance was significantly different based on regionality. While our ticket was positive for DIY and commercial, we saw traffic slightly negative for our DIY business. Again, regional performance played a key role in this result.","We opened 116 net new commercial programs in the quarter versus 134 programs last year. For the year, we opened 249 net programs reaching 83% of our domestic store base. While our sales grew 7.1% on the year in commercial, our programs open grew by 6%. As our programs mature, we believe our sales potential remains strong. As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets, we opened four mega hub locations during the quarter. Over time, we expect to open more hub and mega hubs in order to provide more inventory closer to our customers.","Regarding Mexico, we opened 25 stores this quarter and now have 483 total stores. In local currency, Mexico experienced a strong year. However, Mexico sales in U.S. dollars were below historic growth rates, given the roughly 9% decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar based on fiscal year end rates. Additionally, we are in the final stages of building our second distribution center in Mexico and it is scheduled to begin servicing stores in the first quarter of 2017.","Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 4.3% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses, which includes AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. While we are excited about our online sales opportunities and growth potential, we believe expectations for our space to experience growth like in other merchandise categories is not likely.","We recognize the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase and our e-commerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do their repairs. While these businesses are small for us at less than 5% of our total sales mix for the quarter, the omnichannel experience is important and we will continue to invest in our e-commerce platform.","With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging.","Regarding our expectations for 2017, our first and second quarter results are more difficult comparisons. However, we are optimistic we can grow sales in all of our upcoming quarters. While having underperformed in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic during the winter and beyond this past year, we believe we should improve in these regions. As our history has shown, we manage this business focusing on both short and long-term performance.","We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 40 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. However, with our delivery frequency initiative, our expanding mega hubs and the opening of new DCs, we will likely have some headwinds on our operating margin.","Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were one, great people providing great service, two, profitably growing our commercial business, three, leveraging the Internet, four, improving inventory availability and five, Yes! We've Got It.","On the retail front this past quarter, under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we have been adding store payroll this year, we are now enhancing our training to store level AutoZoners increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the Yes! We have Got It theme. We have been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis.","We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.","In regards to commercial, we opened 116 net new programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 249 net new programs versus 296 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 to 250 programs in 2017. While our commercial sales results were below our expectations this year, the entire industry sales were below our expectations. In previous years, we saw the commercial business grow for our industry in the low to mid-single-digit range while we grew at double digits.","It appears to us the industry, predominantly from the impact of a mild winter in the northern part of the country, grew at a much slower rate in 2016. While our sales growth rate slowed versus last year's pace, the industry saw a similar slowdown in growth. Our data shows we again saw our sales gaining share this past quarter. Regional discrepancies played a big role in commercial as well as retail. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in making additional resources, adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish 2016 at 31.3%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines detail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investor's capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I would like to thank and reinforce how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. 2016 was not an easy year. While our industry's performance was volatile, we asked our organization to accomplish a tremendous amount. Even with our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as new store openings, we were ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers. 2017 will be no different. We are looking forward to an even better 2017 because of our AutoZoners' efforts in 2016.","Now I will turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?","Bill Giles","Thanks Bill and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales which include the domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches, increased 3.3%.","Let me touch on domestic macro trends for a second. During the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $2.22 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.24 a gallon, a $0.02 increase. Now, last year gas prices decreased $0.18 per gallon during the fourth quarter, starting at $2.69 and ending at $2.51 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.","We also recognize the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2% in May and 3.2% in June and we don't have July or August data yet. But year-to-date through June, miles driven were up 3.3% and ahead of last year's increase at this time. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.","For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,773,000. Now for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 5.2%. In the fourth quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $32 million over last year's Q4. This past quarter, we opened 116 net new programs versus 134 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,390 stores supported by 182 hub stores.","Approximately 1,000 of our programs are three years old or younger. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years as approximately 22% of our programs are younger than three years old. However, we focused on a more deliberate opening schedule starting this past year. We feel openings in the range of 200 to 250 is more realistic for our future growth. Not only is it easier to hiring staff, but also allows us the ability to devote resources to our existing programs.","During fiscal 2016, our sales growth in commercial decelerated. Some but certainly not all of a deceleration was due to fewer new programs going through the maturation cycle. Our growth was also negatively impacted by what we perceived to be an overall industry slowdown in commercial, particularly in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic markets.","As we exited 2016, our trends had accelerated modestly, which is encouraging to us. We are very focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams particularly the store managers and district managers. We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers.","I complete my comments here by saying, we feel 2017 should be better sales growth year than 2016. This belief is based on all of the initiatives we have in place. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 25 new stores during the fourth quarter and 42 for the full year. We currently have 483 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open similar 40 new stores and we are on target to open our new distribution center in October. This will be our second DC in the country and it will support Central Mexico store growth.","As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales in base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation in the peso is much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued over the course of the year. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than if rates had remained constant. If EBIT dollar impact on the quarter assuming constant currency with last year's exchange rate was meaningful, it's $10 million impact to EBIT. We feel the Mexico leadership team did an exceptional job managing the peso denominated business.","Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating eight stores. Our plans are to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next few years. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged, like with Mexico, by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars.","Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $3,399 million, an increase of 3.3% over last year's fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year were up 1% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, up 30 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with the current year initiatives. In regards to inflation, it has been down slightly year-over-year. Currently we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we will make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both retail and commercial businesses, but our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note, we do not manage to target gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries will cause. We work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition cost. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.","SG&A for the quarter was 32.1% of sales, lower by five basis points from last year's fourth quarter. SG&A as a percent of sales benefited from the favorable comparison to last year's higher legal costs, which was partially offset by our continued investment in store payroll. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.","EBIT for the quarter was $703 million, up 5.1% over last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $45.8 million compared with $47.1 million in Q4 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,924 million or approximately $300 million more than last year's balance of $4,625 million. Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR.","While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 35.1% versus last year's Q4 of 35.5%. The deviation in results is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose.","Net income for the quarter was $427 million, up 6.4% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.8 million was down 5.2% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.30, up 12.2% over the prior year's fourth quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement for the fourth fiscal quarter, we have generated $530 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6.5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $189 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 99 new locations this quarter along with capital expenditures on existing stores, hubs and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on the development of our new stores for upcoming quarters and development of our new Mexico DC, some investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2016, our CapEx was approximately $489 million.","With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,297 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 483 stores in Mexico and eight in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5,788. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,814. Depreciation totaled $94 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $87 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates.","With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $370 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At year-end, we had $395 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at year-end. Additionally, this morning, we increased our authorization an additional $750 million, taking our total authorization outstanding to $1,145 million. Again I want to stress, we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to be view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 112.8%. Next, we would like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 6.1% over the same period last year driven primarily by new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $625,000 versus $610,000 last year and $629,000 just last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $80,000 versus a negative $79,000 last year and a negative $69,000 this past quarter.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.3%. We have and we will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you Bill. We are pleased to report our 40th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth and for the year to report an EPS growth rate of 13%. We are also quite pleased with all we accomplished during 2016. While we experienced more regional sales differences than either planned or usual, our company executed exceptionally well.","Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day-in and day-out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.","Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2016. We were able to build on past accomplishments and deliver some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that we grew sales to a record $10.6 billion this past year and we grew same-store sales at 2.4% and we continued with our double-digit EPS growth streak, reaching our 40th consecutive quarter.","We grew our store base in Mexico and managed our expenses exceptionally well in spite of the foreign currency headwind with the peso. We continued with our IMC integration, opened six new branches and now have 26 in total. Our inventory availability rollouts continued on plan. I could not be more proud of the tremendous work everyone on these projects contributed.","And lastly, we are talking more, more about saying Yes! We've Got It to our customers. We are determined to meet all our customers' needs in 2017. Our offerings are the best they have ever been and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day, our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortments and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and IMC.","Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run.","We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to detail and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market condition and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.","With 2016 behind us now, we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. I can't wait to sit down and talk with our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our Yes! We've Got It theme and I know our leaders, combined with our talented team of more than 84,000 AutoZoners will do a fantastic job in 2017.","Now we would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will be from Mr. Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Your line is now open.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you very much. My first question has to do with commercial. As you continue to expand the MFT program as well as the hubs and the mega hubs and I realize that certainly you are earlier in the program on some versus others, but as you assess the expenses associated with each of these initiatives and the potential benefits, how would you rank order where between the three of these initiatives you think can be most profitable to you down the road?","Bill Rhodes","Help me with the three. Are you talking about multiple frequency of deliveries, mega hubs and what was the third one, Alan?","Alan Rifkin","And hub stores, Bill.","Bill Rhodes","And hub stores. Yes, I would say hub stores are pretty much baked in the cake at this point in time. We will open a few more. They have been a great addition to our strategy and we will continue to leverage them long-term, always looking for more opportunities to leverage them further.","As I said in our prepared remarks, the mega hubs continue to outperform our expectations. They are doing really, really well. We have got 11 of them now. We will hopefully open more than a handful this year and are proceeding very well with that. That one is much easier to measure and qualify the results.","Multiple frequency of delivery, because you are talking about the randomness of demand, it's a little bit harder to evaluate that. In our test store, we feel very good about it. We are just trying to go back now and validate it. But I would say, the mega hubs are out performing at this point in time and we are continuing to try to refine both multiple frequency of delivery and mega hubs.","Alan Rifkin","Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up, if I may, it was mentioned during the call that the trends accelerated elevated as the quarter ended. I was wondering if maybe you could provide a little bit of color on the performance within the quarter of the weather impacted versus non-weather impacted markets or discretionary versus non-discretionary items, just to give a little bit more clarity around what drove the comp? Thanks.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. Clearly the quarter started softer than it ended. I don't want to overstate that. These were modest improvements that kind of built throughout the quarter. As you know, it got much hotter around July 1. And as we said on the last call, heat's going to help us in the summertime and it certainly did. We saw those benefits across the board in those in heat-related categories. And yes, we saw the weather impacted regions improve modestly, but I think as we have said before, we think that it's going to have a lingering effect until we get into a more normalized winter.","Alan Rifkin","Okay. Thank you very much.","Bill Rhodes","All right. Thank you Alan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Mr. Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Seth Sigman","Thanks. Good morning guys. Just a follow-up on that last question. So is it fair to assume that the gap between the stronger and weaker markets has continued to narrow here in the first quarter, even if just modestly?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. We have got kind of a standing practice. We announce our earnings so early in the quarter that we really don't want to get into this quarter's results. We are three weeks in and things can't just happen in three week periods. So I don't ever want to talk about what's happened in the current quarter. I am sorry.","Seth Sigman","Understood. Maybe I will just ask it a different way. So is it your sense that the gap has really just been weather? Or could there be something else going on, either from a consumer perspective or a competitive perspective? And I guess on the consumer side, I think some of the regions that you have highlighted have also been highlighted by some other companies, even in different sectors. So just wondering your thoughts on that.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. For us, I don't think the health of the consumer is really that significant of a driver. If you turn back the clock to 2009, 2010 and 2011 when everybody was really struggling, we performed exceptionally well. So I don't think we are a good barometer of the consumer and the consumer's health. I think the biggest differentiator for us has been the weather that happened in those parts of the country. We saw it back in 2012. We have gone back and studied it now. That's why we are saying we think the effects will linger until we get into a good, strong winter again.","Seth Sigman","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just my follow-up question is on the online business. So you have mentioned a couple of times on the call. Can you talk a little bit about the expanded offerings that you mentioned and also some of the investments that you alluded to? And I guess ultimately do you expect to be spending more on online as we look out over the next year versus what we just saw? Thanks.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. I think that we will continue to spend a little bit more on our eCommerce platforms, particularly on autozone.com. Because although our volumes may not be a significant from an eCommerce perspective, we have a lot of eyeballs coming to our site to learn more about our products or availability, maybe even get some repair information, et cetera. And we believe that that traffic migrates itself to the stores and winds up resulting in a purchase.","So from an omnichannel perspective, our eCommerce platform is very important relative to providing a complete WOW! Customer Experience for our customers in terms of learning about the products, understanding the location of the stores, pricing, et cetera and then transferring that to the stores and then executing the transaction.","We also make it easy for our customers to do buy online and pick up at store. So we are trying to be able to provide great service to the customers in any form that they want to be able to shop in. And so we think eCommerce is an important element of that and we will continue to invest in it.","Seth Sigman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question will be from Mr. Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Presumably, given your comp in the quarter, you are not seeing the $1,000 to $1,500 of incremental sales from all the initiatives you have put in place. So why do you think you are not seeing that as you expand the availability of those initiatives?","Bill Rhodes","I am not sure that I am prepared to say that we are not seeing it or whether or not there's something else. As I mentioned, there was a 400 basis point impact in the comp. One of the things is, a lot of the multiple frequency of delivery work has been done in those weather impacted regions. So maybe it would have been more pronounced without it.","What we are saying is, look, we hear you loud and clear. We don't see it showing up in the 1% comp, but it might be something else. We are going back to the drawing board and reassessing everything we can to make sure that we optimize those resources. At the end of the day, we know we are improving customer service and we know our in-stocks are up materially. That has to ultimately help our business.","Michael Lasser","And Bill, on the whole online discussion, can you give us a sense of what your customer base on the DIY side breaks down between heavy DIYers and more casual DIYers? And how much of a sale is the nature of each transaction involved so we can kind of scope out what the potential risk is if this category doesn't go online?","Bill Giles","I think that from an online perspective, we are seeing that mostly in somewhat nondiscretionary purchases as far as traffic is concerned and where it's going, et cetera. But I think also the way we think about online a little bit is there will always be an element of transactions that are going to occur online.","But from our perspective, we provide trustworthy advice at the counter for the customer. We also provide an ability for us maybe to replace wiper blades or install batteries, et cetera. So there's a service element that takes place at the store as well. So there's a value proposition that takes place in the store that's different than anything you are going to receive online.","You have got somebody you can talk to you, get repair information that can be printed out and provided to you, get somebody who can walk out to your car and look at it and help you assess what it is you want to accomplish. So in addition to that, there's cores attached to many of the products that we sell which create a two-way transaction.","So there's all sorts of elements that from our perspective, we provide a great value proposition. And I know that there is a discrepancy in the pricing that you are going to see online versus what you get in the stores and that's all part of the equation. So we think from a long-term perspective that we are cognizant of those price discrepancies, but we will also make sure that we continue to add a value proposition that's warranted.","Michael Lasser","Maybe I can just ask the question differently. What percentage of your DIY sales come from customers who spend more than $500 a year with you?","Bill Giles","It would be exceptionally low.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Mr. Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simeon Gutman","Good morning guys. First question on the commercial sales program. Bill, you mentioned you are looking backwards or looking at all options, trying to figure out how to optimize it. What's your sense on the investments that you are making, the ones that are in place, are these things that will take time to get more traction? Or do you think that somehow you have to put more money or put more dollars or CapEx or more SG&A into it to drive the commercial growth?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. I think it's something that has to mature over time. These are relationships built with customers over long periods of time. And because you enhance your availability either from in-stock position or from an expanded parts assortment, they are not necessarily going to switch to you over time. Particularly on the expanded parts assortment, when they are calling around and they find that you do have that product, that's going to help you move up that call list, but it's not going to happen overnight.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And then I guess maybe for Bill Giles, when you initially talked about the rollout of more frequent delivery, right? We dimensionalized the cost. I think it was 20, 30 basis points or so a year. I am not sure that included the rollout of DCs. And so next year, we talked about the DC starting to come into the picture. Does that mean the EBIT margin starts to get inhibited? I know you reiterated the earnings growth algorithm and it sounds pretty typical, but I am curious what happens at the line with margin. Could we see margins flat or if not, maybe down in this investment scenario?","Bill Giles","I think that the MFT, like we said, was like you articulated, was 20 to 25 basis point impact on gross margin. When we roll out the distribution centers, just by the geographic nature of where they get rolled out, our anticipation is that some of the transportation cost savings will wind up offsetting a big chunk of that. So there may be a little bit of deleverage from the start-up perspective, but on an ongoing perspective, we would not expect the new distribution centers to really deleverage gross margin in any meaningful way.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from with Ms. Kate McShane of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Kate McShane","Thank you for taking my question. A couple of questions on commercial also from me. You had mentioned that commercial had been growing the low to mid single-digit range for the industry. Can you tell us how much you think the industry grew this year? And then second to that can you walk us through how you think about the maturation of programs weighing on your comp versus the market share gains you mentioned for commercial?","Bill Rhodes","Let me get into the first one. We don't have the exact numbers of what happened in the commercial industry. From what we have seen, from watching our competitors and some of our public customers and what we have seen, we think it probably slowed 200 to 400 basis points year-over-year. That's not a very finite number, but we have certainly seen virtually everybody show a deceleration in their growth, particularly in the second half of our year. And I am sorry, what was the second part of your question?","Kate McShane","You quantified some of the impact from weather, but I just was more curious about any kind of magnitude with regards to your commentary around the maturation of programs, which I know you have mentioned before, versus the market share gains you think you gained in commercial during the year.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. The deceleration of our program growth and it wasn't just this year, it's really what's happened over the last three or four years, if we qualify that, it's about 300 basis points of the deceleration in our commercial growth.","Kate McShane","Okay. Great. And just kind of a nuanced question, but I am curious why the mild winter can still impact your business before the actual winter hit? Is there still repairs from a severe winter happening in the months of June and July? And how much of that is the percentage of your business during those months?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. It absolutely impacts it going forward and we can go and look at specific markets and see it crystal clear in their performance in certain categories. One of the things that happens in the wintertime in those regions is the snow and ice. Either we have to put salt down to take care of it or there's snow piles that are tearing up the roads. That puts pressure on the under-car parts. Think about chassis and the like. And also the salt makes things rust. And so they don't just rust that day. They rust over time and those rusted parts have to be replaced over time. So we are very confident that we understand what the weather implications are and we are also very confident that they kind of last until we get to another big winter cycle.","Kate McShane","Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Mr. Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. First one I had was, it seems like you are hedging a little bit and I could be wrong here, but it seems in terms of the daily deliveries and if it ultimately will work. I am trying to understand in that core 20,000 SKUs, realistically how many of those need to be replaced more than once a week? Is there some kind of other median between the mega hub and the DCs that you could do to maybe service those SKUs? Then lastly, if you decide that mega hubs is a solution and daily delivery more than once or 2x a week isn't a solution, would you consider expanding the rollout of those mega hubs?","Bill Rhodes","We are going as fast as we can go on the mega hubs. Nothing is holding us back, not capital, not operating expenses. We want to go as fast as we can go. The challenge of that is the real estate projects. And real estate projects can easily take two years from the time you initiate until the time you are completed. These are even more complex than our regular projects. So I don't think it would have any bearing on where we are with the mega hub rollout.","But what I would characterize multiple frequency of delivery is yes, we are trying to find the benefits in the numbers and it's a little bit more difficult than we would like. We knew that going in. It was more difficult in the test as well. We also are looking at it at a more granular level and are trying to find some opportunities and are seeing some interesting things where we might have had some unintended consequences that we can reverse and improve on.","So all we are saying is, we get it that it's hard to say. We have seen $1,000 to $1,500 per store and a 1% comp. That's not lost on us and we are going back to work to make sure we can find it.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay. That's great. And then just one related follow-up. Could you talk about the key drivers across the industry right now to the best you are able to? Are like-for-like SKUs still deflationary? What about part complexity? How much do you think it's adding to average selling prices? Maybe attempt to quantify that?","Bill Giles","Yes. I think on the parts complexity, there's probably a natural inflation, right, that occurs from a technology perspective that we have seen over time and continue to see. So that helps us a little bit from inflationary perspective. On commodity or a cost basis, we have seen very little inflation. In fact, in some cases, deflation. So from that perspective, on an average transaction value, we would say that we have seen little benefit and possibly a slight deterioration from commodity based prices.","And then that's been offset by some enhancements or increase, if you will, from technology inflation that always exist. So actually when you think about it over the last three years, our comp store sales, same with the industry, has probably not been helped by inflation. Inflation usually can be a help in terms of same-store sales and that just hasn't existed over the last couple of years.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. Okay. It makes a lot of sense. Thanks again for your time. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Next question will be from Mr. Seth Basham of Wedbush. Sir, you may begin.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning.","Bill Giles","Good morning.","Seth Basham","My question is around the lift you guys have gotten from the two initiatives, frequency of delivery and mega hubs. Of the $1,000 to $1,500 per week lift that you are experiencing, how much can you attribute to frequency of delivery versus mega hubs?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. We really haven't quantified it because it's so hard to quantify it. But a little bit more than half, I would believe, from the multiple frequency of deliveries and the balance from mega hubs on a per store basis when it's rolled out.","Seth Basham","Got it. That's helpful. Okay. And then secondly, I was just hoping you give us a little bit more perspective on the comp trend through the quarter. Not to beat a dead horse here, but as you think about the weakness earlier in the quarter and the strength at the end, was August in fact stronger from a comp trend perspective than July?","Bill Rhodes","Yes.","Seth Basham","Great. Thank you very much.","Bill Rhodes","All right. Thank you Seth.","Operator","Thank you. Next question will be from Mr. Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot and good morning to you. I want to follow-up on a couple of comments you made online. First of all, I realize that online is less than 5% of your business, but can you give us a sense of the growth rate that you have experienced there, I guess particularly within AutoZone as you can think about it kind of on a full year basis?","Bill Giles","I would say on AutoZone, it's going to grow at a faster rate slightly than the retail business, but you are right, Matt, it is less than a 5% business. It's growing a little bit. But our emphasis and focus on autozone.com is about providing customers with information because in more cases than not, they are executing that transaction in a store or even through a buy online, pick up in store or a visit to the store after they have visited the website.","So we will continue to execute commerce on our website and we will continue to make it a better site in order to do that. But the real emphasis is creating that whole omnichannel experience for the customer between getting online, getting information and getting to the stores.","Matt Fassler","And if I can ask a follow-up on that. So you have talked about the expertise of the parts pros behind the counter and you also talked about AutoAnything. If you go to the AutoAnything site, it leads right at the top with a live chat option and really stresses the presence of phone experts. And I realize that at AutoZone, you certainly have that in the store. Are you considering bringing some of that functionality, some of those features to the AutoZone site to make the brand truly omnichannel from a knowledge perspective as well as from a logistics perspective?","Bill Giles","Probably to some extent. But you are right about AutoAnything. One of the real competitive differentiators is the online chat and the call center and the ability to help customers through more complicated transactions. And also to back on to, I think it was Michael's question before, I mean, the average transaction value on AutoAnything is dramatically even in what we experience in the store. So keep in mind that the majority of things that we are selling are way less than $100 per unit items and so they are significantly smaller tickets.","Matt Fassler","Are you deliberately perhaps trying to position the websites differently at this point in time? Or is it a matter of time until you bring more functionality and more of that engagement opportunity to the zone site?","Bill Giles","Yes. I think we will continue to enhance the zone site and continue to bring more and more functionality enhancements. But those two sites will always be positioned differently because one is strictly an online-only website and the other has the over 5,000 stores with 84,000 people being able to provide great customer service. So it's a different value prop.","Matt Fassler","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Mr. Chris Horvers of JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open.","Chris Horvers","I made it in. Thanks for taking my question. 10:59, so I wasn't sure.","Bill Rhodes","Congratulations or condolences?","Chris Horvers","So my question is, how do you think about the risk that sales trends decelerate from what you have seen in August and September? The hot summer is behind us. Are you seeing acceleration in non-heat affected categories? And related to that, do you think the boost from the lower gas prices last year is now getting behind us and it's a part of the outlook until we get to cold weather?","Bill Rhodes","I think anytime gas prices are low, it's going to benefit us. Especially when you think about the impact of lowering gas prices on the low end consumer, that's putting more dollars in their pocket. No different than the fact that we see significant increases in our business when tax refunds happen in February and March. Whenever our customer has some money in their pocket, we seem to benefit from it fairly significantly.","As for what are the trends going to be in Q1 and Q2, you know we don't really give guidance. As we look at Q1 and Q2 last year, we are comping against more difficult comparisons. We do believe that the weather implications or weather impacts are going to continue to be a bit of a headwind. But we like where we stand. We are going to continue to fight it out and do the best that we can every day.","Chris Horvers","So it sounds like getting beyond batteries and AC repair, there's got to be some sort of other parts of the business that get better to compensate for that lift that you see when you see extreme heat?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. Batteries and AC heating parts are the big parts. By the way, it's still quite hot across lots of parts of the country right now. Hopefully, we will have a bit of an Indian summer and that will help us too.","Chris Horvers","And then my follow-up is, so it looks like if you look at the narrowing of the gap between what we calculate as commercial and DIY comp, it went from 600 basis points the past two years to 300 this year. So it sounds like the maturation is really the single and almost exclusive factor that drove the narrowing gap between the performance?","Bill Rhodes","I think that's a good way to put it.","Chris Horvers","Okay. Thanks very much. Good luck.","Bill Giles","Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Well before we conclude the call, I would just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress, this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating.

Rhodes","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2013 Third Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another very solid quarter. Similar to last year, our sales performance included some significant volatility over the 12-week period. From our perspective, the most important takeaways from the quarter were: one, trends improved during the last 4 weeks of our quarter; two, our sales trends in the most challenged markets also improved; three, retail sales improved during these last 4 weeks on both a 1-year and a 2-year basis, with positive same-store sales results in that period, a trend we have not been able to report for quite some time; four, we opened 102 new commercial programs in the quarter and expect Q4 Commercial sales to improve from here; and lastly, the capital allocation and earnings model for our company remains strong and intact.","Our ability to manage in good sales environments and not so good has allowed us to deliver 27 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. That consistency allows us to be shareholder-friendly through our stock buybacks, and bondholder-friendly through a targeted investment grade rating and financial transparency.","We are excited about our opportunities to grow our business in both this quarter and in future periods. We continue to manage this company for both short-term and long-term optimum performance.","We continue to execute our strategies to improve the customer shopping experience, the initiative that we call Great People Providing Great Service! We also grew our commercial program counts, sales and profitability, opening 102 programs for the quarter.","We expanded 5 additional hub locations during the quarter to take our total remodel hub locations to 82. These remodels entail adding additional inventory into the market that benefits both our Retail and Commercial businesses. We also opened 2 new hub locations for the quarter, finishing with 154. Additionally, we substantially completed the integration of our purchase of AutoAnything from back in December.","On last quarter's conference call, we spoke of sales challenges we saw in the last week of January and the first week of February. Those weeks' results were what I'll call severely negative and brought our quarterly results down.","While I'm happy to say the money did flow back to consumers throughout the quarter and appear to be essentially flat year-over-year in dollars refunded, we didn't feel those 2 weeks were made up at any point during this third quarter. This quarter started out slightly down for same stores, ran negative in March and positive in April. We do not contribute our performance improvement in April to tax refunds.","In fairness to our March results, I need to point out that last year, we had our best monthly results in March. Specifically, our northeastern and midwestern markets outperformed our remaining markets in last year's March. This year, these same markets materially underperformed the remaining markets through March. There was approximately a 600-basis-point gap in performance up until the beginning of April.","I should point out weather patterns during March were not favorable. We experienced cooler temperatures and snowfall that negatively impacted our results. Once the weather warmed up a bit, results did improve.","For the quarter, the northeastern and midwestern markets underperformed our remaining markets in same-store sales by approximately 150 basis points on a total comp-store basis, a noticeable improvement from the 500 basis points we have been discussing in previous quarters. We continue to believe this regional and -- regional underperformance and more recent improvements to be weather-driven.","Last year's mild winter caused a material decrease in what we have classified as maintenance items sold. Our belief is that this past winter's more normalized weather patterns should benefit us and our industry. While the category of goods we classify as maintenance decreased year-over-year, April's positive same-store sales results were attributable to this category's sales turning positive.","As we look forward to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we are enthusiastic about the progress we're making on many of our initiatives. This past year, we have spent tremendous time on improving our inventory assortments, with the result being reducing out of stocks and increasing our ability to say yes to our customers' requests. We continue to utilize our hub network as a tool that will improve the 2 metrics mentioned. As we continue to experience benefits from our hub stores' few additions, it provides us with further insight into areas of potential opportunities.","As a result, we are performing various tests to determine the optimal levels of inventory in our local stores and our hub stores. As is customary for us, we will learn from our testing and roll out those that make sense financially. Listeners should expect us to always be learning and pushing ourselves to improve our results.","As previously mentioned, this quarter's results marked our 27th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. We're very pleased with our ability to consistently deliver strong EPS growth through our financial model of steady mid-single-digit EBIT dollar growth or better, along with high-single-digit reductions in diluted share count through our share repurchases.","Our goal quarter-over-quarter continues to be to provide consistency to our shareholders, our AutoZoners and most importantly, our customers. We feel this targeted consistency in both financial performance as well as execution of our key initiatives results in stability and confidence for all of our key constituents.","Next I'd like to discuss our sales results for this past quarter in more detail. Our sales were up 4.5%, and our same-store sales were down 0.1%. This quarter's same-store sales results compared to last year's third quarter comps of 3.9%.","Our same-store sales results are a combination of both our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses. I should point out, our total Commercial sales were up 9.7% over last year's third quarter, driven by a combination of existing program growth and the addition of 302 net new programs over the trailing 12 months.","In the last few earnings calls, we have cautioned listeners that we wouldn't have a good read on our sales patterns until we lap last year's slowdown, which began in April. As highlighted previously, April was a strong month. But one month does not make a trend, and the first 2\/3 of the third quarter were softer than we had anticipated. Our stated belief all along was the unusual weather patterns in the winter of 2011-2012 in that particular area of the country were the single largest contributor to the slowdown.","Since performance to date has been consistent with those beliefs, we are cautiously optimistic as we head into our all-important summer selling season. I use the word cautiously because we still have some concerns on the health of the consumer due to continued weakness in the broader economy and the recent reinstitution of the payroll taxes to recent norms.","This morning, we want to call out some key accomplishments this past quarter. We completed 5 additional hub projects this quarter, taking our hub resets like to date to 82. We continue to be quite pleased with the sales benefits from the reset hubs as we have increased the size and\/or improved the location, allowing us to expand the number of SKUs offered on a same-day basis in the market. These SKUs have benefited both Retail and Commercial customers. The proliferation of unique makes and models constantly rolled out each year continues to drive our need to add inventory. We expect to discuss proper inventory placement for years to come. We believe our evolving hub strategy better positions us to address this need.","Regarding Mexico. We opened 7 stores this quarter and finished with 341 stores. Sales in our other businesses achieved very solid sales results. Our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which include autozone.com and autoanything.com, continue to perform well, increasing 79.9% over last year. The significant increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of AutoAnything, which we acquired during Q2 of this fiscal year.","There are great opportunities for eCommerce sales growth on both a business-to-business basis and to individual customers, or B2C. While these businesses are relatively small for us at just 3.5% of our total sales mix, we are experimenting to understand where the most potential exists.","At this point, we still view our traditional autozone.com and AutoAnything as complements to our walk-in business. Our objective is to provide exceptional service to all of our customers regardless of how they want to interact with us, and we believe that leveraging the Internet is a powerful tool to meet their needs, whether they're researching their purchase prior to visiting a store or having their products delivered straight to their home.","With continued aging of the car population, we continue to feel positive trends exist for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. With the recent decline in gas prices, we are hoping to see an acceleration of miles driven. Through February, the latest data available, this metric has been basically flat year-over-year.","We continue to remain bullish on our industry sales growth opportunities on both Retail and Commercial fronts over the long term. As the vehicle population remains at an all-time high and consumers continue to look for good values while maintaining their vehicles, we see AutoZone's opportunity to sell to these customers only growing.","Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating plan for 2013, 1TEAM Delivering WOW! The key priorities for the year: Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing the Commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, hub store improvements; and five, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies.","On the Retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We have dedicated great resources to training our AutoZoners on customer service, and we feel we've done a great job at differentiating ourselves on this front.","The fifth key priority on leveraging technology is new this year. We are designing enhancements to improve the information available to our AutoZoners at the point of sale while also making them more efficient, and we are in the process of developing that functionality now. At AutoZone, we have a long and strong heritage of leveraging information technology to improve customer service and optimize efficiencies, and this priority was added this year to enhance our focus in this area.","In regards to Commercial, we opened 100 new -- 102 new programs this quarter. Year-to-date, we've opened 195 versus 287 through the third quarter last year. We continue to expect to open approximately 300 stores for the year, consistent with our annual plan.","Our past quarter's results were not where we would like. The driver behind the results had not surprised us. In particular, regional performance discrepancies and weather impacted our business. We continue to see Commercial as a material sales growth driver for us for many years to come. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.","I'll take a moment now to talk more specifically about our third quarter performance in more detail. Our domestic same-store sales declined 0.1% for the quarter. As noted earlier, our third quarter, which ended May 4, did experience variability in month-to-month sales results. As we've mentioned in previous quarters, our performance in the northeastern and midwestern regions has been materially below that of the remainder of the country.","In fact, the separation in results began in April of last year for us. As we've said previously, the category of sales we define as maintenance had the most challenging performance since that began. With approximately 40% of our sales in this classification, sales of this category were soft, particularly in the subset of geographic regions previously discussed.","However, we saw the sales in this category improve the last month of the quarter. This improvement, we believe, is attributable to having more normal winter weather in these regions versus last year, and we began to lap last year's slowdown. This regional difference in results carries through to our Commercial business as well. We will continue to invest to grow our Commercial business and penetrate a larger percentage of our existing store base.","As I said earlier, ALLDATA and eCommerce, which now includes AutoAnything, had another fine quarter, up 80% in sales from this time last year. AutoAnything's inclusion in this bucket drove the majority of this growth. This portion of our business, while small as a percentage of our overall sales mix, continues to experience faster sales growth than the auto parts stores.","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish the second quarter at 32.3%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship. As the capital we invest is our investors' capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk more about our financial results, I'd like to thank and state how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage this business appropriately these past few quarters. We suspected the sales environment was going to be difficult during the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year. And as is evident in our overall performance, we aggressively managed our cost structure. We are very proud of our organization and all that they continue to accomplish. We have an amazing team, and we are ready. We are ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers, and we are ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structure, providing our shareholders with the consistency we have exhibited in the past.","Now I'll turn it over to Bill Giles.","William T. Giles","Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and international results for the quarter.","For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our one store in Brazil, increased 2.9% on top of last year's third quarter's growth of 6.7%.","Regarding macro trends during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.61 a gallon and ended the quarter at $3.54 a gallon, a $0.07 decrease. Last year, gas prices increased by $0.27 per gallon during the quarter, starting at $3.52 and ending at $3.79 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles, and we will continue to monitor prices closely in the future.","We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven were up in January 0.6%, but down versus last year, 1.4% in February. And the other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-old -- 7 year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.","Lastly, another key macro issue facing our customers today is the reinstitution of payroll taxes back to historic norms. This reduction in our customers' take-home pay just began at the beginning of the new calendar year and, at this point, combined with the delay in income tax refunds and seasonal weather trends, it is hard to objectively quantify the ramifications of this change. However, we believe this is, and will continue to have, a negative impact on our consumers' ability to spend.","For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales for auto parts stores was $1,713,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. For the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 9.7%. For the third quarter, Commercial represented 16.2% of our total sales and grew $32 million over last year's Q3. Last year's Commercial sales mix percent was 15.4%.","As we have said previously, overall, we have been pleased with the progress we are making in our Commercial business, both operationally and financially, and we remain on track with our plans. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings, and therefore, we're optimistic about the future of this business.","We continue to believe we can grow revenues in existing stores, and we will continue to open additional Commercial programs. This past quarter, we opened 102 new programs versus 121 programs opened in third quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,248 stores, supported by 154 hub stores. Approximately 900 of our programs are 3 years old or younger.","With only 68% of our domestic stores having any commercial program, and our average revenue per programs materially below several of our competitors, we believe there is ample opportunity for additional program growth, in addition to improved productivity opportunities in current programs. While we recognize that our Commercial sales productivity per program is well below our peers, we do not believe there are any structural impediments that prevent us from achieving similar productivity numbers.","As we look forward, we're focused on building upon the Commercial initiatives that have been in place for the last few years. We have a very talented sales force, and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of this sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. We feel our product distribution model is scalable going forward, and we are continuing to test additional enhancements to our offerings.","We believe our strategy is the right one for the long run, but it will be an evolution. Our Commercial sales growth has recently been below our aspirations, but we continue to be quite optimistic about our long-term growth potential, as we believe we have the right strategy and people in place to continue to succeed.","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our commercial programs, having opened over 900 programs over the past 36 months. Effectively, 28% of the programs are 3 years old or younger. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share.","The regional variances in our Commercial sales results give us comfort our underperforming markets are not the direct cause of something we have specifically done. We believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner. We continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.","Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 7 new stores during the third quarter. We currently have 341 stores in Mexico. We remain consistent with our strategy to open stores at a steady pace while managing our Mexico business for the long run. We have operated stores in Mexico for over 14 years, and we continue to see opportunity for growth going forward. Our returns and profit growth have been in line with our expectations.","Now regarding Brazil, we currently have one store opened, and we are in various stages of development on future stores. Our plans remain to open 10 to 15 stores over the next couple of years and then reevaluate our development as we refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. At that point, we will talk more on our long-term growth plans.","Recapping our second quarter performance for the company, in total, our sales for the quarter were $2,206,000,000, an increase of 4.5% from last year's third quarter. Domestic same-store sales, or sales for stores opened more than 1 year, were down 0.1% for the quarter.","Gross margin for the quarter was 51.8% of sales, up 20 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. The improvements in gross margin were attributable to higher margins on merchandise growth [ph] . The increased merchandise margins were primarily due to lower acquisition costs.","In regards to inflation, we have seen some increases in costs year-over-year, but at a much slower pace than last year at this time. At this point, our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing for the balance of the calendar year, and therefore, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and will take the appropriate adjustments should they arise.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the Retail and Commercial businesses. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross profit margin percentage. As the growth of our Commercial business has been the steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have to continuously work strategies to offset this.","Additionally, AutoAnything has been a drag on our gross margins as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment, which for the quarter increased approximately $43 million.","SG&A expense for the quarter was 31.1% of sales, lower by 24 basis points from last year's third quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to a gain on the disposal of certain assets and lower incentive compensation.","I want to take a moment to thank our entire team for their diligence on cost control, which ultimately was a significant contributor to our performance in Q3. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure for this foreseeable future.","EBIT for the quarter was $456 million, up 6.7% over last year's third quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 20.7%, or up 44 basis points versus the previous year's third quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $42.1 million compared with $39.7 million in Q3 a year ago. As the fourth quarter will have an extra week, we're modeling interest expense to be in the $62 million to $64 million range.","Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4 billion or approximately $395 million more than last year's third quarter balance of $3.6 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.8%, flat with last year's third quarter. We expect our tax rate to be 36.5% to 37% on an ongoing basis. Net income for the quarter of $266 million was up 6.8% versus the prior year's third quarter. Our diluted share count of 36.5 million was down 7.7% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $7.27, up 15.8% over the prior year's third quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement, for the third fiscal quarter of 2013, we generated $385 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 9% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $89 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 43 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels and work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters. For all of fiscal 2013, our CapEx is expected to be approximately $400 million.","With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,767 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 341 stores in Mexico; and one in Brazil, for a total store count of 5,109. Depreciation totaled $52.9 million for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $49 million.","With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $325 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $278 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our leverage metric was 2.52x EBITDAR this past quarter. Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 111%.","Next I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $2.8 billion, up 6% versus Q3 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth, along with additional investments and coverage for select categories. Inventory per store was up 2.2%, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 32.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","As the last point, I'd like to point out that this year, fiscal year 2013, has an extra week in it. More specifically, the extra week will fall during this fourth quarter.","Already our longest quarter in number of weeks, this year's fourth quarter will consist of 17 weeks versus last year's 16 weeks. As a result, our year end this year -- our year will end this year on August 31. The last time we had an extra week in our financials was fiscal 2008. We would encourage each of you to review the impact this extra week had on our performance in Q4 2008 to better understand the impact it will have on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 results.","Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes","Thanks, Bill. We are pleased to report our 27th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth and to report an EPS growth rate of 15.8% for our fiscal third quarter. Clearly, our sales performance has not met our expectations, as we have experienced softer sales over the past few quarters.","Based on our recent results, we continue to believe we should experience an improvement in sales for the remainder of the year. The basis for this expectation is the confluence of a more normalized winter and easier sales comparisons, combined with strong execution of our plans, including enhanced product assortments, improved productivity in our existing commercial programs and continued new commercial program growth.","The hardest things to predict for us when it comes to our performance are macro factors and in particular, the weather. Spring arrived much later than normal this year and materially later than last year, and it clearly dampened our performance in the first 2\/3 of the third quarter. But we can't control the weather, and over time, its effects even out. Ultimately, our actions determine our performance, and we continue to be pleased with the strategies we have in place, and quite pleased with the execution of those strategies.","But that doesn't mean we aren't looking to improve. We are constantly testing new ideas and innovations to determine what is successful and what isn't. We will keep you apprised of our developments as they progress.","Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, Commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce and Brazil. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low-single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength, and we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits.","We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success.","Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our earnings per share growth and ROIC for Q3, and we remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.","Finally, I want to again thank our entire organization for their dedication to our customers, fellow AutoZoners, stockholders and communities. Our approach remains consistent. We're focused on succeeding in the fourth quarter of 2013, and we are excited about our future opportunities.","Thank you for your time. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of questions, if I may. First on the Commercial programs. Can you maybe give a little bit of color on what the productivity levels are for the programs that are under 3 years old, since it's such a significant portion compared to the more mature programs? And then I have a follow up, please.","William C. Rhodes","Yes, Alan, I don't want to get into too many specifics on it, but clearly, they're much less mature and they come out significantly below the existing programs. The other thing that I think is important, and I'm not sure everybody understands, is as those programs open, many times, probably most of the time, they also cannibalize the existing programs. So some of the growth in the productivity of the Commercial programs right now is muted because we do have those 900 stores that, over the last 3 years, have done some cannibalization of the existing programs. At the end of the day, we're not meeting our aspirations, but the underlying performance of the new programs and the existing programs, when you take everything into account, we're generally pleased with.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So for the select group of markets, Bill, like the west, where you said was better, and let's say the southeast, where weather really was not an impact, did those markets collectively perform on your plan?","William C. Rhodes","I think for the first 2\/3 of this quarter, I would say they were generally aligned with where our expectations were. In the last 1\/3 of the quarter, frankly, the northeast and midwest is where we really saw very strong performance, as they rebounded in a significant way.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, real quick, the 82 expanded hubs, I mean, any sort of color as to how much more productive these hubs are? And do you ultimately plan to expand every single one of the 154?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. Our objective is to expand all the 154. Obviously, we've made great progress so far, getting 82 opened in less than 3 years -- 82 expanded or relocated in less than 3 years. As we get farther down the cycle, because these are real estate deals, we've done the easy ones. Now we have more complicated ones ahead. So the pace will likely slow. As for how they're performing, this is the first time that we've ever deployed capital really for our hub stores. If you think originally, all we did was take existing space that was there and leverage it to put the product assortments. So the easiest way for me to show you that they're meeting our expectations is we continue to make real estate acquisitions and build buildings because they're exceeding our expectation -- meeting or exceeding our expectations. So we're pretty pleased with them.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's Simeon Gutman for Gary. Two questions. First, Bill Rhodes, you talked a lot about the regionality. And so I think that, that kind of helps explain some of the, I guess, cyclical versus secular arguments. Is there anything else you can point to, be it age of vehicles or other factoids that they kind of point to, that this is -- I guess, a year ago's downturn was more cyclical?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I think we're going to stick with what we said for the last year. This isn't a new story. I think the last 3 calls, we talked about the fact that we thought last winter, the lack of winter in the midwest and northeast last year did not cause the same level of maintenance requirements or failure items because the roads weren't messed up. So far, that prognostication has come to effect, but we're 1 month into it. We've seen April come. And I also want to reinforce the 2 points that we've made in our prepared remarks, we're also a little concerned about the consumer. This economy is still not booming, particularly for the low-end consumer, and we've seen them be in a difficult situation now for more than 4 years, and they're all still trying to get readjusted to the reinstitution of payroll taxes.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So how should we think about that in terms of weighing off -- obviously, the weather is driving -- helping the comps and we think will continue to help the comps as you've talked about. But at what level does that get hurt? Or like what say -- where does that kind of peak out because you still have this macro issue overriding it?","William C. Rhodes","Simeon, your voice changed. Hello, Gary.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got a Canadian accent.","William C. Rhodes","Gary, here's the deal. That's what you guys do. You guys are as good at this as we are. We're going to plan our business conservative, like we always do, hope for upside and make sure that we continue to deliver strong performance. I can't tell you sitting here today what the number is, and you know that, that's not our practice, to provide guidance.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And last one, if the weather markets do get better and maintenance categories start picking up, what does that mean for gross margin? Does it bode well for gross margin? How does it mix out?","William T. Giles","I think, overall, we've had good performance on gross margin. Think back that we had some lower acquisition costs this quarter, frankly for the last 3 or 4 quarters. So as we get into Q4, we'll likely begin to anniversary some of the lower acquisition costs that we experienced over the last year or so. So we expect gross margin in and of itself to remain reasonably healthy. Also, in the spirit of full and fair disclosure, AutoAnything will obviously have a negative impact to gross margin. That impacted us about 40 basis points this quarter. That's probably a fair number for next quarter as well. And then at some point, we'll anniversary that and move forward. Like we say, we always manage gross profit on terms of dollars, not so much rate.","Operator","Our next question is from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I know you're tired of talking about the spread between the cold weather markets and not, but I'm a little confused here. So if you can first just get the facts right for me. Did you say in March there was a 600-basis-point spread between the cold weather markets and the rest, but for the quarter was 150 bps?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. What we said, Colin, was it's been about 500 for the last few quarters. Q3 to date through the end of March, it was 600 basis points, and it ended the quarter only with 150 basis points, which means it significantly outperformed in the month of April.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm sorry, the whole quarter was 150? Or at the end of the quarter, it was running 150?","William C. Rhodes","The whole quarter was 150.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So that would mean that the cold weather market significantly comped positive above the rest of the house in April?","William C. Rhodes","That would be correct.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So how do you -- we think about that in terms of just -- obviously, February and March were really bad, and the normal spring maintenance that would have happened in March didn't happen because the weather was so bad. How do we think about that just getting pushed into April?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I think several things. Number one, I don't want to get too excited, and we're not getting too excited about 1 month. We have variability in our sales all the time, week-to-week, month-to-month, and I don't want that to get overstated by any stretch. Now there's a couple of things that made it happen in April this year. Number one, the tax refund benefit that we normally see late January, early February, never materialized. A lot of times, that comes in deferred maintenance, and people get out and do those jobs. That never happened this year. Also, last year, March was particularly strong in the northeast and midwest as we called out, and April was pretty weak. Well, this year, it was very cold and very wet throughout March in that part of the country. All of a sudden, they got some glimmers of improved weather in April, and there was pent-up demand they took -- they did it. But again, I don't want to get too crazy about -- or too exuberant about the performance in those markets in April. One month doesn't make a trend. We got a long way to go. We got a lot of sales that we feel like we're owed in that part of the country.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And then maybe just a bigger picture. I know that you have, for a long time, looked at miles driven as the longest-term indicator of the health of the business, and especially miles driven on older cars. Any thoughts on why we haven't seen any real recovery in miles driven since the recession?","William T. Giles","I think that it really kind of speaks a little bit to -- Bill talked about it before. I mean, we don't really necessarily see the economy picking up. Unemployment rate is down a little bit, but the fact is there's still a significant number of people unemployed and maybe even off of the charts. So miles driven has been relatively flat, as you pointed out. Gas prices have been moderately flat. The age of the vehicles continue to increase, so that's helpful for our business over the long haul. Obviously, miles driven on a 10-plus-year-old vehicle is more impactful than it is on a brand-new vehicle as far as maintenance and wear and tear is concerned. So we think that, that continues to create decent demand and decent industry tailwinds overall. But in terms of miles driven, it's been relatively flat, and we don't anticipate that changing dramatically.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Final quick one, market share. Any sense of how you did?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. We continue to do fine on market share. Our gaps have closed over a period of time, and there have been months where -- in the retail sector, where we've lost a little bit of market share. But they've shown significant improvements as we've seen our sales start to rebound.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Bill Giles, you commented on your prepared comments that you do not see any structural impediments for your Commercial sales program matching some of your competitors. I guess you're referring to NAPA and O'Reilly. When you indicated no structural impediment, do you think you can achieve that productivity with your current distribution strategy that does not include same-day fulfillment from your large distribution centers?","William T. Giles","Although the way to think about it is that we do have same-day delivery out of the hubs. And so when you hear us talk about the 154 hubs that we have out there, the 82 hubs that we have expanded over the last 2 or 3 years, and we'll have several more hubs that will continue to be expanded over the next couple of years, and we continue to really optimize those hubs, both in terms of coverage, as well as delivery, our objective is really to get those products into the marketplace so they can be delivered on a same-day basis out of the hubs. And so the distribution centers will be a backup support for that. But the real key is for us to forward deploy inventory right into the marketplace so that we can get it to the customers as quick as we can. And we think the hub strategy is the one that will get us there. And we obviously have work to do. We're not there yet, but you'll see us continue to invest in hubs, and you'll see us continue invest in inventory.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","When you look at the 3,000 programs that are in place today, do you have a meaningful number that are achieving the same weekly sales volumes as those more established commercial competitors?","William T. Giles","We certainly have programs out there that are achieving the numbers that you would see from our established competitors, without question. And so obviously, from our perspective, it's meaningful. And it also indicates to us that -- and that's kind of how we make that statement, is that there's no structural impediments because we actually have programs out there that are actually delivering that. So we know it is possible.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then the last question I had revolves expenses. It sounds like there may have been a few one-timers in the quarter, got a lower incentive comp, talked about a gain on sale of an asset. What do you think is the sustainable growth rate in SG&A going forward?","William T. Giles","We're going to manage SG&A -- and you've always heard me say this, is that we're going to manage SG&A given the sales environment that we're operating in. I mean, with respect to the sale on asset, I mean, we always have periodically some sale on assets. The fact of the matter is, the organization really did a good job this quarter, as they do most all quarters, of really tightly managing the expenses based on the sales environment that we are operating in. And so there really wasn't a lot of significant fluctuation, which is why we called out the ones that we did. But I think on a long-term basis, we're going to continue to tightly manage expenses, and we're going to respond to the sales environment that we're competing in.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Vigneau - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Matt Vigneau on for Matt Fassler. I had one question about inventory. Would like to ask about the opportunities for incremental investment and your assessments on the returns you're achieving and where the opportunity is greatest within DIY versus Commercial.","William T. Giles","Yes. I would say they're equally opportunistic. One of the things that we find as we continue to invest in inventory, particularly to hubs, as well as the individual satellite stores or the individual retail stores themselves, is that we get inventory productivity out of both Commercial and DIY, which is the beauty of the model overall, is that we have an ability to really leverage the inventory from both a DIY and Commercial perspective. Every time that we add inventory, many times it may be focused on Commercial. The fact is that we get benefits out of both. And so from a return perspective, obviously, we have stringent return metrics overall. But at the end of the day, we need to make sure that we've got adequate coverage in the marketplace, and we're going to continue to invest in inventory to ensure that we have adequate coverage in the marketplace in order for us to further gain market share. I don't know if that answers it, but that's how we look at it.","Operator","Our next question is from John Lawrence with Stephens.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Bill, would you start off with just talking a little bit on the Commercial side? Through this volatility you talked about the last couple of years, how would you talk about sales force productivity, who they're calling on, the chains or the independents, and how does that sort of ebb and flow throughout this volatility?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I think I'd start with how pleased we are with the development of our sales force. You step back 5 years ago, we didn't have a sales force, and now we have a very professional sales force. And our organization has really spent a tremendous amount of time training our sales force to do it the AutoZone way, and also providing them with the tools, a lot of which are technological tools, to make them incredibly efficient, and also gives us great insights into where they're spending their time and what are the results when they spend their time in certain areas. But as far as trying to say where they're spending their time based upon the class of trade, I would say they're spending a lot of time on both the national accounts and on the independent up and down the street operators. Both of those are -- provide us tremendous opportunities, and they're both performing fairly well.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And secondly, could you give us a sense of what percentage of inventory or sales is Duralast products at this point?","William T. Giles","Our Duralast product continues to be probably just over 50%. You've seen over time, if you allow me to stretch back for a couple of years, where we've actually introduced it into some additional categories that previously we may have thought were impossible, Wiper Blades being a great example of that. So as we continue to look forward, obviously, there's fewer opportunities because we're taking advantage of a lot of those opportunities. But we still believe there's opportunities for us to continue to introduce the Duralast brand into other categories. But today, it's just over 50% with a slight increase.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And lastly, AutoAnything. Bill, is there anything -- I know it's early, but anything you've seen conceptually, strategically that's different than you thought? Or opportunities that you see that you could share at this point?","William T. Giles","Yes, I think that's right, John. It's a little too early to share much. I mean, it's -- we're very excited about the acquisition. We're very excited about the team at AutoAnything. We're excited about the customer base that they have, the categories that they really penetrate strongly that are opportunistic for us. And I think the synergies between the 2 organizations are just starting to take place. So overall, we're pleased with the acquisition. And we think, strategically, on a long-term basis, it'll be a great fit for our customer.","Operator","Our next question is from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A couple of quick questions and one just housekeeping. What was the SG&A impact on the lower incentive comp in the quarter?","William T. Giles","Around 10 points or so.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess as you look into the current quarter and the closing of the gap on regional performance, it was 500-odd bps last year in Q4. We've got a few weeks of May under our belt. Is the trend continuing there that you can close that gap going forward?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, Bret. I don't want to get into what the trends in May since the end of the quarter are. We have a very strong practice of releasing our earnings very quickly after the end of the quarter. So here we are talking about this quarter after 2 weeks and 3 days. And I just -- I don't think it's prudent for anybody to get into what's going on in the last 2-week trends. So we tried to give you as much color as possible on April so you could understand that. But as a general practice, we don't want to get into the new quarter.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then one last question sort of following up on John's on the inventory trend and Duralast brand potential. As you build out the Commercial mix and you add incremental hard parts, is that something that is going to be a longer-term headwind to the Duralast mix as a percentage of sales? I mean, are the Commercial customers looking for branded product? Or are you getting traction, convincing them that the Duralast product line is as good as the branded alternative?","William T. Giles","No, we get a lot of traction actually on the Duralast brand, and so we don't believe that, that's anything but positive. And so if we thought that there was a branded product that would make a difference, we'd introduce it. But the fact is, and we've done it many times before, have found that the Duralast product -- it's a high-quality product and we get it into the hands of our Commercial customers, and they see it. And obviously, we back it up with warranties, et cetera. And so that product continues to be received well. And so we certainly don't see that as a hurdle for us to get over, just the opposite.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then one last question. In AutoAnything and some of the more discretionary product mix that they carry, are you saying that category working better across the stores as well as discretionary coming back at all, beyond what you've added in the AutoAnything mix?","William T. Giles","Yes. We've obviously -- it's relatively new at the moment. AutoAnything is being operated relatively separate from the AutoZone stores at the moment. And so we're continuing to evolve and develop AutoAnything. But there are certainly SKU-intensive categories that exist on AutoAnything that lend themselves to online shopping, and so that's our focus at the moment. Long term, there will be some opportunities for us to integrate the 2. But at the moment, they're being operated as a standalone.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. So you haven't changed. I've seen some stores that seem to have a heavier discretionary mix in some performance parts and appearance accessories, that you're not changing your SKU mix on the Retail format in some markets to sort of test that product out?","William T. Giles","No more than we would normally. I wouldn't equate it to an AutoAnything transaction.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I've got a follow-up on inflation, which is something that used to sort of run around 2% in the industry and then seemed to go away last year. Could you give us an update on where we are with that and also the promotional environment, given that everyone seems to able to buy stuff cheaper than they did a couple of years ago?","William T. Giles","Yes. I think you hit it. I mean, the fact is, is that I think probably -- you're right. About 2 years ago, we had some inflation last year. It was relatively moderate. And so far, this year, we're seeing it relatively moderate. And that's why in our prepared remarks, as Bill said, we're seeing the pricing index not really look as though it's going to be increasing much. So we don't see inflation being a positive or a negative necessarily. It's kind of a neutral overall. From a promotional perspective, I would say that we're not really seeing anything different in the marketplace promotionally. I mean, there's certainly a category or a product here and there that might have some increased promotional activity for a short period of time. But on an overall basis, I would say that we're not necessarily seeing any kind of a change in promotional activity per se. There will always be some price adjustments, but not any kind of promotional activity per se.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just looking at the quarter, Bill, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the 2-year comp was better as well. Were you referencing April in that regard? Or were you talking just about the quarter?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, that was specifically about April. We did have a very strong April, and I didn't want people to think it was a one-year lap. So it was 2 years we've grown same-store sales.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And you -- so now that you look at all the Easter shifts and the weather and all that, do you think the base that we're working with now for this quarter is something that's more normal?","William C. Rhodes","I hope so. I think what we've been saying for the last 9 months is once we annualize that crazy winter last year in 2011 and 2012, we would anticipate more normalized run rates. And so I think we're sticking with that at this point in time.","William T. Giles","And then just also taking into -- taking into account also the macro effects that Bill talked about before with the payroll tax, that's the one factor that we don't really know, on a long-term basis, what the impact is to our consumer.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just lastly on SG&A, given some of the puts and takes there and how you historically were able to bring that dollar growth down to basically flat or just up 1% or 2% way back when comps were flattish for a sustained period, how do you think about SG&A now? It seems like it should, just on a dollar basis, grow more than it would have 6 or 7 years ago, given the growth in Commercial. Am I thinking about that right? Or...","William T. Giles","Yes, I think you are. I think the fact is, is that we want to continue to invest in the business. We want to make sure that we're continuing to deliver WOW! Customer Service and being able to take market share. So we're all about making sure that we've got a good face to the customer and that we're providing great service. And we're going to invest properly to do that. That starts all the way from training to customer service, to hubs and to inventory, et cetera.","Operator","Our final question today is from Aram Rubinson with Nomura.","Chris Bottiglieri","This is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aram Rubinson. My question is, as a newer entrant to the commercial space, what changes do you expect to make in order to reach the next level of growth in your existing markets? Do you see that driven more by pricing? Is it going to be a change to sales or service?","William C. Rhodes","I think it's going to remain sticking with our strategy. You've never heard us talk about price being a key driver. We don't think -- we want to be a trusted partner with our Commercial customers, and that means we want to sell them at a reasonable price. We want to have the inventory that they need. We want to get it to them as quick as humanly possible and really build a long-term relationship that certainly is broader than price.","All right. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We'll not take anything for granted, as we understand our customers have alternatives. Our culture remains our key point of differentiation from our competition, and we must not lose sight of the importance of basic store execution in order to remain very successful. We have a very solid plan to succeed for the remainder of the fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Before we close, also, I'd just like to wish everybody a very happy Memorial Day. And obviously, our thoughts are with those folks in Oklahoma who went through so much devastation yesterday. So thank you for participating in today's call.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect at this time."],"2775":["AutoZone, Inc.

Sir, you may begin.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2016 first quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT, and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our Web site www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter. The first quarter has been very busy for us. We continue to organically grow our business, while expanding our initiatives designed to drive sales. We expanded our U.S. retail footprint with the opening of another 22 net new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 10%, with 55 net new programs open for the quarter. We had the commercial program at 81% of our domestic stores, and we continue to expand our presence in Mexico, opening one store in the quarter. Also, in Brazil, we opened an additional store, and now have eight stores in operation.","Lastly, we opened two new IMC branches. While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we believe we have great growth opportunities with both electronic commerce and store openings outside the U.S. for many years to come. ","Along with our key strategic investments, we continue to spend a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic retail business. The DIY operations remain our number one priority, and the business did quite well in the first quarter. We generated positive traffic and ticket on a same-store basis. And performance was generally consistent across the country.","While the macro economy is favorable for DIY performance right now, we continue to gain share, and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store with every customer.","Regarding commercial, we've continued with our inventory placement and distribution strategies to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. Over the past two years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued the rollout of more frequent deliveries to an additional 80 net new stores in the quarter. As we discussed in our last quarterly conference call, this rollout focuses on increasing from once-a-week deliveries from our distribution centers to either three or five times. Our results continue to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate.","With the varying weekly sales volumes of our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. And with the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 1,000 additional stores, ending the fiscal year with approximately 2,000 stores with this enhanced service level. The implementation of this initiative will create a gross margin headwind of approximately 30 basis points each quarter until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete we would ultimately expect about two-thirds of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries. This quarter, we only implemented this initiative in 80 net new stores. This past quarter, our focus was on rolling out multiple deliveries to our hub stores. We focused our efforts on this group of stores because they service so many other stores.","Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the mega hub stores. We ended the quarter with five mega hubs in operation, with no new openings this quarter, although we expect to add a handful of additional mega hubs over the balance of the fiscal year. As a reminder, these super-sized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to most surrounding stores, and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs are exceeding our expectations. We have been pleasantly surprised to see the sales generated by the new unique SKU additions to their markets, lifting both our retail and commercial businesses.","While there is incremental cost to these rollouts, and payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel that our cost de-leverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful de-leverage from this initiative in fiscal 2016. Currently five mega hubs support approximately 2,000 stores on a same-day or overnight basis. And once built out, we'd expect to have a network of mega hubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 locations. Consistent with the increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our mega hub expansion over the next few years.","We also continue to rollout our new store prototype that significantly expands the hard part holding capacity in our stores. All new stores are opening now with this new prototype. And we remodeled 29 additional constrained stores, and now have 126 completed locations. Each of these efforts that are focused on improving our availability of inventory has resulted in an increase to our store level inventories. They've also added incremental costs. Sales have justified our investments though, and offered convincing proof that we remain on the right track.","Along with improving our global parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work, with opportunities for advancement, and ensure we do it on a profitable basis, to provide strong returns for our shareholders.","As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we continue to invest in store labor in order to say, yes, we've got it more frequently. Yes, we've got it, is a new operating mantra for us in 2016. We have made material and meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory. And now it is time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change. With traffic up across our stores, we understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers' needs. When a customer has a request for a part, product, or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, yes, we've got it.","While early in the implementation phase, our team has enthusiastically embraced this notion. And with the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools, and specifically the staff necessary to provide our customers with WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve. We also continue to make significant investments -- systems investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We believe it is essential to be able to share information and processes seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone, and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs.","While we are in the early stages of this work, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective of our customers will benefit us greatly over the next several years. In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the mega hubs, we expect to open two or three distribution centers over the next two or three years. For remodeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost from $40 million to $45 million. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings, and we don't expect any domestic distribution center to come online until early fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development, but the larger portion of capital spend will be in fiscal 2017, and '18.","To summarize our plans, we expect to rollout more frequent distribution center deliveries, and more mega hub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open two or three new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from the past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 to 30 basis point gross margin headwind from these investments alone.","In fiscal year of 2015, we faced headwinds to our gross margin, and we were able to overcome them, and post improvement in each of our quarters. We believe in fiscal 2016, we continue to have opportunities for improvement. But we also have new headwinds.","Now turning to the first quarter's results, our sales increased 5.6%, on top of the 8% growth in Q1 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 3.5%. This quarter's sales results were very consistent throughout the quarter, excluding the last two weeks. The last two weeks of Q1 last year were particularly strong due to the extreme cold across much of the country. Remember the polar vortex. Every year, when the first significant cold spell arrives, we experience significant growth in hard part sales. And customers are reminded of the importance of doing the maintenance work necessary to prepare their vehicles for the winter driving season.","Last year, that first cold weather event was pulled forward into Q1, when it usually occurs early in Q2. While weather is always an important factor for sales, over time the impact evens out. Regionally, the Northwest, Northeast, and Midwest performed slightly below the overall chain. However, these two markets were better the year before. In regard to our three primary merchandise category splits, discretionary products' sales performed the best. Maintenance followed, and then failure-related merchandise. We attribute the recent strength in discretionary category to be due to lower gas prices freeing up money for our customers.","While important, discretionary remains our lowest mix of sales, approximately 80% of total domestic store sales, so the impact of accelerated growth in these categories is not the most significant driver of our overall sales. We are still a failure parts driven retailer, representing approximately 50% of total sales. And the lack of early winter this year muted our sales in failure-related categories. As I said earlier, both traffic and ticket were positive for our DIY and commercial businesses. For the quarter, we opened 55 net new programs in commercial, and have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic store base.","While our sales grew 10% on the quarter, our programs opened grew by 7%. While the commercial business -- the commercial sales growth rate was a bit slower than last quarter's pace, we continue to be pleased with the progress we are making. We believe our future in this business remains bright. As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter we opened two additional hub locations. And now operate 178 traditional hubs. In addition to our opening more mega hub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hubs.","Regarding IMC, we opened two new branches this quarter, and are excited by our opportunities. This year, IMC will be busy. We'll open a few more locations this year, and expand access to their original equipment inventory to more AutoZone stores. The IMC parts catalogue is accessible to around 600 AutoZone locations today. So we see great sales growth opportunities in the future for both our retail and commercial customers.","Regarding Mexico, we opened one store this quarter, and now have 442 total locations. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on U.S. dollar earnings from our Mexico business to abate starting next summer, in the June-July timeframe, as we begin to lap the exchange rate increases. For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than a percentage point.","Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 4% over last year. As a reminder, ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses -- as a reminder, our ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses, which includes AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. Regarding online sales opportunities, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis, and to individual customers or B2C.","With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle sales are reaching all-time highs, and gas prices on the average are down materially, miles driven continue to increase. The lower income customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging. While we understand recent weather has been warmer and we were up against quite cold winter last year, we are still optimistic we can grow sales for upcoming quarters.","While we focus on both short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to delivering consistent strong earnings performance and extending our streak of 37 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth is an important milestone for us. While our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our mega hubs will add some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of the fiscal year, our focus remains growing operating profit dollars and acceptable return levels.","Now, let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, LIVE the Pledge. The key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the internet, improving inventory availability. And yes, we've got it.","On the retail front this past quarter, we are under the great people providing great service priority we increased staffing levels in our stores. We've also been focused on improving our mobile app on autozone.com to increase our relevancy across our fastest growing online category.","We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize that customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all our businesses.","On the Yes, We Got It front, we have added training, metrics, and most importantly share of voice to educate our store level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product, or advice needs they have. We are very excited about what this imitative can mean.","We should also have another strong performance in the total invested capital as we were able to finish the quarter at 31.2%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best if not the best in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investor's capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank our entire organization for their commitment to managing the business appropriately and prudently.","Now, I will turn it over to Bill.","Bill Giles","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial, and international results for the quarter.","For the quarter total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 20 IMC branches, increased 5.6%. Now switching to macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $2.51 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.09 a gallon, a $0.42decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.64 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $3.46 and ending at $2.82 a gallon.","We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles, and cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2.3% in August and 4.3% in September. Now, we don't have October and November data yet.","The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,761,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.","For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 10%. In the fourth quarter, commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $39 million over last year's Q1. While the sales trajectory of the business slowed a bit in Q1, we are continuing our efforts to grow this business. This past quarter, we opened 55 new programs versus 61 programs opened in first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,196 stores supported by 178 hub stores. Approximately 1,106 of our programs are three years old or younger, or 26% of the base.","Let me take a moment and discuss our commercial program performance. While our average weekly sales program for the last 12 months are below some peers in our industry, at $8,800, our productivity continues to improve. Our focus remains on growing both sales and profits at an accelerated rate compared to our retail business. Looking specifically at mature programs both of these five years old, they averaged $10,000 per week this past year and grew mid single digit over last year.","While we will continue to open additional programs over the next several years, we will remain focused on improving the productivity of all our existing programs. We also feel very good about the success we've had and profitably growing the commercial business.","With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we're well positioned to grow our base business. Over the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs and that will continue to be the case albeit at a slightly moderated pace. We have a very talented sales force. And we're enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We've increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends.","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we're well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. We believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner and are excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.","Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened one new store during the first quarter. We currently have 442 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores and we're on target to open a new distribution center. This will mark our second DC in the country and support Central Mexico store growth.","While sales in base currency were above plan this past quarter, the devaluation in the peso remains a material headwind to U.S. dollars reported for operating profit. The peso finished Q1 21% below last year's quarter end rate. This weakness created a significant headwind on our reported U.S. dollars and EBIT. As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter foreign exchange headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than a percentage point.","While we cannot control movement in functional currency versus planned assumptions, the Mexico leadership continues to do an excellent job managing the peso denominated business. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings for the next few quarters.","Now regarding Brazil, we opened one store in the quarter resulting in eight stores opened at the end of the quarter. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we've been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S dollars as well. While the peso devalued 21%, real devalued 48% this year versus last. With extraordinary volatility, it was managed as best as possible. We remain in test phase in Brazil but have been more encouraged by our operating performance.","Recapping this past quarter's performance for the Company in total, our sales were $2.386 billion, an increase of 5.6% over last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year, were up 3.5% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.5% of sales, up 45 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives.","In regards to inflation, it remains subdued basically at flat level to last year across merchandize categories with pockets of deflation. Currently, we feel cost will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and will make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses, but our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins.","It is important to note we do not manage to targeted gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwind expanding our distribution center deliveries will cause. We work diligently to offset these headwinds with the focus on lower acquisition cost. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.","SG&A for the quarter was 34.2% of sales, higher by 17 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher domestic payroll and the impact of the IMC, which was partially offset by the favorable comparison to last year's higher legal cost. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.","EBIT for the quarter was $438 million, up 7.2% over the last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.4%. Interest expense for the quarter was $35 million compared with $37.1 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.754 billion or approximately $350 million more than last year's balance of $4.402 million.","Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy; and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was slightly higher than last year's Q1 tax rate. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis as the deviation result is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise.","Net income for the quarter was $258 million, and up 8.3% over last year. Our diluted share count of 31.1 million was down 5% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $8.29, up 14% over the prior year's first quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement, for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $324 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $87 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 27 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.","With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,163 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 441 stores in Mexico, and eight in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,613. We also had 20 IMC branches opened at fiscal quarter end taking our total locations to 5,635.","Depreciation totaled $66 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $61 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates.","With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $400 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had $698 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at year end.","Again, I want to stress, we managed appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.6%.","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per location basis. The company's inventory increased 7.2% over the same period last year, driven by increased product placement and new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $624 versus $604,000 last year, and $610,000 last quarter.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.2%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. We're very pleased to report our 37th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter to rate of 14% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must take a minute to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. We are confident in our initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis.","In addition, the performance of our mega hubs has been strong, and we look forward to opening more. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate. And we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leveraged our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits.","We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning in the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is, the solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution drives success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions, and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance.","In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must not be content. There's a lot of work in front of us over the next three quarters, but the future looks bright.","Before moving to the Q&A section, I'd like to address some of our recent organizational changes. In late September, Larry Roesel informed us that he was retiring this fall. Larry led our commercial business for eight-and-a-half years. And we experienced tremendous growth during his tenure. We thank Larry for his incredible contributions to our success, and wish he and his wife, Beverly, all the best in retirement.","Additionally, Mike Womack recently informed us that he and his family will be moving back to their home in Ohio. Mike has led our human resources organization for three-and-a-half years. Under his leadership, our HR processes have continued to improve. We wish Mike and his family all the best as they return home. In light of these changes, we have elevated three long-term AutoZoners to Executive Vice President, and we have promoted five AutoZoners to Senior Vice President. I am very excited about these individuals, their promotions, and the impact they will have on our business. These are very talented leaders, and they have tremendous AutoZone tenure.","On the average, these eight AutoZone leaders have over 25 years of AutoZone tenure. This is a great testament to our unique and powerful culture. And it highlights that our diligent work around succession planning is paying dividends.","Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks, good morning, and a nice quarter, guys.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Simeon Gutman","On multiple delivery and DC rollouts, I guess do DCs eventually come into this -- I missed some of the prepared remarks, but I guess an expectation of maybe some time late this fiscal year or next. If you think about the cadence of investments, the 20 to 30 basis points or so from supply chain, how does the DC investments play into that, is that to pump it up or is it -- or I believe you get some other benefit to take it down?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, couple of great questions. First of all, we will open our distribution center in Mexico, our second DC in Mexico hopefully by this fiscal year or first of the next fiscal year. The two DCs that we're working on domestically currently will not open until 2017, hopefully one in the first or second quarter, and then the second one in the third or fourth quarter. As you know, those things take time. As those distribution centers open, clearly they will have some capital investments, but on the operating expense front I don't think that they will be a material contributor to drive our operating expenses up or down.","As we do more frequent deliveries they're going to have some benefits because the stem miles of the transportation routes will be shorter, but obviously they will have incremental operating expenses of having a new facility, and a new management team, and all those things. I think those will net out generally.","Simeon Gutman","Okay, and then one quick follow-up, granted it's early days with the multiple delivery, but I imagine in-store and some of the inventory, the complexion is changing a little, more depth and maybe less safety stock. Is that the case? How are stores acclimating to it? Is there any protocol in store to minimize disruption, and obviously that should be translating into sales?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, and I would say that was one of the things that we looked at when we first started our test on this program. The store operators like it. They like it a lot. Number one, when the truck comes in it's in bite sized pieces, so it's much more easy to work into the daily activities, versus being the big event of the week, where they have to have all hands on deck. So they like it. Yes, it pulls down safety stock which is one of the challenges we have when we talked about our store of the future trying to eliminate some of the physical constraints that we have on our stores. One thing this does is pull down the safety stock and it allows us to put more parts on the shelf. So from an operating standpoint, I think it's all-systems-go, and they really like it.","Simeon Gutman","Okay, thanks.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Mr. Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Sir, your line is now open. You may proceed.","Dan Wewer","Thanks. Good morning, Bill. You had noted that the -- obviously the commercial revenue growth of 10% is quite good. But you did note that it decelerated from previous quarters. When you look at the results for the stores that are commercial programs that are still being delivered to once a week, compared to those that are on a three to five-week schedule, was there a deviation in their sales performance?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, Dan, there's clearly a deviation. But I would say first of all, that the benefits that we see from both of the inventory availability initiatives are both on the retail side and the commercial side. I wouldn't say that those stores reacted any differently in comparison than they did in Q4, if that makes sense.","Dan Wewer","So when you looked at the bit of moderation in revenue growth in commercial from 4Q, it was pretty much the same whether the stores are being shipped to once a week or three or five times per week?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, I think that's right. And as a reminder, when we do the delivery frequency in the mega hubs, we see about a $1000 to $1500 per store if you get both elements of that. That differential seems to be confirmed in everything we've done so far. And we did see a moderation in our sales growth kind of across the board.","Dan Wewer","And then just one other follow-up question on the incremental commercial growth; how is that splitting out between doing more business with existing customers or are your sales people now engaging new customers, and making them aware of your greater capabilities. It would be good if you could talk about how that split is developing.","Bill Giles","Yes, I think it's a combination of both. I mean, clearly as we've mentioned, we've grown our mature programs in the mid single-digit rate. So we're getting more productivity out of our existing base programs as they continue to mature. But clearly, with our opportunities to say, yes, we've got it on a more frequent basis, and be able to deliver products more timely, both through more frequent deliveries, as well as the mega hub network, and being able to communicate that to our customers with our sales force is an important thing. We've been able to do that, and I think we'll continue to gain traction over time.","Dan Wewer","And Bill, if I could just sneak in a real quick -- a quick question, can you remind us how much -- how important are your commercial customers at Firestone, and the service part of Pep Boys to AutoZone?","Bill Rhodes","But you know we don't talk about specifics on our commercial customers, but obviously Firestone is one of our great customers. We appreciate their business, but I don't want to get into specifics on them. And obviously we don't do much, if any, business with Pep Boys.","Dan Wewer","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sir, you may proceed.","Mark Becks","Hi, it's actually Mark Becks on for Chris. Historically, the DIY category has been sort of a flat to 1% comp industry and you guys are obviously doing much better than that. What if anything has changed on the DIY side outside of the fuel price declines? And what do you think the rate of the growth in the industry is currently?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, I think clearly we are seeing some industry strength currently. I think a part of that has to do with what's going on with gas prices. And while gas prices initially went down, you didn't see the initial correlation with miles driven increasing. But in more recent months, starting really strong in this summer, and continuing through September, the latest date that we have available, it\u2019s showing nice strength. Over long periods of time we've seen that has a nice correlation with our DIY industry growth.","I'd also say that our performance I don't think is solely based on industry. We talked about it in the prepared remarks. We're also gaining market share, and I think a lot of these initiatives that we have in place particularly around inventory availability are beginning to pay dividends, and remember, we're just very early in the early innings.","Mark Becks","And two quick follow-ups to that, who do you think you're taking share from, whether it be on the independent or the national retailers, and then also just with the lower gas prices, have you seen any particular lift that you might be able to quantify, or have you done any historical correlation, so for instance, 1% increase in miles driven would add 25 basis points to comps?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. I don't think the analysis that we have is that finite. What I would tell you is we would think that we're getting a benefit of 1% to 2% at this point in time in our DIY business.","As per who we're gaining market share from, I don't really want to get into that. I'm more focused on are we gaining market share and what we're going to do to gain more of it.","Mark Becks","Okay, great. And then just last question, you spoke to still being optimistic about growing sales, and then talked about a dip in trends in the last two quarters. Can you speak to any variability by region that you saw over the last couple of weeks? I think it was 50 here in the Northeast this past weekend and it's supposed to be 60 again this weekend. Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Yes. Thank you, great question. Number one, we wanted to call out what happened in the last two weeks of the quarter, because it was materially different. It wasn't materially different this year from the other weeks in the quarter. What was materially different was last year. We have that very first significant cold snap, and last year was really significant. And it happened in the last two weeks of the quarter. Our sales spiked during those last two weeks.","As we all know, it's been a warm fall. The beginning of winter is warm so far. What happens going forward, we don't know, they're calling for it to be a warmer winter; we will see what happens. And I don't think necessarily when you think about average temperatures, is that really the driver, what we need are a few really abrupt cold snaps, because the parts that are on the verge of failing will fail when those cold snaps happen and we will get our failure-related business back in those categories.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Mr. Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. You may proceed.","Michael Montani","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask Bill if you could just help contextualize a little bit the benefits that you all would have seen in the spring and summer at the last two years from what were sort of I'd say unusually favorable winter conditions, just to help us contextualize that as we head into the coming spring and summer period?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. Clearly we said many times over that a harsh winter does benefit us in the spring and summer. We've never been able to go in and say specifically how much it drives us, but clearly -- and it really happens with the under car parts. So what happens with a tough and particularly a wet snowy winter is the roads get a lot of damage, and that puts a lot of pressure on chassis systems, on brake systems and the like, and so we do tend to benefit from those as the spring thaw happens and into the early parts of the summer.","Michael Montani","Okay, great. And just to understand a little bit more if I could on the cost side, it's a little bit surprised to see the 15 whip hit from IMC just because I thought it would been cycled more or less, so can you discuss a little bit the ins and outs there and how to look at that moving forward as well as you know, the labor cost, which popped up a little bit. Is that due to increases in terms of pay per hour, what's driving that? Is it hourly rates to drive service, I think you alluded to?","Bill Giles","Yes. I would say that on the IMC front, we haven't fully anniversary it. We'll just anniversary through September -- after September, but we've also opened five new locations. So we went from 17 to 22 locations. So those five locations are adding some incremental expenses as they begin to get themselves ramped up. So my expectation is that we would see a little bit of headwind from IMC for the next quarter or so as we begin to mature some of the new openings that we've had.","From a payroll perspective, it's really probably better service levels overall. I think that we've increased our payroll hours a little bit across the board. We're not seeing a significant amount of wage inflation yet. We've seen a little bit. We anticipate probably a little bit more going forward, but overall I would say we have improved our service level in line with our Yes, We've Got It initiative.","Michael Montani","Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Mr. Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. You may proceed.","Chandni Luthra","Hi, this is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. Congratulations on a good quarter guys. My first question is that some of your competitors called out and benefit from the M&A disruption in the space, could you perhaps throw some color as to what you are seeing in terms of those trends and any impact that you are getting?","Bill Rhodes","Anytime somebody goes through a major acquisition integration, it's a challenge. We're not going to get focused on what they are doing. We are going to focus on what we are doing [technical difficulty] in our prepared remarks. We've got a great strategy. What's going to matter is whether or not we are able to execute this strategy. I think we are doing that right now. We are going to make sure we continue to do it. What happens with others is going to happen. There is nothing we can do about it. So we are just going to [technical difficulty].","Chandni Luthra","Got it. Okay. And then, my next question is about ALLDATA, there were some press releases in the last quarter about some new partnerships and agreements that you got for this ALLDATA business of yours, could you perhaps talk about these and the potential of this business going forward in general? Thank you.","Bill Giles","Yes. We have got a few partnerships for the few important vendors and also with customers as well. And that's pretty much ongoing. We will continue to grow the ALLDATA business. We feel good about ALLDATA business. We think that it is a leader in the industry. And we have signed and agreement with AMCO. You may have seen we are trying to just recently to provide them service to all their locations. So it's a great product, well respected in the industry and has good prospects going forward.","Chandni Luthra","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS Securities. Your line is now open. You may proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is actually Mark [indiscernible] today for Michael. Thanks for taking the question. It looks like the gross margin basis point impact from more frequent delivery initiative, picked up slightly this quarter. Can you just talk maybe a little bit about what was slightly more costly than expected and what's bringing you guys up to high end of your expected range looking forward?","Bill Giles","Yes, and that's a very good question and that's spot on. So we are 37 basis points de-leveraged due to supply chain and we've articulated a 25 to 30. So it was a little bit higher. I think part of that is really just as we continue rollout new programs with activity I mean if you look at the quarter in a little bit more finite detail, we probably rolled out about 300 programs on to the program this quarter. Although took off a couple of hundred programs that's got us to that net 80. So there was a lot of activity that occurred during the quarter.","And as we began to ramp this up, our handling cost, our internal cost to deliver more frequently will rise a little bit. And also keep in mind that this quarter and particularly next quarter as well are slightly lower volume quarters. So we really won't have the opportunity to leverage quite as much as we might. They are in the summer months so to speak. So I think that overall, we feel pretty good about the estimates that we have given on an annualized basis although on any given quarter, it may fluctuate a little bit.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. That's really helpful. I guess as a follow-up, can you talk about the performance in the stores that have seen that greater delivery frequencies implemented? And has it been I guess consistently high across the board, or are you guys seeing some variability?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, it's a great question. And we do see variability. And that's the reason why we're going to go forward with the strategy that says roughly two thirds of our stores are going to see three to five time per week deliveries and the third I'm going to continue to see one time a week delivery. The big variable that drives it as you would expect is store volume. We are talking about replenishment levels, and the more product that you sell, the more frequently you need to replenish it. And so, we do see significant variability but it's along the volume scale.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, great. Thanks guys.","Bill Rhodes","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is now open. You may proceed.","Bret Jordan","Hi, good morning guys.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning.","Bill Giles","Good morning.","Bret Jordan","A quick question on the store level SG&A investment, I guess if we were looking \u2013 are we thinking about adding employees or maybe changing the mix of employees and getting sort of higher end part pros as you grow that commercial business?","Bill Rhodes","I wouldn't say it would be changing the mix necessarily. I think that if a commercial business continues to grow, we will continue invest in commercial sales pros as we call them in the organization. I think really the comparison this year versus last is that we increased our service levels relative to where we were last year. I think last year we probably cutback a little bit more than we wanted to. I think actually we probably might have even called out that last year. We thought our service levels were not at the level that we wanted them to be. And so, this year we didn't want to repeat that mistake. And so, we stuck with out model during the quarter and I think we delivered better service levels.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then, a follow-up on the hard part-centric store prototypes, and as you reset some of the legacy stores, do you see doing more of those or you are sort of where you are at where you need to be from a distribution and hard parts availability standpoint?","Bill Rhodes","I think as far as resetting some of the stores that we talked about. We've got a new store prototype. So, all the new stores opened will be under that prototype. We have gone back I can't remember if 126 stores that we've already remodeled on that new store prototype. And we will continue to do that. But frankly, I suspect we'll get into the hundreds of stores I don't see that being a thousand necessarily because we are going to have physical constrains as we go through the process. But where we can find the opportunities to add more hard parts into space constrained stores, we are going to continue that.","Bret Jordan","Is the performance of that hard part the new prototype store meaningfully different than the legacy mix?","Bill Rhodes","It's different enough for us to justify the investment. We can debate what meaningful is. But those stores are performing better and those hard parts are moving.","Bill Giles","If I can add on to that, number one the new prototype is not materially more expensive than the old prototype, so as we open the stores, there's no meaningful cost differential. The real benefit comes in the really, really space constrained stores that we have. Remember, we still have about 3800 sq ft stores, a 5000 sq ft stores. When those stores are performing at high volumes and we are able to go in and remodel them to the element of this new prototype that's where we can really see a difference.","Bret Jordan","Great. Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Mr. Curtis Nagle with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. You may proceed.","Curtis Nagle","Hi, thanks very much and just on for Denise today, so two quick questions, one, it looks like the comp total sales variance narrowed a bit from these trends and I am just curious if that's from the peso or something else, and then two, any commentary on new store growth for this year if you could comment on that?","Bill Rhodes","Sure, great questions. First of all, on the peso, our same-store sales are domestic only. So the peso variances aren't impacting our same-stores at all. If you look at last quarter, our same-store sales did 4.5%. They did 3.5% in Q1 of 2016. You can almost point directly to the last two weeks' performance as to why that's different. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we went up against the polar vortex last year, and in those two weeks, we had phenomenal weeks. This year we had good weeks but they were up against phenomenal weeks and that's basically the differential in our same-store sales for the quarter.","Curtis Nagle","And then just any commentary on new store growth if you could?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. We planned to open -- we opened 158 stores last year. I believe it was 157. We plan to open about 150 stores this year on a domestic basis. We're looking to grow Mexico around 40 stores and Brazil we are kind of taking one at a time.","Curtis Nagle","Okay, thanks very much.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Mr. Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open, sir. You may proceed.","Tony Cristello","Thank you. Good morning.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning.","Tony Cristello","The first question I had was related to the IMC the import business, I think you said you are in 22 locations and those were able to service about 600 stores. Can you talk about how that business has evolved? How important that is relative to future growth? And where you would like to see that business in terms of touch points relative to your existing store base?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, great question. All right, so a couple of things. Number one, when we acquired IMC just over a year ago, they had 17 branches. We have now opened five new branches. We stand at 22 open locations.","Those IMC branches are servicing 600 AutoZone stores, but that's not a function of how many branches we have. That's function on some short-term system limitations that we have at AutoZone to be able to serve up that catalog in our AutoZone stores. We are working. We did some short-term solutions that have allowed us get into those 600 stores, so we could test it. Now, we are having to go back and do the more robust work to industrialize those system improvement. That will be coming later in the year which will allow those system improvements. That will be coming later in the year which will allow us to expand how IMC services the AutoZone stores.","I want to also be careful to not overstate the implications of IMC servicing AutoZone stores. Yes, we will leverage IMC, but that's not going to be the big driver of our commercial business. The reason, the main primary reason we bought IMC is because it's a good business and we will continue to expand that business as we have done with past stores that we have opened to date.","Tony Cristello","Is that a business that can double or triple? I mean I am just trying to understand. It's a great business and the import side of the business is going to continue to grow given the car park and how they are evolving?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. If you take a look at the industry leader on the import side of the business, they have got a well over a hundred locations. I don't see why we can't do the same over time.","Tony Cristello","Okay. And if I could have just one follow-up on sort of another business that can contribute the ALLDATA side and I know you've talked about wins and such, but how much of that business do you get sort of a lead into where you should be structuring your commercial side? In parts you need to be caring because I guess that's a system that's stays with your installed base and probably developing relationships before you may have some of those well established relationship at the store level?","Bill Rhodes","There is some of that. There is an ability for us to be able to extract some information. I think that we still have a lot of work to do relative to acquiring more information out of all that in order to improve some of the synergies across our commercial business as well.","So, I would categorize it is helpful on identifying certain trends, but we still have a long way to go in doing that.","Tony Cristello","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our last question is from Mr. Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. You may proceed, sir.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning.","Bill Rhodes","Good morning.","Seth Basham","My question is around layouts. It sounds like you are having some good success in rolling out mega hubs and getting lifts from stores they are servicing. Can you provide any more detail on what kind of cycle lift you are seeing specifically out of the story from mega hubs?","Bill Rhodes","We haven't gotten into those specifics distinctions between inventory, delivery frequency in mega hubs while we continue to say that we have both of the programs where we are going to add between 1000 and $1500. Now that also varies because some of the mega hubs are the stores that are serviced by that mega hub are serviced by them three times a day directly while other stores are serviced by other hub stores that get delivery three times a day and then other hub stores get overnight delivery. So there is a quite a bit of variability in it, but we continue to be pretty comfortable saying if you get frequency delivery in mega hubs, it means about 1000 and $1500 per store.","Tony Cristello","Got you. And in terms of your growth pace of mega hubs, you've talked around 25 to 30 for the next few years, what's the limiting factor in slowing that roll out if you are having pretty good success with the ones that you have out there?","Bill Rhodes","Yes. It's just as simple as number one, we wanted to go test this program until we got five up and running. We made the decision in the late summer early September to move forward with this strategy, now it's a function of the real estate development pipeline. And remember I mean it even for a regular AutoZone store, it can take us two years to get a store open. So it has nothing to do with anything other than our real estate pipeline and how long it's going to take us to do that. Trust me, we are pushing very hard on that front.","Seth Basham","Right. That's good to hear. And lastly, not to spend too much more time in the weather, but I just wanted to understand, since the weather was unfavorable at the end of the quarter, how is your business progressing through the fiscal second quarter?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, everybody always wants us to talk about that and we stay away from that unlike a lot of organization that will have their conference call four to six weeks after the end of the quarter. It has only been two weeks and two days. So I think it's not a good prudent strategy for us to talk about what's happened in the first couple of weeks. And, we've consistent about that for a long time. So, I don't want to break that.","Now we will say this, weather normalizes over time. And I also want to reiterate that really cold winter is great, but what we really look for is just few good hard cold snaps. And that's when we really see big spikes in our business in certain failure- related categories.","Seth Basham","Got it. [Technical difficulty] and good luck.","Bill Rhodes","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. At this time, I would like to hand the call back to you Mr. Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We'll not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we're confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.","We thank you for participating in today's call, and we'd like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy safe holiday season and a prosperous new year. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."],"2927":["AutoZone, Inc.

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and IT; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the Company for their tremendous efforts during this past quarter. While our results for the quarter were below our expectations, the challenges seem to be broad-based across our industry and other sectors of the economy. The first few weeks of our 12-week quarter were very challenging. On our last conference call, we discussed the impact on the second quarter of the delay in income tax refunds, and that headwind continued for the first five weeks of our third quarter. Our expectations have been that much of those delayed refunds would lead to incremental store sales in Q3 but that never materialized. We don\u2019t have any empirical evidence of where those funds went but they seem to go to some other part of the economy this year. While our March sales did improve, we saw inconsistent week to week performance. It wasn\u2019t until April that we began to see stronger sales results. We can speak at length about delayed income tax refunds and the second consecutive mild winter but the more overarching thing for us was sluggish customer demand across virtually every category, resulting in disappointing sales performance during a specific eight-week period.","As we exited the quarter, we felt our sales trends had normalized and were more consistent with our performance from September to mid January, rather than the challenging results we delivered in late January through March.","Before getting into more detail about the quarter, I would like to address some of the trends and headwinds that our industry and specifically our business has recently been experiencing. Until our second quarter, we had consistently delivered exceptional performance marked by 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings per share growth. However, there are certain factors present today that have made it more difficult to achieve similar earnings per share growth. We have made decisions to accelerate some investment in our business. We're investing at an increased rate in inventory, capital expenditures with two new domestic distribution centers under construction and we opened a second distribution center in Mexico in the fall and we've increased our operating expenses as part of our more frequent delivery and mega hub efforts.","Unfortunately, as we intentionally increased our investment profile, our sales have been below our expectations each of the last two quarters. Simultaneously, we faced several other pressure points. Over the last year, we have experienced accelerated pressures on wages than we have in some time. Some of this is attributable to regulatory changes in certain space and municipalities while the balance and probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers. Additionally, after several years of substantially improved shrink performance, the last two years shrink expenses turned against us. We own it and we're working it diligently but as we're moving more inventory to more locations -- our inventory availability initiatives, it's not completely surprising that are shrink results are unfavorable.","And there are few other macro trends that are working in our favor right now. After years of benefit to our EPS growth rate, interest expense has begun to turn from a driver to a detractor; the Mexican peso exchange rate has worked against us for the last couple of years also. Our management team has been in this business for a long time and over time we been through many different cycles. Sometimes we had tailwinds and we benefited from those and other times we had headwinds and we have fought against them. Ultimately, we will continue to manage this business for the long term to provide great service for our customers and great opportunities for AutoZoners owners, ultimately delivering strong shareholder value.","Our current charge is to determine is some of the decisions that we've made need to be modified, specifically the frequency we deliver in our stores and the significant incremental costs that come with that decision. Our recent performance has been more challenging and some of those headwinds will remain for some period of time. We know that this business model has excelled over decades and we're confident with our AutoZoners leading the charge that that will continue. ","Now, let me provide more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, our sales increased 1%; our domestic same-store sales were down 0.8%. It was the tail of two periods. In the first five weeks, our same stores sales were down more than 4% and the last seven weeks, our comps increased approximately 2%.","We continue to see our Northeastern, Midwestern, and Mid-Atlantic markets underperform the balance of the chain as two consecutive mild weathers negatively impacted these regions. This quarter, there was less [ph] of a drag at approximately 100 basis points but on a two-year basis, this region of the country has materially underperformed the remainder. These regions represent roughly 25% of overall sales.","In regards to our three primary merchandised category, those we classify as failure, performed the best while the maintenance category performed the worst. Maintenance challenges were created during the tax refund delay and only gradually improved as the quarter progressed. We do however expect this category to improve its performance during Q4.","During the quarter, we opened another 35 new stores in the U.S. Year-to-date we have opened 84 stores and still expect to open approximately 70 more in the fourth quarter. Our commercial business expanded by 40.6%, while opening 56 net new programs. This trend slowed down from last quarter's 7.2% increase, much of which was experienced in the first five weeks of the quarter. We expect to open approximately 200 net new commercial programs for the fiscal year or approximately 95 additional programs in our last quarters. Currently 83% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. We continued to expand in Mexico, opening eight new stores. We didn't open any additional IMC branches or stores in Brazil this quarter. While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S.","Regarding Internet, we experienced improving trends versus our first two quarters as our results improved sequentially as the quarter moved along. When I discuss online, I'm referencing business shipped directly to the customer and not buy online and pick up in-store. Our pick up in store business sales are recorded in store sales and are not in the All Other category. Our pickup in store business continues to grow pretty rapidly, up over 30% for the quarter and higher than the 20% increase we experienced in Q2.","Under the Yes! We've Got It theme, we remained focused on improving our closure rates, meaning converting customer requests from pricing and availability into actual sales. In the spirit of satisfying our customers, we are making ongoing significant system investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all our platforms, both domestically and internationally. We understand that we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs.","As our primary objective remains growing our domestic retail and commercial businesses, we continued with our inventory availability initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry. This past quarter, we opened one additional mega hub location and now have 14 in operation. We are working diligently on the development of future sites and we expect to open two more during the upcoming fourth quarter and have a handful or more that are currently under development. We continue to be very pleased with our mega hub performance.","Additionally, we are continuing development on our two new domestic distribution centers based in Washington state and Florida, and we are expanding our distribution center in Illinois. Our current expectations are for the Washington state facility to come online in this Q4 while the Florida facility and our Illinois expansion will open six to nine months later. We continue to expect each of the two new distribution centers to cost approximately $60 million in capital and have some incremental operating expenses from preopening activities and maturation.","Now, I'd like to take a moment to go into more detail on our two inventory availability initiatives. These are two very discrete and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores. Separately, the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our market -- our network before.","Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we had roughly 2,300 stores receiving more than one weekly delivery at the end of Q3. While we added 100 additional stores this past quarter, we continued to modify our modeling. As you remember, up until recently, we have serviced the vast majority of our stores once a week. All of our systems, processes and practices have been built and fine tuned for onetime a week delivery. As a result, transitioning stores to more frequent deliveries has resulted in some unintended consequences operationally within our distribution centers as well as our stores. Therefore, we are continuing to closely manage this initiative and continually make adjustments.","As our overall performance in recent quarters has been challenging, it has been difficult for us to see the sales benefits from this initiative. We have been reassessing for some time whether or not our new frequency of delivery for higher volume stores of three times a week is providing us with sufficient benefit to justify the cost. While we continue to test, current indications are steering us to lower frequencies of delivery. With these ongoing results, we are in the process of moving a significant amount of these stores to twice a week delivery and some of the lower volume stores back to once a week delivery. We're committed to ongoing testing as we understand the sensitivities to different delivery schedules. Ultimately, we have to make the right investments to enhance our customers\u2019 experience but they have to be financially responsible as well.","The second ongoing initiative is the mega hub store concept. We're currently operating 14 mega hubs. We continue to be quite pleased with what the mega hubs allow us to offer our customers. As a reminder, these super-sized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both, surrounding stores and other hub stores, multiple times a day or on an overnight basis.","Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations. Currently, we have just over 4,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. A majority or about two-thirds of these 4,000 stores receive their service on an overnight basis, but as we expand our mega hubs, more of them will receive this service same day and many will receive it multiple times a day.","We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a mega hub is 20,000 to 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging and takes time.","While there are incremental costs to those rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. We\u2019ve not experienced meaningful noteworthy deleverage from this initiative during fiscal 2017.","Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request. And to this end in spite of a challenged near-term, we continued to be shared gainers this past quarter.","Regarding Mexico, we opened eight new stores this quarter and ended the quarter with 499 stores. And just last week, I was down with our exceptional team in Mexico, celebrating the opening of our 500th stores in Mexico in just 18 years of operation. I'm so very impressed by and proud of the business, the team and most importantly, the culture our team in Mexico has built.","In local currency, Mexico experienced a solid quarter. However, Mexico's profit in U.S. dollars declined, given the decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar. As our peso financial results are converted to U.S. dollars on an average rate over the quarter, we continued to experience headwinds to our net earnings as a result. Based on exchange rate differences this year to last, we experienced another significant headwind to earnings per share.","Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 2.5% over last year's third quarter. So, it got sequential improvement each quarter since the start of the year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and E-Commerce businesses which include AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. This compares to being down 3% last quarter and reflects stronger performance in AutoZone.com's business for Q3.","Also as I previously mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in our buy online pick up in store sales. This strength in pickup in store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience. Pick-up in store, while smaller than home delivery, continues to increase in sales volume. We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase and our E-Commerce platform represents an important part of our omni-channel experience.","We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and on how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us and less than 5% of our total sales, the omni-channel experience is important and we will continue to invest in our E-Commerce platform.","With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are quite low, miles driven continue to increase. The lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend remains encouraging.","Regarding our expectation for the remainder of 2017, we expect sales performance to improve in Q4 as trends began to improve in April and May. As we exit a disappointing performance from both our Q2 and Q3 results, we remain committed to focusing on the short and the long term.","Let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2017: Yes! We've Got It. The key priorities for the year are, one, great people providing great service; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, Yes! We've Got It; and five, leveraging IT.","On the retail front, this past quarter, under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We are focusing on enhanced training to store-level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the Yes! We've Got It theme.","We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all our businesses. The focus is on making sure AutoZoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization, not just their store, swiftly and accurately.","Many have the question how susceptible our industry is to online encroachment, and how bigger the role that is playing in this current industry soft spot. Currently every sector of retail has been and likely will continue to be impacted by this new rule. We have certainly studied the ramifications and continue to do so. While some portions that our industry has migrated in part to online we believe that the trustworthy advice elements combined with the sense of immediacy insulates us more than most sectors of retail and over time today that has certainly proven to be the case. As we assess this, we consider the needs of our customers. When their car loan start and they need to go to work, they can't wait hours or days. When they don\u2019t know what is wrong, they can't afford to purchase multiple products. They rely on us to help them isolate the problem. Our commercial customers have to immediately turn their base because time is money. We believe and are committed to leveraging the power of the digital world to further enhance our unique value proposition and we believe we will continue to succeed.","We have seen the current industry sales challenges as being broad-based categorically and more pronounced in certain geographies. Why would that had happened quickly in the later part of January outside of the promotional holiday season and have subsided in April. Our sense is that industry weakness was due to tax reform delays and a second consecutive mild winter.","In regards to commercial, we opened 56 net new programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 95 programs in Q4 of 2017. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our commercial sales performance for the quarter was below our expectations. As with retail, commercial sales improved the last seven weeks of the quarter and were weaker in the Northeast, Mid-West and Mid-Atlantic markets.","Our sales growth has decelerated in the last several quarters. Some of the deceleration, as we have previously discussed, has been the result of slower growth in new programs and less maturation of stores opened in recent years. But, we haven't been pleased with our level of growth. So, we have recently embarked on a new strategic planning exercise focused solely on how we can profitably accelerate our market share growth in this very important sector of our industry. We are quite pleased with tripling our sales and more than tripling our profitability in this business in the last nine years. But, what got us to this level won\u2019t necessarily get us to the next level. So, we are going to take an objective look at our approach for the next several months. We will continue to push for current performance but simultaneously explore other possibilities. This continues to be the most significant mid-term growth opportunity as we currently have approximately 3% market share, and we are determined to substantially enhance that over time.","We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our third quarter at 30.5%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team's efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers' wants, needs and desires. We remain bullish on our future performance because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles.","Bill Giles","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about retail, commercial, and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores, and our 26 IMC branches, increased 1.1%.","For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,768,000. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 3.6% and the third quarter commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $17 million over last year's third quarter.","This past quarter, we opened 56 net new programs versus 46 programs opened in our third quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,493 stores, or 83% of our domestic stores, supported by 184 hub stores; approximately 900 of our programs are three years old or younger. In 2017, we expect to open approximately 200 new programs.","While our trends slowed during third quarter, our April and May sales were in line with our results from earlier this year, which while not meeting our aspirations, is morning encouraging in our trends in February and March. We remain focused on having a great sales team, supplement with strong engagement of our store managers and district managers. We remain confident we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers and we\u2019re encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel we can further grow sales. And as Bill previously mentioned, while we think our strategy has worked very well over the last nine years, we want to take a first objective look over the next several months. Whether anything material change, we don\u2019t know, but we do know, we will likely implement some tests to continue to learn how best we service our customers and further penetrate this large sector of our industry.","Our Mexico stores continued to perform well on local currency basis. We opened eight new stores during the third quarter. At the end of the quarter, we have 499 stores in Mexico. We expect to open approximately 40 new net stores this year and next. As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales and base currency were above plan this quarter, the devaluation in the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. This has created a headwind and our EPS was significantly impacted. We do believe the Mexico leadership team has done an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business.","Regarding Brazil, we opened no new stores and currently are operating nine stores. Our plans are to grow between 20 and 25 total stores over the next few years. And while sales growth has been very encouraging, we continue to refine our business model to make sure that it works for us financially.","Gross margin for the quarter was 52.6% of sales, down 21 basis points. The decrease in gross margin was attributable to higher supply chain costs associated with the current year inventory initiatives and higher inventory shrink results, partially offset by lower acquisition costs.","Compared to the prior year, we have incurred more costs related to our supply chain in support of inventory availability initiatives, along with rising shrink expense after several years of declining expenses. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.","SG&A for the quarter was 32.4% of sales, higher by 25 basis points from last year's third quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 32.4%, deleveraging by 25 basis points. As I mentioned, operating expenses as a percent of sales were higher than last year, primarily from fixed cost deleverage due to our comparable stores sales decline, higher sales insurance costs and increasing wage pressures, partially offset by favorability from last year's discrete legal charge and lower incentive compensation.","EBIT for the quarter was $530 million, down 1.3% last year's third quarter and our EBIT margin was 20.2%. Interest expense for the quarter was $35.7 million compared with $34.1 million in Q3 a year ago. As we completed a $600 million 10-year bond deal this past quarter, we're planning interest of $51 million in the fourth quarter versus $45.8 million last year's fourth quarter.","Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5,153 million or approximately $200 million more than last year's balance of $4,954 million. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy; and, share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was 32.8% versus last year's Q3 of 34.8%. I do want to take a moment and remind listeners of our first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard. The new standard requires us to recognize the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock auctions as a credit income tax expense on the P&L this past quarter, it lowered our tax rate 231 basis points. This accounting change also increases the diluted share count calculation.","Net income for the quarter was $331 million, up 1.3% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29 million was down 4.6% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $11.44, up 6.2% over the prior year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned change in accounting for stock option exercises, our EPS would have increased by 3.2% for the quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement, for the third fiscal quarter, we generated $445 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 7.9% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled about $142 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 45 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters, and initial investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,381 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 499 stores in Mexico, and nine in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,889. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,915.","Depreciation totaled $75,300,000 for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $68,500,000. This is generally in line with the recent quarter growth rates.","We repurchased $284 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter and, at quarter-end, we had $1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.6 times at quarter-end. Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. Company's inventory increased 7% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new store openings, our ongoing inventory initiatives during the fiscal year and lower sales performance and plans. Inventory per location was $653,000 versus $629,000 last year, and $665,000 just this past quarter.","Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $47,000 versus a negative $69,000 last year, and a negative $36,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 107.2%.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 30.5%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes","Thanks Bill. This quarter we reported our second consecutive quarter of challenged sales and profitability performance following 41 quarters of double-digit growth and EPS. Clearly, some of our recent challenges have been macro like timing of IRS refunds, rising wages and interest rates and peso weakness, but macro challenges and benefits come and go. We also have some areas where we need to improve our performance and that is where our attention is focused, determining the right frequency of delivery to our stores from a cost benefit perspective; figuring out why our shrink results deteriorated and correcting those efforts; reaccelerating our sales in both retail and in particular in commercials; finding new ways to leverage our most important asset, our AutoZoners in an accelerating wage environment where personal touch and trustworthy advice really matter and differentiate us. While we are disappointed our recent performance as a Company and as a team, we have been through both periods of difficulty and periods of tremendous success.","Over any extended period, our Company successes have been remarkable. While we need to challenge ourselves, our decisions, processes and strategies, we also need to remember our tremendous record of success and reinforce some of our guiding principles; evolution over revolution and superior execution with consistent strategy is a winning formula. Simultaneously as we are faced with more difficult circumstances, we must step back and take a more objective view of what is working and what may not be. As we are in that stage, we see so many things that our team continues to do exceptionally well. But we also see some areas of opportunities, more areas from accelerated experimentation.","After so many years of unprecedented performance, I am proud of our team for their steadfast commitment to our culture, strategy and approach and for their dissatisfaction with our current performance. Having exceptional that executes extremely well, our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach to levering our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge.","We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Our customers have choices; we must exceed their expectations in what the way they choose to shop with us. We are fortunate to operate in one of the strongest retail segments and we continue to be excited about our industry's growth prospects for 2017 and beyond.","As consumers continually look to save money while taking care of their cars, we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice that they expect. It truly is the value-add that differentiates us from any other faceless transactions. Customers have come to expect that advice from us. It is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our website and in-store experience to provide even more knowledgeable service. We don't ever expect an online experience to replace the advice our customers want, but today's customers do expect more information on repairing their vehicles. This aspect of service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone, and it will be long into the future.","Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last 38 years and we continue to be excited about our future.","Now, I'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instruction] The first question comes from the line of Mr. Alan Rifkin from BTIG. Your line is now open, sir.","Alan Rifkin","Question for Bill Rhodes, starting with respect to the comps, I appreciate all the color that you have described throughout the quarter but Bill, can you segregate the impact of the tax refund versus the weather on the quarter overall? And can you also talk about the comp performance of the stores that is supported by the mega hubs versus the stores that are not? Then I have a follow-up please.","Bill Rhodes","Okay. Regarding separating the comps between the weather and the tax refund, it's really difficult to do that Alan. I wish I can give you more clarity. I would like to go on little more detail on the tax refund. As we mentioned on our last call, we fully expect that those refunds have been shifted later in the cycle and we would actually see a benefit from those in Q3. For whatever reason that we don\u2019t quite understand, those refund dollars never seem to show up. I don\u2019t know -- if I went to say things, [ph] you hear some of that; as I go to remittances to Mexico, did they show up in other sectors in retail or other sectors of economy, we don\u2019t know. But it does not appear that they came into our sector in any meaningful way. And we\u2019ve watched it very closely and we have monthly reporting on market share from two different sources and both of those sources continue to show that our market share gains were very similar throughout this period of time. We just had an eight-week period, three weeks in last quarter and five weeks in this quarter, we were just significantly impacted; it was kind of like when the calendar turned in April, things went back to normal like they were in the fall and early winter.","Regarding the mega hubs, we continue to see that it provides a benefit when our store get turned on to it, very significant benefit, 1% to 1.5% range when they get fully turned on to full service out of mega hubs. ","Alan Rifkin","And my follow-up, if I may, your decision to increase your operating expense obviously is well documented. But certainly, when you started to do that, I don\u2019t believe you foresaw the difficulty in the environment. What is your ability and willingness going forward, if sales continue to be a little bit below your plan; what is your willingness to cut back on some of the discretionary spending and expenses [technical difficult]?","Bill Rhodes","I think there are several things in that question, Alan. First of all, as we increase this investment profile, not only the sales get weaker but several of the things that have been industry tailwinds and our financials are macro tailwinds and our financials turned against this, so it was a little bit of a double whammy. As we look at it going forward, yes, we're going to change our cost structure where we can. The biggest question we\u2019re focused on right now is, we think there is some opportunities to decrease the multiple frequency of deliveries that we\u2019ve rolled out over the last couple of years. Unfortunately, we've not been able to quantifiably see that we're getting a sufficient benefit out of that. So, we're going to continue to test and take some of these stores down to two times a week, we can set a three times a week and hopefully make a final decision in the next six months or so on where we will be long-term. We will pull back some of those costs. What we won\u2019t do is pulling [ph] back cost at the point we're not providing great service to our customers. We're in this for the long-term and sometimes we're going to have periods of little bit weakness and sometimes going to have great periods of strength. We\u2019ve got to manage this business for the long-term.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simeon Gutman","Bill, you mentioned that the last seven weeks were up 2%, can you share with us if that 2% run rate was relatively uniform during the period, or volatile? And then, related to that, is the run rate that you are seeing today, because you did mention May, does that -- do you feel like it resolved the debate, whether the industry is healthy, there was just a bunch of noise? I mean how do you know there is just some pent up demand that\u2019s being realized in the late part of last quarter and early part of this quarter?","Bill Rhodes","Great questions, Simeon. When we talked about May, we were talking about May that we was still in the same part of our portal. As we think about the sales environment, what we noticed was there was a very distinct eight-week period of time where it acted very differently. Go back to the fall, September through mid-January, it was pretty consistent. Now, we have fluctuations week-to-week and you asked about in April that we see fluctuations. Of course, we do because the weather patterns in April are so different. But the expectations week to week based upon the weather that we were experiencing was more consistent with our expectations. That was not the case in that February to March period of time.","Simeon Gutman","I guess looking back at the last, I don\u2019t know, a year, it feels like the industry has become a little less consistent, maybe a little less predictable. Looking back at it, do you feel like it\u2019s explainable by a bunch of these small things or relatively large things? And you mentioned, you are requisitioning a lot of things and some of it is strategic but on the industry as a macro, can you share with us what your requisitioning, what we should be thinking through just given some of the bumps that this industry, which is not normally used to it has experienced over the last year or so?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, that\u2019s a great question. So, as I think about the industry sales environment and when I think about AutoZone\u2019s sales performance over the last year as compared to other years, we have come off to very, very mild winters. I have mentioned it in the prepared remarks, what we have experienced over of two year period of time in the Northeast, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic is alarming. I don\u2019t think that has anything to be with what's going on in those markets. I think it has to do with what's going on with the weather pattern. We can see it in specific categories that are very related to snow, ice, salt potholes, mainly under car items. So, I think very strong as that has as impacted our industry's performance. And then, this whole tax refund thing, this year, it was just a tremendous anomaly. I can't explain it; I don\u2019t know where those dollars went but that has been such a big driver of our industry sales over the last five or six years and it just went away this year, it was non-existent.","And the other thing on AutoZone\u2019s front is our commercial sales are decelerated. They decelerated because we were doing a lot of things on opening new programs and our sales were benefiting from that. As we\u2019ve gotten further down that maturation, we hadn\u2019t had [ph] the same benefit from those. But we continue to gain market share in both retail and commercial. We believe the sales environment is going to continue to be pretty strong.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Steven Forbes","Given the dichotomy of the P&L impact, you mentioned right between the mega hub rollout and as compared to frequency delivery rollout both top and bottom line, if you decide to further slow down the rollout of the frequency initiative, does that free up resources to ramp in mega hub initiatives or is the bottleneck really finding real estate? Just give us some color on the urgency around that initiative, given the potential benefit and just the business restrains relating to rollout of it.","Bill Rhodes","It has such a good blend, Steven. We feel really good about the mega hubs and the results that we have had. And you are spot on that there are some real estate constrains relative to our ability to open up more and more mega hubs. You will see us continue to open up mega hubs and the speed at which that we open them up will be somewhat contingent upon finding the right available real estate in order to do that from more frequent delivery standpoint. Look, we are an analytically driven company, and if we do not see the benefits from the investments that we are making, we are going to make adjustments to that. So from that perspective, yes, we believe that we will basically reduce expenses from that perspective in the future as we make adjustments to that.","Steven Forbes","And then, maybe a follow-up on the frequency of delivery rates. Have you identified which stores will revert, if so, back to the two times or one time for weak delivery? And then, maybe just touch on what parameters are going to drive that decision? I would imagine it's not simply just sales, right, given the service aspect of the business; I would imagine competition may play a role in a decision. Just maybe you could touch on some of the parameters that are going to drive that decision process?","Bill Rhodes","Yes, that\u2019s a host of those things but frankly you have hit on the right one, sales can be a big driver, distance, number of stores on a route et cetera. So there will be a number of factors there. But sales are going to be heavily weighted, because again we have adequate return on the investment dollars that we are putting forth and right now we don\u2019t believe that we are not going to make adjustments to it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matt Fassler","My first question relates to your thought process on the economics of some the investments that you necessarily -- you might want to pull back. What's the ROI, the financial ROI calculation that you have done to determine whether it works for you? And if you do back away, where would we see some of the investment, would it be gross margin, SG&A, CapEx et cetera?","Bill Giles","Yes. Matt, it's not as much an ROI calculation because the capital that we are deploying to do this is not that significant. We are opening these two distribution centers, not because of multiple frequency of delivery, but because we need an incremental distribution capacity. But this is more about how are we going to -- better than a breakeven on the sales environment for the operating expense increases that we have experienced. So, the vast majority of the difference will be seen in gross margins; there will be a little bit of it in the SG&A but most of it will be in gross margins.","Matt Fassler","Is that a function of the frequency of truck runs diminishing and consequently the supply chain cost coming down?","Bill Giles","Yes, it's predominantly supply chain; it's truck runs but it's also extra tours to the distribution centers, so labor in the DCs.","Matt Fassler","And do you feel like there is any -- I mean obviously there is a trade off, do you feel like there has been some sales benefits to you from this that would dissipate or do you feel like it hasn\u2019t really moved the needle?","Bill Rhodes","I think there has been some very minor improvements in sales which would go away, but it's not material, unfortunately. If it was, we continue to do it. And I want to be careful here. We have not made final decisions. This is a very complicated analysis to do. So, we are still doing some work over the next several months to figure out what the right frequency for us is. One of the things we are realizing is that many years ago in our hub stores, we started doing kind of feeder replenishment out of those stores to the outlined store that they service and so that\u2019s one of the reason we are not getting the same kind of benefits out of the multiple frequency of delivery. We were already [indiscernible] highest probability SKUs that we sell; so that benefit didn\u2019t exists for us.","Matt Fassler","And then, my second question, speaking about what changed this quarter, if we look at sales per store or kind of back into comp, DIY didn\u2019t really decelerate, almost all of the deceleration related to commercial. How should we dimensionalize that as you think about both the macro factors you discussed related to taxes and whether -- and also to some of the changes in investment posture they have for that space? And do you agree with my read of the numbers by the way?","Bill Rhodes","I agree with your read of the numbers versus last quarter but you remember, last quarter got killed at the end, particularly DIY. So, I think both businesses have been impacted during that eight-week period of time pretty significantly. And our commercial business has decelerated more than we would have expected. By the way that\u2019s why we're going back and taken another strategic look at commercial. I'm really excited about what we're going to be doing. It\u2019s going to take us some time but we're going to take a fresh look at what we\u2019re doing in commercial and what are our long-term strategies there. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Seth Sigman","My first question is around the international performance; just wondering if you could quantify the impact from FX and also the impact from results in Mexico and how those may have underperformed.. And just as you think about the state of that business, are there adjustments that you're making or any signs of stabilization there?","Bill Giles","I would say, the core base business continues to do well, if you just look at it on a local currency basis, the business continues to perform strong. We're very pleased with what the team has done down there et cetera; from a foreign currency exchange impact on our EPS growth rate, it is probably a little less than 1% of an impact from a growth rate prospective. So, it continues to be a bit of a headwind. So, for us, it\u2019s really about the exchange rate; there is not a lot of strategies that we're necessary going to change. We feel pretty good about the position of Mexico, we're excited about 500th store opening as Bill mentioned earlier. So that business continues to go well but hopefully the peso will turn around a little bit in future.","Seth Sigman","And then regarding the gross margin, if you back out the supply chain impact and the shrink impact this quarter, it still says that the benefit from lower acquisition cost would be less than prior quarters. So, when you peel back to gross margin, can you just give us a sense of what some of the underlying drivers are there?","Bill Giles","Yes. I would say actually we feel really good about what the merchandising organization has done relative to continuing to find opportunities to lower acquisition costs. We mentioned a couple of quarters ago about our activity around direct importing and we continue to increase that. So, the team has done a nice job there, continuing to increase that. So, I feel really good about the health of the gross margin rate today and going forward. It may be a little bit less but it\u2019s still very healthy and it\u2019s very well positioned. So, we have a couple of very identifiable expense items that are putting some headwind on gross margin, both of which we believe are just near-term headwinds and we will be able to work our way through those. But lowering acquisition costs is something that we think is there for a while.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Lasser","Bill Rhodes, what do you think the long run rate or the comp of this business is? Is it materially different than what has been in the past, especially you're going to come up against the much easier comparison you are running at 2% comp or so right now, shouldn\u2019t it be better than the 2% as you anniversary some of the easier trends that you saw last year?","Bill Rhodes","I don\u2019t want to get into what's going to happen as we go into individual quarter comparisons but I'll go into what your original question is. What has changed with the macro outlook for sales in this industry over the long term? I would answer that absolutely nothing. We had an eight-week period of time, which we believe we can very easily attribute to the tax refund delays and two mild winters. But I don\u2019t see anything else in this industry that has changed really at all.","Michael Lasser","Based on that comment, do you think a 2% run rate is still a realistic long-term expectation, reasonable expectation of business, if nothing changed? [Ph]","Bill Rhodes","Again, I don\u2019t want to get into giving guidance. What I'll tell you is I think the industry performance over the long term has not changed by any significant level. And the one challenge that we have in our sales performance compared to what it's been over the last five years is that our commercial business is not growing at the same rate that it was growing before as we opened all those new programs. We have to take that on and we have to find ways to accelerate the market share gains that we are already getting in commercial. And that will be a critical element of our story over time.","Michael Lasser","And my follow-up question is you are making a lot of tweaks of your delivery, availability and frequency, and replenishment, do you think if you were to lower prices, your sales would increase?","Bill Rhodes","I have been in this business for 22 years. I can't add up five times without seeing lower prices lead to higher sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.","Seth Basham","My first question is just on your long-term growth algorithm, Bill. You previously stated the mid single digit EBIT growth and double digit EPS growth, is that still how you see about the business?","Bill Rhodes","I think over the long term, we would -- that would be -- continue to be our goal. I did highlight, in the short-term, we have a disproportionate amount of things, some of which are decisions we have made or things we have done to ourselves and some of them are kind of a disproportionate amount of macros things that are current and are headwinds for us. I think in the intermediate term, we have some more challenges to get to those numbers. Over the long-term, particularly if we are able to reaccelerate our commercial business, that will continue to be our goals and aspirations.","Seth Basham","And then secondly, my follow-up question is drawing inventory per store. We have seen a rise in that mix for the last couple of quarters. Are you comfortable with the levels you are at; do you expect to see some declines going forward? How should we be thinking about that and the potential impact down the road on margins and sales?","Bill Giles","I think as we move forward, we expect that number to hang where it is little bit, maybe come down a little. You saw that came down consecutively from last quarter on a per store basis. So, inventory levels are little bit higher than we would have desired; some of that was sales related; some of that also is some of the activities that have relative to opening up mega hubs, direct import activity et cetera. So, some of that is for good reasons. But, we expect it to moderate going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ms. Kate McShane from Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Kate McShane","With regards to the comps, there are other macro factors; it seems like less improvement in the unemployment rate and slightly higher gas prices year-over-year. Just wanted to see what your perspective was on those impacts to the overall comp? And I may have missed in prepared comments but just talk a little bit about traffics into your stores and how that\u2019s changed over the last couple of quarters?","Bill Rhodes","Okay. Regarding those macro trends that you talked about, regarding unemployment and increased gas prices, the only time we\u2019ve really seen unemployment be a key driver of our performance is when it has been significant increases like during the great recession. And for whatever reason that seems to be a driver of our business rather detractor of our business. On gas prices, clearly, we want them to be as low as possible. But the only time we\u2019ve really seen -- or call them out as material contributors to our success or headwinds for us, have been when they really got up around $4 a gallon. So, I don\u2019t think we believe move from 2 to 250 is going to make any significant difference on our performance.","Regarding traffic, clearly our traffic was down this quarter, particularly on the retail side of the business, it was one of the softer quarters that we have had. It has not performed any different than it has over the long term during this April period of time, in order it perform any differently in the fall. We do have an industry -- as an industry, our long term challenge was traffic going down but at the same time cost of products going up as the quality improves on the products that we sell, we have been doing that last 20 years.","Kate McShane","Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","All right. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I just like to wish everyone a nice Memorial Day weekend and thank you everyone that have served in our process. [Ph] But we are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything from granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.

Rhodes","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2013 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.","Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another very solid quarter and year. 2013 was a very busy and productive year for us. We reached 2 amazing milestones in our company's history. First, we surpassed $9 billion in sales, finishing at $9.1 billion. Second, we crossed $2 billion in EBITDA, another amazing milestone, placing us an elite company across retail. AutoZoners past and present built this business through hard work, passion for customer service and dedication, and we owe them a great deal of gratitude.","We've been growing our business on a variety of fronts. Our U.S. Retail business expanded again in 2013 with the opening of another 153 new stores. Our Commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 12.6% for the year, with 368 net new programs opened. We now have the commercial program in 71% of our domestic stores, having opened 762 new programs in just the past 2 years.","We continue to expand our presence in Mexico, and we've opened stores in Brazil with 3 stores now in operation. We are expanding our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com websites, and we acquired AutoAnything in fiscal 2013.","Along with these strategic investments, we spend a lot of time on our core domestic Retail business. Our DIY business is by far the largest portion of our sales, and it is very profitable. We continue to see significant opportunities for new store growth, improved productivity in existing stores and enhancements to our profitability. This continues to be our #1 priority.","As our Commercial business continues to grow, and it is intertwined with our Retail operations, we've studied our distribution model closely. The research we've done has led us to make some changes. We've determined over time that our hub stores, our larger market-centric stores, require additional inventory.","Back in 2007, we would have said our hubs should be able to support surrounding stores with, on average, an additional 20,000 hard part SKUs. Our research indicates that in many instances, that isn't sufficient. We are being more aggressive with inventory assortments in our hub stores today than in the past. And due to our recent efforts on expanding the size and improving the location of our hubs, we have positioned ourselves to accommodate those larger offerings.","In addition to these increases in hub store inventory levels, we are also embarking on tests to substantially increase product availability in all stores. Those tests are just beginning, and while we are certain some of the changes won't provide us with acceptable returns, we are confident we will find opportunities to further enhance our same-day inventory availability.","Historically, our approach is one of idea generation, strategic assessment and then testing. While all of our tests aren't a success, many of them have developed into key long-term strategies. Our hubs in the new commercial strategy rolled out in recent years are 2 very good examples. We carefully analyze all of our tests to ensure we are achieving the desired results.","We must continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, and we must ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. That means we must have a high degree of confidence in our plans before executing on a broad basis.","This week, in Memphis, we are hosting our national sales meeting all week. And again, during my address to the team tomorrow, we are introducing the idea of creating customers for life. We've always been focused on creating customers for life, but that will be our annual operating theme this year in order to intensify our focus on it.","We've made significant systems investments and enhancements this past year in order to capture data about our customer's shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to toggle between the store experience and the online experience in order to meet our customer's needs.","We have significant additional work in front of us, but the national sales meeting this week, we are introducing a new version of Z-net that will begin leveraging this information. This enhanced system provides our team with additional tools that will allow them to provide our customers with better trustworthy advice and more effectively and efficiently ensure that every customer has what they need to do the job right the first time. This system will be rolling out to our stores over the course of the first quarter.","We have a very exciting year planned in 2014. I can confidently say we feel the actions we have taken and the investments we've made in 2013 position us to grow sales in 2014 across all of our lines of business. While 2013 was a solid earnings year for our company, flat same-store sales for the year was disappointing.","There were many factors that influenced our sales performance in 2013, but the bottom line is we didn't meet our goals or aspirations and that's on us. It is time to grow sales in 2014. I can promise you, our game plan is well developed for the new year and our goal is to grow market share in 2014 while continuing to deliver solid earnings.","Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales increased 12% and, on a comparable 16-week basis, they were up 5.6%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 1.0% on a comparable 16-week basis.","While we spent time the last few quarters talking about how the Northeast and Midwestern markets materially underperformed the remaining domestic stores, that was not the story this past quarter. Regionally, the Northeast performed better than the overall chain. However, our Midwestern states' performance was still lagging, albeit to a lesser degree. Also, we saw our maintenance-related sales accelerate this past quarter while their sales basically finishing on plan.","From our perspective, the most important takeaways from the quarter were, first, certain failure-related merchandise categories underperformed this past quarter due, in our belief, to mild summer weather across most of the eastern United States. In particular, our air conditioning and battery businesses in this section of the country underperformed.","Normally, we over-index in these categories during the summer months. In fairness, the last 2 summers had record-setting heat across most of the U.S. This year, it was milder.","Second, this quarter, we had slower growth in our average DIY ticket versus last year. The lack of growth in our ticket was due to difficult comparisons in a select group of categories from the previous year. Inflation and producer prices was flat this past year and we haven't experienced nearly the same level of commodity-based inflation as we have in recent years. Therefore, our pricing at Retail was basically flat. We believe this trend will continue at least through the first quarter as pricing from our manufacturers has remained consistent.","Third and encouragingly, our customer count trends improved significantly in Q4. While they were still negative on the quarter, we noticed a nice trend across certain non-weather-related merchandise categories and across the country.","Fourth, we opened 173 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 107 programs last year. This acceleration in openings during the quarter allowed us to open 368 net new programs for the full year, reaching 71% of our domestic store base.","To put our growth in this business in perspective, at the end of 2010, we reported $880 million in sales compared to $1.46 billion in 2013, up 66% in 3 years.","And lastly, the capital allocation and earnings model for our company remains strong and intact. Our ability to effectively manage this business in good sales environments and not so good has allowed us to deliver 28 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. That consistently -- that consistency allows us to be shareholder-friendly through continual earnings growth and bondholder-friendly through a targeted investment-grade rating and financial transparency.","We are excited about our opportunities to grow our business in both this quarter and future periods. We continue to manage this business for both short-term and long-term optimum performance.","We continue to execute on our strategy to improve the customer shopping experience. We expanded 10 net additional hub locations during the quarter, take our total remodeled hubs to 92 locations. These remodels entail expanding the size and capacity of these locations, ensuring they're in the right physical location and adding additional inventory into the market that benefits both our Retail and Commercial businesses. We also opened 1 new hub location, finishing with 155.","Lastly, I'd like to address the cadence of our same-store sales performance during this past quarter. In total, performance was generally consistent throughout the quarter, slightly stronger at the beginning of the quarter than the end. August was the weakest performing period for us, but we saw the results most challenged in regions that experienced cooler weather relative to last year. This was particularly evident in those categories I mentioned earlier, air conditioning and batteries.","Overall, we have been encouraged by customer count trends and we believe the initiatives we have in place will allow us to gain share in both Retail and Commercial.","As our sales results weren't meeting our expectations during 2013, we performed some extensive strategic assessments. We learned a great deal as a result of this work and we have accelerated the number of tests across the organization. I mentioned the expanded hub assortments earlier. These tests will take time to implement and evaluate, but many of them are in market today.","We've completed one of those tests and are implementing it currently. This test was a refinement to our individual store inventory assortment methodology. We are leveraging more data than ever before, which allows us to have better store level product assortments. We are rolling this out by category and it will take about a year to complete. As is customary for us, we will continue to learn from our initiatives and roll out those that make sense financially.","As previously mentioned, this quarter's results marked our 28th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. We're very pleased with our ability to consistently deliver strong EPS growth through our financial model of steady mid-single-digit EBIT dollar growth or better, along with high single-digit reductions in diluted share count through our share repurchases.","Our goal quarter-over-quarter continues to be to provide consistency to our shareholders, our AutoZoners and our customers. We feel this targeted consistency in both financial performance, as well as execution of our key initiatives, results in stability and confidence for all of our key constituents.","Next, I'd like to discuss our sales results for this past quarter in more detail. Our sales were up 12% for the full quarter and 5.6% on a 16-week basis. And our sales -- our same-store sales were up 1%. This quarter's same-store sales results compare to last year's fourth quarter comps of 2.1%.","I should point out that our total Commercial sales were up 17% over last year's fourth quarter and 11% on a 16-week basis, driven by a combination of existing program growth and the addition of 368 net new programs over the trailing 12 months.","Over time, we do expect to open more hub locations, but we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level. Our strategy is a steady one. Everyone's model is a little different. Our goal is to say, \"yes,\" more and more frequently in an economically prudent manner.","Regarding Mexico, we opened 21 stores this quarter and finished with 362 stores. Sales in our other businesses achieved very solid sales results. Our ALLDATA and E-Commerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, continued to perform well, increasing 93.6% over last year.","The significant increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of AutoAnything, which we acquired during Q2 of this fiscal year. There are great opportunities for E-Commerce sales growth on both a business-to-business basis and to individual customers or B2C. While these businesses are relatively small for us at just 3.5% of our total sales mix on the quarter, we are experimenting to understand where the most potential exists.","At year end, because of the long-term importance of this customer base and the integrated nature of our online and offline, we have decided to change the reporting on how we calculate our domestic same-store sales. Starting this fourth quarter, we have included our autozone.com business into our same-store sales calculation.","The change is not significant. However, we felt this change was warranted as autozone.com complements our store walk-in business. Again, this change only affects our autozone.com sales and excludes the sales generated from AutoAnything. Our objective is to provide exceptional service to all of our customers regardless of how they interact with us and we believe that leveraging the Internet is a powerful tool to meet their needs, whether they are researching their purchase prior to visiting a store or having their products delivered straight to their home.","With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past 2 years, we have seen those traded-in vehicles be resold to new owners who are repairing or enhancing their \"new vehicle.\"","With gas prices flat year-over-year this -- well, this last fourth quarter, we see miles driven flat as well. Historically, a healthier economy has led to more miles being driven. We expect that trend to reemerge.","We remain bullish on our industry sales growth opportunities on both the retail and commercial fronts over the long term. As the vehicle population remains at an all-time high and consumers continue to look for good values while maintaining their vehicles, we see AutoZone's opportunity to sell to these customers only growing.","Now let me review our highlights regarding the execution of our operating theme for 2013, 1TEAM Delivering WOW!.","The key priorities for the year were: Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our Commercial business, leveraging the Internet, hub store improvements and finally, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies.","On the Retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We have dedicated great resources to training our AutoZoners on customer service and we feel we continue to do a great job differentiating ourselves on this front.","The fifth key priority on leveraging technology was new this year. As previously mentioned, the enhancements to improve the information available to our AutoZoners at the point of sale while also making them more efficient are in process and we look forward to updating you on the results in upcoming conference calls.","We put a great focus on innovation and leveraging information technology to improve customer service and optimize efficiencies. Behind the scenes, we have reset our expectations on technology investment and challenged ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms.","We realize, as customers have become much more tech and mobile-savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.","In regards to Commercial, we opened 173 programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 368 versus 394 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open a generally consistent amount of new programs in future years.","The reacceleration of program openings during the fourth quarter was due to our increased confidence in our model due to the performance of our extensive new programs opened over the last couple of years. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will only grow.","Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish 2013 at 32.7%. While slightly below last year's ending ROIC, excluding the acquisition of AutoAnything, we would have been slightly higher than last year. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retail.","However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investor's capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about the financial results, I'd like to thank and state how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage this business appropriately and prudently. We have an amazing team and our initiatives for 2014 are really exciting. We are ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers and we are ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structure, providing our shareholders with the consistency we have exhibited in the past.","Now here's Bill.","William T. Giles","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and international results for the quarter.","For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our 3 stores in Brazil, increased 10.3% on a 17-week basis. During the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.54 a gallon and ended the quarter at $3.61 a gallon, a $0.07 increase.","Now last year, gas prices decreased $0.01 per gallon during the fourth quarter, starting at $3.79 a gallon and ending at $3.78. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customer's ability to maintain their vehicles and we will continue to monitor prices closely in the future.","We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven were basically flat for the quarter through the last month recorded, which is June. The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-old and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.","Another key macro issue facing our customers today is the reinstitution of payroll taxes back to historic norms. This reduction in our customers' take-home pay began at the beginning of the new calendar year and at this point, it has been difficult to objectively quantify the ramifications of this change. However, we believe this is and will continue throughout the year to be a headwind to our consumers' spending habits.","For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales for auto parts stores was $1.7 million. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.","For the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 17.3%. On a comparable basis, Commercial sales increased 11%. For the fourth quarter, Commercial represented 16.4% of our total sales and grew $75 million over last year's Q4. Last year's Commercial sales mix percent was 15.6%.","As we have said previously, overall, we've been pleased with the progress we are making in our Commercial business, both operationally and financially, and we remain on track with our plans. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings and, therefore, we are optimistic about the future of this business.","We continue to believe we can grow revenues in existing stores and we will continue to open additional commercial programs. This past quarter, we opened 173 new programs versus 107 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year.","We now have our commercial program in 3,421 stores supported by 155 hub stores. Approximately 1,000 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. With only 71% of our domestic stores having a commercial program and our average revenue per program materially below several of our competitors, we believe there is ample opportunity for additional program growth in addition to improved productivity opportunities in current programs.","While we recognize that our Commercial sales productivity per program is well below our peers, we believe the maturation of our marketing programs plus the inventory assortment additions we are making will allow us to close the gap.","As we look forward, we're focused on building upon the commercial initiatives that have been in place for the last few years. We have a very talented sales force and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of this sales force. And we've increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. We will continue to test additional enhancements to our offerings and distribution model in order to better serve customers.","In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our commercial programs, having opened almost 1,000 programs over the past 36 months. Effectively, 29% of the programs are 3 years old or younger. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share and we believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner. We continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.","Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 21 new stores during the fourth quarter and 41 for the full year. We currently have 362 stores in Mexico. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations.","Now regarding Brazil, we opened 2 stores in the quarter and have 3 stores opened at the end of the year. Our plans remain to open 10 to 15 stores over the next couple of years and then reevaluate our development as we refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. At that point, we will talk more on our long-term growth plans.","Recapping this quarter's performance for the company. In total, our sales were $3,095,000,000, an increase of 12% from last year's fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales, or sales for stores opened more than one year, were up 1% for the quarter.","Gross margin for the quarter was 51.8% of sales, flat compared to last year's fourth quarter. Now while flat, improvements in gross margin were attributable to lower acquisition costs, offset in part by the inclusion of the recent acquisition of AutoAnything. Gross margins are similar across both the 16-week and 17-week period.","In regards to inflation, we've seen a modest decrease in cost year-over-year. This is different than in past years. At this point, our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing headwind -- producer pricing heading into the calendar year and, therefore, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll take the appropriate adjustments should they arise.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both Retail and Commercial businesses. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our Commercial business has been the steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have not bothered to call out the headwind quarterly. It is an element of our business model and we understand we have to manage that headwind as the business grows.","Additionally, AutoAnything has been a slight drag on the gross margins as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.","SG&A for the quarter was 31.3% of sales, lower by 29 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was due in part to leverage gained on the 17th week of sales. I do want to take a moment to thank our entire team for their diligence on cost control, which has always been the key part of our corporate DNA. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.","EBIT or earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter was $636 million, up 13.6% over last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 20.6%, or up 29 basis points versus the previous year's fourth quarter.","Excluding the extra week, our EBIT was $596 million, up 6.5%. Interest expense for the quarter was $60.9 million compared with $58.1 million in Q4 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4 billion -- $4.1 billion, or approximately $420 million more than last year's balance of $3.7 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR.","While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.5%, flat with last year's fourth quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 37% on an ongoing basis as the deviation result is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items as they arise.","Net income for the quarter of $371 million was up 14.7% versus the prior year's fourth quarter. Excluding the extra week, net income was up 7.4% at $348 million. Our diluted share count of 35.6 million was down 6.9% from last year's fourth quarter.","The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $10.42, up 23.2% over the prior year's fourth quarter. And again, excluding the extra week, EPS was $9.76 a share, up 15.4% over last year's fourth quarter.","Relating to the cash flow statement for the fourth fiscal quarter, we generated $519 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $156 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 97 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels and work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2013, our CapEx was approximately $415 million. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,836 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 362 stores in Mexico; and 3 in Brazil for a total store count of 5,201 stores.","Depreciation totaled $71.3 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $66.7 million. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $560 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At year end, we had $468 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our leverage metric was 2.5x this past quarter. Again, I want to stress, we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating agency has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.","Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 116%.","Next, I'd like to update you on inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $2.9 billion, up 9% versus the Q4 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investments and coverage for select categories.","Inventory per store was up 4.8% at $550,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments and hard parts coverage. This per-store amount was up only slightly from Q3's $547,000 per store.","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 32.7%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.","Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","William C. Rhodes","Thank you, Bill. We're pleased to report our 28th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth and, for the year, to report an EPS growth rate of 18.3%, or 15.6% on a comparable 52-week basis. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. We focus on executing at a high level consistently, which we believe can be a competitive advantage.","To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.","Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2013. We were able to build on past accomplishments and deliver some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners, we grew both our Retail and Commercial businesses this past year. With this growth, we were able to achieve and surpass the $9 billion annual sales milestone.","We opened our first stores in Brazil. While in early stages of development, we couldn't be more excited about our opportunities in this highly populated country with lots of our kind of vehicles.","Third, we acquired AutoAnything in December of last year, providing us access to a second arguably best-in-class dot-com brand. Culturally, the 2 companies couldn't be a better fit. We look forward to learning from and growing our businesses together.","Both our inventory assortment testing and hub store remodels continue at an accelerated rate, and their benefit to the sales continue. We are talking more than ever about innovation. As the industry leader, it is imperative that we stay ahead, making sure every aspect of our offerings is improved, from inventory assortments to our Commercial offerings, to leveraging the power of information technology enhancements. We can leave no stone unturned.","At the end of the day, our customers have choices and we must innovate to ensure that they turn to us for their vehicle needs.","Again, we are very excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, Commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, E-Commerce and Brazil.","Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits.","We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief of solid consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success.","Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.","We are pleased, quite pleased, with our EPS growth and our return on invested capital for Q4 and we remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.","I can't wait to get back to our terrific leadership team this morning at our national sales meeting. This team is comprised of exceptional leaders. I can't thank them enough for all they do for our entire organization. We are launching our Creating Customers for Life theme and I know these leaders, combined with our talented team of more than 70,000-plus AutoZoners, will do just that.","Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Bill, looks like your Commercial sales per program, adjusting for the extra week, declined slightly in the year just ended. In the past, you've noted that AutoZone may be suffering from some diminishing returns in the new programs. It sounds like now there is an epiphany that perhaps the problem was more inventory coverage. Do you think the issue is that hubs are not as competitive as full line distribution centers operated by your competitors? Or are you indicating the problem is just the breadth of assortment in the hubs is the challenge?","William T. Giles","Let me just start by talking a little bit about -- Dan, I would say that we're happy with the productivity of the commercial programs, particularly the new programs. I think -- also, keep in mind that, as we mentioned, we've got -- probably almost 30% of our programs are 3 years old or less and we've opened close to 800 programs in just the last 2 years. So just given an overall maturation curve, you're going to see a little bit of depression on the productivity of the commercial programs taken as a whole. So I would say that we continue to be pretty pleased with the progress of the commercial programs overall. And I think from a hub perspective, we view that more as an evolution. When we added more inventory into those hubs, we recognized that, that was an opportunity and so this continues to evolve. We think there are real opportunities for us to add more inventory into the marketplace, continue to expand our coverage. As we've talked about in the past, we learned that as we added inventory for -- to help support the Commercial business by adding later model coverage, we found that, that actually helped the DIY business as well. And so we think there's better and more opportunity for us to leverage the existing infrastructure that we have out there at a higher rate than we have up to this point.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And you'd noted that the inventory per store is up a little more than 4% year-over-year, but that's about the same rate of growth in the prior quarter. Once you lay in these new inventory initiatives, how do you see that inventory per store rate increasing? And does that come at the expense of the amount of the share buybacks as you invest that cash in inventory instead of buybacks?","William T. Giles","Yes. And always keep in mind, our first priority is to be -- to driving EBIT and to drive return on invested capital. And so we will do what is financially viable. But to cut to your real -- answer to your real question is, yes, we anticipate that inventory on a per-store basis is going to increase likely over the next year or 2 as we continue to test more opportunities for us to increase inventory coverage in the marketplace. But again, as you know, our DNA is more of a test and then roll out where it's financially viable. So our expectation is that, yes, inventory on a per-store basis will continue to increase slightly over the next year or so and we'll just continue to manage that. Obviously, we hope that, that's going to continue to drive EBIT dollars or we wouldn't be doing it.","Operator","The next question is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A question for Bill. Bill, with the increased emphasis on adding inventory and hard parts in particular, how should we be thinking about the long-term effects on gross margin, given the fact that this category is, typically, above the corporate average?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, Alan. I'm not sure which Bill. Bill Rhodes will take this one at the start. If you want to hear from Giles, just ask for it. I think, generally, the gross margin differences between hard parts and sales for our categories, generally, are not that significantly different. So I think you won't see any material change in our gross margin rate as a result of being more aggressive in hard parts coverage.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. A question for Bill Giles. What was the effect of deflation on comps, if any?","William T. Giles","We haven't really quantified that overall, so I'd be guessing a little bit. But it was certainly probably over 1 point or so over the last couple of quarters. We really saw a fair amount of inflation through fiscal year '12, probably '11 and '12, which kind of helps quite a bit from a comp store sales comparison, if you will. But for fiscal year '13, we've begun to anniversary some pretty good increases in inflation and we're just not seeing that right now. And frankly, we're not seeing that on the horizon either. So we will be up against easier compares, but we will not necessarily have a tailwind on that. So I'd be guessing, Alan, but I'd give it probably that rough estimate.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And one more, if I may. In an effort to just try to quantify what the effect has been on your revenues of expanding the hubs, really looking at the 92 expanding hubs versus the 60-some-odd that are not, are the comps for the expense supported by the stores -- excuse me, are the comps for the stores supported by the expanded hubs significantly greater than the comps for the stores for the hubs that you have not yet expanded?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I would say they are definitely greater. Definition of significant, I'm not sure I would go there. But as you know, we would forecast what our expectations are for each one of those, both what the hub store, itself, is going to do, plus all the satellites that are attached to that hub store. And as we rolled all through those 92 stores, it has been remarkably close to what our expectation was. So we're quite pleased with them. And yes, they're performing better. And as we get the rest of them up, we anticipate that they'll perform better as well.","Operator","The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Credit Suisse.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can we elaborate a little bit or dig in on some of the initiatives that we talked about? I know hard parts is one of them. Then the test that was mentioned, is that separate and exclusive from the greater assortment? And is that test Commercial-focused or DIY-focused? I think you also mentioned Z-net enhancements. And any other current initiatives that are on plan for next year?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, Simeon. We went into some discussions about what we're doing on the inventory assortment front. We did some pretty significant strategic assessments back last winter and end of this spring. And as a result of that, we found some opportunities where we could -- where we believe we could significantly enhance our productivity. So starting in about May, we launched a variety of tests. Some of them are competing tests, but one of them is the mega hub or expanding our hubs even greater than we are today. One of them is what I talked about, a test where we took a large group of stores and used our latest and greatest thinking on the data and leveraging the data for inventory store-level assortments at every individual store. That test proved to work very well and so we are beginning to roll that one even as we speak. It will take about a year for -- because we're going to roll it off with category reviews. It will take about a year for it to get out there. But the vast majority of it should happen between now and February. So we're just trying a lot of different things. We're very excited. Some of them are going to work; some of them aren't going to work. As I mentioned, some of them are competing against each other. So we'll see what happens. It's a little too early to tell yet, but we're confident we found some opportunities to further enhance. The other part that you asked about was Z-net. As we mentioned, about a year ago, we added leveraging information technology as one of our key priorities. And our information technology team has gone to work really collaboratively, particularly with our store operations team, and we're very excited about what we're doing. We're just now, this week, introducing this new version of Z-net to our leaders at the national sales meeting and they are very excited about what they see. So we're excited about what we have in front of us.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just to follow up to something that Alan asked a second ago and I think this is implied in your comments but just wanted to make sure. The inventory that's been added to some of the hubs, or the expand that's been happening over the last year, that's what's increasing the productivity, meaning those SKUs are the ones that are increasing the productivity of those stores where you've added it?","William C. Rhodes","I would say the vast majority -- well, I would say the majority of the benefit is coming from those SKUs, but there's also a market basket effect. So if we have the radiator, we also get some of the ancillary parts that were already there that go with that radiator, if that makes sense.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, it does. And then one more bigger picture. If you look at the Commercial opportunity, we see and we hear the trade data of how fragmented the industry looks. But looking closer to your markets and I guess AutoZone is in almost every market, but looking at it on a more detailed level, can you give us a sense of the competition there? Are there these wholesale distributors that are still part of that fragmentation? Or are you budding up against the bigger, the larger players, the publics as well as the NAPAs and the CARQUEST?","William C. Rhodes","Now we are absolutely competing against a wide variety of competitors, from WDs to local jobbers to individual-owned stores to the people that are public that we always talk about.","William T. Giles","Yes. Keep in mind also, Simeon, we've got about a 3% market share. So we're in control of our own destiny.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Three quick ones, I think. First of all, if you could go into a little more detail as to the enhancements to Z-net, are they graphics? Is it reference information? Is it sort of next steps for associates to take with consumers? Because Z-net, obviously, when hit, will certainly -- gave you guys a different form factor and such. And I know some of your competitors have also enhanced their POS and their direct assistance. So can you tell us what you're doing here that you think will move the needle?","William T. Giles","I would say that on that, it's probably more reference, just to use your own terminology. I think that we're providing better information for the AutoZoners to provide better service on completing a job, maybe to your point on what the next steps are, et cetera. But for us, it's all about making sure that the customer gets exactly what they need to do the job right. And we believe that we're adding some enhancements, particularly for individual jobs, that will allow the AutoZoners to make sure that happens.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Any sense from your early tests of the kind of impact that, that can have where you introduced it?","William T. Giles","I would say it's really early. We tested it very lightly because it's more of a technology. It wasn't a significant investment. And then we're going to roll it out relatively quickly. So we'll see. It can only be a plus.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Second quick question. You talked about, in addition to inventory, talked about a couple of operating initiatives. How should we think about the costs of those initiatives? Are they incremental? Will they show up in any way? Or have they basically been absorbed already?","William T. Giles","I wouldn't say they've been absorbed because we haven't rolled out everything overall. So there's going to be some elements of it that are going to be relatively low cost, where we're going to be able to leverage our existing infrastructure at a pretty high level. There may be some increased operational costs as we move some inventory. That would probably show up maybe in SG&A. But I don't think that right now, today, we're indicating that we're going to see material cost increases. And we know we certainly would be well out in front of that with you guys if we saw that. But today, we don't see that.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then finally, I know you said that the addition of dot-com to your same-store sales calculation was not a big deal. Any sense as to the rough order of magnitude of the contribution?","William T. Giles","I'd say it's, like, around 10 basis points maybe? So it's not...","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So truly material?","William T. Giles","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just a follow-up on some of the inventory questions and talk about expanding the coverage. Are you looking at branded coverage to meet the Commercial hard parts demand, as well, or are we looking at keeping the percentage weighting in Duralast fairly constant?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I would say we're planning to keep the percentage weighting in Duralast very constant. This is about expanding our ability to say, yes, not adding choice.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And I guess as 71% of the stores now have commercial and you look at the store base, maybe some of them don't really apply to commercial. What do you think the potential maximum percentage is if the footprint were to stay the way it is today?","William C. Rhodes","I think if you had 5 of us in a room, we'd all have 5 different points of view. We don't know the answer to that yet. We believe it's not 100%. We believe it's significantly above where it is today. Whether that's 80%, 85% or 90%, I don't think we know the answer. And frankly, as we continue to improve our offering, we think it will be higher and higher.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And I guess one last question. I mean, just from a housekeeping standpoint, what percentage of the mix would be done in the Duralast brand basket now?","William T. Giles","That's probably around 50%.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I believe Bill Rhodes made a comment that you want to say, \"yes,\" more frequently in an economically prudent manner. It seemed like that's going to be more relevant on -- or a little more relevant on the Commercial side. And perhaps to be very relevant in that market, you would have to accept lower turns, may require a greater distribution capacity, a deeper inventory investment. So how do you balance the desire to want to be more relevant in that market with your current return profile that's, obviously, very nice?","William C. Rhodes","Yes, I think it's a great question, Michael. And I would start with, yes, we have 32.7% return on invested capital. We do not hold incremental investments to that 32.7%. If we have something that will exceed our 15% internal rate of return, we're going to go for it. So that's why we're going with all these tests. We also don't want to go out there and launch something big until we understand the ramifications of it. So that's why we've put these myriad of tests out there and we have great testing methodologies where we can look at tests versus control; look at the cost; look at any capital, if there is any; and then determine: is this the right investment for us over the long term or is it not? So I think our approach works really well. And it's the same approach we use to develop the current Commercial model and the same approach we use to develop the hub store model.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So if you are seeing evidence from your tests that you may need to push further on your distribution capacity, that's something that you would not rule out?","William C. Rhodes","I wouldn't rule out anything. If we can find something that's economically viable and have a high degree of confidence that it's going to work over the long term, we would look at this -- all kinds of different strategies. I want to be very careful, that does not mean that's what we're going to go do. We have a myriad of tests that are out there, where we're looking at how do we improve but also make sure that it's prudent from a financial point of view.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That makes sense. My last question is on the DIY side. Can you talk about how you thought your share, your market share trended during the most recent quarter? And what were some of the puts and takes on your ability to either gain or perhaps the circumstances which you lost a little share?","William T. Giles","Yes. I would say we probably had a minimal loss on market share overall, probably over the past year or so. And I think that, that's regained a fair amount of energy and focus in the organization. We're really excited about the things that we've put together as we kind of head forward into next year. So I don't know what the puts and calls are necessarily. There's a lot of things that we know that we can do better on internally and we think the things we articulated today are what we're going to focus on to regain market share.","Operator","The next question is from Greg Melich with ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I only have 2 questions. One is, so I think you mentioned a strong traffic trend or an improving traffic trend while still negative. Could you give us a little more on that? Was that talking through the quarter or sequentially versus last quarter?","William T. Giles","I would say through the quarter versus last year overall. And I would say that what we saw was that traffic had a little bit of an improvement from a trends perspective. And so, actually, tickets been a little bit more of a challenge and we talked about that a little bit earlier relative to the inflation factor.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So it'd be fair to say if your costs improved 110 basis points, sequentially, the traffic improved more than that?","William T. Giles","Yes. That's a good way to look at it.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second is the AP inventory getting all the way to 116%. Is that a function of the new SKUs you're adding and how they turn in their terms? Or is that just sort of a timing of when the year ended? Or can we actually use that kind of rate going forward?","William T. Giles","I would look at it from the standpoint, I think it's a lot of great work from the merchandising organization in order to balance out terms in some of the inventory that they're adding. Relative to going forward, I think we'll continue to see a little bit of pressure on that number as we add inventory over time. So we're thrilled we're at 116%. We think that's a real -- certainly an industry-leading number for us. We're proud of that number. But we're not trying to chase that number at the risk of not having the appropriate inventory coverage.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So put another way, as we add the inventory for the hubs, we shouldn't assume that the payable terms is going to cover all that investment?","William T. Giles","I would say that's probably right over time. But in the short term, it definitely will.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just one question, I guess really for Bill Giles. Looking at the gross margins and you made some -- made comments about -- in your prepared comments about the gross margin, but just maybe so I can understand better. If you look at the trajectory through the course of the year, and it seemed like your gross margin gains moderated pretty meaningfully towards the end of the year, recognizing you don't manage towards the rate, just help me understand the kind of puts and takes with that, what basically caused that moderation?","William T. Giles","I think that the moderation, I would attribute it more to the prior year activity than the current year activity. I think we've had pretty good improvement on lower acquisition costs, et cetera. I suspect that we had a slightly higher rate of lower acquisition costs, coupled with probably some increase in inflation and, ultimately, will always help margin a little bit. And those things didn't anniversary themselves this year. So I think, overall, when I looked at it, we're flat for last year. x AutoAnything, we're probably up maybe 40 basis points or so. So we still have a very strong margin and a growing margin.","William C. Rhodes","The other element of that, we mentioned many times, is as we continue to grow the Commercial business, it is a natural headwind for us. And we're growing at an accelerated rate versus our DIY business. That is a pretty significant headwind in gross margin.","Operator","The next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMC.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted to follow up on the gross margin question. So as you think about inflation going forward, with a lack of inflation going forward and presumably some deflation, is it in categories where the pricing is sticky, where, perhaps, you could see some tailwind related to that, particularly as it interacts with the LIFO calculation? Or does the, I guess, modest deflation put pressure going forward on the gross margin?","William T. Giles","I would say that at the moment, we're not believing that we'll have significant inflation or deflation, per se. I don't think that we're going to necessarily have significant deflation. So and when you think about it, a lot of this inflation occurred in fiscal year '11 and '12. '13 didn't really have a lot. If there really isn't a lot of inflation or deflation in fiscal year '14, then it should be -- not have a significant comparable impact.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So then I guess once you get past the anniversary AutoAnything, December 19 or so, so really, some of the pressure on gross margin goes away. So we could see some modest gross margin expansion once you fully lap AutoAnything?","William T. Giles","I think that's a fair way to look at it. That's exactly right. That would be one aspect, a pressure point that would become anniversary-ed when we lap it. And like Bill said, as we continue to grow Commercial, that creates a little bit of headwind. And then we always have opportunities to improve sourcing, so that can be a tailwind.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. And then the last question on sales. You mentioned the Northeast was a stronger performer relative to other regions. Was that region hit particularly around the cooling weather to suggest that, that region also decelerated into August? And then is there a lingering impact overall in the business as you get past the AC season? Doesn't the mix suggest that maybe things got a little bit better here in September? Or is there a lingering impact on batteries? How do you think about that overall?","William C. Rhodes","Yes. I think the reason we wanted to call out the Northeast and the Midwest in particular was that they had been performing so significantly different than the rest of the country for the last 15 months or so. Basically, what we're saying is, we said all along that we thought that was related to the winter of 2011, 2012. That seems to have been right. Now the Northeast performed pretty well this quarter. The Midwest continued to be challenged but not nearly at the rate that it was before. So I wouldn't read too much into that. As far as the batteries and air-conditioning sales, yes, those were a little bit more challenged, particularly in the Eastern United States during the summer months. They'll become less and less important as we move into October. But then we'll get into December where batteries and other failure-related categories will be very important.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So would you assess the August being a little slower than the start of the quarter, mainly around the weather in those categories?","William C. Rhodes","It was modestly slower and it was certainly mild. So I think that's a good conclusion.","Okay. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. Our culture remains our key point of differentiation from our competition and we must not lose sight of the importance of basic store execution in order to remain very successful. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be incredibly successful.","We thank you for participating in today's call.","Operator","Thank you.

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA, and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.","To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and a very good start to the new fiscal year. We remained focused this past quarter on several key initiatives and on growing our business on a variety of fronts. ","I thought I'd begin this morning recapping the various aspects of our business as it has become more complex in recent years. We have diversified our portfolio with the emphasis on building additional legs of growth. First, we have our retail domestic business which generates approximately 70% of our revenue. This business performed quite well on Q1 and we continue to see opportunities for future growth in store count and same-store sales. Secondly, we have our commercial domestic business which has been growing sales by double digits for five years and continues to be a tremendous growth opportunity. We also have international retail and commercial businesses in Mexico and Brazil. We've been doing business in Mexico since late 1998 and our model has proven to work quite well.","In Brazil, we are still in test phase but our sales had continued to grow nicely. We also have an growing internet business supported by both AutoZone.com and AutoAnything and we have our all data business which is the leading diagnostic and repair business in the United States. We have expanded that business to both Canada and Europe in recent years. And finally we recently acquired IMC which focuses on the import parts business and provides us with a new growth opportunity in new avenues to invite AutoZone customers who often expanded product assortment. This past quarter, our U.S. retail business expanded with the opening of 22 new stores. We also opened 61 net new commercial programs our commercial business continue to gain traction growing sales 13% for the quarter. We now have commercial programs in 78% of our domestic stores having opened 816 new programs in just the past two years and we have opened four new stores in Mexico during the quarter. In Brazil, we continue to operate five stores and expect to open a couple of new ones over the next few months. ","We currently have approximately 8% of our total stores outside of the United States. We believe we have growth opportunity in the U.S. and outside the U.S for many years to come. In the first quarter, our sales accelerated on a same store basis compared to last quarter. We reported a same stores sales increase of 4.5% up from 2.1% in Q4 of last year. We were pleased to see we gained traction in sales categories where we\u2019ve added merchandize and our commercial business benefited from both the inventory additions and a diligent focus on growing sales in our older programs with particular emphasis on mature customers. We were pleased with our sales performance throughout the quarter but our DIY business was particularly strong in the last two weeks when much of the country experienced the first significant cold weather spell. Our results were also generally consistent across all regions of the countries while the weather experience at the end of the quarter accelerated our growth even further, our sales throughout the quarter were noticeably improved from Q4 in virtually every week. Our beliefs is at the reduce gas prices are giving our customers additional disposable income and helping drive our sales. ","Additionally and more importantly, we believe the work we\u2019ve been doing over the last year of inventory availability is also contributing to improve sales performance. Over the last year, we have implemented our new algorithms for inventory assortments and those products have been in our stores now for over 6 months. These are generally slower moving products but as our customers experience the improved debt of our inventory these products are continuing to gaining traction. Overall we were quite pleased with our sales performance in Q1. ","Our inventory per store increased over our Q4 2014 levels the primary driver of this increase was the inventory added through the acquisition of IMC. The IMC stores carry on average eight to ten times the inventory per location are basic AutoZone stores do. While we are more aggressive with our inventory additions this past year, we feel future investments will be more targeted and refined. Additionally, when we implemented our new assortment methodology last year we made a decision to only execute half of the deletes of underproductive merchandize in order to mitigate the potential risk of such a significant change.","We are in the process of executing the additional deletions over the next few quarters. Overall, we believe our growth in inventory per store will continue but at a low modest pace than last year. We will continue to assess and analyze our changes and we will continue to refine our methodologies overtime. But the majority of this initiative will be completed once the additional deletions are removed. Secondly, as we mentioned during the last several quarterly calls, we have been testing different delivery frequencies from our distribution centers. Our ongoing tests have shown us that increased delivery frequency increases sales and improves inventory productivity while reducing safety stock. The important takeaway here is we continue to expand these tests and have added more stores to these test. As we\u2019ve been testing for about a year, our results to date have been encouraging and we plan to further expand the test in Q3. Once we have confirmed our bindings we will develop a long term plan and explain our strategy and its ramifications to you. We would expect to do this in the next couple of quarters. Ultimately, assuming our findings are confirmed we would expect to increase the delivery frequency to most of our stores and we would expect to add two to three additional distribution centers to do this cost effectively and on a timely basis. ","Additionally, we\u2019ve been testing what we call mega hubs, mega hubs have substantially increased product assortment and they leverage those increased product assortments across other hub network providing stores across large geography access to this expanded assortment. ","We have been testing two mega hubs for about a year. Both of them have been performing well and we will be opening three additional mega hubs over the course of this fiscal year. This too is still in test phase but we are pleased with the performance to date. All of our inventory availability initiatives are designed to significantly increase our ability to meet our customer\u2019s needs. In this business, the inventory availability is a must and we believe once this work is completed we will materially improve our ability to fulfill our customers request. As our commercial business has grown, our need for expanded assortments has grown even more. Again, we are continuing to test and we are expanding our test to validate our findings to date. We will keep you abreast with these developments. This has been important and difficult work and I would like to thank everyone in the organization who has been involved with this initiative for their excellent work today. ","Last quarter, we held our national sales meeting here in Memphis. This year's operating plan theme, wow, every customer, everywhere was very well received. The customers are simply focused on everything we do or like we say at AutoZone, AutoZoners always put customers first. ","We've always been focused on service but this annual operating theme adds intensity and renewed focus. We've made significant systems investments and enhancements this past year in order to capture more data about our customer shopping patterns across all of our platforms. ","We understand we have to be able to toggle between the store, the shop the phone and online experience in order to meet our customer\u2019s needs. At the national sales meeting, my favorite event every year is our recognition luncheon hosting our award winning store managers, or as we call them our President's Club, it's an opportunity for our officers to meet and answer questions from our best and brightest store AutoZoners. This year was certainly no exception. These store award winners deserve our gratitude for their efforts each and every day. ","Now I will take a moment to discuss our recently completed acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation doing business in the marketplace as IMC. They are the second largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian vehicles. While considerably smaller than the number one participant in the industry, IMC with 17 branches today offers a terrific growth opportunity for us. ","Not just because of the parts coverage, but also because of a very strong management team. They are an exceptional team. We closed on the acquisition in September and we have been fast at work on getting our integration plan in place. While it's very premature, I will mention our plans include opening more IMC branches in incorporating their parts catalog into our AutoZone's Z-Net parts catalog. We will continue go-to-market as IMC and expect to open a handful of new IMC branches over the next 12 months. We also expect to have their catalog available in our stores by early spring 2015. I do want to point out; there was very little customer overlap with our commercial customer base. ","Now let me stress the IMC brand is very important to us and we will grow that brand and its presence in the future in the many more markets than what it is in today. IMC has been in a growth mode recently and has built an infrastructure to support a substantially larger footprint. Therefore it currently doesn't enjoy the operating margins that we experienced, so it will lower our overall EBIT margins by approximately 40 basis points on an annual basis. We are very excited to have IMC as part of our organization and very optimistic about our future together. ","Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Our sales increased 8% and our domestic same-store sales were up 4.5%. As mentioned previously, our sales improved significantly from Q4 and each month both retail and commercial experienced positive same-store sales growth. That consistency was across all regions of the country. We believe we benefitted from both macro tailwinds, our work on inventory availability and solid execution. While our value related and maintenance merchandise categories performed well. We were especially happy to see the growth in our maintenance category. Regarding traffic versus tickets in DIY business, traffic was negative while ticket was positive. While only slightly negative traffic improved in the quarter well along and was nicely positive at the end. Our average ticket improved significantly and has returned to more normalized levels after about a year of subdued growth. The hard parts of this since we've added to our stores have held ticket growth. ","Over the last two decades, our traffic count has been challenged. The primary driver of this challenge is the improvements in the product quality which has led to fewer failures or longer maintenance intervals but those improvements have come from technological advancements and those enhancements have significantly increased the price of the products we sale. We have been managing through these phenomena as mentioned for over two decades and expect to continue to do so quite well. ","We are having 61 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 125 programs in the comparable period last year. We have a commercial program in 78% of our domestic store base. Our commercial sales excluding items were up 13% this quarter. Lastly, I always like to recognize how effective our team delivers consistent earning in good sales environment and not so good. And that practice has allowed us to deliver an impressive 33 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. That consistency allows us to be both shareholder friendly with solid earnings growth and bondholder friendly through a targeted investment grade rating and strong cash flow. We continue to manage this business for both short term and long term optimum performance. As part of our strategy to increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers this past quarter we opened five additional hub locations. Overtime, we do expect to open more hub locations and we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level.","Regarding Mexico we opened four stores this quarter. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 6.4% over the last year\u2019s first quarter. As a reminder our all data in e-commerce which includes autozone.com and autoanything make the segment of sales. Regarding online sales opportunities there continued to be great opportunities for growth on both business-to-business and to individual customers who are beginning to see. While these businesses are small for us we expect them to grow at a faster rate in our brick and mortar business for the foreseeable future.","With the continued ageing of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both the DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past two years, we have seen those traded in vehicles to be resold to new owners who are repairing or enhancing their new vehicles. With gas prices on average down materially year-over-year for the first quarter, we are beginning to see miles driven increase.","Decline in prices at the pump have benefited our customers especially those most financially strapped. The lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income; this trend is encouraging but only one of several factors that impact sales.","I know many of this has asked about our sales expectations for the second and third quarters. The comparisons are considerably more difficult. Our certain markets and categories outperformed during last winter, others underperformed. We believe we should improve in those regions in our maintenance categories shift the weather patterns be considerably different. ","As our history has shown we managed this business focusing on both the short and long term performance. As we entered the second quarter we are keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 33 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. ","Our operating theme for 2015 is wow, every customer everywhere and our key -- for the year are, one, great people providing great service; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies and five, improving inventory availability.","On the retail front last quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with the improvements to our catalog assortment we\u2019re incorporating more training tools to help our store AutoZoners provide trustworthy advice. ","Training will continue to be a larger effort for us at the store level. Behind the scenes, we have reset our expectations on technology investment and challenge ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms.","We realize that customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the way as they desire to interact with us.","Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. In regards to commercial, we opened 61 programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs and grow our percentage of stores with commercial programs although our pace of growth will likely moderate. We expect to open approximately 300 programs this year versus 424 last year.","As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the sales potential will continue to increase. Our results continued to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative, which also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish Q1 at 31.7%. ","We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best if not the best in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deployed in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital.","Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to recognize our entire organization for their efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. We have an amazing team and our initiatives for 2015 are exciting. With our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as the inclusion in upcoming expansion IMC, we are ready to continue to provide wide customer service to all our customers and we are ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structure providing our shareholders with a consistency we have exhibited. Now here is Bill.","Bill Rhodes ","","Thanks Bill. Good morning everyone to start this morning let me take a few moments to discuss our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. During the quarter total auto parts sales which include our domestic retail, IMC and commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our five stores in Brazil, increased 8%. Regarding the macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $3.46 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.82 a gallon, a $0.64 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.31 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $3.60 and ending at $3.29 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers\u2019 abilities to maintain their vehicles and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to benefit from an increase in disposable income.","We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2.3% in September I don\u2019t have October, November data yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry\u2019s favored. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per auto parts locations was $1,746,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. For the quarter, commercial sales increased 13% commercial represented 17% of our total sales and grew $45 million over last the year of Q1. Last year\u2019s commercial sales mix percent was also 17%. This past quarter, we opened a 61 new programs versus 125 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year.","We now have our commercial program in 3,906 stores supported by 171 hub stores. Approximately 1,200 of our programs are three years old or younger. Let me take a moment and discuss our commercial program performance. As I mentioned our commercial sales were up 13% this past quarter, a nice acceleration versus last quarter while our average sales per program is below some peers in our industry at $8500. We feel we are on the right track and methodically close that gap. It\u2019s important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years as approximately 30% of our programs are younger than three years old. These openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. However, our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers. This year we are increasingly focused on measuring and growing sales in our older programs and the specific emphasis on our long-term customer growth. ","Looking specifically at our matured programs, those at least five years old, they grew in a high single digit range this past quarter. Additionally, we still have significant opportunity to open additional programs over the next several years. We feel good about the successes we have had and probably growing the commercial business. In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe the improvements we have made in upcoming additional improvements from our inventory availability initiatives enhance our prospects and we believe the addition of IMC will provide us with additional avenues to service our commercial customers very effectively. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. ","Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 4 new stores during the first quarter and we currently have 406 stores in Mexico. We expect to open a similar of stores in Mexico this fiscal year that we open last year. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations. Now regarding Brazil, we are currently operating five stores we didn\u2019t open any stores this quarter our plans remains open a few more stores and then refine our offerings improves our accounts of more for our customers and is financially viable. Our sales growth has been very encouraging and on plan. We continue to operate a considerable loss this is due to expected to having such a small store base and carrying distribution capabilities and overhead that can handle far more stores. Once we refinance our offerings in operations and value at the performance we will provide you with an update on our long-term growth plans. Recapping this past quarters performance for the company in total our sales were $2,260 million and increase of 8% domestic same stores sales or sales were stores are for more than year were up 4.5% for the quarter.","Gross margin for the quarter was 52.1% of sales up 20 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandize margins and lower strength expense. Partially offset by the impact on margin from the IMC acquisition. And regards to inflation is been basically non-existing for couple of years now of certain categories have had some price increases in general. We have slightly more decreases at this point our assumption is we experience of produce for pricing heading into the new calendar year and therefore we feel cautiously predictable and manageable. We will remain confident in the future development regarding inflation and we\u2019ll make the appropriate judgment should they arrive. ","Looking forward, we continue to believe the remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both retail and commercial businesses, however, we do not manage through a target growth margin percentage, as the growth of our commercial business has been a steady headwind and our overall gross margins rate for few years was not bother to call out the headwind quarterly and it is part of our operating model. ","Additionally, until the anniversary of the acquisition, IMC will present a headwind on a gross margin of approximately 30 basis points over the next three quarters as this business model operates to lower gross margin rates. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto part segment. SG&A for the quarter was 33.8% of sales higher by 45 basis points from last year's first quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher legal cost and self-insured medical cost. Now IMC will also have approximately 10 basis points of deleverage on SG&A in the upcoming quarters. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.","EBIT for the quarter was $409 million, up 6.5% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was down 25 basis points at 18.1%. Interest expense for the quarter was $37.1 million compared with $42.4 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.422 billion or approximately $250 million more than last year's balance of $4.174 billion. Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease or leverage metrics based on management's opinion debt regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade ratings and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of our strategy. ","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.9%, down slightly from last year's first quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.7% on an ongoing basis as the deviation in results this quarter was primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose. Net income for the quarter was $238 million, up 9.3%. Our diluted share count of 32.8 million was down 5.5% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $7.27, up 15.6% over the prior year's first quarter. Relating to the cash flow statements in the first fiscal quarter, we generated $375 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $92 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 27 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development on new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. ","With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,006 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 406 stores in Mexico, 17 IMC locations and 5 stores in Brazil for a total count of 5,434. Depreciation totaled $61 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $56 million; this is in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $300 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $517 million remaining under our share buyback optimization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again, I want to stress we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant to guide only of each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to do view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percentage of growth inventory finished the quarter at a 112.5% and includes of IMC reduced AP ratio of approximately 150 basis points. ","Next I would like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis; we reported an inventory balance of $3.3 billion of 11% versus the Q1 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects the recent IMC acquisition, new store growth and additional investments and coverage. Inventory per store was up 6.7% at $604,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments and hard parts coverage and the IMC acquisition. The increase in inventory per store this quarter from last quarter was predominantly IMC driven which added just over $10,000 per store to this metric. Excluding IMC, inventory was up 9% over the last year Q1. ","Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.7%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns and significantly exceed our cost of capital. ","Now I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes.","Bill Rhodes ","","Thank you, Bill. We are pleased this morning to report our 33rd consecutive quarter of double digit EPS growth growing this quarter at a rate of 15.6%. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. At the end of the day our customers have choices and we must innovate to ensure they turn to us for the rate of corporate needs. As we continue to invest in our businesses and monitor the results from our ongoing inventory initiatives, we are optimistic about our future. We feel like we continue to be on the right track. Again we\u2019re excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth Mexico, all data, e-commerce Brazil and now IMC. Our long term model is to grow new stores square footage at a low single digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore we look to grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single digit range or better in terms of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits.","We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady consistent strategy is correct. It is the intention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. ","In the end, delivering strong EPS growth in ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past year, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.","Now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.","Alan Rifkin ","","Thank you very much and congratulations on a very nice quarter. First question is for Bill Rhodes. So with all of the new initiatives that you\u2019re presently undertaking whether it\u2019s increasing delivery frequency, investment in the mega hubs or the IMC acquisition, it seems like there is much greater willingness on part to possibly take on more risk and grow the business at a greater rate. Can you maybe just provide a little bit color on why that seems to be at this pointing time and if there anyone of those programs where you have greater confidence than the others. Thank you.","Bill Rhodes","","That\u2019s a terrific question. I think I would say the -- has moved modestly I don\u2019t want to send the message that we\u2019ve changed our investment profile significantly. But working with our terrific Board of Directors we\u2019ve made a decision to take on a little bit more risk and diversify our portfolio a little bit and you mentioned -- all the winning thing is also another great example of that which has allowed us much better insights into the online retail market and provided us with another great team and a good solid business.","I think you asked also, which one do we think is the biggest as most potential, I would tell you that inventory availability has the most potential, because it impacts roughly $8 billion of our revenue today. IMC and all the winning thing are clearly smaller businesses and good solid businesses in growth aspects but the inventory availability initiatives can also significantly impact the overall business. Also let out that we\u2019ve been growing in Brazil as well and as we mentioned it\u2019s cost us significant amount of money and operating loss is down there as we try to get stand up and go on but at the same time that happen when we were in Mexico initially now we seat here with over 400 stores in a very solid business model in Mexico.","Alan Rifkin ","Okay. So Bill as to continue to target inventory availability and you has different delivery frequencies, what are you learning and obviously it increases revenues at think that\u2019s probably clear but what are the cost associated with testing those different delivery frequencies and ultimately you believe that this can be accretive to EBIT margin as well as accretive to comps and revenues?","Bill Rhodes","This is terrific question. I\u2019ll give you some color on it, but the reason we\u2019re not saying it today here is what we\u2019re going to do is because we don\u2019t know all of those answers yet. So on delivery frequency for instance we tested two times a week, we\u2019ve tested three times a week, we\u2019ve tested five times a week. We don\u2019t know what the right answer is yet. The cost profile of going twice a week is very different and going five times a week. Similarly with mega hubs we\u2019re finding how far can we go out on a same day basis versus an overnight basis and the cost profile is very different.","I\u2019ll tell you that I would not expect this initiative would be EBIT margin accretive, in fact I would expect it to be dilutive I can\u2019t tell you today how much it will dilutive I wouldn\u2019t expect massively dilutive, but it\u2019s hard when you hold yourself to a 19% roughly annual EBIT margin to say you\u2019re going to do new initiatives that are going to meet that. We do not want to hold ourselves for that standard.","Alan Rifkin ","Just one last one if I may and I'll pass it on. Is it possible that some stores might be better served with two times a week as opposed to three or five? Can there be some variability in the delivery frequency? I'm having a lot of difficulty with that word this morning.","Bill Rhodes ","","Yes it is a difficult word [indiscernible] prepared comment.","Bill Giles ","","I think that\u2019s a question that we\u2019re asking ourselves right now if so we have a distribution center in Dallas, Texas and we have a $70,000 store in Dallas going there five times a week seems pretty easy. But we have to far go North Dakota does it makes sense to go five times week? Those are question that we just haven\u2019t answered at this point. ","Alan Rifkin ","Okay. Thank you let me pass it on to somebody else.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Robert Higginbotham with SunTrust.","Robert Higginbotham","","Good morning everyone. You mentioned the potential for two to three more DCs or that you expect it to put into two to three more DCs to increase your inventory availability. That seemed to cover a broad range of potential frequencies for deliveries. What kind of range would that two to three cover? Would that go up to daily, would that be two to three times a week, how should we think about that?","Bill Rhodes","","Well the most were attempting today\u2019s five times I wouldn\u2019t call it daily. But we would be able to briefs the networks that we think we need to reach on a two to five time a week basis from, if we added that those three distribution centers.","Robert Higginbotham","","Okay fair enough. And then have you talked about what kind of lift do you see on sales at the stores you tested to the five time?","Bill Rhodes","","No we haven\u2019t because we\u2019re testing around the 150 stores and we\u2019re testing with different profiles. And frankly the results were mix were all positive but the range of results were different, different markets are performing different ways. So we need to get a better handle on it that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to expand the test to further validate our results. These are big decisions that we will make and we\u2019re taking our time to make sure we make the right decisions. ","Robert Higginbotham","Okay and one last one on IMC. Beyond the next 12 months where you said you'd add a handful how do you think about the potential number of warehouses, obviously advances put out some pretty aggressive numbers out there for world Pac with IMC being at least a similar concept. Any reason you couldn't over time maybe reach something close to those levels of locations and then as part of that, could you talk about how capital intensive the new IMC warehouse is, any numbers we can share on unit economics would be helpful, thanks.","Bill Rhodes ","","Sure on the number of locations we think we will have over a 100 at some point of time not see like anybody else would have more than we do. So that will be our plan overtime but we\u2019re going to open a handful this year, this is a new business for us, new endeavor for us and we\u2019re going to work with the IMC team to figure out how can invest leverage each other and open a few make sure that we get the performance that we want and then we will accelerate from them.","Bill Giles","","And then from the capital perspective on the stores or the locations are typically non-retail and more warehouse locations so there are typically certainly less than retail locations with cost.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. ","Dan Wewer","","Thanks. So Bill, in expanding the daily delivery or the delivery capabilities of two to five times a week that would still be I guess less frequent than your three largest competitors in the commercial channel. What do you think that you would be leaving on the table by not going to maybe a multiple daily delivery rate?","Bill Rhodes ","","Well just to clarify we will be doing multiple times a day from our hub stores and our mega hubs in those markets. And so I don\u2019t think we would be if we win a five times a week I don\u2019t think we would be at any competitive disadvantages at that point in time.","Dan Wewer","","So the two to five times per week is from the large distribution center and then you'd top off additionally from the hubs and mega hubs?","Bill Rhodes ","","Three times a day typically within a week more approximately to the store.","Dan Wewer","","So when you look at roughly the 30% gap in revenue per program, do you think this is the game changer that will get you to that 11-$12,000 a week level?","Bill Rhodes ","","I don\u2019t know the answer to that yet Dan. But what I do know is this will be a material change in our ability to fulfill our customers need. We are seeing significant improvements in sales performance my personal expectations is that we\u2019ll grow overtime as our commercial customers in particular experience us being all to fill their needs at higher level. And I think it can make a big difference Whether or not that's a silver bullet I don\u2019t think there is a silver bullet I think we\u2019ve got to stick to our net and continue to improved business every day and get letter.","Dan Wewer","","Separate question on the legal expenses that appears to be about $0.09 a share after-tax. Is this a one off issue tied to the lawsuit that was in the papers a few weeks ago or do you think this is going to be an ongoing higher expense rate tied to just the legal environment that you're in?","Bill Rhodes ","","That\u2019s not a former we want to talk about anything in particular. But obviously during the quarter we believe we had a onetime non-recurring cost and just you pointed is roughly about 22 basis points SG&A for just this quarter. ","Dan Wewer ","","The final question for Bill Rhodes. When you think about the benefits of the drop in gasoline prices compared to the headwinds from the favorable weather last year which went in that tug of war?","Bill Rhodes","","I am sorry, can you say it loud [indiscernible]. ","Dan Wewer ","Which is the most relevant, the benefit from the drop in gas O loan prices or the headwind from the more difficult sales comparison from the ideal weather last year.","Bill Rhodes","Clearly we had terrific performance last year in the second quarter. We saw in specific categories the weather related categories performed exceedingly well. However, some of the other categories did not perform well. We talked about that last year in the second quarter. So it's going to be, the weather is going what it's going to be. There is not material changes that we need to make our business. So we are going to just go up and slug it up the best we can. Gas prices really dropped precipitously just recently and we are beginning to see some of the benefits. I expect the benefits to be bigger overtime if they remain at these levels or even go over but as far as comparing the two I think you have just as good insight on that as I do.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. ","Aram Rubinson ","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of really good questions already asked. Just want to tie it towards the cash flow if we can. I think back in 2012, you reduced your share counts by 9% and then the following year by 8% and following year by 7% and this year we're kind of 5.5 so what I'm wondering is where does that go and implicit is where does CapEx need to go to accommodate these that you've got on the docket?","Bill Giles ","","Yes, I think that's a good question. I think if you look at it over the last several years, we obviously had some benefits on working capital and you look at AP to inventory. And as we've kind of headlined over the last several quarters, that we feel great about where we are from AP to inventory ratio well over a 100% and we think there is some moderate opportunities for us to continue to improve AP to inventory but we do not anticipate having the kind of increases in AP to inventory going forward that we experienced over the last several years, some of that attributed to helping us from a share repurchase perspective. I think relative to capital investments in terms of distributions et cetera, as Bill mentioned, we may add two to three distribution centers of the next several years and we still have work to do to determine whether when we will do it, how many we will do it et cetera. But also keep in mind that we would have added one or two distribution centers overtime anyway just to support our footprint across the United States, I mean you can clearly get out of map and see that we really don't have a lot of distribution capabilities necessarily in the North West relatively to the amount of stores we've opened over the last five years. ","So some of that is inherent in our model overall. So we will give you a little bit more color on the inventory initiative over the next couple of quarters as we finish up the test and have the better plan. I think from a share repurchase perspective, we think we are in a pretty good position right now and we will continue to seek opportunities to improve working capital but I think that's kind of gap existing over the last several years. ","Aram Rubinson ","Well without giving us a number can you tell us where you might have flex room inside of CapEx if you did decide to step it up on the DC side what things might be able to come out to accommodate it? Thank you. ","Bill Giles","","I am sure there are some things in there nothing significant to be excited at the moment. I mean one thing for sure that we want to make sure we're doing is looking down the road, so we're going to continue to make sure that we are making information system investments in order to support our growth long-term both domestically and internationally. We are very diligent about according our pledge making sure that our stores look right and are going to continue to invest in our maintenance and training of our AutoZoners. So there will be opportunities for us to eat the CapEx a little but we will definitely have some costs relative to distribution centers.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi this is Max on your Michael Lasser. Congrats on the quarter and thanks a lot for taking my question. How far do you think your current inventory initiatives can take you in closing the commercial sales per program gap with your peers?","Bill Rhodes","I think it's too early for us to tell. As I mentioned our performance so far, with everything is performing well but there's a pretty wide band of how they are performing. I also think it's going to take time just because we are proving availability it's going to take time to further deepen those relationships with our commercial customers. I think we are doing a lot of great things in our commercial business as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. We've grown commercial double digits for five straight quarters and I think that's pretty impressive and also we will continue to do this. ","Unidentified Analyst ","","Thanks a lot. Also, just kind of as a follow-up, can you maybe dimension some of the cannibalization you're seeing from your younger programs at all?","Bill Rhodes","We can internally. We don't necessarily discuss it externally. I think the key is to focus on for this quarter is that we've obviously improved the productivity of our commercial programs on an average weekly sale basis which is along the way as we measure some 8,500 versus 8,300 last year. We're seeing a high single digit growth out of our material programs, so we feel pretty good about the programs as they mature and we recognize the 30% of our overall programs three years old and younger. And so there will continue to be some cannibalization on those more from just transferring mature customers around, but overall we feel pretty good about the growth rates that we\u2019ve achieved on commercial and we feel pretty good about the trend rates that we\u2019ve seen on commercial.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. ","Seth Basham ","","You guys had same-store sales accelerate 240 basis points from Q4 to Q1. Could you try to break down the drivers of that acceleration between inventory availability whether industry growth, etc?","Bill Rhodes ","","One of the things we thought weather was probably worth around a point or so. I think from a GAAP perspective or lower fuel cost as Bill mentioned before, lot of that happen late in the quarter so I suspect that benefited some. So those items and I think the progression you saw from comp store sales in really a result of lot of the initiatives that we put in place and we think back on inventory optimization the algorithms that we changed that inventory into the stores et cetera now that take itself for just about a little over a year now. We feel pretty good about that and as mentioned before on many of these initiatives it\u2019s going to take time for the customers to recognize the changes that we\u2019ve made. So that inventory optimization is a great example of one where it took several months and now we believe that we\u2019re starting to see some benefits they can drive results.","Seth Basham ","Got it and as you look forward obviously you don't provide guidance but from the outside in should we be thinking about consistent two year stack comps for the next couple quarters? ","Bill Rhodes ","","Yes, that we don\u2019t really look at it that way. We\u2019re kind of looking at how we\u2019re doing right now this past quarter and what we have in front of us and as Bill mentioned before clearly next quarter has a high comp because we have some severe weather and that impacted a lot of failure related categories in lot of the northeast market, at the same time there are lot of maintenance categories that underperformed and there were market outside of the northeast that underperform. So we\u2019ll have to wait and see how it all shakes out but we think that there is opportunities from a category in region perspective and if gas prices stay down that can only be helpful.","Seth Basham ","Okay and then lastly on deflation, would you expect to see more deflation running through your business with oil prices down, impact on oil and chemicals specifically as well as products with steel input?","Bill Rhodes ","","Intellectually a little bit, we would expect to see some deflation that we haven\u2019t seen it yet. So there is some little bit of deflation at oil, there are other categories that have experienced some inflation still on the whole. We\u2019ve seen relatively the nine inflation or deflation in total we have to wait and see how it shake out, right now we don\u2019t really see a big change.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler ","","Thanks a lot, good morning. I want to start out by focusing if we could on SG&A. Even when we isolate out the two discrete items that you called out healthcare and legal, the growth rate in SG&A looks to have picked up a bit and I guess just slightly from where you were earlier in the year. How should we think about your expense comparison going forward and how much discretionary investments would you say is in bedded in the underlying SG&A number here in the November quarter?","Bill Rhodes ","","I think it\u2019s a good question Matt I think that obviously we have the legal insurance to put IMC cost and there we didn\u2019t call out, expose things our which probably get flat SG&A rate year-over-year but you had a 4.5 comp. So you\u2019d expect to have had some leverage on SG&A above that I would think it\u2019s a way to think through that is we probably at a little bit from a discretionary perspective and that\u2019s a much discretionary as these inventory initiatives although we haven\u2019t quantify them. There are a little bit headwind from an operating cost perspective and we would expect those to continue over the next couple of quarters as we continue access those out. So there are some dollars there I\u2019m not going to quantify exactly what the percentages are but I think we can run flattish for the quarter if willing back out some of those items and then probably had a little bit of investments on our initiatives. ","Matthew Fassler ","Just to follow that through a little bit you've had a track record over the past couple years of tightening your belts a bit when the business has been tough as was the case in your fiscal 13 and then investing a bit more in the business has been better so because you did that last year, your expense compare looks easy if you will just given you had the sizeable increase, so should we consider then perhaps to compare might be easy but the investments should persist into the middle of this year given the Supply Chain dynamics or Supply Chain investments remain very much under way?","Bill Rhodes ","","Exactly right.","Matthew Fassler ","And then a follow-up, just trying to work with some of the numbers you gave us to understand the intrinsic profit ability of IMC today and where it could be headed so presuming that it's about a 1.5% \"business pro forma, you talked about a 30 basis point drag on gross margin and I believe you talked about the 10 basis point drag going forward in SG&A. Should that spell out something like a mid-single digit operating margin for that business as we speak?","Bill Rhodes ","","I would say not as we speak I think we think of them in growth note and so they\u2019ve got some immature businesses. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in those businesses et cetera. And so we will need to improve the profitability of IMC and then more importantly we also need to overtime help our own commercial customers through IMC product. ","Matthew Fassler ","And I know it's a small business but given that it's sort of tough to get at a precise number would you say that business is in the black today just to get clear on that.","Bill Rhodes ","","Now to be clear on that Matt just not to talk around it, it is in the slide 1.","Matthew Fassler ","Got it and the profit potential of that model overtime, as you think about intrinsic gross margins and term potential et cetera.","Bill Rhodes ","","Yes obviously that\u2019s probably close to what you\u2019re thinking before versus probably a mid-single digit kind of a number. But the bigger opportunity would be the broader base.","Matthew Fassler ","Understood. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich","Hi thanks. A couple follow-ups I think. One was on the sequential improvement in the comp trend. How much of that was I heard traffic was still a little bit negative but how much of that sequential improvement was traffic versus ticket?","Bill Rhodes ","","I think it was both and I\u2019ve talk about it earlier. The ticket for on the less from year it\u2019s been really quick it\u2019s being continuing to grow it\u2019s been some due. And let trend changed back to the time normalize trends this quarter. But traffic also improved as we\u2019re looking and talking about the acceleration from Q4 I\u2019d also remind as us all that, nobody was really happy with Q4 and remember this July was really poor and August was poor as well. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily the base line if you will.","Greg Melich","Okay great and then just to understand a little bit more I think I heard in your comments that you had lower product acquisition costs. What's driving that and if you think about it going forward I think you mentioned inflation just isn't back at all. Do you think there's actually deflation likely to come into next year?","Bill Rhodes ","","Yes I think our merchandizing organization pretend this to do a great job both and identifying new vendors for existing product where we can reduce our cost in direct import opportunities overseas, doing things directly or finding new vendors overseas as well. So I think the merchandizing organization is done a great job from flowing our acquisition costs. Haven\u2019t seen in total lot of deflation necessarily but we haven\u2019t seen inflation either obviously.
