My name is Erica and I will be your conference operator today.","At this time, all participants have been placed in listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. This is call is scheduled to end at about 9:30 AM. Please note this call may be recorded. Thank you.","It is my pleasure to turn the conference over to Ms. Melissa Poole. You may begin your conference.","Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Erica. Good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for The Hershey Company's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call and webcast. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results followed by a Q&A session.","Before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are based on our current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events and those described in these forward-looking statements contained in our 2017 10-K filed with the SEC and today's press release.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Michele.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter sales and EPS were in line with our expectations and we remain on track to achieve the annual financial guidance we shared in April.","In March 2017, I shared with you a vision for transforming our business and our focus, as a company, remains on delivering that multi-year strategic plan and driving long-term value creation. We participate in on-trend growing categories with a portfolio of great brands that resonate with our consumers.","As consumers, their shopping and the retail environment evolve, we will continue to build capabilities and evolve our business as we have done previously when the marketplace transforms. In the second quarter, we continued to invest in our brands and capabilities for growth, while taking measured steps to enhance long-term profitability.","We developed new advertising campaigns on our two largest brands, rolled out enhanced selling tools for our retail sales force and made solid progress on our capacity expansion initiatives. Amplify's marketplace performance remains strong with high single-digit growth, resulting in share gains and the integration is proceeding well.","The ongoing transformation of our international business is ahead of schedule. We delivered solid organic growth for the quarter, completed the successful divestitures of Tyrrells and Golden Monkey and drove year-to-date profit to $34 million, just shy of our largest ever full-year profit in this segment.","Constant currency net sales increased 5.3% in the second quarter, including a 590-basis-point benefit from the Amplify acquisition. Adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.14 increased 5.6% compared to the second quarter last year. This morning, we also announced the 10% dividend increase and a new stock repurchase authorization, a testament to our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow generation.","Last week, we announced to our retail partners a selective price increase to enable us to maintain strong investment in our business and help offset rising operational costs. This was a targeted approach and it included a combination of list price increases, price-pack optimization and changes to customer terms. As part of this communication, we also shared packaging enhancements that improved the consumer shopping experience to drive growth while delivering net price realization.","In the past, you've seen us take infrequent large actions across the entire portfolio that were largely commodity-driven. Our new pricing approach is much more precise both in terms of magnitude and breadth, it utilizes more levers and will be more dynamic. This go-forward approach is critical in a fast changing environment and enables us to balance market opportunity with operational complexity.","On our last call, we discussed our gross margin outlook. While our margin performance is not yet where we wanted to be, we delivered second quarter results in line with our April outlook and our plans and full year estimate remain unchanged.","This operating environment requires an agile approach to portfolio, strategy and pricing. We continue to take a proactive approach to optimize our portfolio and deliver increased profitability. Our SKU rationalization efforts are a great example and we are encouraged by early results. We have also added resources against optimizing our price-pack architecture, improving mix and enhancing planning.","Our investments in capacity expansion, supply chain flexibility and ERP technology all remain on track. We believe these enhancements, in addition to our price increase, will be important levers to address our recent gross margin headwinds. We are confident in the strength of the categories in which we compete and our compelling brands. Our team is committed to making strategic investments in the business to fuel our future growth and success.","Now, let me provide an update on U.S. marketplace performance. Overall, the retail environment continues to change rapidly as consumers blur the physical and digital shopping experience. Both traditional brick-and-mortar channels and e-commerce are growing, emphasizing the importance of the holistic commerce ecosystem. E-commerce grocery sales remain robust as retailers invest in and consumers adapt to new platforms.","In measured channels, snacking categories are still performing well. Hershey's snacking sales grew 0.3% for the 12 weeks ending July 15, driven by strong Amplify growth. SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn grew 8.3% during this same timeframe, gaining 1.2 points of marketplace share. This growth was balanced across class of trade and driven by gains in both household penetration and purchase frequency. The category remains healthy with growth of approximately 4% year-to-date.","We have good visibility into second-half plans and expect both SkinnyPop and ready-to-eat popcorn category strength to sustain as we move throughout the year. Our expansion to participate in broader snacking will continue to be an important lever in our growth.","Confection category growth of 0.6% in measured channels during the 12 weeks ending July 15 was a bit pressured. This was driven primarily by competitor lapping significant innovation during the same time last year. Trends for most other competitors were in line with year-to-date performance.","Hershey's CMG takeaway of minus 0.4% resulted in a share decline of 30 basis points during the 12 weeks ending July 15. Consistent with what we shared with you earlier this year, we expected softer first-half performance due to a shorter Easter and promotional and innovation timing. While measured channels are a little soft, we are seeing growth in untracked channels as consumers' purchase patterns become increasingly fluid.","Our core franchises grew 1.3% during this period, driven by Reese's and Ice Breakers gum. Reese's growth accelerated, driven by the limited rollout of Reese's Outrageous! innovation and additional media supporting a new campaign.","Hershey's Gold innovation is selling in line with expectations and continuing to help drive the core, which was a key goal for us. Velocities on core Hershey's branded instant consumables were up 5% during our launch window, benefiting from additional co-merchandising with Gold. And we continue to expand Gold to the Take Home Pack-types where customer on-shelf timing is a bit slower than we had anticipated.","Now, for an update on barkTHINS, we have applied learnings from recent acquisitions and are building new capabilities to successfully manage and grow our emerging brands. To that end, we established Amplify as a separate division to nurture and strengthen our emerging and better-for-you brand portfolio.","We have a talented team in Austin with expertise and demonstrated success in acquiring, integrating and growing emerging brands. The barkTHINS portfolio, now managed within Amplify, continues to perform well, with measured expansion and activation helping drive solid growth in year two of the acquisition.","barkTHINS is delivering incremental consumers and occasions to our portfolio and growing approximately 35% over the latest 12 weeks. Importantly, we are increasing velocity while expanding distribution, a key metric of sustainability. This is evidence of the results possible when applying these lessons.","We continue to build our digital commerce capabilities. Grocery shopping, today, occurs in one holistic retail ecosystem, where brick-and-mortar and online are inextricably linked. We are focused on continuously learning more about shopper needs based on the fulfillment models through which they choose to receive their goods.","Each of these models are for different levels of convenience and have different economics, which inform different strategies. One thing that remains consistent is the consumers' desire for Hershey brands. We have been consistently gaining e-commerce share this year through upgrades in content, search optimization and clear merchandising and marketing strategies that are linked to our physical retail environment activation.","We are also engaged in a full enterprise data and digital transformation program, which includes upgrades to our core digital ecosystem platforms and will allow us to leapfrog in broader digital capabilities across all functions. These efforts resulted in another quarter of e-commerce growth greater than 30% and we have confidence this trend will continue in the second half of 2018 and beyond. I'm excited by the progress we've made here.","While we delivered our commitment in the second quarter, we are not satisfied. Consistent with what we shared earlier this year, we expect our overall business results to improve in the second half of the year. An important and unique part of our business is seasons. We have good visibility into strong seasonal orders. Our Halloween and Holiday outlooks are a testament to the hard work of our teams, who were able to not only successfully reduce complexity and increase margins, but also improve our consumer proposition and drive growth. Retailer response has been excellent and we are excited by the opportunity to expand this work to the rest of the portfolio.","We are leveraging our capabilities to secure additional space at key retailers with a focus on our fastest-moving, most profitable SKUs. We have good visibility into customer reset changes this fall and believe this will be a growth driver for us. Reese's Outrageous! is off to a strong start and is important innovation to drive our profitable instant consumable business. It is just now starting to achieve full distribution. And we expect additional growth in the second half as it expands to all classes of trade. And we continue to invest in our core brands. This translates into new campaigns, sharper positioning, better packaging and robust marketing support to drive velocities.","Now, for an update on International and Other segment, last year, we shared aggressive initiatives to reset our international business model. I am proud of the teams that have delivered on these plans. Across our international markets, they have exceeded our expectations to set the right foundation to capture growth profitably. Year-to-date, our International segment has delivered operating income of $34 million. This represents an increase of $24 million versus the same period last year.","In addition to the significant margin improvement, we have built the right foundation in our key markets to capture growth. With a focus on our Hershey's brand, we delivered consistent mid-single-digit sales growth during the first half of the year. This has contributed approximately a 0.5 point of overall company growth in the first half.","In Mexico, our business is performing well. Constant currency sales grew high single digits, resulting in continued marketplace share gains. And through a combination of mix, pricing and continuous improvement, we have also improved profitability.","In China, our transformation is ahead of expectations. We remain committed to this important market and are optimizing our footprint to focus on core SKUs, provinces and channels. Sales are stabilizing. Our core Hershey's SKUs in targeted channels are growing share and our bottom line is improving meaningfully. I'd like to thank the local team for their tremendous work here.","This week, we also completed another key strategic priority by divesting Golden Monkey. We believe this will further enable our teams to focus on our strengths for future growth.","In Brazil, our business performed well, despite some macro volatility. While we did experience some impact from the truckers' strike, it was relatively immaterial to overall company sales. We are confident in our ability to recoup the volume in the second half of the year, given our strong marketplace performance and share gains. We have a strong team in Brazil with a great culture, so great work there.","Finally, in India, we remain committed to our strategy of evolving to a higher-margin portfolio. Our core brands, Hershey's, Sofit, Jolly Rancher and Brookside are growing over 50%. We anticipate these strong segment sales and profit trends to continue in the second half of the year.","In summary, we are pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic focus areas. We are investing in our brands, our supply chain and capabilities to position us to achieve growth. We have expanded our breadth in snacking via a high-growth, high-margin acquisition in Amplify with an experienced team leading our snacking expansion.","We have reset our international business model by divesting non-productive assets, rightsizing investments and focusing our efforts on key brands, key markets and key channels to drive profitable growth. We have made meaningful progress in reducing our foundational cost structure and redeploying assets to areas with the highest opportunity, focusing every function on driving maximum commercial value. And we are on track to deliver a strong year of earnings growth in a challenging environment.","I'll now turn it over into Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Michele, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter net sales of $1.75 billion increased 5.3% versus the same period last year, including a 5.9-point benefit from the Amplify acquisition. Volume increased 1 point, which was offset by negative net price realization of 1.6 points. Foreign currency translation impact was negligible.","Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.14, an increase of 5.6% versus the same period last year. Income from a more favorable tax rate, acquisitions and volume were partially offset by gross margin declines consistent with our April outlook.","As Michele stated, there is no change to our full-year organic sales or adjusted EPS guidance. We expect organic net sales to be towards the low-end of the slightly up to 2% range and adjusted earnings per share diluted in the $5.33 to $5.43 range. As we said in our press release, we updated our reported net sales outlook to reflect the strategic divestitures of Tyrrells and Golden Monkey.","By segment, North America net sales increased 5.6% versus the same period last year. The Amplify acquisition added 6.6 points and foreign exchange currency rates were 0.2-point benefit. Volume was a 1 point contribution to sales growth. Net price realization was a 220-basis-point headwind due to the impact of increased levels of trade promotional spending we planned in support of 2018 programming.","As a reminder, second quarter net sales were impacted by current year promotional shifts and the lapping of elevated inventory levels during the prior-year period. Organic net sales were relatively flat in the first half of 2018, in line with our expectations.","North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased on our scale confection brands in the second quarter. This was more than offset by optimization and shifts out of emerging brands as we emphasize more productive initiatives resulting in an overall decline of 6.1%.","Second quarter total International and Other segment net sales increased 3.1%, including a 1.7-point headwind from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Net price realization was a 3.8-point benefit and volume was up 1 point, driven by solid sales growth in Mexico, Brazil and India, which grew a combined 15% on a constant currency basis, partially offset by lower exports. Our China team is delivering ahead of expectations on both the top and bottom line.","International and Other advertising and related consumer marketing declined 17%, in line with our expectations as we further rightsize our investments to drive more profitable growth.","Now, turning to gross margin, adjusted gross profit declined 0.4%, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 44.5%, a decline of 260 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. This is in line with our expectations for the quarter and was driven by higher freight and logistics costs, unfavorable mix, incremental investments in trade and packaging to enhance the consumer experience at retail, plus additional plant costs related to new production lines.","Despite incremental pressure from recently enacted tariffs, we continue to expect a full-year gross margin decline of approximately 125 basis points. Given the pattern of last year's inflationary pressures, we expect year-over-year trends to sequentially improve in Q3 and Q4 versus the first half of 2018. We're making good progress against initiatives to address our gross margin pressures. We believe our price increase, additional capacity for our core brands, enhanced planning capabilities and SKU rationalization efforts will lead to sustainable gross margin improvement.","Second quarter adjusted operating profit of $339 million was impacted by $10 million of higher depreciation and amortization attributable to the Amplify acquisition and to our multi-year ERP initiative. This resulted in an adjusted operating profit margin of 19.4%, a decline of 140 basis points. Gross margin declines were partially offset by marketing spend shifts and optimization as well as continued SG&A discipline.","Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $35 million increased $11 million versus Q2 of last year, driven by the Amplify acquisition. We had a successful bond issuance in May to secure permanent financing for the Amplify acquisition. The issuance was oversubscribed more than three times with very attractive spreads. Full-year 2018 interest expense is expected to be in the $130 million to $140 million range, in line with our previously stated estimates.","The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 16% versus 24.8% in the year-ago period, driven by U.S. tax reform. We continue to expect the full-year 2018 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20%. Second quarter other income and expense was $20.8 million.","Full-year 2018 expense is estimated to be between $65 million to $70 million, consistent with our previous estimates. The decline versus 2017 is driven primarily by lower non-service related pension costs, which, as you know, are now included in other income and expense and we no longer adjust out. We're continuing with our investment tax credit strategies and expect full-year 2018 expense to be comparable to 2017. Note that we expect most of the full-year other income and expense decline to be realized in Q4.","For the second quarter of 2018, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 210 million. The company repurchased $22 million of common shares in the second quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. The company did not repurchase any common shares against the $100 million share repurchase authorization approved in October 2017.","There is $60 million remaining on this authorization. Additionally, the board of directors has approved a new $500 million authorization for a total outstanding authorization of $560 million. There is no change to our target leverage or cash flow priorities.","Business growth, including M&A, remains our top priority, followed by dividends, then share buybacks. And as we've shared before, for the right M&A, we consider changing our leverage target. This new authorization enables us to make timely choices based on the outlook for M&A and market conditions.","Total capital additions, including software, were $75.8 million in the second quarter. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect CapEx to be in the $355 million to $375 million range. Our capital spending is focused on high-growth, high-margin brands and on technology we believe is critical for the future of our business growth. The additional Reese's line we installed in Q1 has enabled a strong seasonal order as Michele mentioned. And our new Kit Kat line is on track to start producing volume in Q4 and will be a key enabler of the brand's 2019 growth.","Additionally, we are expanding capacity on our Ice Breakers gum business. Retail sales there have grown over $145 million over the past four years, more than doubling the size of the business to approximately $275 million. Leading velocities have created additional distribution opportunities that this new capacity will enable us to support.","Our ERP initiative is on track. We will be implementing our new planning capability next month that will improve analytics to enable us to make better, faster decisions. It will also free up time for our commercial teams to focus on more value-added work.","To summarize for the full year, full year reported net sales are expected to increase towards the low-end of the updated 3.5% to 5.5% range. This includes an updated net impact from acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 3.5 points versus the previous estimate of 5 points, reflecting recent international business divestitures.","The outlook for organic net sales is reaffirmed towards the low-end of the slightly up to 2% range. Full year reported earnings per share diluted are now expected to be in the $4.76 to $4.96 range. We are reaffirming full year adjusted earnings per share diluted of $5.33 to $5.43, an increase of 14% to 16% versus last year.","Full year adjusted gross margin is still estimated to decline around 125 basis points versus prior year. The adjusted 2018 effective tax rate is approximately 19% to 20% and CapEx spending is estimated $355 million to $375 million, consistent with our previous outlook. We continue to return cash to our shareholders with second quarter dividends of $134 million. This was our 354th consecutive quarterly dividend on the Common Stock.","And we're pleased to have announced earlier today a dividend increase of 10%. We're confident in our ability to deliver strong earnings while taking the necessary steps to transform our business model and ensure a healthy, sustainable business in the future.","Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn it back over to Michele for some closing remarks.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Patricia. Our brands are loved by consumers. And next year, we will celebrate our 125th anniversary. Each of us at Hershey are extremely proud that we can share a little goodness into the lives of our consumers. It's one of the things that makes Hershey so special.","With our success comes opportunity and responsibility that we take to heart. Our consumers and customers can feel good knowing that as we focus on winning in the marketplace, we are doing so in a way that positively impacts our people and our planet. Our investors can feel good knowing that this makes us a stronger business over the long term. We are focused on delivering the back half of the year, but our top priority remains on long-term value creation. We are making meaningful progress in transforming our domestic and international businesses and our multi-year strategic plan will continue to guide our investment decisions.","The rapidly changing retail environment is driven by the consumer and we will continue to drive our business forward by focusing on core brand growth and portfolio expansion, retaining and attracting the best talent to build the capabilities needed to delight our consumers, winning across the total commerce landscape and operating our businesses efficiently and effectively.","Patricia, Melissa and I are now available to take any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. Patricia, your accounts receivable were up fairly meaningfully, I think, around 20% year-on-year. And I realize last year's receivables level was unusually low. But beyond the comparison, was there any reason for the sizable increase in 2Q 2018? I guess really the larger question is whether you feel your shipments and consumption timing were more or less in line with each other this quarter, if there'll be any reversals next quarter or so forth? Just trying to get a sense of that whole environment, so to speak.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Go ahead, Patricia.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yes. So, the biggest reason for the changes in receivables was clearly the Amplify acquisition as we acquired their receivables. So, that drove that increase. As we look overall to inventories at retail levels, it's always a changing environment. We have some customers where our inventories are up. We have some customers where our inventories are down.","Those that are up are focused really on service levels. I think, especially in this tight freight environment, the focus is making sure that they have enough safety stock to get products on shelf in this environment. And there was some inventory out where there was consolidation. And besides that, what we saw was sort of the normal patterns of inventory shifting that you'd expect from seasons and promotions similar to what we had last year.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, can I ask about the gross margin trends going forward? Obviously, you've been under a lot of pressure for the last year. It looks as though we're getting back to flattish, I guess, in the back half, given the guidance for the full year. What's enabling that sequential improvement as we move through into the second half? Thank you and I'll pass it on.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Patricia, do you want to take that one?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. So, some of it, Alexia, is just frankly lapping the fact that we saw the inflation really start to bite last year at this time especially and I think this was well covered in our call as well as frankly other people around some of the freight inflationary pressures that we had as well as some of the things that we highlighted in our call around the cost of complexity, some of the logistical costs that that drives. So, as we're lapping those, that's a big reason that we see those sequential improvements year-over-year.","But beyond that and I think more foundationally, we're really tackling the root causes of a lot of the impacts of what was driving that inflation. So, really working hard on freight optimization, making sure that we're trying to avoid buying in the spot market, we contract our freight in advance and then really pushing hard on complexity, both from what we've talked about before with our SKU rationalization, but getting at some of the even deeper root causes of planning better, which is something we mentioned on this call, using some of our analytics tool. If we can plan it on a more granular level, it avoids some of those costs.","So, those are things we're working on. And then, the third benefit that we really see driving that year-over-year improvement in the very back of the year is a strong improvement in international, which continues, as Michele, I think, really highlighted in her remarks, to drive to a profitable growth (33:18) margin.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, everybody.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. I think you mentioned that volume in North America was up 1% and that's a bit better than, I think, what we've seen in some of the scanner. And then, I also thought last quarter that the SKU rationalization you talked about to start to limit some of the complexity, maybe would be a bit more of a drag to North America organic growth in this quarter as well. So, I'm trying to get a sense of whether those things, those programs were the drag that you expected or I guess maybe it's just all the untracked channels at the end of the day, but maybe that differential between what we saw in North America volume with the other aspects I mentioned would be helpful.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. Andrew, so I will start with, as you know, we said that we expected the first half to be our softer half and second half to be stronger. Certainly, as we look at Q2, we did see retail takeaway a little softer and that was partially offset by strength above what we anticipated in non-measured channels as the consumer continues to be fluid relative to where they're purchasing products. And that's very important for us to focus on.","I would say that the real impact from SKU rationalization is really going to go much more forward versus Q2. So, we really just kicked the program off in the middle \u2013 first part of the year. And so, we're going to see more of that impact come later. I guess, as you think about takeaway for the year, what I would say is, as we look to the back half, the key levers that really are going to accelerate growth are, first of all, seasons, which you know is about a third of our business. We have strong visibility into seasonal orders, as you know, because customers commit way in advance and we produce in advance and we have very strong commitments on the season, both Halloween and Holiday.","Secondly, we have also visibility to customer resets in the fall. And we know, through our partnership with retailers, we have a real a focus on making the shelf as productive as possible and that will lead to some distribution gains for us in the back half of the year. We also have the launch of Reese's Outrageous! which really just began in June, but it really accelerates and we gain full distribution in the second half of the year. So, our instant consumable innovation lap, it's much stronger what we have in place this year than prior year. And I'd say those are some of the biggest factors.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","The only thing I wanted to add on the SKU rationalization is, as you'd expect, the first things that we take out are frankly SKUs with very small volume. So, they're not the ones that you see a big impact of and we also focused a lot on merch units, which, again, you don't see coming through in the scanner data.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. Thanks very much.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of David Driscoll from Citi. Please go ahead.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask some questions just around pricing, but I wanted to start with inflation. Could you guys just quantify your expectations for inflation in 2018? And then, one piece of complexity that's a little unusual, but I think we need to know is, is how much of the inflation is system-wide or industry-wide versus Hershey specific? And I'm really thinking about the stand-up packaging, because I know that that's been a big issue. So, there's a question there on inflation and then, I have a follow-up on pricing.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Okay. Patricia, do you want to handle the inflation question?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. I guess if I take it in some buckets, we're seeing a standard inflation that we always see going through on wages and benefits that again, what I think, is industry-wide throughout the country. Second, the freight inflation is hitting us and we do see that impact as well. Again, I think, that's industry-wide. In fact, I think, our guys have done a really good job of managing that, frankly better than probably the industry.","In terms of commodities inflation, I think it's a constantly changing landscape out there. It's not a huge driver for us this year. We have seen some volatility in some of our input costs, like cocoa, but, frankly, we think our hedging program really does a great job of smoothing some of the very short-term swings that we see there.","So, those are things that I would say everybody in the industry is seeing, wage, freight, whatever their commodities piece is. And then, you're right, we do have some impacts that are specific to us. I think the ones that I would call out are some of the inflations that we see as just being driven from some of this complexity that we've talked about, which drives some internal logistics costs as well as the packaging, which we have talked a lot about over the last several quarters. And we think that that investment that we've made in more expensive packaging though will really deliver, especially going forward, a better value proposition and impression on shelf to our consumer.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then, on pricing, can you guys quantify the magnitude and timing of the pricing? And then, one question specifically, I think pricing in the quarter is down. So, Michele, if you could just kind of put this together for me, we're taking a price increase, but yet in the second quarter, pricing was down and it's not even immaterial. I think it's at 1.6%. So, kind of why is pricing so weak in the second quarter, yet there is pricing announcements coming? It's just a little bit of a \u2013 it kind of seems a little bit off in terms of kind of second quarter results and what they suggest versus what it is that you need, but maybe you could pick it up and take it from there.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. Absolutely. So, let me start with the first part of your question relative to the price increase. If you look at our total price increase, the weighted average increase of the total of all the actions we took is about 2.5% across our total business. If you really break that out, as I mentioned in my comments, we've utilized a couple different pricing levers and so, the entire portfolio is impacted by terms. There are select pieces of the portfolio impacted by price-pack optimization.","And then, about a third of the portfolio experienced just a straight price increase. So, that's kind of how you can think about it relative to across the portfolio. We announced it this past week as is the case with what we've done historically. We do need to price protect for promotions that are already committed to customers.","So, really the prime benefit of that comes closer to next year. As you know, there's a little bit of a conversion on the way to realizing the price. And obviously, we have seasons in the back half of the year that are about a third of our back half where we have prices protected as well.","As you look at the second quarter and price realization there, Patricia, do you want to talk a little bit about that?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. So, as we shared before, we have been shifting some dollars into trade this year to support some incremental in-store activity. And then, I think, it's also important to say that there are a number of things going on in our trade line. Some of it did show through on the scanner to the consumer, but it was actually fairly small amount. There's other pieces, which really supported more just in-store activity and then, actually a fair amount of it also was frankly some costs that just shifted from below the gross sales \u2013 the net sales line into net sales for some accounting reasons as well as some prior-year true-ups. So, it was a mix of different things.","And I think that, as we go forward, we just always are looking at our trade, making sure that we evaluate the effectiveness of it versus advertising and working with our retailers and making sure that we're really driving the best value possible from those dollars.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. Remember, I guess, I would say, in our category, as you know, one of the most important things to generate from our trade is merchandising. So, we continuously balance how much goes into price. And as Patricia mentioned, there was a relatively smaller amount that really showed up as a retail price decline.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","How are you?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Very good. How are you?","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","I'm doing great. So, I wanted to \u2013 you gave us the top line impact, but a real simple question, trying to understand any color you can give us around what Amplify did both, in total, in North America to margin trend year-over-year and the operating profit trend year-over-year? So, it seems to be there'll be somewhat of a positive impact. Any quantification you can give us or \u2013 directionally would be very helpful?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. I mean we feel good about what \u2013 the profit that we're delivering on the business and it is actually ahead of our expectations. So, we are feeling good that we're over delivering on our acquisition model on the top and bottom line. And so, it's having an impact in line with what we had shared with you earlier relative to, if you look at EPS accretion, we are in line with the range that we had provided and are seeing strong profitability.","In fact, the team has been focused on really very strong discipline about leveraging the value of that brand and actually spent some time this year eliminating non-productive promotions to further focus on profitable growth. But really if you look overall, the gross margin impact of that business on our total North America business, just given the size of it, is pretty minimal.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got a follow-up question just on price increase. I think in the past, when the pricing in the category has been more episodic, retailers, my recollection of it, has pretty much applied it across the board to everyone. Where here, it's a little bit more dynamic, I guess, right? Your \u2013 part of it is list price, some of it is price pack. So, I guess I'm trying to get a sense from your expectations. Will retailers sort of look at what Hershey is doing in isolation or will they try to sort of apply it across the whole category?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","I really could only speculate on that. So, at this point in time, I really don't know. I'm not sure what their plans will be there. That really rests in their hands.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess as you have factored in elasticities (44:28), have you, I guess, thought about that differently maybe than you had in the past?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Well, we always look at where our pricing is. And in some parts of the portfolio, there's a lot of similarity in our portfolio and competitive portfolios. In some parts of our portfolio, there's not. So, we've continued to do a very detailed analytic price elasticity models and evaluate all the learnings across, but we can't really share the specifics behind that.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Rob Dickerson from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I just had a bit of a bigger picture question on international. You've divested the two businesses. So, congratulations on doing that. But just in terms of overall profitability expectations, as we think forward into 2019, but say three years forward, how should we \u2013 or how would you like them the market to be thinking about the operating margin potential on that segment?","And I just asked, because I think a lot of us can remember dating back, let's call it, five years when there was an expectation for low-double-digit operating margin on the business. A lot kind of happened in the interim. That kind of went away to an extent. And then, in Q2, you're putting up almost 9% in op margin and that's I'm assuming before some hopefully positive effect that would be coming from the divestments. Thanks.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure. So, we feel very good about the profitable growth that we are deriving and how we've reset the markets. And we also see continued opportunity going forward. So, I think without getting into tremendous specificity, I think it would be fair to say that we believe low-double-digit margins will be possible \u2013 could be possible going forward. And I think that's a good way to think about it.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Steve Strycula from UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Quick clarification, just wanted to see whether \u2013 when you talked about the industry price increases and your price increases, across the portfolio, is this in line with some of the peers are doing? Lindt had commented that Ferrero and some others who are out there in the marketplace also taking price. So, first question, I just want to say, is that pretty much at parity with what you're seeing across the landscape?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","I'm not sure that I'm in a position to really comment on others' pricing actions in the marketplace. I think I'd prefer to stay away from that and I'm not sure honestly that I have full knowledge of what others have done, given the actions have been relatively recent.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","I know there are some of them out there.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","And then, how should we think strategically about M&A going forward? It seems like, a few times on the call today, you called out the lower leverage of the balance sheet and the appetite to looking at different types of assets in the marketplace. Are you seeing anything out there in terms of the landscape that's more appealing today versus what it was 6, 12 months ago, whether it's asset prices or anything you can kind of speak to?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. We remain committed, as we laid out in our strategy in March of 2017, that M&A is a critical pillar of growth. We see that as an opportunity to capture more snacking occasions, given our strengths and core capabilities in the area of snacking. And so, I would say, we continue to be committed and you can look at our activity and see that we're taking action probably at an increasing rate versus perhaps where we were in the past, at least relative to size and scale of assets.","I would say that probably the biggest thing influencing our actions is, I think that we have learned a lot and are applying a lot of lessons from past acquisitions. And so, we have perhaps even tighter screening criteria that allow us, I believe, to move more dynamically to capture opportunity.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Pablo Zuanic from SIG. Please go ahead.","Aatish Shah - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Aatish Shah on for Pablo. On a more of a structural level for the quarter specifically, just want to know if there's a change in attitude by retailers regarding the chocolate category, specifically if you could touch on this by channel, space allocation, promotional environment, et cetera, that will be helpful. Thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. I would say that the chocolate category and the confection category overall continue to be a category that's very important to pretty much all of our retail base, because it is a category with pretty high profitability and it has produced well for retailers over time.","So, certainly, in terms of the level of priority and shelf space, that does vary a bit by different classes of trade and different retailers, depending on their strategies. But overall, I would tell you that we have continued to work with key retailers, some of whom are looking to expand space in the category as they look at other categories in their box and say how do they best master the space allocation. And if you just look at category growth across all categories in store, you know that confection continues to grow faster than many.","So, there certainly are many that are looking at that. And then, as we know, there are a couple who have strategies that head in a different direction, and so they probably aren't prioritizing it, but I would say, overall, we continue to feel good about the role of this category and how retailers are viewing it as very important.","Aatish Shah - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for allowing me to ask a question. I appreciate it. A few housekeeping details, I guess, first, the disposal of Tyrrells and Golden Monkey, what's the anticipated revenue drag on both the tail-end of this year and on a 12-month basis?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Patricia, you want to \u2013 yeah.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. So, you can see that that's really the delta between the 5 points that we talked about from acquisition down to the 3.5 [points].","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That math sort of implies if we annualize it that those businesses are about a third smaller than they were when you bought them. Is that right?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","I don't think you can do it that way, because for Amplify, Tyrrells is a piece of their business, but for Golden Monkey, it's been changing dramatically as we go.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And a quick back of the math envelope, we get about a 15, 20 basis point gross margin tailwind from exiting those businesses, reasonable?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","I'd have to look quickly. There's a small gross margin improvement, but it's very small.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then, last question, I'll pass it on. You mentioned \u2013 a two-parter question. On the pricing components, can you specify what that third of the portfolio is where you took a straight price increase? I am assuming it's sort of single serve. And can you give us the magnitude? And you mentioned investment in packaging. Can you contextualize that for us? Give us a sense of what exactly you're referring to.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, I can tell you that some of the specific price increases were primarily in the Take Home Packs. And I think that's about as much detail as I want to go into on that. And then, relative to investments in packaging, that's really about the refresh to create strong impactful packaging graphics and structure at retail to capture shelf impact. And that's one of the areas where we look at the total value proposition to the consumer and really try and optimize that value proposition. And that's part of what you see in our broad pricing action.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","What's that mean? Is that like more retail-ready packaging? Is that more stand-up pouches? I'm not sure what your comments refer to.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. So, it's across the board. There are multiple components. A piece of that is retail-ready packaging. A piece of that is a change in the structure of our laydown bags to be standing up and to have more of an impact from that perspective. So, it makes them easier for consumers to use, allows for much greater shelf impact. And as always, when we look at adding value to consumers, we always look at making sure that we're aligning the price value and getting price realization as we invest more in some of our packaging.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. I really appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. A couple of follow-up questions, regarding the e-commerce strategy, it's encouraging to see the sales up 30%, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to think about the mix impact it might have away from higher margin single serve and maybe more towards Take Home. Have you done any math to determine if this dynamic would shift \u2013 would also be a drag on mix?","And then, also I think you've said in the past that you can shift spending from one bucket to another to fund all of this e commerce investment that needs to take place, but my concern is that you kind of have to invest in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce at the same time. Can you elaborate a little bit on those things?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. So, as you look at e-commerce as a channel, we won a bigger business in e-commerce and on the other hand, we're somewhat fortunate that food and especially condition distribution has been a little bit slower than some other categories. So, we've been able to capture some of the learning that those categories have experienced in terms of really thinking about the packs that we want to sell the price points and what the portfolio looks like in that channel. And I think that is helpful to us as we look at continuing to drive margins.","And as we look at the investment in e-commerce, we have really had programs underway to look at how we want to reallocate our resources strategically across the portfolio. So, if you look at the increase in profitability that we have in international, that was a choice to improve profitability to be able to fund some of our other critical strategic initiatives. So, that freed up money.","We had a major initiative to reorganize internally to drive even greater commercial value. We took dollars out of SG&A on our corporate functions. And that's another source of funds that we could reallocate. So, what we've tried to do is prioritize all commercial value, which is really bricks-and-mortar and e-commerce as users of funds and then, some of those other areas that I spoke to as sources of funds.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.","Erica, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And for the final question, we'll go to John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Michele, just on the international side, the profit recovery has been pretty good, but I'd like to hear more about your vision for the topline. And that, I guess, Brazil and Mexico, India, they're strong, but they're pretty small relative to the U.S. So, do you see Hershey being more of an America-centric business going forward, you lean more on the export business going forward? Is there an opportunity for version 2.0 in China? How do you think about the resource allocation going forward?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, as we think about the international business, our goal is on driving profitable growth. And as we've talked a little bit about our strategy in the past, we have an algorithm that basically says we want to get about 0.5 point of profitable growth from the international business and I think there is a possibility that could go up a bit over time.","Canada and Mexico, our scale markets, where we have scale positions, strong businesses that kind of fit one role in the portfolio. And then, as we mentioned, export is highly profitable business. So, we'll continue to run that to leverage our brands in key markets. And then, we're placing some bets when you look at China and India in particular on the huge growth that's going to incur in the future and is occurring in those markets and really focused on building sustainable business models.","And pending the outcome of that, we'll determine how much more investment we put there, but I think it's clear that we feel good that those businesses have gotten to a point where their profitability is very good. And we'll continue to make choices as we see the success on individual bets in those markets.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just given the experience to Golden Monkey and then, I guess, there's another example of the Bauducco JV elsewhere in the world. I mean what's your appetite for taking on more M&A in emerging markets? I mean do you go with a partner or do you do more JVs? How do you think about that?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","I'd say right now that is not our focus for M&A activity. Our focus is in the U.S. market. So, I feel very good about \u2013 we have enough scale in Canada and Mexico. And I think that we're making really good progress on our own in China and India, not ruling out any potential strategic partnership going forward, but feeling good about our focus on The Hershey brand, on a higher margin portfolio and local talent, doing all the right things to accelerate our business. And I think we've got good success or good proof points that in the past when we've stuck with that, it has worked for us pretty well.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for your time.","Melissa A.

Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results followed by a Q&A session.","Before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. These statements are based on our current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events and those described in the forward-looking statements contained in our 2017 10-K filed with the SEC and today's press release.","Finally please note that on today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors.

Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. And thank you, Melissa and a special welcome to you as the head of our Investor Relations team. For those of you who haven't had the chance to spend time with Melissa yet, Melissa has deep knowledge of our business and the marketplace and a strong financial acumen. I think those of you in the investment community will find Melissa a great resource given that expertise and her very straightforward approach.","Now to the business at hand. We delivered first quarter net sales and EPS both in line with our expectations. Constant currency net sales increased 4.4% for the first quarter including a 340 basis point benefit from the Amplify acquisition. EPS of $1.41 increased 8.5% compared to the first quarter of last year.","We continue to make progress against our key strategic focus areas, driving growth in our core confection business, expanding breadth in snacking, reallocating resources to expand margins, and investing to strengthen capabilities. Our core brands continue to grow behind balanced activation and investment.","Our Amplify acquisition is on track, delivering Q1 as planned and is now expected to be $0.08 to $0.12 EPS accretive in 2018. Our international business delivered another quarter of profitable growth and we are investing in new capacity and capabilities for future sustainable growth.","We generated strong earnings results for the quarter, although we got there differently than we had originally planned. We had anticipated gross margin contraction in the first quarter due to higher freight and logistics costs as well as incremental investments in trade and packaging. However, this contraction was greater than we expected due to unfavorable mix, cost of complexity via incremental supply chain touch points and waste, as well as higher input costs.","Overall first quarter gross margin declined 260 basis points compared to the prior year period. As a result, we are now expecting full-year gross margin to decline around 125 basis points versus prior year. You have heard us comment over the years that we are a gross margin focused company, so reversing these declines is a high priority for us and is central to driving profitable growth. We are taking swift action to mitigate these challenges.","First, we are further increasing our supply chain capacity and flexibility as well as investing in improved forecasting tools by shifting our planned tax reinvestment spend from SG&A to capital expenditure. We believe this will address some of the margin pressures we are experiencing and better position us for profitable growth in the future.","Second, we are expanding our SKU rationalization program to the U.S. This effort is in line with our goal to reduce U.S. business complexity and cost (04:55). We feel confident in these efforts given the significant progress we've made in our international businesses on a similar initiative. We think there is great opportunity to capitalize on our ongoing organization work to reduce complexity and enhance margins by providing an even higher level of service and product assortment to our customers.","In concert with our SKU rationalization efforts, we will leverage our best-in-class category management capabilities to minimize any sales impact and optimize the shelf with our fastest turning items. We believe this portfolio and shelf transformation is the right long-term initiative to drive profitable growth for us and our retailers.","Therefore, we have chosen to rebalance some priorities in the second half, which will result in slightly less but more profitable sales. As a result of this decision, we now expect to be within our organic net sales guidance but towards the low end of our previously communicated range of slightly up to 2% for 2018.","At Hershey we have a strong track record of consistently delivering our bottom line without compromising key business initiatives and investments and we plan to do so again this year. Therefore, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance of $5.33 to $5.43. We expect our gross margin headwinds will be offset by improved SG&A and taxes, specifically about half of the recovery will be from delivering the high end of our Margin for Growth target and greater than anticipated Amplify accretion via accelerated synergies and lower deal amortization, about a quarter from a more favorable full-year tax rate of approximately 19% to 20% versus the previous guidance of around 20% to 22%. And the remaining quarter from a shift in planned tax reinvestment spend from SG&A to capital expenditures as discussed previously.","We expect gross margin to begin to improve and expand as we enter 2019 based on these new initiatives combined with our ongoing continuous improvement and strategic revenue management capabilities. We are benefiting from our organization's stellar SM&A discipline and prioritization in addition to favorable taxes which will help offset certain cost headwinds and enable us to continue to deliver solid shareholder returns as we transform the business for future long-term profitable growth. We remain a consumer-centric brand-building company that will continue to invest to fulfill our vision to become an innovative snacking powerhouse.","Now let me provide a marketplace update. The U.S. snacking market remains an advantaged category and continues to grow about 2%. The categories we participate in; confection, salty snacks and meat snacks, are leading this growth.","Total Hershey Q1 U.S. retail takeaway growth, including Amplify, was up 10.2%. This was driven by Hershey CMG growth of 10.7%, benefiting from an early Easter. The CMG category grew 11.8% resulting in a Hershey CMG share loss of approximately 30 basis points. This was in line with our expectations given the timing of Easter, innovation and promotional activity.","Given the 15-day shorter Easter season, Easter category retail sales declined approximately 8% versus last year. Hershey retail sales declined approximately 10% versus last year, consistent with our plans given consumer shopping behavior in a shorter season. Given the shift, April retail takeaway is expected to be down significantly versus prior year. We expect April year-to-date retail takeaway to be slightly down versus prior year.","Our core brands continue to drive growth, and the variety brands we activated are responding nicely to the renewed investment. Base velocities are showing strong acceleration from previous trends and delivering positive ROIs.","Our new Reese's manufacturing line is up and running here in Hershey, unlocking additional capacity and new opportunities for growth. We also recently broke ground on our new Kit Kat manufacturing line in Hazleton, Pennsylvania.","Hershey's Gold is off to a great start and trial and repeat are encouraging. Importantly, we are leveraging this launch to not only bring excitement but also to drive additional merchandising growth on our core base business as well. New pack types are shipping now to deliver on more consumer usage occasions and drive incremental growth.","Our Reese's Outrageous instant-consumable innovation is on track for a May launch. Our retail partners and consumers are excited for this new twist that builds upon the success of our Reese's Pieces Peanut Butter Cup launch by adding Reese's Pieces to our Reese's Nutrageous Bar.","The new Hershey's Chocolate World on the corner of 7th and 47th in the heart of Times Square launched last year just in time for the holiday season. The new store is three times larger than the original store and includes a Hershey's kitchens baking area and a one-of-a-kind S'mores making experience. The store has hosted well over a half a million Hershey enthusiasts already and is on track to connect with over 4 million guests this year.","We continue to strengthen our digital commerce capabilities and have made meaningful progress over the past few months. Net sales were up around 30% in the first quarter, and we expect this trend to accelerate as we move through the year and fully activate the digital strategy I shared with you at CAGNY. We have recently allocated incremental investment to further these initiatives and drive awareness, equity and conversion across the ecosystem from any touch point, physical or digital.","The Amplify business is on track, and integration in Austin is proceeding nicely. As I mentioned earlier, we are successfully capturing cost synergies sooner than previously anticipated. There is no change to our ongoing synergy estimate of approximately $20 million by end of 2019.","SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn year-to-date retail takeaway grew 3.1% versus the year ago period. This was driven by strong base sales growth of 6.9% with velocities improving versus 2017. These base sales gains were partially offset by planned declines in low ROI promotional activity. We have line of sight to distribution expansion that we expect to help further drive second-half growth and I feel great about this business and great about the talent we have in place to lead this business.","Now for an update on our International and Other segment, net sales of $220 million for the quarter were slightly ahead of expectations. We continue to make meaningful improvements to segment profitability with Q1 operating income of $18 million, an increase of $16 million versus Q1 2017. I am really proud of the work the team has done to deliver these results. We expect this segment to continue generating operating income gains as we move through the year, albeit at a slightly lower pace.","Our performance in Mexico, Brazil and India remains strong with Q1 combined constant currency net sales growth of 12% versus last year. Our China performance continues to sequentially improve as we execute our Margin for Growth initiative with constant currency net sales up approximately 1% in the first quarter. We had a solid Chinese New Year, growing share in our focus SKUs for the first time in several years.","In summary, we will continue to balance our top and bottom line in this complex environment. We will invest in our brands and capabilities to drive growth while hitting our bottom line commitments. As we look ahead, we are intently focused on managing the controllable aspects of our business and making the choices needed to further position us to achieve growth, both today and into the future across our portfolio of iconic brands.","I'll now turn it over to Patricia who will provide you with details on our financial results. Patricia?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Michele, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net sales of $1.97 billion increased 4.9% versus the same period last year, including a 3.4 point benefit from the Amplify acquisition and a 0.5 point benefit from favorable foreign currency translation. Volume increased 2.4 points, which was partially offset by planned negative net price realization of 1.4 points.","Adjusted earnings per share-diluted came in at $1.41, an increase of 8.5% versus the same period last year. Gains from volume, acquisition and a more favorable tax rate were partially offset by gross margin declines.","Note that due to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07 Compensation-Retirement Benefits, our 2017 results have been restated. Due to the change in the standard, we have also revised our calculation of non-GAAP earnings, which is positively contributing to the 2018 year-over-year EPS percentage change versus prior year. A reconciliation of these changes, as well as restated quarterly and full-year 2017 results, are available in the Investors section of our website.","As Michele stated, there is no change to our expected adjusted full year EPS guidance of $5.33 to $5.43. However, given the restated 2017 non-GAAP results, full-year EPS is now expected to increase 14% to 16% versus prior year.","By segment, North America net sales increased 4.4% versus the same period last year. The Amplify acquisition and foreign exchange currency rates were a 3.8 point and a 0.2 point benefit, respectively. Volume was a 1.8 point contribution to sales growth. Net price realization was a 1.4 point headwind due to the impact of first quarter true-up adjustments related to prior-year trade programs as well as planned increased levels of trade promotional spending in support of 2018 programming.","Due to the earlier Easter, we accelerated execution of some of our summer promotional activity, including S'mores and Twizzlers. This resulted in some merchandising volume being shipped in the first quarter of this year versus the second quarter of last year.","Also recall that in the second quarter of last year, net sales outpaced retail takeaway due to key retailer distribution and some packaging changes that temporarily elevated customer inventory levels. Therefore, we anticipate second quarter net sales will be pressured versus the second quarter of 2017.","In total, taking into account our first quarter net sales and the timing of shipments, we expect first half organic net sales and retail takeaway to be relatively in line with the first half of last year.","North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased on our core confection brands but was offset by spend optimization and shifts within emerging brands, resulting in an overall decline of 5.3% in the first quarter.","First quarter total International and Other segment net sales increased 8.8% including a 2.4 point benefit from favorable foreign currency exchange. Volume was up 8.1 points, as we expected, driven by solid sales growth in Mexico, Brazil and India, which grew a combined 12% on a constant currency basis.","We're pleased that net sales growth in China continued to improve as we execute our Margin for Growth initiative and optimize our portfolio. China net sales grew 0.9% on a constant currency basis compared to a 29.5% decline in the fourth quarter of last year.","International and Other advertising and related consumer marketing declined 2%, in line with our expectations, as we continue to right-size our investments to drive more profitable growth.","Now turning to gross margins, adjusted gross profit declined 0.9%, resulting in adjusted gross margin of 44.9%, a decline of 260 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. As we communicated at CAGNY and on our last earnings call, we did anticipate gross margin to be pressured in the first half of the year due to higher freight and logistics costs as well as incremental investments in trade and packaging to drive sales growth and to remain competitive at retail.","However, as Michele discussed, first quarter gross margin was below our expectations and we now expect full-year gross margins to decline around 125 basis points versus prior year. Given the pattern of last year's gross margin inflationary pressures, we expect to see improvements in the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis.","First quarter adjusted operating profit of $428 million resulted in an operating profit margin of 21.7%, a decline of 150 basis points. The marketing spend shifts and optimization I mentioned, in addition to continued SG&A discipline, partially offset the decline in gross margin.","Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $29 million increased $6 million versus Q1 of last year driven by the additional commercial paper debt secured to fund the Amplify acquisition. We plan to issue bonds in early May to permanently finance the acquisitions. Bond principal amounts and maturities are aligned to rapidly de-lever the company, consistent with our targeted capital structure, maintaining a 1.5 times to 2 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio.","Even with this additional debt, we have maintained our strong A1 and A debt ratings from Moody's and S&P respectively. We will utilize our healthy cash generation to repay these bonds as well as our existing bonds coming due in 2018 and 2020, upon maturity. Full-year 2018 interest expense is expected to be in the $130 million to $140 million range, in line with our previously stated estimates.","The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 24.9% versus 31.5% in the year ago period driven by U.S. tax reform. With the additional time we've had to evaluate the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, in combination with prudent tax planning, we are updating our full-year 2018 expected tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20% versus our previous estimate of approximately 20% to 22%.","First quarter other income and expense was $1.9 million. We expect full-year 2018 expense to be approximately $65 million to $70 million as we continue our investment tax credit strategy. This was a slight increase versus our initial estimate.","For the first quarter of 2018, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 212 million. The company repurchased $140 million of common shares in the first quarter. This completes the $500 million January 2016 share repurchase authorization while $60 million remains on the October 2017 $100 million authorization. We also repurchased $38 million of common shares in connection with the exercise of stock options.","Total capital additions including software were $60 million. For the full year 2018, we now expect CapEx to be in the $355 million to $375 million range. This updated estimate reflects the increase of approximately $25 million that Michele discussed, which will go to further enhancing supply chain capacity and flexibility, as well as for forecasting tools, all of which we believe will help address gross margin pressures.","Total depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $74 million. This was slightly lower than our planned level driven by favorable Amplify amortization versus initial estimates.","We are making progress on our strategic review of the Amplify international business. We have now reached a point where we believe it is likely that we will sell the business in the next 12 months. Therefore, you will now see this reported as an asset held for sale in the 10-Q we're filing this quarter. The business is still included in our guidance as we're not certain if and when a sale will occur. To assist with your modeling, 12 month sales are approximately $125 million and operating income is immaterial.","We continue to return cash to our shareholders, with first quarter dividends of $134 million. This was our 353rd consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock.","We take a holistic long-term view to deliver value to our consumers, shareholders and communities. We remain committed to investing in our brands and our business model to deliver great tasting products and delight our consumers. We generate strong cash flow and have a healthy balance sheet that enables us to return value to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.","And we continue to support the communities where we do business. Most recently, we announced our comprehensive strategy, Cocoa for Good that addresses the most pressing issues facing cocoa growing communities. We're investing half a billion dollars by 2030 to nourish children, elevate youth, build prosperous communities and preserve natural ecosystems.","To close, we have good visibility into plans that we believe will enable us to deliver on our earnings outlook in a difficult cost environment. Despite recent pressures, we believe our margin structure remains advantaged and we are aggressively taking steps to address these headwinds in a sustainable way while we transform our business model.","Before I summarize the year, let me provide some thoughts on the next quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we expect Q2 gross profits to be pressured. This, combined with the timing of some of our capability investments such as ERP, is expected to result in lower Q2 EBIT versus last year. Our revised tax rate will be somewhat of an offset and we expect nominal Q2 EPS growth.","To summarize for the full year, we are reaffirming full-year adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $5.33 to $5.43, an increase of 14% to 16% versus last year. We're refining our reported net sales estimates toward the lower end of the previously communicated range of 5% to 7% to reflect the new initiatives we are implementing to reduce complexity and improve margins.","Full-year adjusted gross margin is now estimated to decline around 125 basis points versus prior year. We'll continue to invest in DMEs and business building initiatives. The Margin for Growth program savings in 2018 are estimated to be $80 million to $90 million, an increase of approximately $25 million versus our initial estimate as we now expect to deliver the high end of the $150 million to $175 million overall program target.","Amplify accretion has also increased from initial estimates and is now estimated to be $0.08 to $0.12 EPS accretive for the full year. The adjusted 2018 effective tax rate is approximately 19% to 20% and CapEx spending is estimated at $355 million to $375 million, an increase of $25 million versus initial estimates.","Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn it back over to Michele for some closing remarks.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Patricia. Hershey is a category leader with compelling snacking tailwinds. As we transform our business in both domestic and international markets, we believe our core brands and expanding portfolio, our relentless focus on innovation, proprietary insights, and in-store capabilities, and our strong margins and cash flow will help us maintain our competitive advantage, fuel continued earnings growth, and deliver long term shareholder value.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Patricia, Melissa and I are now available to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I think if I heard you correctly, your outlook for the gross margin was to expand, I think you said improve and expand as you enter 2019. I know we can't really talk in detail about 2019 right now, but I think most of us are modeling in some cocoa headwinds as that year begins. And I think most of us would assume that the pricing environment doesn't get a whole lot better right now. So I realize you have some tailwinds, but historically Hershey's gross margin has been pressured when cocoa rises no matter what else is really going on behind the scene. So I wanted to get a little bit more comfort if I can in what gives you that confidence in seeing that gross margin improvement as maybe 2018 progresses or into 2019?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So let me \u2013 I'll start off. It's Michele, and I'll also ask Patricia to add some commentary on this as well. First of all, as we mentioned, we think we're taking some very specific actions to address some of the things that hit us that are within our control. We had some customer-specific programming that leaned towards value-oriented packs and created some unfavorable mix, and as we go forward we are working to fix that and address that.","As we look at our SKU rationalization plan, a real focus on the core is going to help us tremendously to address some of those mix opportunities for us. And so we think that we've got a good plan against that. I'd also say as we look at input costs (00:29:02) comments about cocoa in particular and then I'm going to turn it over to Patricia. Certainly the fundamentals of the cocoa crop, weather, supply and demand are all relatively healthy, but it is a commodity that we know has some high volatility given just some things that are outside the fundamentals.","So with that, let me just turn it over to Patricia to talk a little bit in more detail about the recovery on gross margin. But I think if you think about it at a very macro level, there's a lot of recovery that's just grounded in the lapping of prior-year gross margin.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, I think that's a good summary. So as you know, we started to experience some freight inflation and some other inflationary pressures in the back half of last year, and so as we lap those, that will give us some easier comps in the back half of this year.","And then as we exit that into 2019, while we really don't see a lot of relief on some of the cocoa and other inflationary pressures, we are very focused as a team on reducing some of the costs that we can control, things like the mix that Michele talked about, some of the \u2013 some of our go-to-market, things like our packaging changes.","And then really just getting at this issue of complexity and that's where we want to focus our SKU rationalization on making sure that we're really providing the right package to the right customer at the right time with the right value, but not doing that in a way that overcomplicates our supply chain and logistics system, which is where we've seen some of the cost pressures come in that we do believe are controllable. And those are the things that we're looking to improve in 2019.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yes. Remember, Ken, some of our capacity investments, the Reese's line came online this quarter, and we have a new Kit Kat line coming online at the end of the quarter. So as we look at the mix of what we've been able to sell, we were a bit constrained on some of our most profitable items, and as we get that addressed that's going to help us quite a lot in terms of driving mix on the business.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Rob Dickerson from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Kanika Goyal - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. This is Kanika Goyal on for Rob. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the top line trends. Considering how strong organic sales came in for Q1 and the guidance for Amplify is unchanged at 5%, currency still neutral, could you just explain a little bit more on why the full-year guidance was taken down to the lower end? Like where is the pressure actually coming from? I know the shorter Easter period and SKU rationalization was expected to impact sales by 1%, but is that more profound than what you initially expected? And thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, so first of all, a little bit of perspective on the full year. We always expected \u2013 we had expected in our plan for the first half to be a bit pressured, primarily driven by promotional (32:03) and innovation timing but primarily the shorter Easter. So that was in our plans. As we look at the last \u2013 at the second half, we remain really bullish (32:16) including Outrageous which is launching, Reese's Outrageous, in May, continued Gold success, and very strong sell-in behind Halloween and holiday.","The key difference as we look at the back half of the year is this focus for us to really balance the P&L and drive for profitable growth and thus the SKU reduction program. We think it's the right thing to do to really shift and work to drive mix. And we do know, though, that there will be some short-term impact as we make those changes. So really that choice is the primary driver that led us to call the low end of the guidance. We just want to give all of you the heads-up, relative to what the impact of that program could be as we initiate it.","Kanika Goyal - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from David Driscoll from Citi. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. So I wanted to ask just a little bit more about the gross margins. So pricing is down, and I believe you used the word planned in the prepared remarks. Can you talk a little bit more about the planned pricing reduction? I mean, it feels kind of counterintuitive that pricing is down as much as it is with gross margins under this much pressure and cocoa kind of screaming higher. So are you under retailer pressures and this is why pricing is down? Or are there other good explanations?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","We're always balancing the mix of our investment behind the business between advertising and trade, and as we looked what we thought we needed to do this year to really be competitive, we did make some additional shifts between advertising and trade on certain parts of our business.","I wouldn't say that we see that as major pressure but rather continued optimization to maximize the business going forward. And not all of that is necessarily showing up in price. So as you think about our investment with trade, is really about investment with customers at retail. Merchandising, merchandising racks, things like that also fall into that line.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Can you guys explain just a little more on the \"complexity\" that you're talking about? I'm still not understanding how that comes as a surprise, if you will, in the quarter to drive the gross margins perhaps so much lower than what you initially expected. And I feel like that's really what you're trying to tell us on today's call because it seems to want to drive the SKU rationalization in the second half of the year. Could you just spend a little bit more time on this complexity? And what really this meant? And then why was it kind of something that was a surprise within the quarter to drive this gross margin miss?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So David, I'd say a couple things. First of all, C-store trends were a little bit lighter than we anticipated, and that really had a bit of a mix impact for us. As we looked at \u2013 so I'm going to address complexity as well as the mix piece. Some of the customer-specific programming we had, some of the areas of the business that did the best were some of our bigger more value-oriented packs, and that created some unfavorable mix. So those are two things we didn't anticipate that hit gross margin.","As we look at kind of the complexity piece, what I would say is in a difficult growth environment and with some capacity constraints, we've leaned into some areas of the business to drive revenue that we think have created complexity. They also created sales obviously, but they added some incremental touches in our supply chain. And we just have to get after those. And given that we have these capacity investments in some of our biggest businesses, this gives us the opportunity to better control what we are selling.","Patricia, anything else you want to add to that?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","The other thing that we've really explored with the complexity is how much it puts a stretch on our demand planning system. And as we just add SKUs, it just gets that much harder to plan at that SKU level, and that frankly drives some of the cost, too, for things like the extra touches or in our supply chain or added freight. Things like that. So that's one of the areas that we think is a real opportunity for us going forward.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","And, David, I would say like some of the mix things \u2013 obviously, I think some of those marketplace dynamics were a bit out of our control. I think the complexity caught us a little bit more. We knew there was complexity. It caught us a little bit more than we thought it would. And so what we are focused on is we can take the actions to fix that, and we are.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you for the comments. I'll pass it along.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Rob.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to focus on Amplify for a second. I thought I heard you say that sales were up versus year-ago only about 3%. Our Nielsen data tracking indicates that SkinnyPop popcorn in the U.S. was up more than that. Can you help us reconcile those two things? Like, is the Nielsen data overstating the growth rate of SkinnyPop?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Are you referencing the 360 basis points which is just for us the amount that Amplify contributed to our sales given that it was zero last year, and we had a partial quarter?","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Maybe I misunderstood in your opening remarks, Patricia. So maybe just tell us, like, what's SkinnyPop's growth rate versus year-ago on a retail basis?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Hang on. 6.6%.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So it's up about 6.6%. Is that decelerating versus its normal rate because I remember this used to be like a double-digit growth kind of brand?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","If we look at the latest 12 weeks, it's about 6.3%. Yeah, if we go to the back part of the year \u2013 I'll have to see if we have those numbers here. I thought we did. Hold on. Yeah, we can follow up with you on that. There may be a little bit of deceleration as it's gotten larger, but there's tremendous growth in the category and we're pretty happy with the mid-single-digit growth.","Certainly in the first quarter, the team had built some plans to remove some of the lower ROI trade promotion events that they had prior year, and so that's causing a little bit of an offset to some of the momentum that they had. But as we look at the full-year basis, we're feeling really good. And we have line of sight to some distribution expansion which is, frankly, well deserved on the business, which is going to, I believe, reaccelerate that growth rate.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to John Baumgartner from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele, wanted to dig into the health of the category a bit more, CMG in the U.S., because it seems as though some of the upstream commodity indicators are broken down. You also have rising gas prices, which can't be helpful for C-stores. So have you become more cautious in the category for 2018 since January? And as a follow-up, if you could speak a bit more to your performance in everyday versus seasonal, given that I think Q1 was your third straight share loss in CMG.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure. So we haven't really changed our outlook in the category versus what we shared at CAGNY. So we had shared that we believe the long-term outlook for the category was around 1.5% to 2%. As we look at this year, we believe this year is probably 1% to 1.5% because the long Easter drives a 0.5 point swing between a long Easter year and a short Easter year.","We also continue to be really bullish about the chocolate and non-chocolate part of the category. If you take refreshment out, it continues to have \u2013 grow at an accelerated rate and we anticipate that will be 1.5 points to 2 points of growth for this year.","As we look at share, we had shared previously that we saw our plan for the year to be back-half loaded and we anticipated that our share would be softer in the first part of the year, but we expect to end the year gaining share. So some of that's tied to competitive timing of competitive programming as well as the timing of our own programming. It's certainly always our goal to gain share. And I feel good that as we end the year, we will be on track to be doing that.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much for the question.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Jon.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","One broad question, one detailed question. A lot of talk about complexity on the call and recently, and some amount of complexity, it seems to me, it's always been a trade-off, right? You've been able to grow revenues and profits by great innovation and that innovation necessarily leads to complexity. If anything, the world's become more fragmented and maybe more micro targeting probably is a little bit more rational than necessary, not necessarily for you but for everybody.","So I'm trying to understand how reducing complexity, if this \u2013 what changed in your kind of calculations to want to go after this opportunity right now? And is it the case that \u2013 is it in the future, are we just going to wind up with another more complex business two, three years down the road when we push all the innovation we can with the new SkinnyPop, et cetera, and the great brands that you have?","That's much my broad question. And my narrow question is with these tax credits, Patricia, does the tax rate benefit line up on a quarterly basis with the other expense? So if you buy a credit that lowers your tax rate, do we feel that quarter-to-quarter, or is there ever inter-quarter movement between those two phenomenon? Thank you very much.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So first on your broad question, this certainly is a category that is complex, right? It's a high SKU-driven category with multiple locations in the store. I think as we look at it, though, there is good complexity, strategic complexity, that adds profitable growth and adds value. And there is also bad complexity, where there can be excess that adds items but not driving really incremental profitable growth. And I think one of the most important things we always have to do is keep track of that. I think we got a little bit out of balance on that, and we think it's really important to address that.","So, for example, I'll give you one example. We could have 500 merchandising units, and it might be that when we take a really close look at them, with a couple tweaks, we could get that number in half and generate massive efficiency that takes complexity out of the system.","On the other hand, we are going to continue to add SKUs when it comes to innovation that we think is driving incrementality or new pack types on some of our core items. So it's really a balancing act, but it's keeping the good complexity and shedding the nonprofitable, non-incremental complexity. And it's a category that we just have to stay on top of that and stay focused.","Patricia, I'm going to turn it over to you for the tax question.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","We do put those two together in terms of the other income impacts that you see with the cost of the tax credits with the rates. Those two tend to go together.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","So they don't move quarterly, basically quarter-to-quarter or go together on a yearly basis?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","They go together on a quarterly basis.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. I just wanted to dig in briefly to the incremental SKU rationalization that you're doing I guess. I want to make sure I understand specifically where is that rationalization more focused? Is it primarily within the core\/noncore chocolate franchise? Is it primarily focused on sort of the other non-chocolate broader snacking activities that you've been getting more involved in over the last couple of years? If it's the latter, I'm just trying to get a sense of whether that works, or is that at odds with the type of actions you're taking to get into this broader snacking environment to go after that growth?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. So Andrew, this is really not tied to the snacking initiative. This is really (45:23). I think we have pretty good line of sight and, frankly, a much smaller number of SKUs in the portfolio in snacking.","This is really focused on looking at the broad core confection, all the brands, all the pack types we have and actually all the merchandising units as well. So it's really more focused on optimizing that, making sure that we are as focused as possible on driving the core, and making the decisions to have the highest velocity items on the shelf everywhere we possibly can. So it's really within that core piece of the business.","Patricia, anything you want to add to that?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, Michele gave a great example about the merchandising units. I'll give you another one that's really core to us, and that's things like Halloween assortments. We tend to have five different approaches to that, but then over time we've migrated to where we do a lot of customer-specific assortments.","And this year what we did is we really optimized our base levels, and those have proved to be so well designed that we can eliminate some of the customer-specific assortments. And that just takes complexity out, makes the customer happy, makes the consumer happy. So that's an example of where we see the complexity creep in that we don't think is adding value to ourselves, the customer or the consumer.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. So I want to just follow up. You had made a comment earlier, or there was a comment made earlier, just about the sort of the shift between advertising and trade spend. And so leaning a little bit more to trade spend this year, can you just elaborate a little bit more on is that a response to like cross-category type elasticity? So trying to sort of position your core chocolate confections better against maybe some of the other categories where they're near-in? Maybe some of the snack bars, that type of thing? Or is it more a response to just competitive activity near-in within your core chocolate franchise?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. I would say it's much more a near-in chocolate franchise view and looking at a couple specific areas of opportunity on certain pack types and at certain customers that we wanted to take advantage of that made really good business sense.","I also just want to reinforce that even with that shift in total, advertising on our core chocolate brands was up in Q1, and we expect it to be up for the full year. So we've shifted the advertising away from places that were less strategically important within the portfolio.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And where you've done it, has it also come with incremental distribution? I guess what I've noticed in some of the impulse channels, like convenience and gas, for instance, where you've had the price \u2013 the promotions, you've also had out of aisle display. You've had some sort of display attached to it. So fair to say when you're spending the trade it's not just on price but it's also to get better placement or some merchandising attached to it?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, I would say that is entirely what drove the (48:51) investment. This is a category obviously driven by impulse, and our primary goal with trade is to get merchandising display. Our secondary goal is price. I think that's a very accurate way to think about it.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Wow, a daily double. Okay. Just regarding the guidance, your EPS guidance is unchanged, but you have also lowered the tax rate. So that alone implies a lower operating income for the year. But then I think what you also said is that you're going to cut the SG&A and kind of reallocate it towards CapEx about $25 million. So is this in a way kind of saying that, okay, our operating income is lower than what we thought even though there's another $25 million of SG&A that's being reduced and just kind of reallocated? So it's kind of like, I don't know, maybe $50 million, for example, on a fundamental basis?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, Patricia, go ahead, you can take that.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, I think Michele did a good job of talking about where the recovery comes from, and again about half of it is on that SG&A Margin for Growth target as well as the improved Amplify accretion. And then a quarter of it is that tax rate. So if you think about above the tax rate, yes, that's where you're going to see some leakage. And then the remaining quarter is that shift from where we had some reinvestment sort of earmarked in our P&L at the beginning of the year, and we've moved that to CapEx. So that's a total help. So if you think about it, about three-quarters of it is being offset above taxes, and about a quarter of it is not.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So a quarter of it is not being offset by the tax rate? Okay.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","No, I'm sorry. I want to be super clear. About three-quarters of it is offset at the operating income EBIT line, and about a quarter of it is offset at the tax line to get you the full offset. Just super clear.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Steven Strycula from UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just want to follow up on a few of the gross margin questions. Patricia, if we had to boil it down or kind of break down the 120 basis point delta from where you initially guided versus today, how would you kind of segment that between necessarily trade versus freight and logistics versus raw materials if you had to kind of break it down to those three buckets? Just so we conceptually understand where the weakness is coming from. Thank you.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","It's all of those buckets. We're not getting into that level of specificity, but what we've done is called out the big pieces, and you should think about those as all are (51:57) important to the pressure and all the things that we're going to be tackling with the initiatives that Michele mentioned.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","And in that vein, should we expect the second quarter gross margin rate of decline to be comparable to the first quarter? Is that kind of what you're trying to insinuate? Is that fair?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And the last piece and I'll pass it along, what was the logic in the accounting switch from the ERP spending expensed to capitalized? At what point did you kind of think that that was \u2013 you made the decision to go down that path? Thank you.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","I want to separate those two things. So first of all, in second quarter, we are expecting a little bit more ERP spending. And that's something that I called out, versus what we've been running at. And that's just the normal timing of any kind of program like that. What we did separately from that is we had earmarked some of our savings from the tax benefit, the overall Jobs Act tax benefit, to reinvest in the business. And we decided that the best way to do that was to really focus on CapEx. Some of the capacity or DC initiatives, as well as some programming, but not related to the ERP system. Does that answer your question?","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, that clarifies it. Thank you so much.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Good morning.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. So the deterioration in pricing, particularly in North America this year, do you expect that to rebound going forward, i.e., could we actually get back into positive year-on-year territory in the next quarter or two?","And then the follow-up question is are new channels like e-commerce, for example, part of this complexity issue? I guess what I'm really asking is, is e-commerce investment likely to be a big area that you're putting money into going forward? Thank you. And I'll pass it on.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, Alexia, I'll hit the e-commerce one and then I'll let Patricia talk about your first part of your question. We are continuing to increase our investment in e-commerce. And I think you made a mention, perhaps, about complexity when you asked about that. That would be an example of good strategic complexity. I mean, we're certainly looking for efficiency as we build e-commerce, but that would be a place that we'd be investing in because certainly there's a tremendous (54:26) growth opportunity there. So we are continuing to increase our investments there because we're getting really nice growth.","Patricia, you want to talk a little bit about the trade price outlook?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. So we were hit a little bit harder, Alexia, in the first quarter on trade because of the true-ups that we do annually in the first quarter related to prior year. And that won't be an impact in the second through the fourth quarters. We're not at the point of giving guidance about specifics down to the pricing level, but we did have an outsized impact in the first quarter.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hello, everyone.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you for allowing me to ask a question. I appreciate it. Hey, I guess I want to come back to and build off a few of the questions that were asked so far.","A lot of what seems to be transpiring with the portfolio seems very reminiscent of what was happening maybe a decade ago. Adding more complexity to the portfolio to drive growth, and I know you're on the back end of that. And also shifting advertising to trade to drive impulse at point of purchase. Those tactics worked well until they didn't a little over a decade ago. And now, we're talking about you still putting more trade in, still suffering market share losses. It feels like they're not working that well today either.","Now, last time, it clearly led to a path of the business stalling out, ultimately a rebase that set you up to grow anew. Why shouldn't we be concerned that we're ultimately on the same path, a path to kind of needing to rebase to reinvest to reaccelerate growth?","And given the category is not quite as resilient as it was back then, competitive intensity seems more elevated. The input cost curve is going the wrong way. And you've got a lot of other stuff on your plate with diversification. It feels like this time could even be worse. Where do you see us maybe off base with that line of thinking?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So first of all, I would say shifting from advertising to trade, we have a very strong investment in advertising. So 10, 12 years ago, advertising as a percent of net sales was 2%. We are about 9% now at industry-leading levels and we are still at that, even with a minor shift. This was a minor shift to trade of like a couple tenths. So we still have very, very strong advertising levels. So on that piece, I would say there's just not even comparability whatsoever.","I think from an SKU perspective, we continue with our strategy to be very focused on driving the core. We always have been. And when complexity ekes into the business, we have to address it. So I think from that perspective, you may say that addressing complexity, as we've done it in the past, is something that needs to be done. And that might be similar to where we were at some point in time, but I think the benefit of that drove some significant growth on the business on a go-forward basis because that usually tends to result in a much greater focus on some of the core most profitable SKUs, and I think creates opportunity for us.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. I appreciate that. And one sort of unrelated follow-up, in regards to the cost curve, if we look back over history, this has been a category where the pricing power has been exceptional relative to the rest of food. And when you face cost pressure, you're able to pass it through. Great discipline in the industry. In context of sort of the proliferation of broader snacks and the greater array of competitors you're facing today, do you feel that that equation or that relationship may have changed at all, or is it \u2013 do you still believe you have the same degree of pricing power and ability that you have in the past?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Well, obviously we can't speak directly to pricing. What I would say is we still feel really good about the category, and every category and the dynamics within the categories are different. The category of confection continues to grow.","We as a company are somewhat differentiated in terms of that very significant investment that we make in our brands at industry-leading levels, what we just talked about relative to advertising, and we continue to have low private label penetration in our category.","So we're always looking to work collaboratively with our retail partners and look at the marketplace and make sure we have the right product news, the right investment, and the right pricing to benefit all of us for the long term health of the category.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to Pablo Zuanic with SIG.","Aatish Shah - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning. This is Aatish Shah on for Pablo. Just have a question on seasonal chocolates, specifically if you could tell us what percent of total chocolate for Hershey's sales this is? And then, does this percentage vary much from the first half to second half? And given that Hershey's under-indexed in this, is there an opportunity there?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So seasons as a part of our business is about one-third, so our business breaks out about a third seasons, about a third instant consumables, and about a third take home. There does tend to be a little bit of back half focus given the size of Halloween and holidays together, which are larger categories than Valentine's Day and Easter combined, and we continue to feel good about the seasonal chocolate sales that we have in the marketplace.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. We are not under-indexed in seasonal. It's clearly a strength of ours in the marketplace.","Aatish Shah - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. And just one quick follow-up. I'm not sure if you touched on this. Could you just comment on your cocoa hedging practices? I don't know if you release that kind of level of detail?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Patricia, do you want to talk about that?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. We hedge a number of our commodities. We hedge out for 3 months to 24 months in layers. We look for getting price visibility and sort of easing into any market disruptions. We can't hedge all of our ingredients, but those that we can, we have a longstanding and effective hedging program.","Aatish Shah - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thank you.","Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

My name is Keith, and I will be your conference operator for today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many of you as possible. Please note this call may be recorded.","Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark Pogharian","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session with them; Michele Buck, President, North America and Myself.","Let me remind everyone listening that today\u2019s conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on our current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, because of factors such as those listed in this morning\u2019s press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC.","If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss 4Q results, excluding net pre-tax charges of $39 million, or $0.10 per share-diluted, primarily related to the productivity initiative announced in June, a non-service related pension expense, and acquisition and integration charges. Our discussions of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","John Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark. We made progress against many of our strategic initiatives in 2015. And despite a difficult environment in the second-half of the year, we delivered adjusted earnings per share diluted growth within the targeted range we provided during our second quarter conference call.","Fourth quarter net sales on a constant currency basis was slightly below our expectations and declined about 3%. North America gross margin expansion resulted in solid operating profit growth and we continue to hold the line on overall expense control.","Hershey U.S. CMG retail takeaway sequentially improved from Q3 to Q4, and increased plus 2.5%, although market share was up about 0.2 point. Seasonal performance was good and we gained market share in both Halloween and holiday. Our fourth quarter marketplace performance was similar to the full-year.","Specifically combined fourth quarter retail takeaway at one of our largest retailers and within the dollar and drug channels was a solid plus 6%. The drug class of trade was driven by our precision initiatives, while the other two channels were winners from a consumer trips perspective.","However, in the remaining channels, our combined retail takeaway was only slightly up, while small, we also had meaningful gains in non-measured channels, such as e-commerce and food service.","For the full-year, Hershey U.S. CMG retail takeaway increased 2.4% and was largely in line with category growth. As a result for the 52 weeks ended December 26, 2015, Hershey U.S. market share was an industry-leading 31.3%. Following a period of relatively consistent marketplace success where we outperformed the category, our momentum slowed in the second-half of 2015, and was relatively in line with the CMG category as a result of increased competitive activity within CMG and broader snacks.","Over the last three years, the average growth rate of the CMG category was about 2.3% below the long-term historical average of 3% to 4%. As we previously discussed the category is being impacted by many of the same issues facing other food categories, including changing shopping habits like channel shifting, increased competitive activity and some retailers adjusting their merchandising practices, and a proliferation of broader snack SKUs.","As a result going forward, we estimate that CMG category growth will be in the 2.5% to 3% range. Our goal is to outpace the category and gain share on an annual basis. Additionally, we have good visibility into our developing snacks portfolio and expect positive sales contributions from it in 2016.","Given our solid CMG position in North America and the investments we will continue to make in our snacks business, we expect our North America segment to generate long-term constant currency annual net sales growth of 3% to 4%. As we look to 2016 and beyond, we\u2019re taking actions that we believe will enable us to regain our North America marketplace momentum over our strategic planning cycle.","Some of the things you\u2019ll see in the marketplace in 2016 to address broader snacking, income bifurcation, and lower trips include a broad-based launch of substantial snacking items, including Brookside Bars, Snack Mix, and Snack Bites canisters, as well as increased distribution of Krave meat snacks.","You\u2019ll see incremental investments related to core CMG merchandising in display activity and the introduction of branded pods that bring our brands to life in-store. Although note that this will result in higher trade promotion as we strive to maintain the right mix of quality merchandising and related promotional price points.","We\u2019ll also launch Cadbury Chocolates to the stand-up pouch targeting the mass premium market and begin a 500 store test featuring Scharffen Berger and Dagoba organic brands. And we\u2019ll introduce Allan Candy sugar confectionery items in peg bags to appeal to a cost conscious consumer. This is just a brief summary, excuse me, of some of the activity we have in North America this year.","Now for an update on our international business. In late December, we reached an agreement to acquire the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016 subject to government approval. While the category in business has experienced slower growth, we\u2019re committed to the China market and the acquisition of Golden Monkey is important to Hershey\u2019s future growth.","We believe in the complementary advantages of Hershey and Golden Monkey and the opportunity that we have with these businesses together. Earlier this month we kicked off the year of the Golden Monkey campaign. The key elements of the campaign include activating TV and mobile advertising and executing merchandising and display at retail. This is well underway, as it started in early January.","Our China Chocolate fourth quarter net sales results were less than our expectations, as we adjusted our sell-in for Chinese New Year given category softness. In Q4, the contraction of the China Chocolate category accelerated and was down about 13%. As a result for the full-year, the category was about flat versus last year.","In a slowing category and our overweighting in hypermarkets, this has impacted our performance negatively. In 2015, Hershey retail takeaway was off a 11% and market share declined 1.1 points to 8.5%. Similar to what we discussed over the last year, category performance is being impacted by macro economic issues and the related impact it\u2019s having on consumer shopping behavior and confidence.","And given the China news flow that we\u2019ve all seen, it continues to be difficult to gauge the consumers behavior. We\u2019re focused on the integration of our businesses in building distribution on our portfolio. And while small, our e-commerce business in China is a bright spot. In the fourth quarter, our e-commerce business increased over 75%, driven by solid China singles day performance.","For the year, our China Chocolate e-commerce retail takeaway outpaced the category. In 2016, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our e-commerce platform, increase Brookside distribution and trial, and focus on channel development. In Mexico, net sales in local currency for the quarter were about flat versus previous year.","For the full-year, local currency sales increased 6%. Within the chocolate category, we\u2019re seeing investments by all major manufacturers in a form of new products in core brand investments. As a result, our chocolate marketplace performances lagged the category. Chocolate market share in the modern trade in Mexico for the year is off as our retail takeaway of about 4%, lagged category growth of about 12%.","In 2016 within the modern trade, we\u2019ll concentrate on portfolio core chocolate Hershey\u2019s and Kisses franchises and our small but profitable grocery branded items. Our traditional trade initiative with Sigma is progressing, and we expect our market share here to improve this year.","In Brazil, local currency net sales in Q4 were slightly down versus last year, given the macroeconomic environment and competitive activity. In 2015, we were the fastest growing chocolate company in Brazil, as retail takeaway increased about 13%, resulting in a share gain of 0.2 point.","In 2015, we successfully exited Bauducco JV and established our own sales team and secured logistics agreements. In 2016, we expect the growth will be driven by Hershey\u2019s brand mainly through pricing and core innovation.","Constant currency net sales in India declined in line with estimates around the phase out of our edible oils products. This completes our transition to a confectionery and snacks-based portfolio. We believe the macroeconomic environment and competitive activity in the international markets where we operate will continue to be a headwind for the chocolate category and Hershey in 2016. Therefore, we estimate constant currency international and other segment net sales growth of mid to high single digits in 2016.","Over the long-term, we expect global economies when category trends to improve and our national business \u2013 and our international business on a constant currency basis will contribute about one point to our overall long-term sales target.","Despite the aforementioned macroeconomic issues facing consumers and competitive activity, we believe the global confectionery category will continue to grow. We\u2019ll continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S., as well as capabilities related to knowledge and insights.","And despite the slowdown in the international markets, we will build on the strategies that we\u2019ve established, as they will benefit the company over the long-term. We\u2019ll also make incremental investments in our existing snacks platform, as it will provided us with another lever of growth. These initiatives should enable us to achieve long-term constant currency net sales growth of 3% to 5%.","Given the scale advantages of our North America business and a balanced approach to international investments, the company expects to generate long-term earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%.","Patricia will provide you with all of financial details that we believe are innovation, advertising, consumer investments and insights, work within our confectionery and snacks business should enable us to deliver on our 2016 objectives. Although note that sales and earnings will build throughout the year, as our Q1 profile will continue to be pressured.","For the full-year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange of about 1 point, constant currency net sales growth is expected to be around 3%, resulting in an increase of adjusted earnings per share diluted of about 6%.","As we look to the long-term, I remain encouraged by our prospects. Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its U.S. scale, global brands, and core capabilities. Additionally, we\u2019re continuously examining our manufacturing footprint and overall cost structure and believe opportunities exist to maintain and improve margins. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong and we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined in open to sources of growth via M&A.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with some additional details on our financial results.","Patricia Little","Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Fourth quarter net sales of $1.91 billion decreased 5% versus last year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.08, an increase of 3.8% versus last year.","Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.9 points, net sales declined 3.1%. Pricing and net acquisitions and divestitures were 1 point and a 40 basis point benefit respectively, offset by 4.5 points of lower volume, due to slightly lower sales in North America versus estimates and the expected sales decline in China.","Fourth quarter North America net sales were slightly below expectations, due to a decline in spreads and baking chips sales due to increased competitive activity. Our focus on inventory levels at select retailers most likely looking to manage working capital and slightly lower seasonal sales than anticipated.","Excluding the 1 point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 1.2% versus the year-ago period. Net price realization in this segment was a 2.3 point benefit and volume was off 1.4 points. On a net basis, the Allan Candy and Krave acquisitions in the Mauna Loa divestiture were 30 basis point benefit.","Total international and other segment net sales for the fourth quarter declined about 27% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates and trade promotion were unfavorable by 5.7 and 4.2 points, respectively. In October, Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition sales were 1.1 point benefit. The international and other segment core business volume was off about 18 points, due primarily to the Chinese chocolate business and Golden Monkey November and December performance that was less than a year-ago.","Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin increased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter, however, this was less than our forecast. Gross margin expansion was driven by net price realization, which was off versus our estimates. Supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives partially offset by obsolescence, other supply chain costs due to lower volumes and slightly higher commodities. We did benefit from lower dairy, however, this was offset by the higher cost of simple ingredients.","We called during fourth quarter, we nationally debut Holiday Hershey\u2019s Kisses Milk Chocolates and Hershey\u2019s Milk Chocolate Bars made with simple ingredients and no artificial flavors. These are some of the first products in Hershey to transition to simple ingredients of commitment announced last year.","Operating profit in the fourth quarter increased 1.3% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margin of 19.9%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses.","SM&A excluding advertising and related consumer marketing and acquisitions and divestitures declined 5.9%, driven by the implementation of the business productivity initiative announced in June and the company\u2019s continued focus on nonessential SM&A spending.","Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined around 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2014; driven by planned reductions in international spending.","North America on-air advertising was higher in the fourth quarter, although advertising and related consumer marketing expense for the quarter was in line with the year ago period, as production costs were less than anticipated. For the full-year, North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 3.1%.","Now, let me provide a brief update on our international business. As J.P. mentioned earlier, we reached an agreement in late December to acquire the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey. The agreement is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, subject to government approval. We are concentrating on bringing the businesses together and focused on optimizing the structure for top line growth. This is still a work in progress and we\u2019ll share our plans with you in the future. In the near-term, the business will not get back to the operating income level of 2014, and will be a drag on total company operating profit in 2016.","China chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical growth rate of a 11% to 12%. In fourth quarter, the China chocolate category was down about 13%, as marketplace trends slowed across all channels affecting all major manufacturers. This contraction impacted our Chinese New Year sell-in, China chocolate category growth in 2016 is expected to be flat to slightly up versus 2015. We estimate that our retail takeaway will be relatively in line with category performance.","In 2016, our China chocolate operating loss is expected to improve versus 2015, as we expect trade promotion to be lower. However, margins will be pressured, given the decline in growth sales volume.","Mexico fourth quarter net sales in local currency were about flat versus last year. For the full-year, local currency sales increased 6%. Brazil fourth quarter local currency net sales were down slightly versus last year, given the tough macroeconomic environment and competitive activity. As a result, we are managing our costs and focusing on core brand SKUs that we think will enable us to improve our profitability in these two markets.","India fourth quarter local currency sales declined about 60%, and we are in line with estimates, as we phased out sales of edible oils at the end of the third quarter. We expect this to continue to be a headwind for the first eight months of 2016.","Moving down to P&L, fourth quarter interest expense of $19.2 million declined $2.1 million versus last year, or 9.7%. For the full-year, interest expense was $76 million and was in line with our previous estimate.","In 2016, we expect interest expense to be about $85 to $90 million. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.3% and 33.2% for the full-year, slightly better than our estimates. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $25 million within the other income and expense line related to the previously mentioned U.S. Government investment tax credits.","In 2016, we expect to purchase about the same amount of tax credits as we did last year, which should result in an adjusted tax rate that\u2019s similar to 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 219 million shares, down 5 million versus last year and about a $0.02 benefit in the quarter, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.8, or an increase of 3.8% versus a year ago.","Now, let me provide a quick recap of year-to-date results. Year-to-date net sales decreased 0.5%. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 1.1% versus a year ago period.","Operating profit increased 1.8%, resulting in operating profit margin of 20%. Year-to-date, adjusted gross margin was 46% versus 44.9% last year, or a 110 basis points higher as a result of net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and slightly higher commodity costs. Year-to-date, adjusted earnings per share diluted increased about 3.5% to $4.12 per share.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the fourth quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter by $40 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $2 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $50 million and accounts payable declined by $8 million.","Total capital additions, including software were $119 million in the fourth quarter and $357 million for the year in line with our forecast. This included capital related to the manufacturing facility in Malaysia. In 2016, we expect CapEx to be in the $285 to $295 million range.","During the fourth quarter, depreciation and amortization was $62 million and dividends paid were $123 million. No shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter under approved program and to-date $230 million of outstanding shares have been repurchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015.","For the full-year, the company repurchased $403 million of outstanding shares. In addition, the company repurchased $15 million of common shares in the quarter and a $180 million year-to-date to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.","This morning, we announced that the Board approved an additional $500 million share repurchase program that will commence after the current program is completed. This authorization is the result of the company\u2019s strong balance sheet and confidence that we\u2019ll deliver long-term earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%.","We believe, this business model will enable the company to generate meaningful and predictable cash flow from operations. As such, we\u2019ll continue to have Board level discussions related to capital structure, including dividend increases, value-added share buybacks, and M&A opportunities.","Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $347 million. This is lower than a year ago, primarily due to acquisitions and share buyback. In 2015, we faced a number of challenges as a result of changing shopping behavior and greater levels of competition. Our plans for 2016 and beyond reflect the reality of the current retail and consumer environment.","We are confident in our ability over the long-term to execute at retail and provide consumers with CMG and snack products that can drive growth. As J.P. mentioned, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S. and key international markets and build on the strategies we have established, as they will benefit the company over the long-term.","We\u2019ll also make incremental investments in our existing snacks platform, as it will provide us with another level \u2013 lever of growth. These initiatives should enable us to achieve long-term constant currency net sales growth of 3% to 5%. Given the scale advantages of our North America CMG business, snacks margins that are lower than the company average and a balanced approach to international investments, the company expects to generate long-term adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%.","For the full-year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange about 1 point, constant currency net sales growth is expected to increase around 3%. The company expects gross margin to be about the same as last year. The business productivity initiative announced in June is on track and the company is also focused on nonessential SM&A spending, as it continues to leverage existing resources.","Additionally, we\u2019ll continue to invest in advertising and related consumer marketing, including a greater shift to digital and mobile communications. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase around 6%.","Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on some of the items pressuring the first quarter. First, Easter is a week shorter this year. Also, merchandising in display space will be lower at select retailers, as we will not lap their new floor designs until late in second quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, some of them are also focusing on caring lower levels of inventory.","As J.P. stated, direct trade will also be hired to ensure that we maintain the right mix of quality merchandising and promotional price points. Competition for this space in the store is robust. And we continue to listen to the consumer and invest in simple ingredients, which were currently purchasing at a slight premium to traditional ingredients.","Thank you for your time this morning. And we\u2019ll now take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Please note this call is recorded. And we can take our first question from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Baumgartner","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question.","Patricia Little","Hey, good morning, John.","John Bilbrey","Good morning, John.","John Baumgartner","John, [indiscernible] I think Michele spoke to the plans for 2015, it was pretty specific in terms of the improvements in the retail coverage and space acquisition and sourcing from snacking. And in Q4, you also had a bump from marketing, but we didn\u2019t really see much aware ofshare gains, as the year unfold us. So maybe just in hindsight, how did your execution evolve relative to that CAGNYplan, and what\u2019s holding back your share gains there?","Michele Buck","Yes. So, John, thanks for the question, it\u2019s Michele. I would say two things relative to Q4. First of all, our biggest shortfall in Q2 \u2013 in Q4 was really around our grocery and snacks business. So we saw a lot of competitive activity, both in baking and as well in spreads. And I would say on spreads to some degree, we\u2019ve really learned our way to where we will win in that category, where we\u2019ll focus. We\u2019re doing well in jars and we\u2019ve seen some price value issues in the instant consumables.","And then I would say the other pieces when it comes to CMG, we gained share in the season, so we had solid growth. But we didn\u2019t gain as much as we anticipated, because frankly, we saw more competitive activity during the marketplace, and we have adjusted our plans coming into the year, this year to really dial up to be even more competitive to regain that share momentum.","John Baumgartner","Is there a sense that it involves more trade promo going forward or balance between advertising and promo?","Patricia Little","There absolutely is more trade promotion and more trade investment. And as we look to this year, you will see us investing more in trade. There are more snack options out there, so there\u2019s more competition. As you know, there are some retailers who are going to cleaner floor policies and so there is a little bit less space and more competition for it, so.","John Bilbrey","One of the things, John, you would have seen over the course of the year, if you just look at CMG pricing relatively modest as we got into the fourth quarter, you could see a bit of lower pricing versus some of our average pricing as well and we believe that may have had an impact on some of our business.","John Baumgartner","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","John Bilbrey","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning, everyone. So I guess just one question related to the change in your long-term growth algorithm. And I guess, could you describe, I think in the previous algorithm, there was some explicit expectation that M&A would be a contributor to the growth algorithm? So could you talk about in the 3% to 5% sales growth expectation, is there any expectation for M&A?","And also I guess within that how much are you expecting in North America sort of the non-confections business to contribute to growth? So the expansion of things like Krave and other snacks, how does that build into the 3% to 5%? Thanks.","John Bilbrey","So for clarification, we would not have had M&A in any of our previous guidance, nor would it be in the current algorithm. The way you think about it broadly without breaking out the Krave pieces of the business, which are \u2013 some of those is relatively small. You should really be looking at three to four in North America, one in international. So if you think about this year, it certainly falls within that range. But I think as you saw in our comment, we talked about 2.5% to 3% and a point. So I think that\u2019s a good way to think about it in terms of 2016.","Patricia Little","And specifically on snacking we\u2019ve looked to have that at between 0.5 point and a point off of the CMG.","John Baumgartner","Okay. Thank you.","John Bilbrey","Yes.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","John Bilbrey","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Goldman","Good morning. Hey, everybody. According to Nielsen, I know it doesn\u2019t tell a whole story. It looks like there were some share losses for Hershey in both the Halloween and Christmas Seasonal Candy or at least especially Chocolate. First of all, is that accurate?","And second, could you give us a little color about what happened and what the company is doing, if it is an issue to remedy the problem this year?","John Bilbrey","So if you look at both of those on a volume basis, if you look at all of our seasons over the course of the year, we were up about 3.7% on a volume basis. If you look at Halloween, it was about, I think about 7.5, and it was about half that I think it was 3 point, so 3 something on holiday. But it\u2019s about a 0.25 point in terms of share, which is below what we would have set our targets. But we did gain share in both of those at a modest level, but we did gain share.","Ken Goldman","Okay.","John Bilbrey","And if you just \u2013 so I\u2019ll just leave it at that unless Michelle has anything she wants to add.","Michele Buck","No, I would just go back to the comment I made about some increased competitive trade dollars to get merchandising during the seasons and we\u2019ve adjusted that in terms of our offerings going forward.","Ken Goldman","Okay. I\u2019ll follow-up after the call. Thank you.","John Bilbrey","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","John Bilbrey","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Katzman","Hi, good morning, everybody. I guess on the \u2013 my first question has to do with the Premium. I think J.P. you mentioned going with Dagoba and Scharffen Berger?","John Bilbrey","And also we\u2019d be introducing a Cadbury item as well that Cad \u2013 the couple of those would be think \u2013 you think about those as mass premium and then Scharffen Berger would obviously be in super premium.","Mark Pogharian","Yes, and remember, Eric, there was a \u2013 the latter Scharffen Berger and Dagoba more of a 500 store test market right now.","Michele Buck","500 selected kind of retail environment test. But Cadbury is a broader offering since it plays in mass premium.","Eric Katzman","Okay. And then just a follow up more of an accounting question, I guess, for Patricia. So now that you own a 100% of SGM. Does that mean that there\u2019s greater EBIT losses that have to be recognized versus, I guess, maybe you had a minority interest kind of a back out on the net income line, or on a pre-tax basis. But this International EBIT get negatively affected by the fact that you now own a 100%, and then I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks.","Patricia Little","No, it doesn\u2019t. So first just to be completely technical, we haven\u2019t yet closed the rest of the Golden Monkey, and it\u2019s been a 100% consolidated from day one.","John Bilbrey","Day one yes.","Eric Katzman","Okay.","John Bilbrey","So a 100% of their sales and a live loss Eric has been in our P&L since day one.","Eric Katzman","Okay, okay. Thank you. Pass it on.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","John Bilbrey","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everybody. Can I ask about the outlook for 2016 on the Chocolate category in the U.S.? It looks from the Nielsen data though it\u2019s been very on-again, off-again a lot more precarious I guess that we\u2019ve seen in previous years. What do you think happening in there in terms of consumer behavior, retailer behavior, and are you confident that or where do you see the category gets back to as we get back maybe into the middle of the year and past the Easter pressure? Thank you.","John Bilbrey","Well, I think that we would see Chocolate by itself being somewhere between 2 and 2.5, it\u2019s a fairly broad range. I think, Alexia, what we think about in our 2016 plan is, we\u2019re going to have a strong focus on our core brands and then we also think there\u2019s an opportunity for us as we\u2019ve looked at quality merge over 2015, that innovation plays an important role and being able to get that incremental quality merged even and be competitive. So we\u2019re also very focused on that.","So, I think what we\u2019ll see is as long as there is a strong focus against big core brands and then we can achieve good quality merge against our innovation activity, that becomes the incremental activity that makes us competitive, not only within chocolate specifically, as you asked, but it also makes us competitive against any potential trial at least you\u2019ll get from competitive brands, so\u2026","Patricia Little","Alexia, I would just add to that. We also know chocolate is really a destination for the seasons, during the seasonal periods, and that will continue. So I think, we kind of think about it, that\u2019s a solid foundation and base that consumers are looking for chocolate in particular around those times, in addition to all the other comments J.P. made about how we\u2019re seeing the year.","Alexia Howard","Thank you. In the interest of time, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from David Driscoll with Citi Research.","John Bilbrey","Good morning, David.","Alexis Bornin","Hi, good morning. This is actually Alexis Bornin in for David this morning.","John Bilbrey","Okay. Greetings.","Alexis Bornin","Hi, international. So Hershey\u2019s international segment was profitable in 2013 and 2014. How obviously the segment took a big step backwards in 2015. When do you expect the segment to return to profitability?","Patricia Little","That is not something that we layout an exact timetable on. But clearly, we are not going to be back to those 2014 levels in 2016.","Alexis Bornin","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","John Bilbrey","Good morning, Jason.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, folks. How are you?","John Bilbrey","Good.","Patricia Little","Good.","Jason English","Good, good. A couple of questions or clarification. There is a lot of trade spent in international that was clearly a negative price drag for you. Should we expect that to continue into next year? And I heard reference to trying to correct some price gaps in CMG, a little more trade spend in North America as well there. Should we expect pricing to be a bit of a drag in that segment as well?","John Bilbrey","Well, I think what you\u2019re going to see in total is that, it will be a more of competitive environment and that you\u2019ll see a greater trade spin in 2016 than you would have seen in 2015, which could lead to some lower net prices. And so obviously that makes \u2013 that obviously has a mix effect in terms of the P&L.","Michele Buck","The other thing I would just add to that, I think it is important to note some of the trade spending will go into promoted price points, but some of that will also be investment to really get spaced in other ways.","John Bilbrey","Yes, because, Jason, Michelle\u2019s last point it\u2019s pretty important, with more snacks, we\u2019ve all seen them coming on over the last few years, I don\u2019t think that will abate. Everybody is trying to get to the perimeter of the store. So that\u2019s based \u2013 it\u2019s not expanding anymore let\u2019s face it. It\u2019s just very competitive to get.","Jason English","Yes, got it. And then one other quick follow-up question. You mentioned the cost upgrades weigh in our margins in terms of simple ingredients, as well as the mixed impact from lower margin snacking items. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of margin headwind you\u2019re anticipating in 2016 from those initiatives?","Michele Buck","I mean, we typically don\u2019t talk about inflation, the inflation as a percent looking forward, we\u2019ll always tell you what it is. When we report for various competitive reasons, we don\u2019t want to get into that level of specificity right now. But we do have net inflation this year.","Jason English","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning, everybody.","John Bilbrey","Hey, good morning.","Jonathan Feeney","I want a little bit more detail about the competitive landscape, not only within chocolate candy. You mentioned pretty high levels of competition a couple times in the narrative, but also some of yourcompetitive sort of pushback and different behavior you might have gotten from some of this extension into other categories with Krave and some of the non-candy snacks?","Michele Buck","Yes, I think, so I think we\u2019ve been fairly clear in terms of how we\u2019ve talked about the confectionary environment. If I go beyond broader snacks, the comment I would make specifically to meat snacks is that in the premium segment that we compete, the meat snacks business continues to be up about 25%, overall meat has slowed a bit in terms of growth, and of course a core part of our focus is to continue to build distribution around the Krave business and then also you\u2019ll us introducing some extended items to the current line that we have as we built out that distribution.","So from that standpoint, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a significant, difference is probably a positive for us. If you think about broader snacking, I think I said on a previous call that as you look over the last 18 to 24 months, there\u2019s about 80 SKUs, which have been added in that segment. And therefore, it\u2019s more fragmented it has before gives the consumer different alternatives for trial. And therefore, we\u2019ve seen some competitiveness and a little bit of a competitive pressure from there.","But I think, again, it comes back to making sure in each segment that we compete that we\u2019re winning merchandising and display, as we talked about earlier. But those would be a couple of things that I think are part of the existing landscape that we face.","Jonathan Feeney","Thanks, J.P.","John Bilbrey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","John Bilbrey","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning. Hershey obviously talks a lot historically about being a gross margin focused company. I guess, this year you\u2019ve got to reinvest a little of that into trade promotion and you\u2019ve got some ingredient cost you\u2019ve talked about from some of the new products and things. I guess, is it a shift at all in Hershey\u2019s long-term emphasis on gross margins, or more getting the base right and moving from there?","And then last thing would be with the reduction in the long-term growth outlook, I guess, does it change management\u2019s or the Board\u2019s view on thinking about maybe creating even if it\u2019s larger scale partnerships, or in pieces of the business, whether it would be overseas or in the U.S. to, I guess, help compete and grow, it\u2019s kind of a broader question?","John Bilbrey","Yes. So I think if you think about your first question around gross margin, we\u2019ll always defend our brands and we\u2019ll be brand building consumer centric company and invest in our brands. But I would tell you that it\u2019s not a change in philosophy. We continue to be a gross margin focused company. And there maybe years of periods of time when you have to change the way you get there. But we\u2019ll always have the gross margin at the top of our list and again there can always be a mix effect of how you get there.","I\u2019m not going to speculate around any kinds of comments from partnerships and things like that. We continue to look for ways to grow and build our business and things that are good for our shareholders. And so, we\u2019re continuously looking at our strategic options in terms of how we build our business. And so that would be the only comment that I would make.","Andrew Lazar","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","John Bilbrey","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Moskow","Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I thought that the guidance for 2016 sounds very reasonable and sets a logical base. But the one assumption I wanted to ask you about was China, I think, going back to kind of flat to up a little bit from a category perspective. And then just in the broader context of international being down as much as it was. What are the drivers that that you think helps China stabilize especially given your modern trade exposure?","And then the other countries too, you have economic issues in Brazil. Mexico was very competitive. It seem like this is an area where you\u2019ve been surprised in the past. Did you consider something a little more cautious just in the near-term for international?","John Bilbrey","Yes. There is a couple of things that I would say and maybe Patricia and I both talk about this a little bit. But if you look at the total international business about 80% of the impact of that business really occurred in China. And so we know that that was a very unique event. About another 10% of that was really India in the oils business and then, of course, you have the impact of the FX. And then in a local currency basis, of course, you had both Brazil and Mexico, which were positive contributors albeit modestly. So that\u2019s a little bit of where you see us come out. Also and I mentioned this a bit earlier, as we look at our different opportunities, I think what you\u2019ll see us is moderate our pace and approach to where we think we could best allocate capital and still be consistent with our long-term investments and strategies.","And so, that also has an influence, I think, and I think it\u2019s quite pragmatic actually to go to where you think the ball was going to be. So those are a couple of comments that I would make. I don\u2019t know Patricia has anything or perspective that she want to add to that.","Patricia Little","Yes, I think that we \u2013 clearly, it was a tough year in China overall and it was this combination of macroeconomic forces in China that we\u2019re not alone in experiencing, as well as the added complexity of an integration that didn\u2019t \u2013 an acquisition and acquisition that frankly didn\u2019t go the way we wanted. We certainly can start to see our way moving through those two aspects.","And while I think the macroeconomic environment in China is not something I\u2019d ever want to predict. Some of this is in our control, as we start to bring the businesses together and understand what we have in terms of brands, in terms of supply footprint, in terms of channels, in terms of distribution. And that\u2019s where we are going to be focused on the things that we can control.","Robert Moskow","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","John Bilbrey","Good morning, Matt.","Pamela Kaufman","Hi, this is \u2013 good morning. This is actually Pam Kaufman calling in for Matt. I was hoping that you could elaborate on the stable advertising and marketing expense that you saw in North America during the fourth quarter? And the company\u2019s previous commentary about plans for increased advertising and programming during Q4? Did it have the anticipated impact on your non-seasonal business in the U.S.?","John Bilbrey","Well, first of all a comment I would make is that if you look at the numbers part of what you have to recognize there is GRPs were actually up in the fourth quarter. And some of our actually administrative costs and non-working costs were actually what was lower. So the brand investment actually in terms of eyeballs on brands and attention to brands was up. And so as you parse through the numbers, that\u2019s an important piece to understand. Michele may have a point that you were talking about effectiveness or anything beyond that. But it\u2019s important that you understand that as you look at the absolute numbers.","Michele Buck","Yes, so the \u2013 that \u2013 it was the non-working kind of production costs that actually we just had some timing shifts on. And then relative to impact on the business, we felt good about our every day takeaway in Q4. So while we don\u2019t have all of the analytics back on the spend based on what we know to-date, we feel pretty good about it.","And one other thing I would just point out is, as you look at the takeaway as we\u2019ve launched Snack Mix and Snack Bites, which is key innovation on our core brand. It\u2019s actually the Snack Mix piece is rolling into the salty snack category and not CMG. So, as you look at every day takeaway just keep that in mind.","Pamela Kaufman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","John Bilbrey","Good morning, David.","David Palmer","Good morning. I\u2019ve seen data from the NPD Group, which points to decline in volume for the sweet snacks mega category. And I guess we\u2019ve seen some falling in the chocolate category as well. I\u2019m wondering, I mean, clearly, we can see some things that might be more category specific like packaging innovation that\u2019s run its course. But when you\u2019re thinking and looking at the consumer, I know you do a lot of consumer insights work.","Do you see a big mega reasons or shifts by the consumer that are things you can just to, you mentioned in the release today that your \u2013 that the consumer want simpler ingredients. But could you comment on certain other invisible things perhaps on a short-term basis that you think you could push against to cause category growth improve? Thanks.","John Bilbrey","Yes, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments. So if you look at what the overall category trends and I\u2019ll kind of give you where we were. If you look at the chocolate category, it was up. We were up pretty consistent with the category. If you look at non-chocolate, we actually lagged to the category and then if you look at gum and also mint, we would have outperformed the category on those segments.","We have deemphasized a little bit the level of activity that we had in some of our sweets business. And so that\u2019s certainly showing up in the business one brand in particular was a great brand. But if we just look at the absolute programming we had on a brand like TWIZZLERS, it is a little bit lower and that ended up showing up some in the overall business.","If you look at the sweets business and some of the channels where it does well, you can also follow that with call it income cohorts. And one of the things that we\u2019re doing in 2016 is using our Allen Candy acquisition to leverage our portfolio there on pegged bags and where in select places where we think that can really benefit us. So we did see within that segment an opportunity and we\u2019re going to try to leverage that as well. And then some of our competitors also had the emphasis on some of those brands, which also would have had an influence on our performance as well.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","And will take our last question from Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","John Bilbrey","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Dickerson","Hello, good morning. I just had a kind of a larger question around your debt capacity and how look at leverage. I know previously you spoken to that 1.5 to 2 times levered to adjusted EBITDA. But I mean how do you think that over time is running a lower level of leverage relative to your peer set? And one could argue potentially an inefficient capital structure is the right way to go, or if you\u2019re talking about snacking opportunity and leveraging your distribution network in the asset base. Then why not increase your leverage a bit more than you have historically actually grow a bit more quickly via acquisitions and not in China, I mean, more on the snacking side in the United States. Thank you.","Michele Buck","Great. Thanks for the question. We really like where we sit right now on a leverage basis is something that we go back and pressure test every year. And one of the benefits that it gives us is that, it gives us a lot of capacity to do something incremental. It\u2019s something big and attractive and incremental came along in the category. We would be very open to it, I don\u2019t think that our leverage would be a constrained in that situation. But as we sit here today with opportunities in front of us, we feel very good about where we are.","Robert Dickerson","Okay, thank you. And just very quickly, I\u2019ve seen some material on your SOFIT brand. I haven\u2019t heard you mentioned much, but I think I believe it\u2019s selling on Amazon. Is that something we should see more of in the future such that SOFITwould be rolling out like a Krave, or like a Brookside into mass retail, or is that for the time being to sell on price?","John Bilbrey","Yes. I think SOFIT is test and learn. It\u2019s a brand out of India. It\u2019s soy protein and it\u2019s part of our efforts to learn about the protein segment plant-based. And so you\u2019re seeing it more \u2013 from a test and learn standpoint, we\u2019re going to be able to make that in the U.S. versus obviously try to ship it from India. So, as you know with beverages and so forth closed on is always a good idea. But it\u2019s a brand, we think is very interesting. But it\u2019s really about us having a learning approach.","Patricia Little","And I\u2019m delighted you found it on Amazon, because we just\u2026","Robert Dickerson","Yes. Okay. Thank you very much.","John Bilbrey","All right. Thank you.","John Bilbrey","Thank you for joining us today I\u2019ll be available for any follow-up calls that you may have.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day."],"10990":["The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call January 30, 2020  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Melissa Poole - VP, IR","Michele Buck - Chairman, President and CEO","Steve Voskuil - SVP and CFO","Conference Call Participants","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Ken Goldman - J.P.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Melissa Poole","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for The Hershey Company's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call and webcast. Michele Buck, Chairman of the Board, President and CEO; and Steve Voskuil, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, followed by a Q&A session.","Before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Federal Securities Laws. These statements are based on our current expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events and those described in these forward-looking statements contained in our 2018 10-K filed with the SEC and today's press release.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information does not intend to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Michele.","Michele Buck","Thanks, Melissa. Good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast. We had a strong 2019, with accelerated business performance and differentiated financial results. This was driven by momentum in our core U.S. confection portfolio in both retail takeaway and margin expansion, like incremental and profitable international growth, and by further expansion of our snacking portfolio, and we continue to invest in our brands, capabilities, and people. I would like to extend a sincere thank you to our employees and all of our partners for their hard work to make this possible.","For the full-year, we delivered net sales growth of 2.5% and EPS growth of 7.8%, a testament to our strong brands, business model, and a commitment to balance top and bottom line growth. Constant currency organic sales growth of 1.8% was ahead of expectations, driven by incremental pricing and core base strengths of our U.S. confection business. These gains drove stronger than anticipated gross margin expansion of over 100 basis points for the year, which enabled incremental investments in our brands and employees, and enhanced earnings for our shareholders.","We're pleased with the consistency of our results throughout the year, and the momentum we're taking into 2020. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 4% behind 1.9% organic constant currency growth, and our gross margin expanded 96 basis points. For the full-year, our Hershey Candy Mint and Gum retail sales increased 2.6% resulting in a category share gain of approximately 10 basis points. While a long Easter contributed to this performance, we also finished the year strong with retail sales growth of 2.8%, and a category share gain of approximately 20 basis points in the fourth quarter. As was the case with the entire year, this growth was driven by balanced activation across the portfolio, and we are seeing the benefits from our investment in marketing spending carrying through to retail performance.","Our Reese's brand continue to outperform the market with growth of over 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by great advertising, innovation, and strong in-store execution. Kit Kat grew 2.3% in Q4 behind incremental capacity, and our new Kit Kat Duos innovation, which launched late last year. Early results of this innovation are encouraging, and we expect continued momentum on this brand in 2020.","Our media and packaging investments on our mid-tier iconic brands also drove strong growth with Payday up over 8%, Almond Joy up 6%, Rolo up 5%, and Heath up 35% in the quarter, resulting in a combined share gain of 20 basis points.","Pricing remained an important lever for us in the fourth quarter. Net price realization of approximately four points in Q4 was slightly ahead of expectations as we began to see a benefit from our most recent price increase announced in July of 2019, and we expect this to continue in 2020 with planned price realization of 2 to 2.5 points on our U.S. confection business in the U.S. for the year.","As we look at 2020, we have another great year of activations planned within our confection business. In just a couple of days, for the first time in brand history, Reese's will be running an advertisement during the 2020 Super Bowl. This will be a great opportunity for America's number one confectionery brand to increase awareness of one of its best tasting, highest consumer rated items in the portfolio, Take 5. As we had shared with you last year, our re-launch of this item is off to a strong start, and we're excited to build on this with an ad during America's most watched sporting event and additional in-store merchandising and distribution.","We're also excited about our product innovation for 2020. In addition to our Kit Kat Duos innovation, we are excited to announce the expansion of our THiNS platform in 2020. York THiNS and Reese's white THiNS will launch in March, and will be available in both the take-home bag and peg formats. This provides York lovers a unique way to enjoy one of their favorites, and it enables us to secure strong year to merchandising for our core milk and dark Reese's items that we've launched this past year.","Our snacking portfolio also delivered solid growth in the fourth quarter. SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn retail sales grew over 13%, resulting in a category share gain of 170 basis points. And as expected, Pirate's Booty performance accelerated as we began to recapture distribution lost earlier in the year, and had strong promotional activity behind our on-pack Disney promotion. Retail sales grew 1.4% in the fourth quarter, and over 4% in December. Our most recent acquisition One Brand grew 35% in traditional measured channels with additional strength in non-measured channels such as e-commerce.","Now, for an update on our international markets, we have made significant progress over the past several years by focusing on branded high margin products, streamlining our operating model and right-sizing our investments. Since we began this journey at the beginning of 2017, we have increased our segment income by $125 million over the past three years, while continuing to grow our organic constant currency net sales. This is a significant accomplishment made possible by the hard work and dedication of many employees around the world. A sincere thank you to everyone who helped drive this business transformation and financial performance.","Our international business provides us with important geographic diversification and incremental growth, and we're excited to build on this progress with another year of profitable growth in 2020. In Mexico, we will continue to focus on increased distribution and innovation on our Hershey and Pelon Pelo Rico brand. After strong test results last year, we will be launching a new business model more broadly in 2020 aimed at securing incremental and profitable distribution in traditional trading.","Additionally, we will continue to innovate with new flavors and packaging to drive growth in our existing channels. In Brazil, despite a continued heightened competitive environment, we delivered profitable growth in the fourth quarter. Our Dark Chocolate Hershey's portfolio has performed very well, and we're excited to bring new innovation within that platform to market in 2020.","Additionally, we're focused on growth in non-traditional retail channels, and we're expanding a successful 2019 test to more regions this year. In India, our National Kisses launch remained on track, and we are leveraging important learnings from our regional launch last year to further optimize the proposition as we expand in 2020. We continue to see this market as a strategic growth vector for our business. In China, we had a strong finish to the year, and we plan to build upon last year's successful flavors of life promotion with new varieties in 2020. Due to the timing of Chinese New Year in 2020 and 2021, we expect 2020 shipments to be slightly pressured, but we continue to feel good about our in-store activations and our base business momentum.","In summary, we're pleased with our performance, and believe we will deliver another year of high-quality financial results in 2020. We're proud of what we have accomplished and the momentum we're seeing on the business, but we also recognized we must continue to adapt and invest to elevate the business further.","Over the past several years, we've invested in incremental capacity and planning capabilities. I'm pleased by the progress that we've made here, and the opportunities that this has unlocked for us. In 2019, we delivered our best case fill rate in a decade, and saw meaningful increases in our Advantage Survey rankings. Since 2017, our supply chain ranking with our customers advanced from number 15 to number four, and our customer service is now ranked number one amongst our peers up from number 12 just three years ago.","We will build on this with additional investment in our supply chain capabilities over the next several years. As a part of a multi-year capital project, we will add additional capacity for our largest and fastest-growing brand, build agile fulfillment and late-stage customization capabilities, and invest in new data and technology within our supply chain that increases visibility, automation, and digitalization. We believe these investments will enable us to respond to changing needs from both our consumers and customers, while maintaining our advantage margin profile. We look forward to sharing more details about this at our Investor Day in March.","In addition to investing to advance our business capabilities, we're also very focused on elevating our talent and culture. In December, I announced several organization changes that I believe will enable us to take our business to the next level. Chuck Raup has been promoted to President at U.S. Chuck is a proven, results-driven, commercial operator with a successful 10-year track record at Hershey, most recently leading the acceleration of our U.S. CMG business. Chuck's deep expertise across snacking, having led all areas of confection at Hershey, and from his previous experience at Craft will be instrumental to our future success as we pursue our strong growth ambition across traditional and digital channels.","Kristen Riggs has been promoted to Chief Growth Officer. Kristen started with the company more than 14 years ago, and has worked across nearly all commercial functions. Her focus on driving growth is underpinned by a strategic and analytical understanding of the modern consumer, strong marketing expertise, and tenacity for creating positive change in the organization. Together, the U.S. business and growth office will work seamlessly to ensure the delivery of both 2020 and our growth plan over the next several years.","And finally, Chris Scalia has been promoted to Chief Human Resources Officer. Chris joined Hershey in our legal department in 2005, and transitioned to human resources in 2011. Since that time, Chris has led talent management, recruiting, HR operations, and business partner teams as well as workforce development. Chris brings a strong commercial business acumen and analytical rigor to talent planning and development, and a passion to help people and culture drive performance. These changes are a testament to Hershey's talent development succession planning, and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead with this tremendous talent across the organization. Thank you to Todd, Mary Beth, Kevin, and Terry, for all their contributions to our success over the past several years.","I'll now turn it over to Steve, who will provide you with details on our financial results. Steve.","Steve Voskuil","Thank you, Michele, and good morning, everyone. It was a strong year and quarter and we are pleased with the quality of delivery across our segments. North America achieved net price realization and operating leverage, enabling incremental investment in brands and capabilities throughout the year. We saw consistent solid retail takeaways on our core confectionery brands in the U.S. and our international business delivered another year of incremental profitable growth. We feel good about the momentum we have heading into 2020 to deliver in on algorism year for both top and bottom line.","Fourth quarter net sales increased 4% to $2.1 billion versus the same period last year, with a slight headwind from foreign currency exchange. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 220 basis points of growth. Organic, constant currency net sales growth of 1.9% was consistent with expectations and driven by price realization in the U.S. and volume growth in our international markets. Net price realization for the quarter was 360 basis points partially offset by anticipated elasticity-driven volume declines of 170 basis points.","Adjusted earnings per share diluted were $1 28 for the quarter, an increase of 1.6% versus the same period last year. This was driven by gross margin gains, which were more than offset by increased incentive compensation. For the full-year, net sales increased 2.5%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a one-point benefit.","Organic constant currency net sales growth of 1.8% was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange of 30 basis points. The delivery of our net sales and gross margin expansion plans allowed for investment in brands capabilities and our employees to drive future growth. This translated to adjusted earnings per share for the full-year of $5.78 cents, an increase of 7.8% versus prior year.","In the fourth quarter, our North America segment net sales increased 3.8% versus the same period last year. The net benefit of acquisitions was 250 basis points. Organic net sales of 1.3% was driven by price realization of 400 basis points partially offset by elasticity-driven volume declines of 270 basis points.","Recall, in the third quarter, price realization was approximately one point lower than expectations due to the timing related to our July 2019 announced price increase as anticipated, this headwind reversed in the fourth quarter. Without this timing shift, price realization was approximately 300 basis points, about 50 basis points ahead of expectations as we began to get a slight benefit from our most recent price increase. This incremental pricing contributed to stronger than anticipated gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter.","Adjusted gross margins in North America expanded 130 basis points versus prior year. This was driven by net price realization and favorable commodities, which were partially offset by increased logistics and packaging costs consistent with other quarters. North America advertising and related consumers marketing spend increased 5.1% in the quarter driven by planned advertising increases enabled by our gross margin expansion.","Fourth quarter international and other segments net sales increased 5.8% versus the year ago period. Constant currency net sales grew 6.3% offset by a 50-basis point headwind from foreign currency exchange. Volume was a 5.7-point benefit and net price realization contributed 60 basis points to net sales growth; combined organic constant currency sales, net sales in Mexico, Brazil, India, and China grew 6% versus the fourth quarter of 2018 with growth in all markets. International and other advertising and related consumer marketing decreased 11% versus prior year as we continue to optimize investment in these focus markets.","Now turning to gross margin, adjusted gross profit of $898 million in the fourth quarter increased 6.4% versus prior year. This resulted in adjusted gross margin of 43.4%, an increase of nearly 100 basis points driven by net price realization and favorable commodities.","Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit of $370 million resulted in operating profit margin of 17.9%, a decrease of 70 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2018. Gross margin gains were more than offset by higher incentive compensation. This incentive increase was related to a strong 2019 performance, and a structural market-based increase of variable compensation linked to company performance for our managers and individual contributors. This increase was planned to occur gradually over the coming years. However, our strong performance in 2019 allowed us to accelerate this change, which we believe is important for retaining and securing top talent in our organization.","As you saw in our press release reported operating profit in the fourth quarter declined $135 million versus the prior year period, driven by the recognition of a long-lived and intangible asset impairment loss associated with our 2015 acquisition of KRAVE. While meat snacks remain a growing category, volume has been driven by mainstream and value brands. The Premium segment slowed, and became even more competitive, which pressured sales and margins. While disappointing, this acquisition was an important step to beginning to diversify our portfolio in the U.S. And we have leveraged the learning to improve the propositions and performance on our more recent acquisitions.","Moving down to P&L, interest expense of $37 million was in line with the prior year period. Full-year interest expense was $144 million in increase of $5.3 million versus 2018 due to increase debt associated with acquisitions. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 9.8% versus 9.5% in the year ago period. This rate was favorable versus our expectations due to the execution of additional tax credits. For the full-year 2019, the adjusted tax was 17.4% versus 19.2% in the year ago period. This full-year favorability was driven by excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and valuation allowance releases in our international markets.","In the fourth quarter other expense with $34 million, a decrease of $5.1 million versus the year ago period, driven by non-service related pension expense. For the fourth quarter of 2019, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately $210.5 million, reflecting a slight decrease versus the prior quarter. The company did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter against our July 2018 $500 million authorization, and $410 million remain.","Total capital additions including software were $82 million in the fourth quarter, totaling $318 million for the full-year 2019. This was slightly below expectations, as some of our IS initiatives were delayed due to employee resource constraints related to our large ERP and supply chain projects. We continue to return cash to our shareholders with fourth quarter dividends of $157 million. This was our 365th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock.","We have solid underlying momentum in our core business that we believe positions as well to keep the momentum going in 2020. We expect full-year net sales growth of two to 4% consistent with our long-term algorithm. This includes an approximate one point benefit from the acquisition of ONE brand. We anticipate our growth in North America will accelerate versus 2019 as we lap our SKU rationalization program. While we continue to expect profitable growth in our international markets, we expect the contribution will be lower than 2019 due to less favorable macroeconomic conditions impacting the confectionery category growth.","Like 2019, we expect our North America growth to be driven by pricing while our international growth is expected to be more volume-driven. We expect gross margins to expand again in 2020, but at a slower pace than 2019. While we plan to benefit from slightly more price realization, commodities will change from being a tailwind in 2019 to a headwind in 2020. As a result, we expect the adjusted gross margins to expand 40 to 50 basis points. As was the case in 2019, we will leverage this pricing and growth margin expansion to lead into investments in our brands and capabilities.","We expect advertising to grow slightly ahead of sales this year, and will continue to invest in data, technology and other initiatives to drive sustainable profitable growth in the future. We expect 2020 interest expense to be relatively in line with 2019, and other expense to increase 30 to $40 million versus 2019. As we plan to execute additional tax credits. As a result of these higher tax credit investments, we expect our 2019 adjusted tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. The net impact of investment tax credits and our adjusted tax rate is unfavorable versus 2019 as we lapped the one-time benefit of valuation allowance releases.","For 2020, we expect elevated CapEx spending as we advance our ERP transition and initiate a strategic supply chain program. As Michele mentioned, this multi-year capital project will not only add capacity, but also give us new fulfillment and technology capabilities that we believe will help us deliver on the needs of our consumers and customers while maintaining and advantaged market profile. Given the significant investments, our CapEx for 2020 is estimated to be between $475 million and $525 million.","Our core business sales growth and another year of gross margin expansion are expected to deliver full-year adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% consistent with our long-term algorithm. Given some of the timing of this year's key initiatives, as well as events we are lapping from prior year, we do expect second-half financial performance to be stronger than the first-half, while we have more pricing in the first-half, and are lapping our SKU rationalization program, we're also lapping a strong Easter pipeline still associated with our package and candy transition tax strategies that resulted in a low first-half 2019 rate and second quarter margin benefits associated with our July 2019 price increase. Similar to 2019, while these factors create some volatility in our quarterly financial results, we expect retail performance to be more consistent throughout the year and remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year guidance.","We remain focused on delivering balanced growth with a disciplined approach to building our brands and evolving our business model for the future. We have strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet and we'll continue to make the necessary investments to drive the business and deliver long-term shareholder value.","That concludes my financial discussion, and I'll now turn it back to Michele.","Michele Buck","Thanks, Steve. I'm proud of what we have delivered over the past several years, and I'm optimistic about 2020 and our future, we continue to operate with a healthy level of dissatisfaction and constantly push ourselves to elevate the business even further. We are excited about the opportunities ahead, and we look forward to sharing more details about our strategic plans in March.","Steve, Melissa and I are now available to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Steve Voskuil","Good morning.","Michele Buck","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hi, there. So, two things for me; first, as we think about some of the various pieces that drove the fourth quarter unallocated corporate, maybe can you give us a sense or help quantify a bit, you know, how much sort of is expected to stay in the base as we go through 2020, and how much of any sort of reverses out and perhaps helps to become a bit of a tailwind to 2020 operating income?","And second, I know it's a smaller business, Michele, but your comments on a new business model in Mexico just peaked my interest, I think you were talking about a new model to gain some incremental distribution, I didn't know if that was something along the lines of more of like a partnership or perhaps you can expand a little bit on that, and that's it. Thank you","Michele Buck","Andrew, why don't I take that one first, because I think that's a quick one, which is really the focus there in Mexico is a new model to capture traditional trade. So, it is not anything beyond that, but really it's a focus to go after that traditional trade business.","Andrew Lazar","Got it.","Steve Voskuil","And just picking up on the on the compensation and what stays and goes just in the fourth quarter really had three things that rolled in, one was if you look year-over-year, there was a re-based impact on incentives, the prior year period had below target performance and payout. So, in the fourth quarter, you sort of catch up to target. We had then a predicted over-target performance, and then the market adjustment that we talked about, and clearly as we roll into 2020 that one-time market based adjustment will go away, and so will the performance will reset at a target level. So, roughly 50% of that increase will stay going forward, and about half of that will go away.","Andrew Lazar","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Moskow","Hi. The results are pretty much in line with what we'd expected, maybe incentive comp is a little higher than we thought, but -- so I was just going to jump into CapEx, the CapEx spend is a big step up. You mentioned it's related to the ERP and supply chain program. Are there any expenses that run to the income statement related to this step up in your ERP program, or is this really just a kind of a CapEx kind of effort, and also what steps are you taking if any if you need to mitigate customer service issues? Thanks.","Steve Voskuil","Sure. The ERP program has been going for a number of years, and so, you're right, there's a portion of that CapEx step up in 2020 is due to the ERP program continuing. There is a portion that hits the P&L. Year-over-year for '20 it's not a material factor, and it's obviously factored into our guidance. As we get to the March Investor Conference, as Michele said, we'll talk more about the supply chain project, and probably also talk more about the next couple of steps that we expect on the ERP program, but for 2020, it's fully reflected from both OpEx and CapEx.","Michele Buck","And we have a big focus on change management to the end of your question relative to really managing the risks and business continuity during that period of time, and we can talk a bit more about that in March.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Well, I'll wait till March then. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning. Thank you.","Michele Buck","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Goldman","Hi. First the increase in CapEx, does that change your outlook at least in the short-term on M&A? I know most of the M&A you've been doing is relatively, I guess, tack on in nature. So, my guess is probably you'll stay opportunistic, but I'm just curious for your thoughts there.","And then my second question is, thank you for the guidance on the gross margin outlook, I guess, in that guidance, are you assuming any incremental pricing action, whether it's list prices, whether it's reduced promos or pack size changes, things like that, or is it just sort of status quo and you have all the pricing actions that you need already baked into hit that gross margin number? I'm asking because obviously, cocoa has gone up a little bit, and I know your heads there and so forth, but just curious.","Steve Voskuil","Maybe I'll take the first part of that question relative to thinking about M&A relative to the additional CapEx. So clearly, it has an impact on free cash flow. Our capital allocation priorities aren't changing. You know, we continue to look first and foremost at funding, both organic and inorganic growth, protecting the dividend and obviously watching overall leverage. I would say as we sit here today, we have with the incremental CapEx investment we're not pulling back, are looking for potential inorganic opportunities as they come available, we'll always do that with an eye towards leverage and the value proposition for shareholders. I would say no change in our posture from that perspective.","On the gross margin side, we don't comment about specific pricing actions that we might have planned for the coming year. We can say price continues to be a strategic part of our repertoire of tools to use along with all the other components. So, anything you want to add to that, Michele?","Michele Buck","Yes. I would just say, I mean, overall, we are expecting price in that 2% to 2.5% range for the year in North America, and our gross margin guidance is consistent with that being a part of it.","Ken Goldman","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Steve Voskuil","Good morning.","Alexia Howard","So, it seems as though the core business is chugging along, you've got the modest price increases rolling through each year. In terms of the future business development, acquisition strategy from here, can you talk a little bit about what the key learnings have been from what's worked with SkinnyPop Popcorn, and what seems to be improving with Pirate's Booty, and maybe some of the things that didn't work so well with KRAVE and Brookside? And then also maybe just talk about what your priorities are for it from here, is it going to remain within salty snacks in the U.S., are you thinking about more overseas acquisitions, what's the priority list from here? Thank you very much, and I'll pass it on.","Michele Buck","Sure. So, let's start with our overall strategy, which is about capturing incremental snacking occasions, and if you look within that, certainly the number one priority is in categories outside of sweet indulgence in the U.S. So, both salty snacks savory as well as we recently bought the ONE brands nutrition bar. So, I'd say it's largely about better for you in savory in the U.S., not to say that we will not move forward with something in confection if there's a gap in our portfolio we will, and we would entertain international acquisition, but our bar is much higher given the risk levels of that business, and obviously, given we don't have scale internationally the businesses that makes sense for us are just a bit different than in the U.S.","Relative to our key learnings, I would say, probably the first and biggest learning is that is around selection of assets, that is, we are a branded high gross margin company that is -- those are the kinds of brands we're used to growing and building. SkinnyPop and Pirate's Booty fit right in that sweet spot on both of those elements, and I think especially if we're going into a newer category or segment within snacking. KRAVE in particular was an acquisition that did not meet either of those relative to adequate scale nor adequate gross margin. So, I think that's the single biggest learning was that piece of what fits our business model and staying true to that, and then certainly along the way, I think we learned other things relative to integration and how to get the best of both leveraging our scale as well as enabling some of the entrepreneurial spirit, but realizing the businesses we're buying are in a phase of scaling up in growth and there's help needed to do that.","Alexia Howard","Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for citing me in and happy belated New Year.","Michele Buck","Thank you.","Jason English","You're welcome. I want to come back real quick on the CapEx piece because it's a surprisingly large number. And it sounds like we'll get more detail on where that spends coming at the Analyst Day, but given that you're spending a lot more into supply chain and you explain at the same time that your prior margin for growth productivity savings are poised to step-down. Is it unreasonable to think that we should expect a larger or some sort of news around renew productivity goals over the next couple of years?","Steve Voskuil","Yes, we're not announcing today any renewed productivity goals, I would say productivity is and will remain a key part of our algorithm inside the P&L. You're right last couple of years with margin for growth that probably had higher than historically typical productivity. 2020 is down a little bit from that as that kind of peak of that program passes. And we will do as we always do, kind of continue to look for additional productivity opportunities and some of the improvements coming in terms of fulfillment with the supply chain investment will actually set the future for some more as we go forward.","Michele Buck","Yes, little bit additional context. In the past, we did big supply chain projects and those tended to be much more focused on utilization of capacity and also margin enhancement. This supply chain project is very much focused on enabling growth and doing so by providing increased flexibility and customization capabilities that will then allow us to meet consumer and customer needs while maintaining the advantage margin structure that we have.","Jason English","Thank you. That's good context. I understand a little bit better. I appreciate that. Switching gears real quick to the growth side, so new capabilities help drive growth, but from a volumetric perspective, there's not a lot of growth right now in at least in your North American portfolio, and I know there's some elasticity components there, but how should we think about the growth trajectory for both the category and your portfolio as we track through the next 12, 24 months?","Michele Buck","So first of all, we think both volume and price are important to our long-term algorithm. During the years where we have pricing, those years will be much more pricing driven than volume driven. And we do a lot of hard work on our programming to keep our volumes flat during that time. Otherwise, according to the models, we'd actually decline in volume. So we're pleased that we've been able to do that. But over the years, you'll see a bit of both. And as we look at the actual growth outlook, we continue to think that the CMG category is going to grow at that 1.5% to 2% type of range. We believe in 2020, that it will be at the higher end of that range given the pricing in the marketplace, but we believe it will not be as high as 2019, which also had the additional benefit of a long Easter and we look to grow in line or slightly above the category growth rate.","Jason English","Got it, okay, Thanks a lot. I'll see you in Florida.","Michele Buck","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good morning. Just piggyback off of Jason's question on organic sales for the year, how should we think about maybe how the China and Brazil macro situations really kind of play into how you think about the international business, I know it's a smaller part and then on the U.S. front, anything to comment on Snap and how that any potential developments in legislation might potentially impact that business as you think forward? Thank you.","Michele Buck","Yes, so certainly we have seen macro economic softness in several of the developing markets in which we participate. As we developed our plans for the year, we tried to take that into account as other factors that were known at the time, clearly the coronavirus would be the one unknown that really we didn't have visibility to at the time, and we are tracking that carefully. We do anticipate that will have an impact on our business in China. But as you know, we're a predominantly North American based company. So not as big an impact as we may see from some others, and we are carefully tracking, and always do kind of what happens with Snap at this point in time; we have not built in nor anticipate something significant there, but we'll keep a close eye on that.","Steven Strycula","As a quick follow-up to that, Michele, I appreciate the color for China, as you think about it being a potential impact as you noted, is it more from a manufacturing standpoint that facilities or maybe offline until maybe the beginning of February, as is the case for the industry, or is it more just an early indication that depletion rates in the retail channel are already starting to come in a little bit as travel slows, any color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Michele Buck","Yes, I would say it's more the latter which is our business tends to have a seasonal skew around Chinese New Year, we sold in our volume and now consumers are not able to go to retail and so we're trying to carefully watch what's the take away will be and any waste implications from the fact that that portfolio is seasonal in nature. So that's the biggest hit for us.","Steven Strycula","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question.","Jon Feeney","Good morning, thanks very much. A couple of detailed question first and then a real question. The detail question is on looking at your takeaway data you gave us, so 28 on Candy Mint and Gum or 11.3 on salty snacks, 2.5 overall, is it like last quarter where all that gap is that all KRAVE that were kind of flushing out of the system is my first question that because it would seem to me it'd be something like in the threes overall if that was the case. And second question, real question is, it seems like pricing works a lot better than it used to, and it's worked fantastically at times in the past decade. But it seems like you get it, you see less elasticity, you grow gross margin like, is there something just new under the sun here where you have better capabilities, and you can just price more tactically going forward than used to be, if any detail on that, I'd appreciate it.","Michele Buck","Okay. So relative to your first question, you're right that there are some of the smaller emerging brands like KRAVE that are a drag to our total consumption. The other piece is our grocery business, which is comprised primarily of syrup and baking chips. Syrup tends to be a pretty stable business. But baking chips has big promotional windows, and it's very competitive. So, we always have decisions to make relative to which pieces of business to go for at which just don't have the profit margins that we're interested in. And so we passed on some less profitable business this year. And that was a drag in our total retail takeaway. Relative to pricing, I would say we think about the impact as being pretty consistent with what we've seen over the years that we've always had a pretty solid ability to leverage price, and we believe that's only though because of all of the investments that we make with retailers in retail specific programs. The high level of advertising we put behind our brands that creates the brand value proposition for the consumer then it enables that. So but we see basically the elasticity is being somewhat in line with what we've seen historically.","Jon Feeney","Well, it works whatever it does. Thank you.","Michele Buck","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","John Baumgartner","Good morning. Thanks for the question.","Michele Buck","Good morning, John.","John Baumgartner","I guess, Michele or Steve, I just like to hear a bit more about the operating leverage, given the importance of that to the P&L. We've seen plant closures over the years you've had the modernization in Hershey. Now there's talk about, I guess, the smart plants. So as you exit the margin for growth, how do you think about leverage from here, I mean how large of the contributor will manufacturing be given the increases in capacity, flattish category growth relative to leverage from SG&A at this point and a lot of moving pieces, just trying to get a sense for the factors and how it materializes?","Michele Buck","Steve, you want to take that?","Steve Voskuil","Driving operating leverage over time is going to continue to be a key part of the algorithm. And so, all of these investments whether we're talking in the manufacturing area or some of the capability investments, all are with an eye towards driving a return over time and ultimately driving leverage of itself. Some of the investments in digital and data, all have a business case around leverage at the end, and so as we've done in the past, as margin for growth wraps up, we will kind of that Michele said in the past go right back through the P&L and attack each one of those to continue to drive sustainable leverage. Anything to add there, Michele?","Michele Buck","Nope.","John Baumgartner","Okay. And just as a follow-up there. Based on the guidance, it looks as though non-advertising SM&A for 2020 should increase a fair amount year-on-year. Are there any particular callouts there in terms of the plan, whether it's in-store programming, your sales force feed on the street or anything else worth note that we should think about here?","Michele Buck","Our data and technology investments do fall in that line. So investments around ERP, investments more broadly around data and technology when it comes to analytics and how we evaluate the business, new data sources, et cetera filling up buckets, that's a significant piece.","John Baumgartner","Okay. Michele and Steve, thanks for the time.","Steve Voskuil","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Dickerson","Great, thank you. I guess first question, Michele is just, given the amount of investment, you deployed over the past two, three years to now, speaking to the next two to three years, to become more efficient. With that in mind, as we see brand support increase, I feel like at least, usually that brand support goes to larger brands, right, just higher margins that are leverage overall. But you've also acquired a number of smaller companies that are faster growth, smaller with faster growth, on trend, et cetera. So, like, when you step back and say, okay, we kind of, let's say, we've kind of gotten through the first part of kind of our investment overall supply chain ERP, now we have further investment, like should we be expecting, increased innovation in the marketplace on brands like Skinny and Pirate's Booty and One, and I just asked because, you seem to be kind of the on-trend growth to your brands, not as big, but there's a lot of potential there, and I feel like we just haven't seen a tremendous amount of new innovation come out of those brands so far post acquisition?","Steve Voskuil","Yes. That's a great question. I would tell you that overall, as we look at growing a business, we do really believe in balanced -- the balance levers we've spoken with you all about relative to distribution, advertising that can drive base velocities, seasonal presents, pricing et cetera, and so, we believe all those levers are important, but at different phases and different brands lives, different of those levers are more important. So, with brands like SkinnyPop and Pirate's in particular, we want to make really sure that we take full advantage of driving the cores on those businesses because they were not at max distribution capacity for what they deserve, given their velocity levels. So, making sure that we continue to focus on that core distribution and also that we advertise to maximize household penetration, so there are many brands and confections where we have 40% household penetration, and it's significantly less on the brands like Pirate's or Skinny. So it's intentional that we first focus on the core, and that we judiciously add innovation. And we did do that with some seasonal items and some items, the right flavor profiles, but we think that's a key learning from the past is to be very measured in the innovation approach. We learned that on some of our early acquisition models focus enough on the core.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, fair. And then, just a quick follow-up, I guess what's implied with further capital spends, especially in 2020 on the CapEx side and overall investment, I'm assuming, as leader of a company, right, the expectation is that this does build efficiency obviously. So, essentially, hopefully de-risk further acquisitions, even a smaller in scale. So, basically KRAVE doesn't happen again?","Steve Voskuil","Yep, we're always focused on making better and better decisions and learning from every action we take in the past. So and we feel good about what we're seeing on SkinnyPop and Pirate's in particular and One is on track integration and acquisition model wise as well.","Rob Dickerson","Okay. Super. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","David Palmer","Great. Good morning.","Michele Buck","Good morning.","David Palmer","In recent years, Hershey has been smarter about pricing and smoothing out the price increases in any one year and you've been hitting different parts of the portfolio and using weight outs and new packaging, but volume is still down, it's down this last quarter and wondering how you're thinking about pricing power levers that you might have up your sleeve. Should we get into a inflationary environment particularly with cocoa into '21 that looks like it's shaping up to be. In other words, do you do you think you could defend that 45% type gross margin should we get an outsize lumpiness in inflation?","Michele Buck","So, of course, we can't really talk about the future pricing actions, but we can talk a little bit about what we're seeing in commodities and cocoa pricing and how we're thinking about how that flows through the P&L. I think if we take a little bit of a step back and talk a bit about that, and Steve and I'll kind of tag team this. So we are very focused on watching cocoas commodity, because it's critically important for us, we do know it's a headwind as we go into next year, and that headwind is built into the guidance that we've given you. So, every year going forward, we focus on the right combinations of programs, which include hedging, which includes sometimes deciding to price, which include making tradeoffs across the P&L to really accommodate whatever's happening in cocoa pricing. We do have pretty strong visibility going forward, so we have a chance to plan around that. And Steve, do you want to talk a bit more about that?","Steven Voskuil","Yes, I would say, as Michele said, we have good visibility in 2020. As you point out, David, if things like the lid and some of the pressure on cocoa remain into 2021, you know, that puts some pressure for sure from a commodity standpoint into the P&L. That said, between pricing levers, productivity levers and others, we will use our toolbox to work to continue to drive leverage through gross margin as we go forward. The bar will be tougher, depending on how that cocoa pricing shapes up as we get to the back part of 2020 and into 2021, and we'll have more visibility into that as the year progresses.","Michele Buck","It's certainly something that's been volatile over time. So I think we have experienced managing that volatility.","David Palmer","That's very helpful. And just a real small one, that the re-launch of Take 5 as you said, at the Super Bowl, that's an interesting move, it's only in the measured channel looks like it's about half-percent of your channel mix. So, it's not a huge trademark, but there's probably something you see in that that's making you think there's an opportunity there. So, may be a couple of comments about why you think that is? Thank you.","Michele Buck","Sure. So Take 5 has the highest repeat purchase of any competitive innovation, and has one of the highest repeat purchases of many of the great brands we've seen over time. It lacks the awareness and trial, and so we began re-launching that brand putting it under the Reese's trademark because that is one key way to drive trial, it has great Reese's peanut butter on it, but that's where a placement like Super Bowl can tend to really help you, which is it garners a lot of awareness and trial and eyeballs, and we think that that will be really helpful for us as part of our overall marketing plan behind Take 5. So, we look at Take 5 as -- I look at it as one of our great innovations for the year. We know it's a great product, and we'll have consumers get a chance to try it for themselves.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Melissa Poole for any closing remarks.","Melissa Poole","Thanks for joining us this morning. We will be available for the rest of the day if you have additional questions. Please feel free to reach out.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Roxanna and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] This call is scheduled to end at about 9:30 a.m. So, please limit yourself to one question till we can get to as many of you as possible. Please note this call maybe recorded. Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark Pogharian","Thank you, Roxanna. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company\u2019s third quarter 2016 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session.","Let me remind everyone listening that today\u2019s conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning\u2019s press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss third quarter results, excluding net pre-tax charges of $72.4 million or $0.23 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","J.P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. Before we discuss the details of our third quarter results, I\u2019d like to add some context to the press release we issued on October 14. It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to be the 11th CEO of The Hershey Company. I\u2019m proud of all that we\u2019ve accomplished as a team over the last 5 to 6 years and plan to be fully engaged on a day-to-day basis as CEO over the next 8 months or so as we drive the business forward and regain momentum. I will also continue to work closely with my management team as we review our global go-to-market approach that we discussed in July. We are making progress and expect to discuss these value-creation strategies with you in early 2017.","Importantly, we believe that The Hershey Company will continue to be successful in the marketplace. We have a solid framework in place related to customer capabilities and consumer insights, especially in the North American segment that should enable us to execute against the demand landscape work that we\u2019ve been updating. This is in conjunction with the progress that we\u2019ve made in our R&D pipeline and faster innovation cycle in our core CMG business and snackfection initiatives. As part of our overall commitment to research and development, we are very pleased to announce our participation in the new University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Pennovation Center, whose grand opening is today. The Pennovation Center is a bridge that brings together corporations with the need, curious educators and student scientists in the university\u2019s new hub for innovation that will focus on research, development and entrepreneurialism.","Let me add some perspective to our international operations. We have experienced macroeconomic challenges and slowdown in some of our key development markets. With this said, under the right conditions, we know our brands can be successful, as evidenced by the market share gain that we\u2019ve attained, where we focused on our core brand-building efforts. However, given an uncertain outlook in these markets over the near term, we will continue to assess our investment mix across the enterprise to align with both our long-term strategic intent and best growth and margin-enhancing activities. We believe that it\u2019s appropriate to continuously assess market opportunities and evolve the best approach to meet our growth and profit focus. We simply see this as part of our ongoing operating philosophy. We plan to share further details with you at our investor event early in the year.","For now, I can tell you that we are striving for an organization that\u2019s more agile, flexible and focused on the consumer, brand-building and cost efficiency across our entire business. This will drive improved gross margin and EBIT margin. Our commitment to growth and cost control will enable us to continue to deliver strong cash flow growth and generate value for all shareholders. As it relates to 2017, it\u2019s a bit early to discuss specifics, but we think there is a setup to deliver top quartile performance versus the peer group. A longer Easter season and planned innovation driven by Hershey\u2019s Cookie Layer Crunch and barkTHINS\u2019 acceleration should benefit top line growth. We have visibility into our cost structure and $100 million in productivity savings that we discussed earlier in the year that should lead to EBIT margin expansion in 2017.","Third quarter sales, marketplace performance and operating income were relatively in line with expectations. Earnings per share exceeded our forecasts, driven by a lower tax rate, and Patricia will have more on this in a bit. As we anticipated, U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improved versus last quarter and was within our targeted range. Total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended October 8, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels increased 0.6%, with market share the same as the year-ago period. This represents all Hershey manufactured products sold at retail, such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave, chocolate syrup and snack bars.","Importantly, trends in our chocolate business improved due to a shorter Easter and the timing of innovation, chocolate retail takeaway was off about 0.5% in the first half of the year and was up 0.6% in the third quarter, resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points. We expect that the fourth quarter total Hershey and CMG performance will continue to sequentially improve.","Our brands responded positively to the investments we discussed last quarter. Specifically, marketplace results in the quarter were driven by our performance in August as in-store merchandising and display activity and on-air advertising GRPs were solid, supporting U.S. Olympics programming and the launch of Reese\u2019s Pieces Cups. Our marketing mix for these programs was balanced between direct trade in both TV and digital advertising. You will see more of this next year as we look to optimize our marketing mix model.","Innovation in targeted 360 degree programs, where we got our marketing mix right, has worked for us so far in 2016. Variety and news on the Reese\u2019s franchise, driven by our NCAA relationship, which has been extended to the fall football season, and the launch of Reese\u2019s Pieces Cup, has resulted in the Reese\u2019s brands retail takeaway of close to 8% in the third quarter. End results were similar for the Kit Kat franchise, given the success of the Big Kat new product launch. And Hershey\u2019s Kisses, up 7.2% in the recent 12-week period, is also quietly having a good year, driven by birthday-themed packaging and programming.","We are getting incremental quality merchandising in other parts of the store, where wrapping paper and birthday cards can be found leveraging the emotional connectivity the brand has with consumers. And our Reese\u2019s Snack Mix and Hershey\u2019s Snack Bites continue to do well and give us confidence that our close-in snack strategy will gain traction over time. The same successful principles will be applied to Hershey\u2019s chocolate, where current brand performance isn\u2019t where we really want it to be. We believe the launch and related support of Hershey\u2019s Cookie Layer Crunch will reenergize and make the brand fresh.","Consumer demand for multi-textural eating experiences across varying snacking occasions is increasing and this product fills whitespace opportunity and should partially source volume from the cookie category. We are leveraging our iconic Hershey chocolate bar and pairing it with layers of cookie \u2013 crunchy cookie bits and decadent fillings to offer an indulgent textured snacking experience, easy for me to say. This is one of the most anticipated innovations from the iconic Hershey\u2019s brand in many years. Based on pre-launch testing, Hershey\u2019s Cookie Layer Crunch earned some of the highest consumer scores of any product ever launched by the company and will come in three flavors: caramel, vanilla cream and mint. Each piece is perfectly portion controlled at 90 to 100 calories and will be available at select retailers starting in December.","So, we are making progress, but there is still a lot of work to do as we enter the fourth quarter and look to 2017, where our priority is to restore Hershey\u2019s marketplace momentum with the very profitable U.S. market. We believe these initiatives and ones that we have yet to disclose will result in improved and consistent marketplace performance over this strategic planning cycle. As such, we believe the candy, mint and gum is an attractive category capable of solid growth over the long term when supported with the right mix of customer and consumer marketing.","Net sales in India declined versus the year ago period due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media-invested brands, Jolly Rancher, SoFit and Hershey\u2019s Syrup and Spreads, where we are focusing our efforts and investments, increased about 20%. In China, the modern trade hypermarket environment continues to be challenging across many categories. Our gross sales in China declined in line with our estimate, with net sales up about 15% on a constant currency basis.","Chocolate category performance in the third quarter was sluggish and down about 4%. Our marketplace performance was in line with our expectation, with market share off about 1 point. We\u2019re executing against our plan and over the remainder of the year, have a balanced consumer proposition of variety, news and marketing across the Hershey\u2019s Milk Chocolate, Hershey\u2019s Kisses and Golden Monkey candy and snack brands. Our China e-commerce business has been relatively consistent and continues to post solid results, albeit off a smaller base. We estimate that our e-commerce business has about a 10 share of the market in China and look to build on that over the remainder of the year, driven by Singles Day in November.","Now, to wrap up, despite the macroeconomic challenges facing the consumer, the broader snacks category, including indulgent snacks, continues to grow across retail channels. We are committed to our marketing mix modeling, trade, TV advertising and digital media as well as investments related to innovation, consumer marketing and insights that we believe will enable Hershey to deliver consistent and predictable top and bottom line growth.","As I stated earlier, we feel good about our preliminary 2017 plans that are still taking shape. We\u2019re a growth and EBIT margin-focused company with a goal of increasing margins on an annual basis via both cost control and importantly, top line growth. Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its global brands in U.S. scale. We are optimistic about our future and focused on what we need to do to succeed. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, and our executive management team and the Board of Directors are confident that we\u2019ll continue to build value for all Hershey\u2019s shareholders.","Now, I will turn it over to Patricia who will provide you with details on our financial results.","Patricia Little","Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.2%, in line with our forecast. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.29, an increased of about 10% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to shift of advertising and related consumer marketing expense to the fourth quarter and the 280 basis point decline in the adjusted tax rate that was greater than anticipated, more on both of these in a bit.","Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 20 basis points, net sales increased 2.4%. As expected, net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates and a 70 basis point benefit primarily due to lower international and other segment direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances as we lap the year ago challenges in China. Volume was a 1 point contribution to net sales growth, driven by our performance in the U.S. Acquisitions were a 70 basis point benefit due to barkTHINS, which we acquired in the second quarter.","By segment, third quarter North America net sales increased 1.8%. Volume was a 1.1 point benefit and driven by the U.S. business, where volume was up 1.7 points. Canada net sales and volume were off as planned as solid new product performance was more than offset by select SKU rationalization. Acquisitions were an 80 point \u2013 80 basis point benefit and net price realization, a 10 basis point headwind.","Total international and other segment net sales for the third quarter increased 5.3% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 2.2 points. International and other segment volume was up 10 basis points, as solid Latin America and select export market performance was partially offset by lower sales in China, the discontinuance of the edible oil business in India and a little softness in the global retail and licensing business. Net price realization was a 7.4 point benefit as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were lower.","Turning now to margins, adjusted gross margin declined by 40 basis points in the third quarter as productivity and cost savings were offset by unfavorable sales mix from excess packaging and higher supply chain costs, driven by initial year absorption of overhead related to the Malaysia manufacturing facility. For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly down versus a year ago. As J.P. mentioned, we remain focused on our cost structure. The productivity initiatives we have discussed this year are on track and we plan to deliver approximately $135 million in cost savings this year and at least $100 million per year from 2017 through 2019.","Adjusted operating profit in the third quarter increased 7.6%, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 22.3% versus 21.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating profit was driven by an increase in gross profit and lower marketing expense. As expected, total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined about 9.6% in the third quarter. This is partially due to timing. Recall, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 5% in the second quarter and we expect that it will increase in the fourth quarter as well.","North America and international and other segment, SM&A, excluding advertising in the barkTHINS acquisition, declined 5.5%, driven by savings from the previously discussed business productivity programs. Unallocated corporate expense increased 3.5% or $4 million as efficiency and cost savings initiatives were offset by higher employee-related costs, an increase in corporate depreciation and amortization and JV minority interest expense.","Now, let me provide a brief update on our international and other segment. I am pleased that our total international business delivered on their Q3 plans. As J.P. stated, we are executing against our plans in the key markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India. Adding to his commentary on China, chocolate category performance in brick-and-mortar continues to be choppy. Consumer spending still appears to be mixed within the modern trade box. China gross sales are forecasted to decline in 2016. However, net sales are expected to increase as we don\u2019t anticipate the same level of direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances as last year. Constant currency net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased nicely. International and other segment operating profit increased meaningfully and I am pleased with the progression. As J.P. said, we are committed to profitability in this segment.","Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $24.4 million increased $5.7 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.7%, lower than our estimate as R&D tax credits were greater than anticipated. As expected, the other income and expense line item includes the book expense related to corresponding tax credits that we mentioned last quarter. For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be about 100 basis points lower than last year. For the third quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 215.2 million shares, down 4.9 million versus last year resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.29 or an increase of about 10.3% versus a year ago.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow, at the end of the third quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year\u2019s third quarter by $20 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $1 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $30 million and accounts payable increased by $9 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $64.1 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be at the low end of our $265 million to $275 million range.","During the third quarter, adjusted depreciation and amortization was $61.5 million and dividends paid were $128.6 million. In the third quarter, the company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In addition, the company did not repurchase any common shares in the third quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $333 million slightly lower than a year ago.","As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year and into 2017, we have a lot of innovation, variety and seasonal merchandising and programming in the marketplace. We have good visibility in the holiday orders and demand related to the upcoming launch of Hershey\u2019s Cookie Layer Crunch. We feel good about our marketing mix modeling investments and believe that we have the right balance of spend over the remainder of the year as total trade and advertising is higher in the fourth quarter versus last year. We believe these investments should result in a continued sequential improvement in U.S. retail takeaway.","For the full year 2016, net sales will increase around 1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of about 50 basis points and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 75 basis points. We continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly below last year due primarily to unfavorable sales mix. Business productivity and cost savings programs are on track with our targets. And as we discussed earlier, the tax rate is expected to be slightly favorable versus our previous expectations. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted for 2016 to increase 4% to 5%, including barkTHINS\u2019 dilution of $0.5 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.28 to $4.32 range versus the previous estimate of $4.24 to $4.28.","Thank you for your time this morning and we will now take any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney","Thanks very much.","J.P. Bilbrey","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Feeney","I wanted to ask a little bit about the Q4 and maybe some thoughts going forward. Obviously, I mean, you mentioned a little bit in the script there are some timing issues with the reductions to SG&A. So, I\u2019d first like you to maybe parse how much of that is kind of reduction in advertising versus maybe structural SG&A that\u2019s just going to be lower? And when you think about Q4 and 2017, are there things going on? Can you give us a sense of like what your \u2013 what\u2019s the right level of relative advertising for the business right now, because obviously, you spend well ahead of your peers? You have a launch going on. But on the flipside, a lot of people are maybe looking more critical with the kind of investments that they are making and there is other ways to push it and promote right now. Thank you.","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes. Sure, Jonathan. Thanks. What I am going to do is ask Patricia and Michele Buck, who, as you know, is our Chief Operating Officer, is also with us. So, I will ask the two of them to talk about the fourth quarter, because I think that will be something that comes up for several of you. Thanks.","Patricia Little","Thanks. Let me start off by talking first about SG&A, excluding advertising and related marketing. You could see that it was down and has been down since we have gone through the year both on a divisional level and on a year-to-date level in corporate. When \u2013 we did have a little bit of an uptick compared to prior year in the third quarter. That really had more to do with some timing issues that we had last year\u2019s third quarter than any change in our fundamental run-rate. And I expect to see this focus on cost in our SG&A, excluding marketing and related advertising expense to continue. In terms of the advertising and related marketing expense, we \u2013 as I said in my remarks, we have been running above in the second quarter. We dipped below a little bit in the third quarter, but we expect to have that backup again in the fourth quarter. And that, combined with added investments in trade promotion, we believe will continue to drive momentum in the marketplace. And I will turn it over to Michele to talk a little bit more about that.","Michele Buck","Yes. So, I would say we continue to believe in investing with the consumer and focusing on getting that right balance between advertising and trade that lets us really deliver in the marketplace. If you think about Q4 overall, we have very good visibility into our holiday orders as those are already sold into customers. We will be shipping Hershey\u2019s Cookie Layer Crunch and that will be a bigger benefit to net sales than it will be takeaway. You will see more of the takeaway towards the end of the quarter and into 2017 and you can think about that as being roughly 1 to 2 points growth for us in Q4. And then lastly, the balance of our growth will really come from overall takeaway across our international and U.S. business. And we believe that we will continue to see some sequential improvement in Q4 behind the investments that we are making.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning everyone.","J.P. Bilbrey","Hi, Ken.","Ken Goldman","J.P., I know it\u2019s early. I know you are not ready to give an exact number yet. But just in terms of you talked about some potential margin growth coming from some of the unique activities you maybe undertaking in the next year or two, people are speculating anywhere from 50 basis points to 400 or 500 basis points. Is there any help you can give us just sort of bracketing what the opportunity might be? I am sure you are not going to go full 3G on us, but any thoughts about the opportunity and how we should think about that would helpful at this point?","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes. I think there is a couple of things, Ken, that I would say is that you are going to continue to see us talk about the importance of being both growth and EBIT margin-focused. And so we have got to have the right balance there. We continue to be optimistic about the category. And the things that we have talked about so far, I think we have been transparent about, but what you will really hear more with greater specificity is when we get together on March 1 at our meeting. So, a lot of this work is still in process, I would say. But the way we think about it, Ken, is we really have more of a business model philosophy around how we want to have that right balance. But we also believe that if you noticed in my remarks, I have talked about getting the right mix of growth opportunities and where we invest. And I think it\u2019s just basic that we always have to revisit some of those. And given some of the macroeconomic challenges, I think you will see us try to get those right going forward. And then again the greater specificity will come in March. So, if you work with us on that, I appreciate it.","Ken Goldman","No, I appreciate that. Mark, if you don\u2019t mind, if I can ask a quick second question.","Mark Pogharian","Sure, go ahead.","Ken Goldman","J.P., I think you mentioned that you are looking for both top quartile performance in 2017 as just sort of an early outlook into next year. One, I wanted to make sure that, that was EPS that you were talking about just in case I missed it. And two, what are you looking at when you are looking at performance? Are you basing that versus 2016? What are you thinking about performance? What will that be on average? Just trying to get a sense of \u2013 I guess it\u2019s my job, this entire call, trying to get numbers out of you, but trying to figure out what those numbers might be a little more specifically?","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes. So I think you have to think about that as both from a growth standpoint and then also from an EBIT margin standpoint that will be a significant focus for us going forward.","Ken Goldman","Alright, thank you.","J.P. Bilbrey","You bet. Thanks, Ken.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Rob Moskow","Thank you. As a follow-up I think to Ken\u2019s question, you will probably get questions about the sustainability of your gross margin, which is at \u2013 still at a \u2013 close to a peak. And I guess I can see a lot of room for SG&A kind of efficiencies, but I\u2019m still curious as to what you think gross margin can do and if there\u2019s expansion from here given that you are expanding into snacks, which I believe are lower margin. And I think commodities were probably about as low as they can go. They probably can\u2019t get much lower. So \u2013 but what are you looking at in that regard?","Patricia Little","Hi, Rob. It\u2019s Patricia. Let me take a crack at that. I think you have laid out some of the parts to our gross margin that we are very focused on. I agree with you that the snacks and some of the international margin \u2013 gross margins are lower than they are. In our core U.S. chocolate business, there is not much that does better than core U.S. chocolate in terms of margin. And you see some of that mix impact in terms of what\u2019s in the base right now. You have mentioned commodities. Commodities will go up and they will go down and we keep our eye on them. And we always look to have some visibility going forward in our commodity expenses so that we can price accordingly and respond accordingly. But I don\u2019t subscribe to the fact that there aren\u2019t improvements we can make in our gross margin. And I want to call out one of the things that our U.S. plants are doing here in terms of the methodology we call lean, which is really wringing even more costs out of the production process and that\u2019s something that we are in the process right now of \u2013 we have in several of our plants and were rolling out to more plants. Another thing that we can look at is really on our SKUs and making sure that we have the best, most optimal SKU mix in our portfolio. So, while I agree with you there is a little bit of a headwind in terms of the portfolio evolution, I think that we wouldn\u2019t want to say that there is nothing that we can do about it. We need to remain enormously focused on gross margin.","Michele Buck","Yes, I would build on that. I think we also believe we have some opportunity relative to the work that we are doing on revenue management and optimizing trade as well as price mix that could help us as well.","Rob Moskow","Okay, J.P., congrats on your retirement. Looking forward to March 1. Thank you.","J.P. Bilbrey","Thanks a lot. Look forward to seeing you as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Driscoll","Great, thank you and good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about the Cookie Layer Crunch, you gave some nice comments in the opening, but can you discuss just kind of why this product is so important? And how incremental do you expect it to be to Hershey and the category? So let me just start there and a follow-up, if I may.","Michele Buck","Sure, David. It\u2019s Michele. I will take that one. As we have talked a bit before, we really view our competitive landscape as being that whole snacking world. We know that snacking is growing faster than the total food market. And within that, we are seeing a lot of growth in indulgent snacking and we think it\u2019s a real opportunity for us to leverage our trademarks and play as broadly as we can. And what we have seen is a strategic opportunity to source revenue more broadly and also to provide some incremental texture that we are seeing based on our consumer demand landscape that certain consumers are looking for so that it really expands the footprint of our Hershey trademark. So as we had mentioned, this is an area where we do a lot of testing. We did the BASES test that looked at concept, product delivery as well as our marketing investments behind the proposition. And all signals have indicated that it is a big nice kind of scale platform opportunity for us and that\u2019s why it\u2019s really important. It\u2019s going to help us to refresh the Hershey brand to bring relevant news and capture new snacking occasions.","David Driscoll","Can I just follow up with a question that\u2019s a little bit bigger picture? When you guys look over the last couple of years on innovation within the U.S. chocolate category, kind of how do you grade it? And how do you consider that to be the primary culprit in \u2013 resulting in the much lower and slower category growth that we have seen? And then is Cookie Layer Crunch one of the key components to reaccelerating the category for Hershey?","Michele Buck","So David, I would say, as we think about the key priorities that are necessary for us to drive the business and maximize our results, they really focus on portfolio, which does have a lot to do with innovation. On marketing mix, we have talked about this category as very responsive category, so getting the right balance between advertising and trade and also within advertising, how we spend our dollars and then, of course, cost control, where we are \u2013 have always been focused and as you know are focused on some additional platform work going forward there. So, I would say that innovation is absolutely key. Scale platform innovation has proven to be one of the greatest drivers for our category. I am encouraged about some of the innovation that we had this past year and I think that we have seen the results of that in the marketplace. And a lot that didn\u2019t launch until the second half, but Big Kat, Reese\u2019s Pieces Cup has done incredibly well. And Snack Mix was also a great innovation that drove incrementality. Of course, it wasn\u2019t shared to the confection category. It\u2019s actually health and salty snacks. So, it is a key lever. And having that sustainable big platform innovation gives us sustaining innovation over a multiyear period of time and that\u2019s one of the biggest focuses for us is making sure that we have sticky innovations, so that it doesn\u2019t just launch and come out. But I agree with you that as we look to next year, both in terms of our business as well as the category, we think that the level of innovation is really going to help to drive CMG category growth and bring consumers to our category. So we are really excited about that.","David Driscoll","Well, I really appreciate the answer. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew Grainger","Good morning. Thanks, everyone. I wanted to ask about the margins in the international segment. I think it\u2019s the first quarter in about 2 years, you have been profitable there. And I don\u2019t expect you to comment on longer term targets for where you see that at the moment, but just if you could walk a bit more through what contributed to the improvement and the profits turning positive in that segment. And do you feel you have turned the corner and are now at the point where you can sustain positive margins, positive operating profit in international over the next few quarters?","Patricia Little","Yes, I will take a crack at that. And let me start by saying that you may recall last year, we had a lot of issues in China with trade, where we really had to readjust our inventory out in the trade to market conditions. And so what you are seeing \u2013 a lot of what you are seeing is the non-recurrence of that. We have some great results in our Mexico and Brazil operations that I feel really good about. In Brazil, we are having a very good year as we have taken over from our Bauducco JV and have now control of our \u2013 over our distribution and are seeing great results from that even given the difficult operating environment in Brazil, so great job from the Brazil team. In Mexico, we have increased distribution opportunities using our Sigma distribution partner, so great result there. India has been taking care of some products that are lower profitability and you can really see that helping our margin and we need to continue to do that going forward. I think China will continue to be a work in progress as we assess our opportunities against the marketplace that we have there, whether that\u2019s in chocolate, which has been a little bit weak or in the more traditional candies that we have with our Golden and Munching Monkey brands. So, we are focused on gross margin there. And getting to healthy gross margin is a big part of the story of returning that whole segment to profitability.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. And the restructuring that\u2019s going on in China, is that \u2013 are we seeing the impact of that flowing through or is that being largely offset by some of the category challenges still?","Patricia Little","It\u2019s \u2013 I am sorry \u2013 go ahead.","Mark Pogharian","No. I mean, I was going to say we have done some initial integration work with Monkey. I don\u2019t think there is \u2013 we didn\u2019t say anything about any restructure work underway, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what you are referring to. I mean, there is again a broader assessment going on right now. As J.P. referenced around what \u2013 it\u2019s really a global review across all functions in all geographies. So, we will come back to you with further details on the where and the how.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone.","J.P. Bilbrey","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","A question for Michele. Can you just give us a little bit of color in terms of how business is performing in the U.S., instant consumable versus future consumption? And I know the instant consumable has been a bit of a drag over the last, I guess, year or so, but it sounds like some of the innovation or some of the work you have got going into the market next year is going to address that. But if you can give us some color of kind of the difference between the two would be helpful? Thanks.","Michele Buck","Sure. So, instant consumables is always a priority for us, given its strong profitability and so as we look at the past couple of years, we are really focused going forward and how we can continue to drive instant consumable a little bit harder. There has been a bit more competition in that area from some healthy instant consumable offerings. But where we feel good about where we are making progress is the results we have seen from some of the innovation that was instant consumable focused, both in terms of our Ice Breakers gum, capacity expansion and then the Reese\u2019s Pieces Cup and Big Kat. And then you will see that with Cookie Layer Crunch as well and some other offerings into next year. We have also focused on optimizing some of our merchandising strategies in a way that we think will continue to drive instant consumable a bit harder. So it\u2019s certainly a key focus for us.","Bryan Spillane","And just in terms of how it\u2019s trending right now, is it still lagging your future consumption business?","Michele Buck","No, it\u2019s not.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. Thank you.","Michele Buck","Absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.","Jason English","Hey. Good morning folks. Thank you for the question. You mentioned earlier about innovation to try to rejuvenate next year so \u2013 and the platform optionality. Tactically, I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on this Crunchers product and how it fits in, in terms of that and maybe some specificity about when and what is coming on that. And then stepping up beyond innovation, we crunched some of the numbers over here, it looks like another big source, so the category weakness has been just a crowd-out in terms of merchandising, display \u2013 and display space, quality merchandising space within retail, if you can elaborate a little more, what do you think is driving that and what do you think can try to reverse the course of that one, I appreciate it? Thank you.","Michele Buck","Sure. So I will address both of those. So first of all we will look at Crunchers, this fits right in the strategy. We have spoken to you a bit about around snackfection, which is thinking broadly about where our core confectionery trademarks, which are so powerful, can play to bring in new users and be utilized across even more snacking occasions with consumers. So if you look at Crunchers, you can see the product has our great trademarks and great chocolate, but very different eating experience, which is much more of a munchable crunchy product, which will put those propositions in a whole different consumer use education. So it really fits in that strategy of expanding snacking occasions across the broader marketplace. And you will see that in the marketplace sometime mid first half of the year. But we are really excited about that. Relative to your broader question on some of the other factors at play in the category, one that I would bring up is just the timing of Easter is always a key factor for the category. And certainly, some years that\u2019s a benefit. And some years, it\u2019s not. This year is one of the shortest Easters. Next year, we have that going in our favor, so we are excited about that. And relative to display, there has been some pressure on the category as some of the biggest retailers have gone to clean floor policies. And given how much floor space confection has received. I think this category has taken a little bit of a bigger hit than some other categories potentially. We believe that we are now behind us with lapping a good piece of that and we believe that having great innovation is one of the best ways to gain display and space. And we are feeling good about some of the initiatives that we have put in place for holiday, where we are seeing share gains and also the share gains that we saw in Q3. And display has been a piece of that.","Jason English","Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar","Happy National Chocolate Day, everybody.","J.P. Bilbrey","Thank you, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","I must have made I was not aware that was a thing, but I just figure that out today, so that\u2019s good. So J.P., just a quick one, I am curious on, I guess your thoughts on all the activity in the space this coming year. We have got a new chocolate launch in the U.S. by Mondelez, you have got margin rate we are now better able in theory to kind of integrate their efforts, I guess more fully in a category that remains relatively slower versus historical run rate, so I am trying to get a sense if you think all of that is enough to accelerate the category growth rate in \u201817. And obviously, if what Hershey has planned both what we know and don\u2019t yet know is enough to either hold or gain share in that sort of a more active environment?","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes, sure. So we \u2013 as we look at 2017, we believe the category has indicators that it will continue to expand. I wouldn\u2019t describe that as a planning stance that says it\u2019s a hockey stick, but I think we can see that there is firming in the category. Consumers are in stores. And I just think overall, at the macro level, we think people are across all income cohorts beginning to spend a little bit more confidently than they have before. What I think of that I am very optimistic about is if you just look at the total snack wheel, snacking continues to progress. I think it\u2019s largely driven by occasions. So we have to compete and do well against those new occasions that exist in the market. But I think innovation will be an important driver. It\u2019s good for the category if you think about it within the total snack wheel that we have great competitors. And so frankly, as there is good innovation, I think it just reminds consumers the relevance of CMG in total and so I think that\u2019s good for all of us. And then we of course have to win as well. So what I think you will hear from us as we get more specific about 2017 is we are optimistic about some improvement in the category growth rate as relative to snack wheel. We think occasions certainly benefit us as well and then we have to win market share. And that\u2019s why we are focused against an overall business model that helps us win as a part of the top quartile of our peer group. And then we also want to win market share, obviously within our specific categories. So I am pretty optimistic about 2017 and those are some of the reasons why. Michele importantly talked about the competitiveness in-store. That was all true. But listen, we are all in the business of growth and meeting the wants and needs of consumers. So we are going to be really focused against executing. We are going to win every day from a market share standpoint and then the category growth rate should take care of itself.","Andrew Lazar","Great. And as it relates to in-store competitiveness, you may get into this more at your meeting in March, but where you do think Hershey stands now at the sort of the in-store effort or the feet on the street, you made a lot of investment there over the last couple of years, is that in the right place or does there need to be some maybe some additions and further investment on that part of it?","J.P. Bilbrey","Well, in my comments, I talked about being flexible and agile. And that\u2019s something that we look at all the time. And so we are constantly reviewing where we think the opportunities are with our organization. We believe strongly in the resource that we have and the effectiveness of our sales organization, our overall go-to-market effort. So you would continue to see that as something we just view as really important to winning every day.","Andrew Lazar","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard","Good morning everyone.","J.P. Bilbrey","Good morning Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hi, can I ask about how you are thinking about the acquisition strategy from here, I would love to hear what your sort of views, historically on the Brookside acquisition and then Krave were. And I am focusing on North America here, as you think forward, are you thinking about larger scale opportunities and how are you thinking about diversification maybe in the direction of Krave and more into the non-sweet snacks area or is it going to be more of the bolt-on box and Brookside type of activity?","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes. So Michele and I will both talk about that. Let me take the more macro piece of that. So we believe that we want to grow and we look at acquisition as an important piece of that. Obviously, if we can find large, meaningful assets that align with the categories that we are in, we are very open to that. As we have talked about before, we are very aware of all of the different things that exist. We look at a lot of things. At the same time, we believe we have a great business model and we don\u2019t want to do anything that doesn\u2019t really help us build there. I think that when you would see us do smaller things, it\u2019s because we believe they fit within a larger platform or have a brand positioning that we can really build around. I don\u2019t think we are going to be in the business of just getting a lot of disconnected small things that we can\u2019t figure out how to knit together. So, we are very thoughtful about how we think the emerging consumer trends are and does that help us get into some of these different places. So, M&A is an important thing for us. At the same time, we want to be very, very thoughtful about how we approach that. I will let Michele talk a bit more about Krave and Brookside and some of her thoughts there.","Michele Buck","Sure. So, we feel good about each of those acquisitions if I look to Brookside, Krave as well as barkTHINS though that one obviously is early. And really, our strategy there is looking at how we can expand our portfolio to either bring in new users or new usage occasions, something that we perhaps aren\u2019t able to do with our current existing portfolio of brands. So, we really think about buying a brand and a full proposition. As I look at Brookside, we have been really pleased with how we have delivered against that acquisition model over the years. We certainly have grown the business. It continues to be important strategically in terms of delivering and getting us more into the mass premium space. And right now, we are focused on consumers love the products. We have great repeat. And our next wave of growth there needs to be to continue to drive incremental trial and bring in additional users to that product that folks love. Krave, we are feeling good about. And if you look at all three of these acquisitions, as we create value, we certainly start by creating value by expanding distribution and that\u2019s been the clear first piece of the model by achieving cost synergy and then third, by unleashing and expanding the brand and that\u2019s really the model we think about each one. Krave, we have nearly doubled the sales on that, likewise, nearly doubled distribution and are feeling good about where our velocities are in the marketplace and the innovation pipeline we have behind that. And we are seeing similar results that would certainly again allow on barkTHINS. So, we feel like we have got a model that is helping us to continue to have a portfolio that meets the growing, expanding needs of consumers.","Alexia Howard","Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations, J.P.","J.P. Bilbrey","Hey, thank you.","David Palmer","As a follow-up on an earlier question, how would you compare the new cookie fused products to past innovation maybe in your consumer testing or the trade buzz, it can be compared against the platforms like Minis, Pieces or Reese\u2019s Stuffed with Pieces or Hershey caramel? And I have a quick follow-up.","J.P. Bilbrey","Well, first of all, all of the different things that we look at there, we believe they are consumer tested and we want to make sure that they are meeting a need. We have done a lot of demand landscape work that helps us think about where these products belong. And I think we are \u2013 I would tell you that I think the rigor we have and the new demand landscape work that we are doing is pretty exciting and it gives us some real insights into some of the things we are doing in our R&D work. So I would tell you we are very confident about the things that you will see us working on as we go forward. And I am sure that in March, we will reveal a little bit more of our demand landscape work and you will see where we are positioning some of these products. So obviously we have always been thoughtful and we are always optimistic, but we just try to get better every year. And we are pretty excited about the things we have in front of us.","David Palmer","And then with regard to SKUs, back in 2015 I think you were talking about SKU rationalization being part of the plan. Earlier in the year, it looked like SKUs were flat. Now, they are coming back up again. Are you in a good place with the trade on SKUs and velocities or how are you thinking about that as you enter into \u201817 and have new products coming on shelf? Thanks.","Michele Buck","So, we know that it\u2019s a highly competitive marketplace and I think we are always trying to achieve that balance between having the right amount of news to fulfill those consumer and retailers\u2019 needs and be competitive in the marketplace, but also balance that with being very disciplined and really making sure that we have got the right focus on profitable SKUs that allow us to deliver the best margin. So, I would tell you that we have got a lot of focus on that right now. We have continuing focus on that and we will look to continue to optimize there.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Baumgartner","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question.","J.P. Bilbrey","Good morning, John.","John Baumgartner","Michele, just in keeping with the theme of generating your own growth in the U.S., how much more can you maybe lean into the seasonal businesses whether it\u2019s in C-stores or other channels? I mean, that seems to be a reasonably incremental segment that Hershey hasn\u2019t executed against significantly in the past?","Michele Buck","We think very broadly about seasons and seasons are really celebratory occasions. So, we certainly look to max out each individual traditional season opportunity, but we really try and think more broadly about how we can apply that model more broadly. So for example, the S\u2019mores occasion is a great opportunity of almost \u2013 of the S\u2019mores season. And then more recently, we built the birthday opportunity, which we just started shipping in the marketplace in the second half of this past year. It\u2019s one of the reasons why Kisses is doing so well, because we have now found a way to get that Kiss and some of our chocolate products into a new occasion, where we really help create and shape that occasion for consumers and the need for our product during that occasion. So, we see that as one of the big opportunities just to continue to expand on that occasion focused strategy in addition to winning the traditional seasons and continuing to uncover new insights that allow us to do that.","John Baumgartner","Thank you.","J.P. Bilbrey","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. The last question will come from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Strycula","Hi, good morning everyone.","J.P. Bilbrey","Good morning, everyone.","Steve Strycula","So, two quick questions one for Michele and one for J.P. For Michele, I think I heard you say earlier in the call that Cookie Layer Crunch, which you are excited about should be about a 1 to 2 percentage point lift to baseline sales in the fourth quarter. Is that right? And if so, should we expect it to kind of endure through the first half of next year as you kind of bump up that baseline into 2017?","Michele Buck","I don\u2019t [indiscernible].","Mark Pogharian","I don\u2019t know if we want to get into that level of specificity yet. I mean, obviously, the fourth quarter, you are backing into it, so it\u2019s a little bit different. But a lot of this \u2013 it\u2019s a big brand, a big launch and we hope to get trial and repeat. And then as J.P. loves to say, repeat a repeat. We will certainly provide more color there, but I mean it\u2019s the biggest news on the brand in a long time. So let\u2019s put it that way.","Steve Strycula","Great. And then J.P., a quick follow-up, just wanted to see \u2013 you commented earlier on the call that you are seeing broader based spending habit pickup across the income spectrum it seems like because you said traffic seems better in the stores. And I think this time last year, you are talking down saying traffic was a little bit of a pain point in some of your occasions. So, can you kind of explain the evidence as to why you are seeing kind of like a broader based pickup in your core consumer and even the category? Thanks.","J.P. Bilbrey","Well, first, you have to take a step back and remember, with our brands, we have very high household penetration. We have high market share. And therefore, we can see across and we have ubiquitous availability. So as we look at all of the different channels and how consumers are \u2013 put traffic into stores and then how they are spending per trip, it\u2019s all things that we follow pretty closely. And so you are starting to see such. So imagine that some retailers probably have relatively stable traffic on a going basis than others depending who their income cohorts are. You might see a bit of a different traffic pattern. So, what\u2019s happening is, first, you begin to see people come back into the stores and then you begin to see the basket broaden a little bit. So, I just want to be cautious that it\u2019s not as if everybody is out high-fiving. But as we talk to some of our retailers and as we follow those metrics, there is evidence that the consumer on a more broad base is having a greater frequency in the store. And then we follow what I would simply call the breadth of the basket or the trend \u2013 or the value of the basket and we are seeing some improvement there as well. It\u2019s different by channel and you would see some retailers having different experiences.","In some retail segments, still talk a little bit about volatility that they are seeing. But again, the good news is that fairly broadly, we are seeing an uptick in trips. And then as the economy I think continues to firm a bit, there will be some confidence around the spend of those consumers. And that\u2019s part of what makes us optimistic about 2017 is if you think about the three elements of our business, seasons, the everyday business and then, of course, instant consumable, instant consumable is very much influenced by people obviously being in the store. We are going to have our products on the floor when they are in the store. When our advertising is working hard for us, you see that everyday business, which is a wonderful margin business for both us and the retailers, do well. So, it really comes back to these elements, Michele talked about earlier for us, strong innovation, making sure we have got the right marketing mix modeling and then the business model that we have talked about. And we will explain more in \u2013 when we get together in the spring. It\u2019s really going to be the three buckets of focus for us as a company.","Steve Strycula","Well, congratulations on a good quarter.","J.P. Bilbrey","Thanks a lot.","Mark Pogharian","Well, thank you very much for joining us today. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s call. You may disconnect at anytime and have a wonderful day."],"10980":["The Hershey Co. (NYSE:HSY) Q2 2017 Earnings Call July 26, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Mark K.

My name is Keith, and I'll be your conference operator today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","This call is scheduled to end at about 9:30 AM, so please limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many of you as possible. And please note this call may be recorded. Thank you.","It's my pleasure to turn your conference over to Mr. Mark Pogharian. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's second quarter 2017 conference call. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC.","If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income, prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.","The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss second quarter 2017 results excluding net pre-tax charges of $28.9 million, or $0.14 per share-diluted, which are primarily related to business realignment cost and derivative mark-to-marketing losses. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.TheHersheyCompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Michele Buck.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast. Hershey's second quarter results were solid, with particular strength in market share and EPS delivery. And we made solid progress against the initiatives that we discussed with you earlier this year.","I was pleased with our innovation performance and solid second quarter U.S. retail takeaway of 4%, driven both by our core brands and Easter, where we gained 1.6 market share points in this important season.","Constant currency net sales increased 1.8% and were greater than our previous estimate, driven by the timing of new stand-up packaging as well as distributor changes by several customers. Gross margin was up nicely in Q2, and we continue to expect it to increase around 50 basis points for the full year. This will enable us to maintain investments in initiatives that should benefit the company in the near and long-term and drive future growth.","Adjusted EPS of $1.09 was greater than our previous estimate, due to higher sales, gross margin expansion and the timing of advertising and related marketing investments versus our forecast.","We continue to expect that full year advertising and related marketing will increase versus last year. The Margin for Growth Program we discussed on March 1st is progressing nicely. And we believe the benefit in 2017 will be a little bit better than our initial thoughts. Importantly, year-to-date adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS increased 13% and 23%, respectively. This puts us in a position to deliver solid full-year EPS growth at the high-end of our 7% to 9% range, while also enabling important investment in the business.","Our core power chocolate brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat and Kisses, continue to perform well, with retail takeaway up 6% and market share up 1 full point year-to-date. Nielsen's second quarter measures do not encompass the entire Easter season in both the year-ago and current periods. Therefore, the majority of my remarks today will refer to year-to-date marketplace performance for the 24 weeks ended July 8, 2017.","Year-to-date, CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, category growth in the xAOC+C-store channels, was up 1%. Importantly, within the chocolate and non-chocolate candy segment, where we derive the majority of our U.S. sales, year-to-date category growth is about 2.1%.","Turning to Hershey takeaway, total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the year-to-date period through July 8, 2017, was up 1.4%, driven by solid CMG growth of 2%. This more than offset some softness in grocery items such as baking chips and syrup, as well as lapping last year's successful snacks performance.","Our year-to-date CMG market share was up 0.3 points, resulting in a market-leading share position of 31%. Importantly, our CMG non-seasonal retail takeaway and market share adjusted for Easter cannibalization increased.","Year-to-date, xAOC+C-store chocolate category growth was plus 2.3%. Hershey's xAOC+C-store chocolate retail takeaway was plus 2.9%, resulting in a chocolate market share gain of 0.3 points. While we feel good about the progress we've made and strong market share gains, our year-to-date takeaway is lower than we anticipated, driven by the challenges we are seeing broadly across the total box. As a result, we have updated our full-year net sales forecast to reflect this change in shopping patterns and behavior that will most likely continue over the remainder of the year.","We have good visibility into our second half seasonal orders and have strong consumer support that we expect will drive second half retail takeaway of about 1%. This will outpace second half net sales, which we estimate will be around the same as the year-ago period, due to the second quarter timing I mentioned earlier.","Our response and go-to-market strategy in this fast-changing retail environment must continue to evolve. Work is underway to determine how to further leverage our advantaged capabilities and knowledge to enable us to deliver the consistent top-line growth that we expect from our business.","We believe the CMG and broader snack wheel will continue to outperform the center of the plate shelf-stable part of the store. CMG and snacks have inherent advantages such as impulsivity, seasons and multiple pack types for usage occasions. This facilitates merchandising and display within different parts of the box where there is foot traffic, like the perimeter and check-out. We will keep building on our expertise as we continue to encounter greater levels of competitive snacks innovation and related in-store merchandising and programming.","So we're focusing on three areas of our business that we control where we can drive growth. One, CMG and snacks innovation; consistently delivering meaningful, sustainable, candy and snacks innovation on an annual basis is an important lever of our overall growth algorithm. We're testing products and concepts from the snacks demand landscape work, and we're encouraged with the early results. The demand work is also pointing to an opportunity around branding. Our core candy brands have appealed to other snack consumers. However, there remains an opportunity to more effectively target this group. We'll leverage this work in the near future and look forward to sharing the insights with you.","Leading this effort will be Mary Beth West, who joined Hershey in May as our new Senior Vice President and Chief Growth Officer. Mary Beth will oversee the company's growth strategy, including insights and analytics, strategy, innovation, R&D and M&A. She is an accomplished leader who is considered one of the best food executives and marketers in the industry. Her deep experience in growing some of the world's best-known consumer brands and demonstrated ability to transform consumer engagement will be a tremendous asset to Hershey as we chart our growth agenda.","Two, we're accelerating our efforts in collaboration with key brick-and-mortar retailers related to their click-and-collect and omni-channel initiatives, as well as with established e-commerce players. This is a fast-evolving and continuously-changing space. And we're partnering on digital front-end design to drive category and Hershey growth.","We are making investments over our strategic planning cycle that we believe will lead to solutions to ensure that Hershey and the category remain top-of-mind with consumers, no matter where and how they shop. The build-out of this strategy should help ensure that we have a compelling message and product that connects with the consumers of our major retail partners in all channels.","Our absolute annual e-commerce net sales dollars are small, low single digits on a percentage basis, but it's the fastest-growing platform of our business. As shopping and consumption patterns change, there's been an acceleration of online snacks purchases in 2017. We're expanding and further developing our e-commerce CMG and snacks business. We have a dedicated cross-functional team responsible for the strategies and execution of our e-commerce plans that report directly to Todd Tillemans, President of our U.S. Commercial Group.","Within our supply chain, initiatives are underway to create more efficient pack types and packaging to accommodate the needs of e-commerce and click-and-collect retailers. And we'll leverage the learnings from our digital and social marketing teams with the goal of converting every consumer connection into a purchase opportunity.","The seasonal component of our core business gives us an opportunity to engage with consumers and potentially leverage this into subscription or occasion-based purchases. While we have come a long way, we believe we're still in the very early innings, with a long runway of opportunity ahead of us in the e-commerce space.","Three, we need to leverage and commercially-activate the incremental consumer data that is becoming increasingly available due to technology advancements. We have advantaged capabilities today; however, we need to continue to develop them. Our analytics and consumer insights have historically focused on traditional methodologies based on qualitative and quantitative shopper feedback. Predictive analytics, machine learning and big data sets to identify candy and snack growth opportunities is getting better. And we're constantly exploring how to leverage and further our capabilities using this technology. So there are a lot of exciting growth initiatives under way that we believe will help ensure Hershey remains a top quartile performance.","Now, for an update on our International and Other segment, we are driving growth while meaningfully improving profitability. Excluding China, our International and Other segment constant currency net sales are expected to increase mid-single digits this year. We're making measured investments in our core markets of Mexico, Brazil and India, where we're seeing solid marketplace gains while improving on operating income trends.","Net sales for the quarter were greater than our estimate, although on a constant currency basis, slightly lower versus the second quarter of 2016. Mexico and Brazil continue to deliver against plan and achieved constant currency net sales growth in Q2 of a combined 12%. And in India, where we have evolved our portfolio, shifting to higher-margin value-added products to strengthen our business model. We're sharing these learnings with our team in China, who's focused on doing the same.","In the second quarter, implementation of the Margin for Growth Program in China commenced. We have begun to optimize the manufacturing operations and the related support functions as we strike the right balance between in-country investments and near-term market opportunities.","China chocolate category sales sequentially improved from Q1 to Q2, increasing plus 1.9%. Small format stores continue to show growth and more than offset hypermarket softness, resulting in a year-to-date chocolate category growth of about 0.5%. Our e-commerce team continues to make progress, and we estimate that our online market share increased 0.6 points in Q2 to 8.6%.","Going forward, we have a disciplined strategy in China that is focused on effective Hershey brand messaging, continued e-commerce penetration and smaller store format expansion to enable us to capture the opportunity in this emerging market.","Now to wrap-up, we're making progress against the many growth initiatives we outlined when we were with you on March 1st. In the second half of this year, we're lapping a solid comp versus the year-ago period. However, we have a lot of innovation and activity, including the continued rollout of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch bars, the late Q2 launch of Reese's and Hershey's Crunchers Candy and Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cups, as well as solid Halloween and holiday plans, all of which should enable us to achieve our goals.","We have much work to do. And there are always refinements along the way, especially now, given the consumer and retail environment seems to be changing at an accelerated pace. With this change, I see tremendous opportunity, opportunity to evolve our business model, to advance our capabilities to new heights, and to create new vectors to unlock future growth.","As evidenced by the market share gains of our core chocolate products, our brands resonate with consumers in an increasingly competitive environment. Consumers have an emotional connectivity to this category. And when combined with our go-to-market capabilities and knowledge, I feel we're positioned nicely for future growth in measured and evolving non-measured outlets.","The Margin for Growth Program should provide us with the fuel to invest in the initiatives that we believe will create long-term value for our shareholders. We'll continue to invest in our brands and in the capabilities that give us a competitive edge at retail and with consumers.","We believe our margins are sustainable and are forecasted to increase over a strategic planning cycle. And our strong operating cash flow gives us many options to grow our business and reward shareholders.","I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you details on our financial results. Patricia?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Michele. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.66 billion increased 1.5% versus last year. This was greater than the estimate we spoke to you about in April, due to the timing of some customer shipments that Michele discussed earlier.","As implied in April, we did not expect a big acceleration in Q2 from a net sales and retail takeaway perspective, given the late Easter and the lapping of successful new product launches like Kit Kat Big Kat and Reese's Pieces Cups in the year-ago period.","Adjusted earnings per share-diluted came in at $1.09, an increase of about 28% versus last year, driven by the higher sales, by solid gross margin expansion, OI improvements in the International and Other segment, driven by our Margin for Growth Program savings, which are coming in a little faster than we anticipated, a decline in corporate expenses and a reduction in the year-over-year tax rate that was in line with our estimate.","Excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.3 points, net sales increased 1.8% versus the year-ago period. Volume was a 1.2 point contribution to sales growth, and net price realization was a 0.1 point favorable. The barkTHINS acquisition was a 50 basis point benefit in the second quarter and is relatively on track with our plans.","By segment, North America net sales increased 2.2% versus the same period last year. Excluding Canada's unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.3 points, net sales increased 2.5% versus the year-ago period. Volume was a 1.7 point contribution and net price realization was a 0.2 points favorable. The barkTHINS acquisition was a 60 basis point benefit.","Given the level of competitive activity in the CMG category and the timing of innovation and promotions impacting year-over-year comparability, we were pleased with our U.S. market share performance. However, similar to trends experienced by the broader U.S. food group, 2Q CMG category growth and Hershey retail takeaway was less than our forecast. The company forecasts growth in U.S. retail takeaway and market share in the second half of the year, despite the broader industry retail challenges that are expected to persist.","Due to the timing of some Q2 shipments, our net sales in the second half of the year are expected to be about the same as a year ago. As is typically the case, the company expects full-year U.S. retail takeaway and net sales growth to be similar.","Total International and Other segment net sales for the second quarter decreased 3.6% versus last year. Excluding the 10 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange, International and Other segment net sales decreased 3.5% versus the year-ago period. Volume was off 2.1 points, due to planned declines in China and net price realization was a 1.4 point headwind.","Turning to margins, adjusted gross margin of 47.1% increased 160 basis points in the second quarter, driven primarily by lower input costs and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives. This more than offset unfavorable sales mix and a slight increase in obsolescence.","For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted gross margin to increase about 50 basis points, driven by lower input costs, greater than our previous estimate, and by productivity and cost savings initiatives. This is expected to offset second half fixed costs volume absorption due to lower sales, unfavorable product mix and the rollout of new packaging formats.","Adjusted operating profit in the second quarter increased about 16.9% versus the year-ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 20.8%, an increase of 270 basis points. The increase was driven by the higher gross profit and lower SG&A due to productivity and cost savings, both at the corporate level and in China, driven by our Margin for Growth Program.","Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense was about the same as the second quarter of 2016. Our forecast back in April called for mid to high single digits percentage increase. However, given the retail environment, the forecasted second quarter increase in advertising and related consumer marketing expense is now planned to occur in the second half of the year. The company continues to expect that full-year advertising and related consumer marketing will increase in 2017.","Now, let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. On a constant currency basis, net sales declined 3.5% versus last year, although revenue performance was slightly better than our forecast. Michele discussed our China operations, but let me add that I'm very pleased with the Margin for Growth Program work that is underway. While this has pressured sales, the rightsizing of the cost base is beginning to come through at the operating income level.","Looking at our other focus markets, we continue to execute against our plans in Mexico, Brazil and India, where combined constant currency net sales in these three countries increased 10%; more on this in a minute.","Second quarter International and Other segment operating income of $8.4 million increased nicely, driven by the implementation of the Margin for Growth Program. As we stated previously, we are driving a strong profit-focused mentality in this segment and are beginning to see the bottom-line trend improve in 2017. And we now expect International and Other segment operating income to be around the breakeven area for the year.","In Mexico, chocolate progress continues, with solid double-digit retail takeaway that is in line with chocolate category growth. Q2 constant currency net sales in Mexico increased 17%, driven by a combination of volume and pricing. Sales were strong across key brands, particularly Kisses and Hershey's chocolates and Hershey's milk drink box. Our new Hershey's CHOCOYOGO product is off to a good start. We continue to build distribution in the modern trade, with repeat purchases and market share tracking with our estimates.","In Brazil, our team is focused on profitable growth, despite the challenging operating environment. Q2 constant currency net sales increased by 3%, driven by about 6 points of pricing. We estimate that year-to-date, chocolate category growth in Brazil is about 10%. Our retail takeaway was about 2.5 times the category growth rate, fueled by both distribution gains and higher velocities, resulting in a market share gain of about 40 basis points. We do expect retail takeaway to temper in the second half of the year, due to increasing competitive activity from wait-outs and price-driven activities.","Constant currency net sales in India increased about 2% and was in line with our plan. Importantly, growth in the brands we're investing behind, Hershey's branded syrup, spreads and milk booster, as well as Brookside, Jolly Rancher and SOFIT, increased more than 40%. The launch of Brookside, primarily in the modern trade, is progressing and on plan.","Our transition of the India portfolio is enabling a higher margin business. And we are on track to expand gross margins here by 1,000 basis points in 2017. This is enabling investments in the marketplace that should result in a sustainable operating model.","Moving down the P&L, second quarter interest expense of $24.1 million increased $2.8 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $95 million to $100 million range. As expected, the adjusted tax rate declined in the second quarter to 25%. The rate versus the second quarter of 2016 was driven primarily by a favorable rate differential related to supply chain and international operations, some discrete items, as well as the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments.","For the full year, the company now anticipates its effective rate to be between 26.5% and 27%. This is about 100 basis points lower than our previous outlook, due to the discrete tax items and slightly higher income tax credits. Specifically, in 2017, we expect other income and expense related to the corresponding tax credits to be about $60 million versus our previous estimate of $55 million.","For the second quarter of 2017, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 214.6 million shares, in line with last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $1.09, or an increase of about 28% versus a year ago.","Total capital additions, including software, were $51.4 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect that CapEx will be in the $270 million to $290 million range. And during the second quarter, adjusted depreciation and amortization was $60 million.","In Q2, we paid $128 million in dividend. And earlier today, we announced that we increased the dividend by 6%. The company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January, 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. The company did repurchase $100 million of common shares in the second quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.","Now to summarize; as Michele stated, we have a lot of activity over the remainder of the year. While our second half of the year profile is not as robust as we'd like, recall that we're lapping our strongest period of quarterly sales growth. Combined with the macroeconomic and consumer challenges at retail, we believe the plans we have in place will enable us to achieve our full-year sales target of around 1%, including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 25 basis points.","As I mentioned earlier, we don't expect input cost inflation and continue to forecast adjusted gross margin expansion of about 50 basis points. The Margin for Growth Program is progressing, and we now expect 2017 savings of about $25 million versus our earlier forecast of about $15 million. Additionally, our brands typically respond positively in marketplace investments and we continue to forecast that full-year advertising and related consumer marketing will increase in 2017. Although lower than our previous estimate, SG&A, excluding advertising and related marketing expense, is expected to increase for the full year 2017 versus 2016, as our ERP expense will be ramping up in the second half. Combined with the lower tax rate, we continue to expect 2017 adjusted earnings per share-diluted to be towards the high-end of the 7% to 9% range.","Thank you for your time this morning. And we'll now take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take your first question from Andrew Lazar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning, Andrew.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","My question is on marketing and advertising spend. I guess would you anticipate that the full-year spend that you plan is consistent with what you had initially targeted, just now concentrated in the back half of the year, as opposed to the increase that you thought previously in 2Q? And then, given that your brands in your business historically have been so responsive to the marketing spend, and you've got a lot of new stuff out there like the Cookie Layer Crunch and you've got some EPS flexibility in the 2Q, I guess. I guess I'm curious to get a little more color on why not spend earlier in the year behind some of these initiatives when your brands really are so responsive? Thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So Andrew, as you know, we are big believers in investment in our brands. It's a key piece of our business model. We are fortunate to participate in a category that is very responsive to investment. So as we look at our investment in advertising and consumer-related spend, our impressions will be up, so we look both at the dollars, but we are also trying to get seated more impact from the dollars we spend. And our impressions will be up comparably both in half two as they were in half one. So even though there was a little bit of shifting in dollars, our spending is definitely in line with what we had forecast for the year; in fact, it's up a bit. And we continue to feel good that what we're getting from that spending is even higher, based on the marketing mix modeling that we're doing.","So we're always making trade-offs and balances as we manage the year in terms of where we think we can get the biggest bang for our buck. So we are committed to the dollars, but sometimes we will shift it if we see an opportunity or we have some innovation. We had some in Q2 that actually the ship timing pushed out a little bit further than we anticipated and, therefore, we needed to push out the advertising.","So I wouldn't think about it as much as a pull-back of us consciously pulling back on spending, but more making sure that we're getting the most and aligning it to the activity that we have and the quality of copy, et cetera.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Alexia Howard. Please go ahead.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning, Alexia.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. So, I guess my main question is you had a pretty hefty and clean beat this quarter versus expectations, yet you're not raising your formal guidance on the EPS range for the year. I know you're saying it's coming in at top-end. Is there anything that's getting tougher going forward than you expected, aside from the uncertainty around the store traffic here in the U.S.? Thank you very much.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. Alexia, I would say there's not any one big thing that we are trying to protect ourselves against. I actually think what we really want to do is make sure that we have the opportunity to invest into this marketplace. There are a lot of new capabilities. We're investing in e-commerce. We've mentioned before continued investments in activating some of the learnings from our demand landscape, work that we're doing around aisle reinvention, packaging updates, investing in emerging brands. So we're really looking at where those vectors upshift in evolution in the marketplace and how do we make sure that we are investing appropriately there and also still able to maintain all those critical investments in the core that drive our profit engine. So that's really what we're trying to do there.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","The other thing I'd add to that, Michele and Alexia, is really what I'm pleased about is that we were able to hold our EPS guidance, given that we took our net sales guidance down. And that really reflects the company's good cost discipline, which is allowing us both to maintain that as well as invest even more in the second half than we planned to.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","I agree. The other thing, Alexia, just as a data point I should point out, ERP is another big investment. And as we look at our investments there, we'll actually be spending twice as much in the second half, behind ERP, as we have in the first half and that's meaningful.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for the question.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Congratulations on a solid first half.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thank you.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","One thing you highlighted, however, that's concerning is just the ongoing softer-than-expected category growth rates. You also mentioned e-comm, the impulsivity of the category, presumably, ongoing shift to e-comm threatens traffic; maybe it threatens the category with that impulsivity. So in context of the realities of slower category growth and maybe some risk on the forward, I'm surprised that we haven't heard you talk about your strategic focus on diversification to other snacks.","So can you shed a little bit more light on where you're going? I know there's chatter or news out there on expansion into ready-to-eat popcorn. Could you just touch on some of the initiatives, whether or not there's a heightened sense of urgency in context to category, and what it means both from an organic and inorganic strategic direction?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Absolutely. So let me start with, first of all, we feel really good about this category and, particularly, about chocolate if you look at the chocolate takeaway numbers that were delivered this year, because the category softness was primarily driven by gum and mint. And, as you know, chocolate is the biggest piece of the category. The way that we think about the business is we need to win with growing customers. Our goal is always to outperform the marketplace and to gain market share, so that if there is softness, we get even more of our growth from market share gains. And we're heavily focused on that because it's our profit engine. At the same time I would tell you, I think about this marketplace as a time where we have a great core business that we're going to continue to drive. And at the same time, we have some opportunities to evolve, to evolve our product and brand portfolio and also to evolve our channel mix to adapt to the changing marketplace.","Snacks is important in our strategic agenda. And the way that I think about it is we are a large player in snacks by being number one in the biggest category within snacks. What we now want to do is expand our portfolio so that we can participate in even more snack occasions and ensure that we have the right portfolio and channel development to maximize those opportunities.","So I would say it is important. You will see us both doing snacking innovation and also continuing to evaluate and consider M&A as a lever in that growth agenda as well. Our snacking demand landscape that we completed really helps us to lay out and see the future opportunity, both for confection and for snacks to make sure that we're building our portfolio incrementally.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Baumgartner. Please go ahead.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for the question. Good morning.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Hi, John.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, John.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Michele, just to continue with the snacking discussion, in the first half in North America, there was a 60 basis point differential in your retail takeaway between the total portfolio and then just the CMG business, which grew faster. So can you speak a bit to some of the performances and observations at KRAVE and barkTHINS in terms of just distribution and competition?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure, absolutely. So first of all, we feel great about our core brand CMG performance. As you know, that's really the stable part of our portfolio that is really our profit engine, so feel great about that. As I look at the remainder of our portfolio, I'd say that we saw some pressure in two areas. First of all, baking chips and syrups were softer than anticipated, in line with, I think, what we're seeing in center of the store categories.","And then, as we go and look at our portfolio of smaller emerging brands, I would say it's a little bit of a mixed bag. We're really pleased with how barkTHINS is doing. And as we look at some of the rest of the pieces of the portfolio, we've learned a lot since we made the Brookside and KRAVE acquisitions and we're trying to leverage that learning along the way. So we've had to right-size distribution on some of those brands where we think we overextended both the distribution and perhaps the portfolio a bit. So we're really self-correcting on that. And we're applying learnings to make us even more stronger in the marketplace. I would view this piece of the portfolio as one that we expect growth from, but I think it's going to be a little bit lumpier and inconsistent as we leverage big learnings and expand along the way.","As part of that snacks portfolio, I would add we feel really good about Snack Mix and those products that we've put in the marketplace, as they've demonstrated a lot of stability and pretty strong growth.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Michele.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Driscoll. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Hi, David.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I had probably just two questions that I wanted to ask. A follow-up here on the sales, so in the most recent Nielsen data, the last two quad weeks, either a month ago, it was up 0.6% and the most recent data, up 2.2%. So it actually looked like things were getting better. So maybe I'm a little surprised that you're thinking net sales will be flat in the back half. And then maybe when you just talk about that a little bit, the strength in this recent Nielsen data and why it does suggest that things flatten out. Can you quantify the impact of the inventory build?","And then to Patricia, can you talk about the margins a little bit? I think operating margin's up 210 basis points in the first half. And I think the implied margin would be down 100 basis points to kind of reconcile with where your guidance is. That feels pretty negative, given your comments on Margin for Growth and the very flat commodity environment that we're seeing. Maybe a little bit more discussion on that would be helpful to understand the impacts.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thanks, David. And I appreciate the question and your perspective on that. If we look at the 12-week period ended July 15, it's a little more flattish. So while I'm really encouraged by the past several weeks, if I look at the two quad periods earlier, the marketplace was much softer. So I think what we're seeing this year is a lot of volatility. It's difficult to predict the market. And I certainly am optimistic that those recent trends continue, but I would say that they do include the July 4th holiday period. And I think we've seen a bit more stability during some of those periods, where there is an anchor season where somebody's coming into the store to make their purchase, but really I'd say it's about volatility. First part of the year, we saw some months that were up, we saw some down. And we're trying to do our best to project what we think that will look like as we go into the second part of the year.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","And this is Patricia, David. You asked about the retail inventory. And, yes, that was a factor in our second quarter. So we really wanted to have a lot of transparency around that. We did some pipeline build against new packaging. And we accommodated some of our retail customers who had some changes in their own distribution network. And it was very important to us to meet their service needs so that they could get product on the shelf in a good execution way.","And so when you look at our takeaway, you can see that we need to normalize that retail build over the second half of the year. And so we still believe that retail takeaway will improve in the second half, but from a net sales perspective, we know that we've got to work through that inventory.","In terms of the gross profit that you commented on, that sales pattern also shows up in the gross profit. So to the extent that we had higher sales in the first half of the year, that had better fixed cost absorption and that will come out again in second half of the year as those sales normalize through.","The other thing that we had in gross profit is as we have reduced our overall full-year sales guidance, obviously, that has a mix impact when you look at the mix of products that we think are most hit by the weaker retail trend. And then finally, we do have some changes in packaging coming, both on the shelf and as we work with our retail partners for packaging that works in their format. And that's also a bit of a headwind for us in our gross margin in the second half of the year.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And, Patricia, just to follow-up, is there any way that you could quantify that retail inventory build, just because it sounds like we should take it out of the third quarter, but I don't think I heard you say the magnitude of it?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","We didn't put the dollar amount out there, but what I'd say, David, is what we want to do every year is make sure that our net sales and our retail takeaway are in line together. So if you look at our overall sales, assume that that's our retail takeaway, and I think you can pretty easily normalize out that inventory build.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","By the end of the year, we would say they'd be aligned.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Feeney. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you so much. So I guess following up on Dave's questions, I want to make sure I have these numbers right. I think you told us year-to-date U.S. retail CMG takeaway was 1.4%. And I think that maps to the 4% number you gave us for the second quarter in the release. Correct me if I'm wrong about that. So, a couple of questions here; first, am I right that means Q1 was down 1.2% on net retail takeaway or something like that? I know there is seasonality between Q1 and Q2.","And secondly, Patricia mentioned Q2 takeaway was disappointing. Can you give us a sense what you had been expecting for Q2 takeaway? And then related to that, like what kind of takeaway would you expect? Is this just continued 1.4%-ish takeaway in the second half for the U.S., are you expecting with this flat sales guidance? Thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure. So let me start with the first part of your question, which is total Hershey takeaway was up 1.4%. Hershey CMG takeaway year-to-date was up 2.0%.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So our CMG performance outpaced the total. And that was really as a result of...","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","The grocery stock.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","The grocery stock primarily that was a bit of a drag on the total number.","And then as we look at the takeaway on a full-year basis, as Patricia said, we're looking for by end of year, net sales and takeaway to be relatively in line with each other. And we're anticipating net sales to be around that 1% range. So that can help to give you a guide of the range of where we think that takeaway may come in.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. And, Jon, it's typically pretty much, well, they're relatively the same every year. So if you go back to our April guidance, around 2% would've meant around 2% retail takeaway as well.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","That's helpful. I guess I'm just trying to understand where the disappointment came in and its order of magnitude on takeaway.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. And I'd say a lot of that was around everyday post-Easter was a bit softer than we anticipated.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Gotcha. Thank you very much.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Okay.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ken Goldman. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Question, Patricia, your guidance remains, I think, for input costs to still just not be a headwind for the year, but they were a tailwind in 2Q. And it's obviously impossible to know from our end, but at least from our basic math, it doesn't seem like that tailwind gets any less strong in the back half of the year. So I'm just curious. Is there anything we should be aware of that might be more of a headwind in the back half of the year or do you expect similar trends to maybe what you saw in 2Q in terms of just that input cost tailwind?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. They were a little bit better in the second quarter. And we expect that to flow through to the full year, but not get better. It's really the drivers that I mentioned earlier around because of the change in sales between the first half and the second half, you've got some fixed cost volume absorption. You've got that mix impact I mentioned. And some increased costs coming through on the packaging. And that's really what's, you know, when you look at that against where we came in in the second quarter, that's where some of that comes out.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for that. And then a follow-up, Cookie Layer Crunch, you talked, I think, last quarter, about the real question \u2013 and I think this is true for all new products, right, is where repeat purchases are going to be. Can you help us understand where they have come in versus your expectation? And the reason I'm asking is, at least in Nielsen data, which I know is not always precise when it comes to new products, but what we're seeing is the max ACV, the weighted average ACV, they both peaked a few months ago and have trailed off a little bit since. So I just wanted to get a better sense from you guys what you're really seeing with that brand and how happy you still are with it.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So we're very pleased with Cookie Layer Crunch performance. Trial and repeat are exactly in line with our expectations. And so we feel great about that, especially in a world and a marketplace where there are a lot of other big innovations in the category this year as well. So we particularly feel well that we hit those goals despite that. So we continue to be bullish on the initiative, as well as on some of the other innovation like Crunchers and some of the recent innovation that is out there.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Palmer. Please go ahead.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. First, a follow-up on the acquisition comment you made, I think it was Jason's question. Are you looking across all snacking as fair game? I ask because, at times, Hershey has ventured into other aisles and has done perhaps a little less well. And you seem to be signaling a little bit of a closer-in approach with that term snackfection, where, seemingly, you're trying to leverage a little bit more of the core with what you extend into. Any comment there would be helpful. And I have a follow-up.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure. So we really are looking across the snacking landscape. We have identified a couple key areas that we have the most interest in that, for competitive reasons, I won't go into the details on. I will say when we think about that, that we do think about how we can get scale wherever we're going to make an acquisition, either by buying something that's large enough to give us scale or by either looking at a section of the store we can get scale, or a category segment where we can get scale to ensure that we get the benefits of having a profitable business and the organization's focused in one spot. So I'd say we're looking across, but we have distinct areas of focus within.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just to follow-up also on your comments in the prepared remarks, you seem to be calling out a need for at least a subtle repositioning or a revived focus on the core in some way. You said something about insights work you're doing and stay tuned. Is that a comment about everyday non-seasonal chocolate? And maybe you can give us a hint as to what sort of general opportunity exists for improvement and the timing of any tactical changes you can make there. Thanks.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure. I mean, what the snacking demand landscape really gives us is an even deeper view of where each of our brands plays and where there is opportunity to sharpen our positioning to capture new usage occasions or to be more relevant to new users and also to take our portfolio and appropriately spread it to cover the landscape to minimize any overlap.","And so what you'll see on some of our brands \u2013 we recently started investing in Twizzlers and PayDay. And we're leveraging some of the landscape insight in the messaging and in the media strategy. And we're actually seeing some really nice results. And across many of our brands, we're seeing some of that sharpening focus.","So, I'd say in terms of timing of when you would see that, I think you would start to see it like on the Twizzlers and the PayDay, for example, right now. I think on some of the bigger brands, we should see some benefit from that, I'm going to say, mid to perhaps late into next year, maybe around mid-year next year perhaps. Is that helpful?","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Moskow. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thank you. Michele, I think I thought I heard a bit of a change of tone today regarding the sense of urgency to get bigger in e-commerce. You mentioned click-and-collect and also with pure-play e-commerce providers. And I think what I hear from investors about their biggest concern on Hershey and other confection companies, is that just the number of cash registers, the number of opportunities for impulse purchases are now structurally declining. So have you decided internally to kind of shift more of your resources towards that e-commerce effort? And is that part of what you're kind of signaling today? And maybe give me a little bit about what they're thinking about doing to duplicate that impulse occasion online?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure. So I would start with the fact we're encouraged that as we look at our business this year, we had pretty strong performance across impulse and our take-home business. So despite that accelerated shift in e-comm, we've still been able with our retail sales force and the power we have in store, to capture and grow that piece of the portfolio. And innovations played a key role in that as well.","That said, I think it is fair to say that we are dialing up. We've been focused on e-commerce, but we are doubling-down a bit more than we had in the past with the dedicated team, our reinvestment of additional resources and really partnering closely with our customers.","One of the biggest changes I've seen in the marketplace is a lot of our bricks-and-mortar partners are now really dialing up their efforts on omni-channel, both click-and-collect and multiple forms of home delivery. And then, of course, there are the pure-plays out there.","So I guess I think about that business in two ways. One, I think that we have an opportunity to say how do we capture the planned nature of how consumers purchase in that channel and dial that up and really capture that on our business. And at the same time, several of our retail partners have come to us and asked us to partner with them in terms of figuring out how to optimize impulse in an e-commerce world. I can't tell you I have the answer to that right now, but I can tell you I think we are in a good position to really be partnering with our retailers on that.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Strycula. Please go ahead.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Steve.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Two questions; the first would be on gross margins, just to follow-up on Ken's questions. Can you help us unpack a little bit of some of the tailwinds or headwinds in the back half of the year? It just seems like the full-year guidance is conservative where you're tracking year-to-date. Can you talk about the mix comments you were discussing, whether that's channel mix are more product mix and elaborate a little bit more on the packaging investments that you're making? That'd be helpful.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Sure. Thanks for the question. So I think it helps to just stand back and say that whenever we're going to reduce our overall net sales outlook, it's going to have an impact on our gross margin, both because we're going to have fewer products to absorb our fixed costs and also because as sales come out, those are typically are very high margin, best mix product. And that's just a natural impact. So first of all, that's the pressure down. In addition to that, this year, especially in the second half of the year, we are making changes to some of our packaging, both as the way that the consumer will see it, and also the way the retailer will handle it in store. And that has some cost as well. So those are the headwinds that we have on a full-year basis.","You do see this sort of first half, second half dynamic, driven by the change in sales profile between the two halves of the year. I think the fact that in that lower sales world, we were able to hold our gross margin \u2013 overall margin's actually a positive story. It shows that we do have slightly lower input costs and also that our productivity is very strong in that area.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","That's really helpful. And then two quick modeling housekeeping questions, the $60 million other income that you were speaking about, that I think was ratcheted up about $5 million for this year, is it fair to model that $60 million going forward or is it just kind of that one-time extra $5 million is a bump this year versus forward years?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Great question. We want to have a sustainable tax rate. So we look each year at investment tax credit opportunities. I think that that's as good a forecast as I would have right now for next year is, again, because we're looking at a sustainable tax rate.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And given the mechanics of what you said for the third quarter gross margin, the volume deleverage because of the timing of the shift, does that mean that EPS on a year-over-year basis is more pressured in third quarter versus fourth quarter or are they pretty comparable on a year-over-year basis? Thank you.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","They'll come in the way they do, depending on the pattern of our sales. And we're really not giving that level of quarterly guidance. I'd just think about it right now as a second half impact.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Growe. Please go ahead. Your line's open.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Chris.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I just had a question for you, if I could, on when I look at the stronger gross margin performance and the lower SM&A in this quarter, it's not clear to me that you are investing. You've talked about investments in go-to-market capabilities. Is that inherent in these stronger performances? And then, I'm just trying to understand going forward then, is that also part of the pressure, if you will, on the second half performance of the business?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yes. I think that's a great question. Thanks for the question. We talked about the amount of savings that we wanted to deliver through our Margin for Growth Program. That's coming in a little higher than we expected. And that's given us the opportunity to both maintain our bottom line as well as incrementally invest in the second half of the year on a couple of things: first, against advertising and related marketing spend that Michele talked about; second, about the capabilities that we talked about in the first part of the remarks. So when Michele's talking about things like unlocking the demand landscape, using analytics against our consumer or growing our e-commerce capabilities, those are investments that we're making. So we are ramping up those capabilities in the second half of the year.","And then finally, as Michele mentioned, we do have a new ERP system going in. And that spending is also starting to really ramp up in our SG&A in the second half of the year.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And thanks for that color. And just a quick question for you on China, it's becoming a smaller and smaller part of the business. Much of this quarter looks like it was self-inflicted. Is that sort of decline rate going to continue? Are you rationalizing SKUs to a point that we've got to lap this, if you will, over the next year?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. I think that's a good way to think about it. As you know, we've put a real focus on rightsizing and rationalizing our China business. It's one of the first pieces of the Margin for Growth area that we focused on and where we'll see some of the early wins. We are seeing those wins. And inherent in that is a lot of moving parts, including looking at the SKUs and making sure that we're going to market with productive and profitable SKUs. It means rationalizing where we participate in the markets in terms of channel mix as well as geography. And so all of that is having a planned impact on our overall sales and we knew that would happen, but it's resulting in a more healthy business and that was our goal. And we're very pleased with that.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, okay. Thanks a lot.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take that question from Matthew Grainger. Please go ahead. Your line's open.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, everybody. If I could just ask two quick follow-ups; first, I just wanted to ask about the seasonal outlook for the second half of the year. You had extremely strong share trends in the first half during Easter season. So just curious how the discussions with retailers around second half holidays have been progressing, their level of excitement around the CMG category, specifically, and whether you expect similar or still sort of clearly positive share trends during the upcoming holidays. And then the second one, all the reinvestments you've talked about, the impact on second half margins, could you talk a little bit more about why you expect a pullback in International margins? And which investments are specifically focused in that segment?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Matthew, we feel good about the seasonal outlook in the back half of the year. We anticipate that we will grow business, our business, in both of those holidays. And as you know, we have very good visibility into what our retailers are purchasing in those holidays. Right now, I would say we are feeling good that we should gain share during the holidays in the back half of the year. And I'll turn it over to Patricia to answer the second part of your question.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. So great question and I think you made a good point, which is year-to-date, we are slightly positive in our International and Other segment. So when I say around breakeven, it would sort of encompass that. We do recognize that with a lot of moving parts going on in China, in particular, there are a certain amount of things that we want to protect against in that world. And so that's a little bit of my maybe conservatism on that piece of the business.","We also mentioned some of the trends we think will be a little pressured in Brazil in the second half of the year as well. When you're this close to breakeven, we're talking about plus or minus pretty small numbers.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Mark K.

My name is Theresa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company First Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Pogharian to begin. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you, Theresa. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Bert Alfonso, Executive Vice President and CFO and Chief Administrative Officer; and I will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We welcome those of you listening via the webcast.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2011 filed with the SEC.","If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.","As we said within the note, the company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","We will discuss first quarter results excluding net pretax charges of $33.6 million or $0.09 per share diluted, which are primarily related to the Project Next Century program. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges, non-service-related pension expense, and acquisition and integration costs related to Brookside Foods.","With that out of the way, let me now turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","John P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark. I'm pleased that the Hershey Company generated solid quarterly results in Q1 of 2012. We expected to get off to a strong start as the first quarter is essentially the only period of the year where we realized pricing across the board. We continue to support our brands with the right level of investments to succeed in the marketplace across all channels. This has resulted in achievable, predictable and consistent growth, which has been ahead of the long-term targets we established in 2008, and we did this against a backdrop of consumer uncertainty. Importantly, the CMG -- candy, mint and gum -- category continues to outpace other parts of the store. For the 12 and 52 weeks ended March 24, 2012, the CMG category growth was, again, greater than the historical growth of 3% to 4%.","Given the high household penetration, impulsivity of the category, as well as affordable price points, we believe retailers across all channels will continue to value the confectionery category. As a result, we would expect the category to continue to consistently secure key merchandising space and programming.","In the first quarter, Hershey's net sales increased 10.7%. Bert will provide you with details, but growth was primarily driven by pricing. Everyday U.S. core brand performance was in line with our expectations and volume elasticity modeling, while Easter was slightly stronger. Our international business continues to be strong, contributing about 2 points to the overall top line growth.","Now looking at retail takeaway. CMG retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending March 24, 2012, per our custom database, in channels that account for over 80% of our retail business -- and as a reminder, these channels include food, drug, mass, including Walmart and convenience stores -- increased plus 6.4%. If you were to add the other fast-growing retail outlets like club and dollar, which will be available to you around midyear, and add the Easter products scanned in all channels between March 24 and April 8, our retail takeaway is in line with first quarter U.S. net sales.","Looking at syndicated data here excluding Walmart, Hershey's FDMxC retail takeaway was up 4.7%. Hershey FDMxC CMG market share in Q1 was flat, in line with our expectations. Note that syndicated data currently excludes our market share performance at our largest customer and in the fast-growing value channels where we continue to do well. Additionally, the year-ago period benefited from our major product launches, primarily Reese's Minis, that occurred earlier in the year given the late Easter. In 2012, the window between Valentine's and Easter was closer, necessitating seasonal merchandising and programming on the floor much earlier than the prior year. Therefore, we plan to launch our more significant innovation to launch in Q2 and beyond. We expect that this will have a favorable impact on our FDMxC market share performance in the coming months and quarters.","Given these moving parts, I'm pleased with the overall category performance in the first quarter. Investments in the category in the form of advertising and innovation are present for most major manufacturers, and it appears that competitor new product launches were skewed to the first quarter. For the 12 weeks ended March 24, FDMxC CMG category growth, including seasonal activity in both the current and year-ago periods, was also up plus 4.7%.","Given that marketplace data for the 12 weeks ended March 24 excludes the significant last 2 weeks of the Easter season and all the aforementioned moving parts, my upcoming remarks related to marketplace performance by channel will include seasonal data in all periods. For the 12 weeks ended March 24, 2012, food channel CMG category growth was up 1.1%. Food channel retail takeaway for Hershey was off about 0.5%, resulting in a market share decline of 0.5 points. Our non-chocolate performance was solid, up plus 10%, driven by continued TWIZZLERS momentum and the new Jolly Rancher Crunch 'N Chew product. And as I mentioned previously, Hershey chocolate performance in this channel was impacted by the timing of chocolate new product launches in the year-ago period. Hence, Q1 food channel chocolate category growth slowed to plus 1.8%. Our food channel chocolate retail sales declined 1.4%, resulting in a negative 1.4 share point loss. Given the timing of our 2012 new product launches, we would expect marketplace performance in this channel to sequentially improve as we make our way through the year.","In the C-store class of trade where the Easter impacts are minimal, the CMG category was up plus 8.5%. Total Hershey C-store performance was particularly strong with takeaway up 9.3%, resulting in a share gain of 0.2 points. These gains were driven by pricing, core brand advertising, in-store selling, merchandising and programming, including our continued successful promotional tie-in with the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament. In Q1, Hershey's C-store performance was balanced with retail takeaway up 8.6%, 15.1% and 15% in chocolate, non-chocolate and mints, respectively.","Importantly, it doesn't appear that higher prices at the pump are having a major effect at the C-store level. In case you missed it on April 6, a NACS, or National Association of Convenience Stores, spokesperson was on CNBC and stated that despite higher gas prices, sales inside the store have actually increased. 2011 was better than 2010, and so far this year, he stated most members are telling him that sales inside the store are going up. Hence, the current prices at the pump don't appear to be having the same effect on consumer buying behavior at NACS locations as they have in the past. Our experience is consistent with this as first quarter traffic, partially due to good weather and consumer dollar spend, was higher at our own CHOCOLATE WORLD retail stores. The convenience store channel will continue to be a meaningful contributor to Hershey in 2012. However, as we make our way through the remainder of the year, retail dollar takeaway growth will most likely slow as we begin to lap the price increase.","In the drug class-of-trade, CMG category growth was plus 2.2%. Hershey retail takeaway increased 3.4%, resulting in a share gain of 0.3 points. Similar to the last couple of quarters, our drug channel retail takeaway was meaningful in non-chocolate, mint and gum and resulted in solid market share gains.","However, our chocolate growth slowed to plus 2.6% and we lost 0.3 chocolate market share points in this channel. Chocolate dynamics changed in this channel during the quarter. However, we maintained our disciplined and focused strategy that will deliver long-term chocolate category growth and quality market share gains.","As we look to the remainder of the year, we have many exciting new products, promotions, programs and merchandising events in place across all channels. New product launches include Jolly Rancher Crunch 'N Chew, Rolo Minis and Ice Breakers Duos. Additionally, we're pleased to announce the launch of Hershey Simple Pleasures in 3 flavors, milk chocolate, dark chocolate and vanilla cream, in a smooth and creamy format that has 30% less fat than the average leading milk chocolates.","Our proprietary sales force allows us to execute flawlessly in store and leverage our merchandising and programming expertise. Some of the activity we have planned includes S'mores programming that will run throughout the key summer dates and into fall tailgating; a couple of TWIZZLERS summer programs, one tied in with the upcoming Spiderman movie and another that will award a lucky consumer a chance to win a new car filled with their favorite TWIZZLERS products; as well as a summer Reese's and Coca-Cola promotion. We're also on track to increase full year advertising expense low-double digits for the total company on a percentage basis versus last year, supporting new product launches and core brands in both the U.S. and international markets, and new advertising campaigns on the JOLLY RANCHER and ROLO brands.","Q1 advertising growth outpaced the increase in SM&A expense x advertising. We don't expect that to be the case over the next 9 months, as our planned investments in international go-to-market capabilities accelerate, especially in the second quarter. The SM&A increases are in support of the key international markets we've previously discussed and are focused on market research, category management and building selling capabilities. Our businesses in the focus markets of Mexico, China and Brazil are off to a good start to the year as net sales increased about 20%. The business and consumers continue to respond positively to these broad-based investments, and we expect the same response from our 2012 initiatives.","Now to wrap up. I'm pleased with the way the confectionery category and Hershey continue to perform in the marketplace. We have solid relationships and are working well with retailers in all our channels. Macroeconomic challenges still exist, however, and we feel good about the prospects, as confectionery has proved to be resilient given the impulse nature of the category and the continued investment in the category in the form of innovation and advertising. Category growth has been robust. It's expandable, profitable for the retailer and affordable to the consumer.","Over the remainder of the year, we're confident that our innovation, advertising and in-store execution will continue to drive top line growth. As previously mentioned, advertising will increase low-double digits on a percentage basis versus last year. As a result, we have increased our top and bottom line outlook for the year. We expect organic volume to be slightly up in 2012, and including in the results of the Brookside acquisition, about $90 million at current exchange rates, we expect full year net sales growth of about 7% to 9% including the impact of foreign currency.","There is no material change to our inflation outlook for the year and we continue to estimate that the input costs will be higher in 2012 versus last year. Despite this increase, pricing, productivity and cost saving initiatives are in place and at this time, we estimate that full year 2012 adjusted gross margin will increase about 90 to 100 basis points. Therefore, given our solid first quarter start and the SM&A investments to be made over the remainder of the year, we have increased our full year adjusted earnings per share diluted outlook and expect it to increase 10% to 12%.","I'll now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some additional detail on our financial results.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Thank you, J.P. and good morning, everyone. First quarter results were solid, with consolidated net sales of $1.73 billion, up 10.7% versus the prior year and relatively in line with our expectations. Adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.96, up 31.5%, was a bit better than our expectations due primarily to the timing of SM&A investments that I will provide more context on shortly. J.P. provided details on our marketplace performance, so I will focus on the review of the P&L, balance sheet and cash flow.","As expected, first quarter net sales gains were driven primarily by a 10.9% net price realization benefit, partially offset by core volume decline due to price elasticity of 0.5 points. Our recent acquisition, Brookside Foods, contributed approximately 0.7% on top line, and foreign currency exchange rates were about a 0.4 point headwind. Importantly, in the U.S., excluding about a 1.5-point benefit from new products, volume elasticity due to price increases on core brands is tracking in line with our modeling, and our U.S. seasonal business continues to be strong. Following a strong fourth quarter holiday season, Easter sell-in in Q1 was a bit better than our initial estimates. We continue to see relatively consistent growth in our international markets, as they contributed about 2 points to our top line growth on a quarterly basis.","Turning now to margins. In the first quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points, driven by net price realization, supply chain efficiencies and productivity. These margin gains were partially offset by higher input costs of about $30 million, in line with our expectations. Commodity spot market prices have been volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue in the coming months. As previously stated, we have good visibility into our cost structure and there is no material change in our full year inflation outlook. We continue to expect higher input costs in 2012 versus last year. However, due to our good start to the year, solid productivity and cost savings, as well as net price realization, we expect full year adjusted gross margin to increase 90 to 100 basis points versus our previous estimate of about 75 basis points.","Adjusted EBIT, driven primarily by higher gross margin, was up 28%, resulting in an EBIT margin of 21.3%, up 290 basis points over the first quarter of 2011. In addition, SM&A excluding advertising declined as a percentage of net sales by 130 basis points versus last year. A good portion of this gain is timing-related, and over the remainder of the year, we expect SM&A increases, excluding advertising, to be greater than the first quarter trends. Our planned SM&A investments include market research, category management and selling and marketing capabilities in both the U.S. and international markets. In addition, our R&D center in Shanghai is also scheduled to open later this year.","Advertising expense increased about 14% in Q1, and we continue to estimate low double-digit percentage increase versus last year, supporting core brands and new products in both the U.S. and international markets.","Now let me provide a brief update on our international businesses. First quarter international sales, excluding Canada, increased about 20% versus last year. We are pleased with our progress in our focus markets and especially China and Brazil, whose top line growth exceeded 20% in Q1, driven by strong seasonal performance. International profitability increased versus last year. However, this increase was primarily driven by the already mentioned timing of SM&A investments. We remain committed to these markets and we'll continue to make the necessary investments to build brand equity and drive trial and repeat purchases.","For the quarter, interest expense decreased, coming in at $24 million versus $24.5 million last year. In 2012, we expect interest expense to be approximately $95 million to $100 million. The tax rate for the first quarter was 6.1% [ph], slightly lower than last year due to the timing of certain tax events. Excluding tax rate impacts associated with business realignment and impairment charges, we continue to expect the full year tax rate to be about 35%. The tax rate in Q2 will be slightly less than Q1 and about 34% in the second half of the year.","In the first quarter of 2012, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 228.7 million versus approximately 230.2 million in 2011, leading to adjusted EPS diluted of $0.96.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the first quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's first quarter by $184 million. Accounts receivable was up $69 million and remains extremely current. The current year-over-year increase is a direct result of Easter timing. Inventory increased by $114 million year-over-year, primarily related to the Project Next Century production transition. Lastly, accounts payable decreased by $1 million.","In terms of other specific cash flow items, total company capital additions, including software, were $92 million in Q1. These amounts included Project Next Century capital expenditures of $47 million. In 2012, we expect ongoing CapEx to be approximately $240 million to $250 million, excluding Project Next Century. Capital additions are expected to be an additional $65 million to $70 million for Project Next Century, making our total 2012 CapEx estimate $305 million to $320 million. Note that these amounts include CapEx for Brookside Foods manufacturing capacity expansion as well. The Brookside integration is progressing as planned, and we intend to expand distribution in 2013.","Depreciation and amortization was $55 million in the quarter. This includes accelerated depreciation related to Project Next Century of approximately $9 million. Adjusted operating depreciation and amortization was $46 million. In 2012, we are forecasting total operating depreciation and amortization of about $195 million to $205 million.","Dividends paid during the quarter were $84 million. During the quarter, we repurchased 125 million of our shares against the 250-million repurchase authorization that was approved in April of 2011. There is 125 million remaining on this authorization. We also purchased 93 million of our common shares to replace shares issued in connection with exercises of stock options. All 218 million of acquired shares were repurchased in the open market.","Cash on hand at the end of the first quarter was $567 million, down $126 million versus year-end. As it relates to our short-term cash needs, the company is currently well positioned to manage the capital needs of the business. Our cash flow remains strong, and we'll continue to improve as we grow earnings and normalize inventory levels related to Project Next Century.","Let me now provide an update on the Project Next Century program. We are pleased with the progress we're making on the West Hershey plant expansion, which remains on track. The building is complete and progress continues with the startup of new production lines. All new lines are expected to be operational at the West Hershey facility by the end of Q2. The forecast for total project pretax GAAP charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs remains at $150 million to $160 million. By 2014, we expect ongoing savings to be approximately $65 million to $80 million. Please see the note in Appendix 1 in today's press release for further details.","Now to summarize. Our U.S. marketplace performance in measured and non-measured channels is tracking as expected. We have core brand building, merchandising and programming, as well as launches of new products planned for the remainder of the year, that will enable us to maintain our momentum. In addition, advertising will be up low-double digits on a percentage basis versus last year.","Given our strong start to the year, we have increased our top and bottom line outlook for 2012. We expect organic volume to sequentially improve and be up slightly for the full year. Our current modeling indicates organic volume will be about flat in Q2 and then up slightly in Q3 and 4. And we continue to estimate full year net sales contribution from Brookside of about $90 million at today's exchange rates.","Therefore, including Brookside, we expect full year net sales growth of about 7% to 9%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. There is no material change to our inflation outlook for the year. We have good visibility into our full year cost structure, and despite higher input costs in 2012, I expect adjusted gross margin to increase 90 to 100 basis points, driven by productivity, cost savings and net price realization. Therefore, we have increased our full year adjusted earnings per share diluted outlook and expect to grow 10% to 12%.","Before we open up to Q&A, and as you work your models, please note the following. In Q2, we begin to lap last year's price increase. Due to seasonality, Q2 is typically our smallest quarter. Our 2012 innovation picks up in Q2. However, we are also lapping the launch of successful Reese's Minis and Hershey's Drops. Despite commodity spot market volatility, input costs will continue to be higher year-over-year. We would expect to incur promotional and launch costs related to Rolo Minis, Hershey Simple Pleasures and Ice Breakers Duos starting in Q2. And as already mentioned, a good portion of the estimated timing on expense increases will mostly likely be incurred in Q2 and Q3.","With that out of the way, we'll now open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from David Palmer of UBS.","Mineo Sakan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Mineo calling in for Dave. I guess our first question would be, you did mention something about increased marketing and go-to-market capabilities. Could you characterize the nature of that spending?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Sure. We've been making investments over the last couple of years, certainly in both the U.S. and non-U.S. markets. And in this particular quarter, we've talked about it separately than advertising, which we said increased at about 14%. And so market research; sales force capability, not only training but also distribution expansion in certain geographies, particularly in China, that we've talked about in the past; as well as other capabilities which are collaborative, such as IDP, with our major retailers. Those are the types of investments that we're talking about. In addition to those, I mentioned that with our product launches, obviously, we have product launch expenditures that also fall into the SM&A category.","Mineo Sakan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And as you start to lap the Drops and Minis, which is clearly going to represent tougher comparisons going forward, are there any additional innovation in the -- or is there any additional innovation in the pipeline for the second half of the year?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, we have innovation across all of the markets over the balance of the year. But the ones that we've talked about are primarily the ones that we're going to be focused on. So again, let me remind you that we talk about our innovation being about 1 point of our overall growth. Over the last couple of years, we've done certainly better than that. And we're going to do better than that this year as well, but there will be some tough comparisons versus the kind of success we had versus Minis. But we still believe that we've got a good slate of innovation that'll be very productive for us.","Operator","The next question is from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of things real quick. On Brookside, can you tell us where you stand right now in terms of capacity utilization, the plan, the pacing of the expansion and where that business sits in terms of distribution across all channels today?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, the Brookside acquisition, if you remember when we talked about capacity, will be bringing on new capacity late in the year of 2012 that will help position us for a much broader expansion in the U.S. market in 2013. So today, that business is doing very well, and in fact, we wouldn't be able to go much further than we have already with the capacity we have. So we'll have capital investments in that business late in the year that gives us the ability to expand. And again, we're excited about what we believe is the potential of that. But 2013 is where the big change happens in terms of both volume and distribution gain.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And any help in me sort of sizing the prize on what the upside could be? Are you currently around 25% distribution, 50%, for example?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, we have broad distribution in Canada and then through Costco in North America. So as we think about bringing on the distribution, we would hope to be able to achieve distribution levels consistent with the balance of our brands in the category.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Costco, I think, is around 10% of U.S. right now, so that sounds like there's a lot of untapped opportunity.","John P. Bilbrey","We're very optimistic and excited about what Brookside brings to us.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And last question and I'll pass it on. I don't want to be too much of a time hog here. China, I think last quarter you guys talked about pushing out into Sugar Confection, maybe with the JOLLY RANCHERS brand. Can you give us any updates on that?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, in China this year, as well as in 2013, we have a number of different efforts going on in our sugar confectionery business, so ICE BREAKERS is certainly one. We would see the Duos launch also being one that would be relevant in China as well. So that category is actually doing quite well for us. And as you know, in China, sugar confectionery is a significantly larger percentage of the business than chocolate is today. So we really are focused on having a balanced portfolio, sorry, of brands, and then also recall that we have our R&D center that we hope to have open later this year, which should also help us develop products that are very China- and Asia-specific.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So cocoa has stayed quite cheap for a while now. I know you're loathe to comment on this and I understand why, but let me maybe ask the question this way. If cocoa stays inexpensive versus recent historical levels, and if you don't see big increases to your other inputs, why should investors maybe not start to think that your input costs late this year and into next year have a chance to be much less of a headwind or even a small tailwind? Is there maybe something we're missing when we're thinking optimistically about this part of COGS?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, Ken, I mean, I don't think you're missing anything. I mean, I think the way you've characterized it is reasonable. Cocoa is down and a couple of the other commodities, while still at pretty elevated levels, are down. Versus last year, we continue to signal that there is some meaningful inflation year-on-year. But having said that, downward trends in commodities certainly will show up, but we don't ordinarily talk about the timing because that's proprietary on our side. But I think the longer it continues, the general optimism is well placed.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then I'm hoping to get a better understanding of how your sales performed, maybe in the center of the store where we've seen -- we've seen volumes be such an area of concern for so many of your food manufacturing peers, but it sounds maybe from your comments like you did better in the center of the store than the industry has as a whole. So I guess first, am I reading that right? And second, if so, how did you buck that trend, in your view?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think you're probably reading it right. And I think we believe that the category continues to be accessible. One of the things we say over and over again is that this is one of the most -- it is the largest, most profitable confectionery market in the world and happens to have one of the lowest costs per pound. It has the ability to be an accessible indulgence regardless of what seems to be happening around use. I would call that resilient, certainly not anything recession-proof. I wouldn't go that far. But I think this is a unique category. It has a lot of great qualities. It has the seasonal events that really bring consumers into the store and get them into the aisle, as well as all the other points of distribution that it has. So again, we have programming that's well over 30 weeks out of the year on our brands, so they're just broadly available and accessible to consumers and then they can enjoy them without having to sacrifice a lot. And I always looked at the C-store channel in addition to the balance of retail as a testament to the strength of the category.","Operator","The next question is from Rob Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My questions have pretty much been asked already, but you mentioned that international contributed 2 points of growth. Can you give us a little more detail on the extent to which that would -- what did the growth look like x Canada? Were you still hitting kind of that 25% kind of growth? Or was it better than that?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, the numbers we gave you would've been x Canada, and of course, there is a large mix across all the countries. So some of the countries are obviously doing significantly better than that and a couple modestly below. But that's really the texture of that business. We continue to feel very good about our ability to execute against a very basic, solid model in each of these marketplaces. And if you recall from our last call, we talked about that these markets have gross margin very similar to our U.S. business. And therefore, as we continue to go forward, it gives us choices around how we invest in those markets and how we can adjust that investment to ensure that we continue to be -- we continue to be productive. But right now, we feel very good about being able to deliver the overall business results we are and still be able to invest differentially in what are some of the most attractive markets around the world.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And can I ask a follow-up? On the question earlier about SM&A being up higher in second, third and fourth than it will be in first, a lot has been talked about how your category management skills have improved. You've invested in a lot of new tools. What can you tell us about the types of these investments? Are they just kind of like similar to what you've been doing all along with better technology and better use of data? Or is there something new, maybe some new programs that you're introducing to the trade?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. I would say that there's a bit of a combination and it's evolutionary, right? I mean in the U.S., where we've done the most of that work, certainly we're further along as you might imply in terms of intellectual capital and the sophistication of the trade and how we collaborate with key retailers. We do bring that knowledge into other markets. Some of those markets are not quite as sophisticated at the retail level, but the objective is very similar. It does involve data, obviously. And then it involves the types of insights that you would expect in terms of consumer and shopper. And so really, it's a matter of the level of sophistication, but it is focused on intellectual capital and our people, and the collaborative nature of how we bring knowledge to retailers to maximize the value of the category, certainly our brands, but the value of the category in general.","John P. Bilbrey","Rob. Hey, Rob, one real specific example is if you recall from CAGNY last year, we talked a lot about the demand landscape. We're investing in that work in places like China and some of the other geographies, which is really the foundation of the consumer insight and demand landscape work, because that's what our overall business model hinges on in terms of the way we go to market. So we're really expanding some of those programs.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But, John, you also talked about rolling IDP, which was a huge success in drug, rolling that out to grocery. I haven't heard much of an update on that. Can you give us one?","John P. Bilbrey","Sure. Today, we are probably working with about 6 to 8 of the largest customers on an IDP-type framework, which really starts with a long-term strategic -- joint strategic planning. And then you really go down through a menu of solutions based on what those strategies are -- were for both the retailer and ourselves. And what I would tell you we're finding is, is that the success we're having in those customers which have the tools and we work jointly with performed differentially versus those where we have not rolled out IDP. So the goal for us is, one, we have to be prepared ourselves, and that's one of the things Bert talked about in terms of investing in intellectual capital and getting people that can interact in these kinds of programs. And then the same thing happens on the retailer side. So as we can do more of that, we will do more of that. But we are very encouraged by what we're experiencing, and we believe it's fundamental to a number of our successes.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First off, I'm just trying to get a better idea to the extent you can help us around maybe the magnitude of the sort of the timing shift in the SM&A. And I only ask this because if we think about some of your guidance on a full year basis for sales and gross margin improvement and some other things, it's pretty easy to get to a full year earnings number that's pretty far beyond what your sort of current guidance is. And I realize it's only 1Q and all of that, but the plug there is obviously what that SG&A line looks like for the full year. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how that might look on a full year basis, just so we have a better sense of that?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, Andrew, I certainly think it's more than just the one line in terms of how you're characterizing it with -- and I understand your thought process in terms of where SM&A is in Q1 versus outlook. There's a definite increase, obviously, and some timing involved in the SM&A, but it's not about programs that we weren't already planning for. So from that perspective, I would say that we haven't added a lot of investment. If we had, we typically would talk about that. While we're -- while we have food advertising, it's still at the low double-digit rates and we expect SM&A not only to kick in more with the new products coming in place, but also just the timing of some of the work that we just talked about, whether it's demand landscape in other markets or those types of things. The other thing to point to, while we haven't talked a lot about it, but I think it's obvious in the comments, is the level of price realization, which was quite high in Q1 as expected, because other than a little bit of Valentine, the entire portfolio would benefit from that. And then you start to lap the price realization. You start to recover some of the volume. And so you don't have as much gross margin expansion in the remainder of the year. By definition we said 180 versus 90 to 100. So I wouldn't focus overly on the SM&A line, and think of it more some of the other moving parts in the P&L. I would say that's probably the better way to look at it. And what I can tell you is we think they are the right investments to make and the right markets, and that's how we framed up the overall annual outlook.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then it's a smaller channel, obviously, but in the drug channel, I think, J.P. mentioned that there was a sort of a change in the, I think, category dynamic as you put it. And I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what you meant by that.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think for us, as we've worked with the drug channel, there's a couple of things that are going on. The drug channel was historically very overdeveloped in terms of the percent of seasons that it sold and some of that volume, we felt, was probably less productive for everybody, the retailer as well as us, in terms of the way we were going about it. And so we've been able to, I think, rebalance some of those efforts to where we're getting much better balance on front-end sales. We're doing better on the in-aisle part, and then I think as we do seasons, we're doing seasons smarter and more profitably. So as we look at what's happening for both the retailer and for us in the way that we go about managing, specifically the seasonal sales, it's a higher quality sale for everybody, I think, than maybe it had been historically. And so that's a bit of the context change there. And we're very optimistic about the drug channel just in total. So getting our business as productive as possible there has been really important to us. And it's taken several years, frankly, to get to the point where we're at, and that's really what I was referencing.","Operator","Your next question is from David Driscoll of Citi Investment Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions, pretty quick ones, though. First one is on Easter. Is there anything related to the timing of Easter that would affect the shipment pattern between Q1 and Q2? Was Q1 in any way benefited by better shipments because of the earlier Easter? And I would assume that's all volume-related if it was true. But you didn't call it out so I'm thinking no, but could you just clarify?","John P. Bilbrey","David, it would be relatively modest actually in terms of the changes. I think one of the things to think about is if you look at the IRI data, I think that's through March 17. Our comments have been around March 24. We feel very good about the actual sell-in of Easter as a double-digit volume increase. But we really won't know the answer until we get the May 3 data on what was really the overall outcome of Easter, but we would anticipate growing share at Easter. And our -- as we tumble the numbers, and this is a very imperfect science at this point, we hope to gain about 0.5 share point over the course of the Easter holiday.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. But in terms of from the manufacturer's point of view, from your point of view, the shipments would've occurred in the first quarter in the year-ago period, and they would've occurred in the first quarter this year no matter what the timing -- the exact timing of Easter was in the second quarter. Is that right?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. I think -- yes, I think that's correct. We just -- I mean there could be an absolute modest amount that would've been different, but not really meaningful, Dave.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. On the SM&A question, excluding the marketing expense. So I think the SM&A budget this year -- or sorry, in the first quarter was up like 3% when you exclude marketing, and your guidance is -- if I read everything right, the guidance is just that simply it will be north of 3% of an increase in the subsequent quarters. But maybe this is too cryptic for me. Can you just tell me what you think SM&A is going to be up year-over-year for the full year? Is there any reason why you wouldn't know that right now?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. You're right about the 3% and we would expect it to be more in line with sales growth.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So SM&A x marketing, up something in the magnitude of sales growth. Because it's only up 3% in the first quarter yet first quarter sales are up 11%, that's the timing issue that you were talking about. Is that right?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, that's correct. And so again, I want to reiterate, we're not -- in the past, when we've changed some numbers, we've talked about hey, and we're increasing our investment versus what we've planned. That's not the case. We're making the investments as we've planned them. The timing is just a little bit different. And that accounts -- and that applies to both SM&A as well as advertising.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then does this SM&A issue, does this drop all the way down to the bottom line? So if $0.81 was consensus and you come in at $0.95, $0.96 depending on how you want to treat the pension cost issue, that's $0.14, $0.15 of an earnings peak. Guidance is only up $0.03. So is your explanation that the timing of SM&A is the explanatory factor why full year numbers don't rise by the significant beat versus consensus?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, that's part of it. And again, I mentioned it to -- in response to Andrew's question, the pricing is quite different, right, during the year in terms of if you look at our gross margin of 180 basis point expansion in Q1 and our guidance of 90 to 100, there's a lot -- the pricing, as you would expect, because it's across the portfolio and you're only starting to lap it in the second quarter is also a contributor.","Operator","Your next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just one question and one point of clarification. First, just on the gross margins as we look out the balance of the year, so as pricing will be less incremental as we go through the remaining quarters, is your cost inflation essentially -- the year-on-year inflation essentially the same in each quarter? Or is there any variability in terms of what you'd expect for inflation from quarter-to-quarter?","John P. Bilbrey","Bryan, it's fairly consistent. Obviously, when we set up our standard costs at the beginning of the year, that's a standard that's consistent across the quarters. If there were some variability to that, it would come up as purchase price variance, and the fact we haven't talked a lot about that tells you we're pretty close to standard. The only thing I would say is the first quarter, certainly it's our most impacted volume quarter as well. And we gave the number of about $30 million of inflation, so there would be some volume pickup as you get through to third -- second, third and fourth quarter, so you're going to have a little bit more volume, so you may have a little bit more of the cost impact because of that volume, but I would say that from a standard perspective, it's relatively the same.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then during the course of the first quarter, there had been some discussion, I guess, in the channel about maybe the potential of some competitors either rolling back pricing or not following through completely on all their pricing plans. And so now you've got sort of the first big holiday under your belt. Just if you could give any sort of comment on that line of logic and whether or not you've seen anything that would suggest that the industry or some of your competitors may not be following through on all the pricing.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, first of all, we're not going to comment a lot on what we believe other people's pricing strategies are, but we continue to execute, we believe, successfully against the things that we've chosen to do. We don't see a number of things in the marketplace that would lead us to believe that there's anything different than historically occurs, and there's always instances where you could go into an individual store or maybe a regional customer maybe decides to do something unique. But for the most part, we feel comfortable that the course that we've charted is working well for us, and we continue to believe that's how we'll execute through the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had a quick question for you. I think it's a bit of a follow-up on the price realization. As we think about the sequential pricing through the year, Q3 pricing, would that be greater than Q2 pricing because of the degree of seasonal sales in the quarter? Am I looking at it the right way?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, we'll have some pricing in Q2, and then we'll have some in Q3 as you rightly point out, related to Halloween particularly, which is when that ships. So nowhere near in Q1, because in Q1 it applied to everything except for a little bit of Valentine. So we will have some price realization in 2, a little bit more in 3 and then it really winds down a lot in fourth.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, just wanted to be clear on that. And then I also -- there was a comment before about a roughly 1.5% benefit to sales from new products. Is that like a year-over-year calculation for the first quarter?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, when we talk about our growth algorithm on a going basis, we want to have 1 point of net growth coming from innovation. And what we have been experiencing is innovation success greater than that over the last, frankly, several years. But I think we were at about 3.5 last year. I think we're a little bit lower than that this year. But certainly, ahead of the 1-point algorithm that we have for ourself.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And that's -- is that like products from the last year essentially, the last 12 months? Or...","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, the way that we calculate that is in the second year, those are not included in terms of innovation, so you really look at it net of cannibalization. And when you calculate that, then the numbers that we talk about are really what's happening net of cannibalization in the year -- the second year.","Humberto P. Alfonso","But the way to think of it is that the 10.7 net sales growth that we talked about, it's 1.5 points of that.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, sure. Okay. I guess to -- just to follow up, I know there's been a lot of questions on the international investments. My question to you would be, would your profits grow at a materially slower rate for international versus the sales growth this year? Is that your expectation? I'm just trying to frame the level of investment and maybe that's one way to kind of get a little closer to it.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, I mean, we don't do segment reporting, but we try to give some color on international. We've been trying to give more. So what I would say is in the key markets where we're growing rapidly the top line, as well as investing for future growth, that will be true. I mean, we're largely in a reinvest mode. So while we're -- as J.P. already mentioned, we're very conscious of our gross margin in those markets. It's really less about profit contribution.","John P. Bilbrey","If I could just build on that comment for a second, is that when you think about our business model, there's 5 or 6 markets around the world that have GDP growth of greater than 5%, some significantly greater than that. And those are really the markets that we're focused on. So in terms of quality and attractive growth for us in these markets with attractive gross margins, which again gives us choices on how and when we choose to invest, it's really a very attractive model versus having legacy businesses. I mean, if we all looked this morning at some of the news items coming out of Europe, certainly, there are some drags on businesses there. And hopefully, we'll be able to continue to grow at an attractive business level in markets that have the best growth potential of any of the markets we have and continue to execute in a smart way, building brands with -- behind really strong consumer insight. So I think it's why we continue to feel very, very good about our approach. And so hopefully, we'll be able to continue to see that we'll achieve the international growth targets that we've set and maintain a very healthy business at home.","Operator","Your next question is from Matthew Drizer [ph] of Morgan Stanley.","Unknown Analyst","So just 2 quick questions. First, I wanted to ask specifically about the special pleasures health and wellness product. Can you give us a sense of how this might be positioned from a pricing standpoint, how material you expect it to be? Is this something that you're looking at more as a niche product? Or should we be looking for relatively broad distribution and a significant push behind the product?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, we would expect to gain broad distribution behind the product. It's more of a trade-up type product in terms of its pricing, and we don't position it necessarily as health and wellness as much as it is an indulgent chocolate that has fewer calories than if you were to look at a solid milk chocolate bar. So the truffle center -- it's more like a truffle technology, the center. The cream there is very low calorie and so it gives you a unique experience in terms of eat, that it's a very melty, creamy-type taste, and then it has this center fill. So the way to think about the 30% lower calories is that versus other chocolate products in the category, the average chocolate products in the category, it has fewer calories yet a very indulgent experience.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So from a distribution standpoint, it's a product that you think will have traction immediately, but may gain more distribution over sort of the course of a 12- to 18-month period.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, we would see that the product gets broader distribution over time, but we would expect it to get all the time and attention that all of our launches get.","Mark K. Pogharian","Yes, and we probably wouldn't see that across all channels. I mean, it would primarily maybe be focused in food and drug out of the gate as we educate the consumer about it, because there is that process to it.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And secondly, I was just hoping you could provide a quick update on the key export markets and how these are performing relative to the core international markets. How much of a benefit are you getting, if any, from undemanding prior year comparisons in Japan and sort of selected markets in the Middle East?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, I would say that our -- we've already commented in the past that's a very profitable part of our international component. And it's growing nicely as we anticipated. To be specific, certainly Japan has rebounded. Last year, they had the catastrophe, so that we're certainly seeing above average growth in Japan because of the -- last year's tsunami, and a little bit of the opposite in the Middle East because of some of the turmoil. But overall, very good. Continue to penetrate new markets in Latin America and other parts of the world, but it's a good business for us. But specifically, the 2 markets that you mentioned, one certainly with a rebound because of prior year and the other about the same. Again, it's a very profitable model for us in terms of our export business.","Operator","Your next question is from Alexia Howard of Sanford C. Bernstein.","Gretchen Guo","This is Gretchen Guo calling for Alexia, and I just wanted to quickly ask about India. You had mentioned some of your other focused markets, mainly China and Brazil, which have grown about 20%, but we didn't hear too much about India. Can you just talk a little bit about that market, and perhaps an update on the Godrej JV?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, we grew again in our India business this quarter, so we certainly felt good about that. We continue to be optimistic about the potential of the India market. And I'll add, over time, we have India classified as a market that we want to participate in. We certainly don't want to get out over our skis there, and we're not commenting on the JV. Certainly, we've all seen different things in the press, but there's really nothing new to say there from the things that we've said before. So at the current point in time, we feel good about the progress we're making there and we're learning a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions for you. You mentioned comments on gas [ph] that consumer behavior these days is -- due to high gas prices, is different from what's happened in the past. What's your explanation why consumers are much less affected by gas prices these days?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, I would say there are a couple of factors. On the one hand, I think the last time that we looked at that impact would have been back in '08 where we saw a very rapid spike in prices. And while prices are not any more attractive than they were back then, it's been less of what we would think of as a spike and we think that the consumers adjust to that in a different way than they do to the spike. Having said that, consumers are sometimes not filling up the tank, and we see some -- we saw some of that conversation on the CNBC show that J.P. mentioned, where they may take more frequent trips, and that tends to help our category as they come into the store. So we do think it's the shock factor. We also think that while unemployment is not at a good level, there has been some improvement in the U.S. economy in the first quarter. You've seen the consumer numbers in the first quarter all around. We're somewhat better despite the higher gas prices, so we just think the consumers has adjusted to them better than they have in the past.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the second one, a small modeling question. You bought back significant amount of shares and exhausted a good amount of your authorization. Are you still expecting to do share repurchases for the rest of the year? Or are you done?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, we don't comment on the specific timing of those repurchases. Certainly, we have 125 million that's still authorized, so we'll execute against that in consultation with our board.","Operator","Your next question is from John Baumgartner of Telsey Advisory Group.","John Baumgartner ","J.P., can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from the food channel and what's driving that share loss there? Do I understand it correctly that it's primarily the timing of innovation between yourselves and competitors? Or is there something else going on there?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. I don't have any concerns around the fundamentals of our business in the food channel. I think, essentially, what we're seeing is that we're lapping some very strong innovation in the first part of the previous year base. There was a lot of competitive activity in terms of introduction of new items in the first quarter, and we've made a conscious decision that in Q2 and Q3 is where we'll be focused more around the new items that we have. And then you have the other aspect of it is that the whole price conversion and all adds so much noise to the system that I kind of on this tend to look at the total and make sure that the fundamentals are good. So if you were to look at the first quarter from a quality, merchandising and featuring standpoint, our competitors would have certainly won that share of voice. And we would hope that we'd continue to be able to do the same in Q2 and Q3 as we introduce the things we have. So while it's never fun to lose share, I don't see it as something that would fall outside of just the fundamentals of our business, and I think we'll continue to do well as we go through the year. And then the other comment I would just make broadly across our businesses and coming back to IDP is we feel very good about the financial performance of the company, and we believe that over time, we continue to deliver quality share and quality share growth, and sometimes you can look at numbers that they might feel good but they may not be the best quality result. And we're pretty confident that the results we're delivering are quality results.","John Baumgartner ","Okay. And then in terms of the Simple Pleasures, if you were to benchmark that in terms of more recent launches, I guess like the Drops or the Minis, I mean it seems like you're expecting a smaller impact out of the gate for Simple Pleasures. Is that fair?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, Minis is definitely a home run. So I wish I could have one of those every single time, and certainly, that's probably not always going to be the case. But with this one, anytime you have something new, so whether it be Air Delight, whether it be something like Simple Pleasures, you're really building a platform that the consumer has to learn what it is. So trial is important and getting people to then, of course, repeat is fundamental. So it's a little bit longer of a story on those type of brands when you launch those first than something that's a big driver around a core brand. And then this is in a standup patch, so there's no inter-consumable [ph] version either. So by default, you have a bit of a difference there as well. But we're committed to try to build these brands as best we can. And again, I would just remind you, versus our long-term algorithm, as we continue to see how we're doing in innovation, we're doing better on a sustainable basis within our innovation than we have in some time.","Operator","The next question is from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess, let's go back to Dave Driscoll's question and maybe Andrew Lazar, because I'm not exactly sure, Bert, that I get the guidance. So if you're up 10% to 11%, 12%, that's like 20 -- that's like $0.30 a share. You did most of that this quarter. You're saying that your SM&A spending really hasn't changed, gross margins are a bit better, but that all works out to be just a couple of pennies for the rest of the year per quarter. So is that really what you're saying, that it's just a couple of pennies of growth in earnings per share each quarter?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, Eric, I appreciate the question. And again, I'm not going to say anything different than I said before. We've planned a certain amount of investment in the business this year. There is some timing related to first quarter versus rest of year and we continue with those plans, which we think is the right thing to do for the business, both short-term and long-term. You are seeing some uptick in terms of the guidance on the bottom line. It is partially the price realization that's coming through, which we think is a bit better, and a little bit more volume on the top line. So that's the way the math works. I'm not sure how else to try to answer that.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, I mean, it's just -- I don't want to beat a dead horse, but it just -- it's either -- it seems to me either your investment spending in some of these initiatives is higher than you originally expected or you're just being incredibly conservative. Because otherwise, I'm just not sure how exactly the math works if you already were, call it $0.15 to $0.20 of that $0.30 has already been put into the bank.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, for the most part I would say that the investment profile in terms of total SM&A as we planned it through the year with, obviously, with the timing thing we've already talked about, is largely in line with how we started the year's thinking.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just more of a broader industry question for J.P. Kraft is obviously going to Acosta for their grocery company. I was just with General Mills and McCormick had an Analyst Day and they talked about how, kind of similar to you if anything, they're investing more in their own kind of sales force and in-store capability. And so I guess maybe for somebody -- or for a company that, I guess, has been really pushing this initiative from when Rick took over to Dave to now you, what do you see as like the potential advantage of using a third-party distributor as opposed to the in-house capability, because it seems like the industry is -- like some players are going one way and the other players are going the complete opposite?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. I can't really speak for how other folks have really thought about it, but I can tell you that from a philosophical standpoint, I am a strong supporter of having our own organization and our future being in our hands. So we believe -- as you've heard us say many, many times, our sales organization, we believe, has a strategic advantage. We can move on a dime. Our people are passionate about the results we get. Every one of them can tell you that winning is visible when you walk out of a store. You don't have to have somebody give you 100 metrics to understand if you've won or not; you can recognize it easily. And so we just feel very, very strongly about the commitment we have to our own people and the passion they have for our brand. You could do all kinds of analysis around what is the financial comparison, et cetera. And all I know is that when we stand up in front of our troops at those national sales meetings once a year, I couldn't be more proud to be associated with those people than I am every time I'm with them. And so, I guess, on my watch, never say never, but as far as I'm concerned, we'll fight the battle with our own guys.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And, Bert, if I could have just one quick follow-up. I think you said that elasticity on the everyday business was what you had expected in terms of volume. Was it down like mid-single digits or low-single digits? What do you mean by it was like in line with what you had expected?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, it would be low-single digits to characterize it. And yes, it was in line with how we think -- with how we were expecting it. But I would -- the only thing I would say is we look at it across package, across channels, so every one of them is imperfect, but by and large, yes, low-single digits and a little better than we expected, but not by a lot.","Operator","And your final question comes from John Feeney of Janney Capital.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. First, how do you think about dividends versus share repurchase? I apologize if that's been asked. I missed a few minutes of the call, but I know, certainly, with the performance in the stock, the yields a little lower and certainly there's some cash flow.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, in terms of how we think about cash deployment, clearly, we're always conscious of what we think we need to run the business in terms of day-to-day operational and strategic investments. We're very much committed to the dividend. We think that's a good way to give back to shareholders. We increased it 10% back in February. And as a result, you're right. I mean, the stock has performed well. So I'm not going to apologize for the low yield at this stage, but they're equally, [indiscernible]...","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Because you got there the good way.","John P. Bilbrey","Right. They're equally important to us, and again, we did execute against some of the buyback and we'll continue to talk to our board to see how we want to treat the rest of the authorization. But currently, the dividend is an important element for us.","John Baumgartner ","Okay. And just a follow-up for Bert. You mentioned that you don't break out segments. I don't know how the rules work or how you look at it as a judgment call, but at what point do you anticipate breaking out international as a segment...","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, the way the rules works -- the way the rules work clearly is based on size of business and a number of other factors. If you take a look at the accounting pronouncements, right now we're a little bit below what those rules would require for segment, but I suspect we'll be reporting segments certainly in the future as the international business grows. From a complexity standpoint, again, it's not that we couldn't. We certainly are accounting folks who are capable of doing that. We're not required to, so at this stage, we've just chosen to stay with our current requirements but I think it's pretty predictable that there's going to come a time when we will report segments.","Mark K.

Thank you.","It's now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Ms. Melissa Poole. You may begin your conference.","Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for The Hershey Company's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call and webcast. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the federal securities laws. These statements are based on our current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events and those described in these forward-looking statements contained in our 2017 10-K filed with the SEC and today's press release.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Michele.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get started this morning, I'd like to take a minute to recognize and thank Patricia. As I'm sure you're aware, Patricia has announced her intention to retire in the spring of 2019. She has been a valued leader as we have: created a more profitable and sustainable international business model; instilled a more disciplined cost management model across the enterprise; and upgraded the company's financial systems, an important piece of our ERP transformation. Patricia and I will continue to work closely together over the next several months as we search for and transition to a new CFO.","Overall, I am pleased with the progress we are making against our key strategic focus areas. Our third quarter results were in line with expectations, and we remain on track to achieve the financial targets we shared earlier this year. Our U.S. core confection retail takeaway and share trends are sequentially improving in line with our expectations, driven by strong Halloween results and distribution gains on core items. The addition of Pirate's brands strengthens our brand portfolio and marks our second high growth, high margin acquisition this year to capture incremental snacking occasions.","Our International business continues to deliver profitability improvements, while driving strong constant currency organic sales growth. Importantly, we are achieving these results while staying true to our values and purpose, as evidenced by being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the sixth consecutive year.","Constant currency net sales increased 3% in the third quarter, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of 2.5 points. Foreign currency exchange was a 0.7 point headwind. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $1.55 increased 20% compared to the third quarter last year.","In the U.S., we are focused on executing a strong finish to the Halloween season, both in store and online. From core innovation and occasions programming, to strong sell-in with more than 500 employees volunteering at retail, we are out-performing the category and on track to deliver our first-ever $600 million season.","The power of our core brands and breadth of our product lineup enable us to deliver great assortments for trick or treating and Halloween parties. Our focus on optimizing mixes, piece counts and price points has driven strong mid-single-digit growth this year, enabled by some of the core capacity investment and expansion we did earlier in the year. We also have exciting Glow in the Dark packaging on select Hershey's, Reese's and Kit Kat products to add some additional magic to the season. We're seeing great engagement and ideas from consumers on social media for these new products.","For those who were able to join us in late August for our digital update, the designed for online assortment bag we featured, made BuzzFeed's top 10 best things to buy on Amazon list earlier this month. If you haven't gotten your candy yet, there is still time.","As expected, this Halloween strength and other key initiatives are driving sequentially improved retail takeaway and market share performance on our core confection business. In measured channels, for the last 12 weeks ending October 14, Hershey's CMG takeaway increased 0.4% versus the prior-year period, resulting in flat market share. In the latest four weeks, Hershey's CMG takeaway grew 2.5%, resulting in a market share gain of 22 basis points, with improvements across classes of trade. This enhanced performance is driven primarily by our chocolate brands, which grew 3.2% in the latest four weeks, resulting in a market share gain of 24 basis points. In addition to Halloween, distribution gains on core SKUs and new campaigns are driving better results.","On September 13, Milton Hershey's birthday, we activated our new Hershey's Heartwarming campaign. The inspiration for this campaign came not only from Milton Hershey, who believed chocolate can bring people together, but also from others who are using Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars to create positive connection and bring individuals and communities closer together. Our mission started from the inside out. I, along with hundreds of our employees from across the country, took to the streets to bring a little warmth back to communities through the gift of chocolate that day. This launch is a great example of how we are leveraging new models to make our spending more impactful and efficient. In addition to our paid media, we secured over 2,000 media placements and almost 700 million earned or non-paid media impressions from this activation.","We are really excited about the early results we are seeing from this activation. In the past month, since we launched the campaign, retail takeaway on our Hershey's Milk, Hershey's Almond and Hershey's Special Dark Bars, which represent almost $750 million of retail sales, was up almost 7%. Our Reese's performance is also accelerating, as expected, behind Halloween strength, a refreshed campaign and the national rollout of Outrageous. In the latest four weeks, Reese's retail takeaway of plus 5% resulted in a CMG share gain of 30 basis points.","In addition, we are making progress against our distribution initiatives we shared in July. Since May, our team has secured over 10,000 incremental points of distribution on our core Ice Breakers Mint pucks in the convenience store channel alone. These items have leading velocities and strong margins for both Hershey and our retailers. This incremental distribution has resulted in improving top-line and share performance for our mints business.","This is just one example of how we're leveraging analytics to drive space optimization with our retailers. While our overall points of distribution are down due to the SKU rationalization program we announced earlier this year, we believe our focus on ensuring the highest velocity items are on-shelf will pay dividends for both us and our retailers going forward.","As the retail environment continues to change, our category management teams have also identified several opportunities to secure incremental space for the category at select retailers. The velocities and margins of confection items, particularly for iconic brands, are still some of the best in the store. So we are excited to capture these opportunities and keep the momentum going as we exit 2018 and head into 2019.","This year's innovation, Hershey's Gold and Reese's Outrageous, are continuing to performance well and are in line with our expectations. We will continue to support both launches in the fourth quarter with consumer promotions and merchandising, to not only drive trial, but also support our core portfolio, as well.","In December, we are launching the first-ever mash-up of our two most iconic brands. Hershey's with Reese's Pieces will be available in a bar format. We also have our first new holiday-flavored Kisses in almost a decade this holiday season. Kisses Hot Cocoa Chocolates combine marshmallow-flavored cream and classically delicious Hershey's milk chocolate, recreating the experience of drinking a cup of hot cocoa. Similar to innovation earlier this year, these new products will leverage our iconic brands to drive merchandising and consumer excitement in a very cost-effective way.","We are also on track to roll out new, improved packaging on our take-home bars next spring. This change affects more than $0.5 billion of sales and we believe will improve branding, shelf appeal and improved consumer experience. Let me just correct that. It's on our take-home bags, excuse me. This is a great example of non-product innovation that can drive core brand and category growth.","And finally, I couldn't be more excited about another upcoming innovation that will launch in March of 2019. Consumers love Reese's in all shapes and sizes. And now, they will have a new experience with a new benefit with our launch of Reese's Thins. This product is about 40% thinner than the original cup, and it appeals to those consumers who want something sweet with more permissibility. They will be available in individually-wrapped pieces in both milk and dark chocolate varieties in our newly-redesigned take-home bags. This product truly provides a differentiated benefit, and we've seen this thins concept play well in other categories. For 2019, we have a balanced approach, a combination of news, packaging innovation, as well as unique offerings that we believe will drive core brand growth.","Now, for an update on Amplify, SkinnyPop continues to show strong growth in the marketplace, driven by both distribution and velocity gains. In measured channels, retail takeaway grew 10.3% in the latest 12 weeks ending October 7. This was driven by core SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn, which grew over 8%, resulting in a category share gain of one full point. As we shared earlier this year, our goal has been to maintain the entrepreneurial spirit of the team in Austin, while leveraging Hershey's capabilities to capture new occasions and sales opportunities.","The biggest example of this is our category management and shopper insights expertise. The Austin team has spent a considerable amount of time learning from, and developing relationships with our Hershey team to ensure they are fully leveraging our vast data, tools, and insights. This has enabled them to elevate conversations with retailers and secure incremental distribution and better placement for SkinnyPop, as well as provide strategic counsel to retailers on optimizing overall aisle efficiency. These skills and relationships will be critical as we continue to expand our footprint more broadly within snacking.","Last week, we closed on our acquisition of Pirate's brands. Pirate's Booty, the principal brand in the portfolio, is a sizable fast-growing cheese puff brand with on-trend, better for you attributes and high margins. We expect the full Pirate's brands portfolio to be a great fit for Hershey's growing portfolio of snacking brands, which is targeted toward consumers who are looking for great-tasting snacks without compromise.","As with Amplify, we believe this acquisition is a terrific business model fit with our core capabilities. We are best at driving great brands with scale and high margins in expandable consumption categories. We have a deep understanding of consumer snacking behaviors, best-in-class category management expertise, a growing digital commerce capability, and strong retailer relationships across formats. We believe that all of these will be key assets to expand and grow our full snacking portfolio in the future.","Pirate's Booty can be found in grocery and club stores. And we believe there's an opportunity to leverage our category management and insights to work to unlock additional growth, particularly in the mass and convenience classes of trade. Year-to-date, the brand has consistently grown high single digits in measured channels, with growth over 7% in the latest four and 12 week periods. Importantly, the growth has been balanced across both distribution and velocity gains on core SKUs, a key indicator of healthy and sustainable expansion.","I hope many of you were able to join our webcast focused on digital commerce at the end of August. We believe the competitive advantages we have in traditional brick-and-mortar stores translate to the digital world for our entire portfolio: beloved brands; deep customer relationships and category management expertise; strength in media; and strong margins.","Our initiatives are paying off in 2018. We are increasing trips online. We are trading consumers up to higher price points. And we are driving larger basket sizes, while maintaining our margin profile. Our digital commerce net sales for the quarter were up over 60%. And our market share increased 180 basis points. We believe we have the right strategy, organizational focus, talent, and technology to accelerate growth as industry infrastructure continues to expand.","Our investments in U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion are on track. Over the last year, we have invested more than $150 million in U.S. supply chain advancements. The Kit Kat line in Hazleton, PA, announced earlier this spring, is expected to be completed by year-end, and will start benefiting us in Q1, 2019. Additionally, our expansion on Ice Breakers gum and our Midwest Distribution Center are also on track and expected to be complete in the next three to six months.","Now, for an update on our International and Other segment, we continue to make great progress on our transformation, with profitability improving meaningfully again in the quarter, while driving top-line growth. Combined constant currency net sales growth in Mexico, Brazil, and India was approximately 10%. In China, our constant currency organic sales were up double digits, driven by focus on our core Hershey's portfolio. Year-to-date, our operating profit is $65 million, already $20 million ahead of our previous full-year segment high in 2012. Importantly, each country is contributing to the profit and top-line improvements as we shift the mix to more profitable core and right-size our investments.","Last week, we launched our iconic Hershey Kisses brand in India. Over the past decade, we have introduced a range of Hershey's products that are loved by families across India, from Hershey's syrup, to cocoa, to milkshakes, to chocolate spreads. And Hershey's is a leading brand in each of these categories. We believe the launch of Hershey Kisses will further fuel our growth in this strategic market.","In summary, we delivered solid top and bottom-line performance. And we are seeing sequential improvement in retail takeaway trends, CMG market share, and gross margin, in line with expectations. We have a great holiday program ahead of us, and continued distribution gains to keep the momentum going through Q4 and into 2019 on our core U.S. confection business. And our International business and broader snacking portfolio continue to perform well and remain on track to deliver additional sales and profit growth for the company.","I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Michele, and thank you for the kind words. Good morning, everyone. Third quarter net sales of $2.08 billion increased 2.3% versus the same period last year. Constant currency net sales increased 3%, with foreign currency exchange a 70 basis point headwind. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 2.5 point benefit to net sales growth. As a reminder, M&A contribution to overall growth in Q3 was less than in the first half of the year due to our Tyrrells and Shanghai Golden Monkey divestitures.","The Q3 contribution from the North American Amplify business was comparable to Q2. Volume was a 1.7 point benefit in Q3, which was partially offset by negative net price realization of 1.2 points. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $1.55 was an increase of 20.2% versus the same period last year. Income from a more favorable tax rate, SM&A declines, acquisition and volume growth were partially offset by gross margin declines.","We are reaffirming our full year net sales and adjusted EPS outlook. We expect reported net sales to be at the low end of the 3.5% to 5.5% range, with approximately a 3.5 point net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures.","We continue to expect organic net sales growth to be slightly up versus prior year. Full year adjusted earnings per share-diluted are expected to be in the $5.33 to $5.43 range, an increase of 14% to 16%. We anticipate the top and bottom-line impact from our recent acquisition of Pirate Brands to be minimal in 2018.","By segment, North America net sales increased 2.9% versus the same period last year. The Amplify acquisition added 3.7 points and volume gains contributed 90 basis points. Net price realization and foreign currency exchange rates were a 150 and a 20 basis point headwind, respectively. The negative price realization was in line with expectations, driven by slightly higher levels of planned promotional support as well as true-up of trade accruals and other accounting impacts.","These trade rate increases are not resulting in deflationary retail prices on our confection brands. Per IRI, on average, our retail price per pound is relatively flat to prior year. Therefore, we remain confident in our ability to execute the price increase we announced in July.","As a reminder, this pricing action of approximately 2.5% had several components and will predominantly impact 2019. While some of the price increase will take place in January, the redesign of our packaged candy portfolio will flow through in early Q2, and seasons will begin realizing price in Q3 with Halloween. With the multiple levers we are employing with this action, we expect retail shelf prices to increase on approximately 20% of the portfolio. Given our targeted approach and continued investment in the category, we expect solid conversion, similar to previous actions.","North America advertising-related consumer marketing spend declined 18.5% in the quarter. I want to spend a couple of minutes providing some important details and context here. Media spend for our strategic scale brands was in line with prior year for the quarter. We are leveraging analytic tools to improve effectiveness of this spend to get more reach and impressions for the same amount of dollars. So far this year, we have achieved double-digit ROI increases in four of our top five brands. We are also focused on expanding our reach through earned media by having authentic and appropriate content in the right channels.","Our Heartwarming campaign is a great example of this. As we work through new models, we are also taking advantage of cost savings in agency and production fees, as we leverage the appropriate production for different channels. An example of this is the creation of our own in-house production studio that went live earlier this year. This is enabling us not only to take advantage of our great employee creativity, but also to be faster and more cost effective. We have also continued to right-size our investments in our smaller, emerging brands in line with our previously-stated strategy. We remain committed to supporting our portfolio and will continue to invest at levels significantly above industry average.","Now, for an update on Amplify, as Michele mentioned, sales growth remained strong, with core SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn continuing to grow high-single digits. We are on track to deliver our acquisition model for both the top and bottom line in 2018 and anticipate approximately $0.08 EPS accretion this year.","Third quarter total International and Other segment net sales decreased 1.9%, including a 6.4 point impact from divestitures and a 4 point headwind from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Volume and net price realization were a 780 and a 70 basis point benefit, respectively. Mexico, Brazil, and India strength continued, with combined constant-currency net sales growth of approximately 10%, and the transformation of our China business is ahead of our expectations. International and Other advertising and related consumer marketing declined 1.7%, in line with our expectations as we right-size our investments to drive more profitable growth.","Now, turning to gross margin, adjusted gross profit of $916 million declined 0.6%, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 44%, a decline of 130 basis points versus the third quarter of last year. This is in line with our expectations for the quarter and was driven by higher year-over-year freight and logistics costs, as well as incremental investments in trade and packaging. As we had shared earlier this year, we expect continued sequential improvement in year-over-year change in Q4, given the pattern of last year's inflationary pressures.","Third quarter adjusted operating profit of $471 million increased 5.1% versus the third quarter of 2017. This resulted in an adjusted operating profit margin of 22.6%, an increase of 60 basis points, driven by lower selling, marketing, and administrative expenses.","As Michele mentioned, we are really excited about the addition of Pirate Brands to our portfolio. Net sales of the business are approximately $90 million, and EBITDA is between $25 million and $30 million. This acquisition was financed with short-term borrowings and cash on hand. We expect minimal impact to our leverage targets, given our strong cash flow and anticipation of slight accretion in year one for the acquisition. Additionally, there is no change to our credit ratings.","Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $37 million increased $12 million versus Q3 of last year, driven by the Amplify acquisition. Full-year 2018 interest expense is expected to be approximately $140 million, the high end of our previous range, including the impact from our recent acquisition of Pirate Brands. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 22.8% versus 30.3% in the year-ago period, driven by U.S. tax reform. We expect the full year 2018 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 19%.","Third quarter other income and expense was $8.5 million, a decline of $16.7 million versus the year-ago period. This year-over-year decline is driven by timing related to our investment tax credit strategy. Our full-year 2018 outlook remains the same at $65 million to $70 million. For the third quarter of 2018, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 211 million. The company did not repurchase common shares in the third quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options or against the October 2019 or July 2018 share repurchase authorization. The total combined outstanding authorization is $560 million.","Total capital additions including software were $105 million in the third quarter. For the full-year 2018, we expect CapEx to be in the $355 million to $375 million range, in line with previous estimates.","We continue to return cash to our shareholders with third quarter dividends of $147 million. This was our 355th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock.","Our Margin for Growth program is progressing nicely, and we remain on track to deliver the high end of $150 million to $175 million program savings range. We have executed a significant portion of the initiatives and now believe our restructuring costs will be slightly less than initial expectations. We now expect total estimated project costs of approximately $340 million to $355 million, versus our original estimate of $375 million to $425 million.","That concludes my financial discussion. Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn it back over to Michele for some closing remarks.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thanks, Patricia. As we have shared consistently this year, we are focused on delivering our 2018 commitments, and we are on track to do so. I am confident in our strategies, and I am extremely proud of our Hershey team as we build momentum in the back half of the year.","I am pleased with the momentum on our core U.S. confection business. Our growing snack brands are performing well. And we are excited about the opportunity that Pirate Brands brings to our portfolio. And our International business continues to provide meaningful top and bottom-line growth. We will continue to invest in our business as we look towards 2019.","Our pricing strategy will begin to have an impact in 2019, along with strong seasonal growth, including a long Easter, core capacity expansion, solid innovation plans, new campaigns and growing digital capabilities. We will continue to do this while operating in a way that is consistent with our values and purpose. And our focus remains on long-term value creation.","Patricia, Melissa, and I are now available to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Andrew Lazar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. I think the start of this year, you had guided consumer spend or advertising and consumer to be down slightly, with more of the focus on spending on analytics and some of the enterprise resource planning that you're doing. I guess year-to-date, it's down a bit more than that, around 10% or so. And I know your long-term targets would have A&C growing more in line with sales. So I guess I'm just trying to get a sense if that's still the expectation longer term. And if so, would we expect some type of step-up next year to get more on that long-term track?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thanks, Andrew. We continue, as you know, to have a very heavy investment in our brands, much higher than the industry average. And if we look at the investment we've had on our core brands on both in Q3, where it was flat, so we had very stable investment. And on a year-to-date basis, our investment in our core brands was actually up. So what we really try and do as we go through the year is leverage the learnings that we're getting and making sure that we are constantly putting our spend in the most effective places.","As we looked at this year and got into it, we believed that we were overspending on some of the smaller brands, and we wanted to reduce that spend to ensure every dollar counts to drive business. And also, we did have an accounting change that resulted in moving some dollars out of the consumer marketing line into trade. So as you look at the go-forward, you're going to see some of that continued right-sizing between now and the end of the year, but as you think about 2019, I would tell you, we are very strongly committed to investing where there are returns. The accounting changes will have lapped the right-sizing of the smaller brands. And you shouldn't expect to see declines like we've had in 2018. We think that we'll be more set in terms of our normal track of spend and moving forward.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane. Your line is open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Morning.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Morning.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess I just wanted to understand a little bit more, just in the fourth quarter, it still implies a pretty wide EPS guidance range for the fourth quarter. And I guess given the visibility that you have into a lot of the seasonal stuff you're doing, just trying to understand what the variables are that might sort of drive you to the high end or the low end of that range, just why such a wide range in the fourth quarter.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Patricia, you want to take a crack at that?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, we really haven't had any major changes at all in our outlook for the full year EPS. And we just left the range where it was, just to, frankly, make sure that we were working right into that number. (33:30)","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So it doesn't imply that there's any potential for like you were anticipating any volatility in costs or shipment timing or anything like that?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","No.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","That's correct.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ken Goldman. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. One quick one and then a follow-up, if I can, for 2018, management had previously guided for the gross margin being down 120 basis points year-on-year and the EBIT margin being flattish year-on-year. I may have missed it, but I don't think you specifically reiterated those numbers. Can you help me out with those? And then, I have a quick follow-up, if you will allow me.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Patricia, you want to talk about gross margin?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, so Q3 came in right in line with our expectation. And, as we've stated before, really the change versus each quarter is heavily impacted more by the phasing that we saw last year in 2017. So we continue to expect Q4 gross margins to be in line with or slightly up from prior year because last year, the fourth quarter is really when we saw the big impacts of inflationary pressures. So we're also very focused on our continuous improvement program, our Margin for Growth initiatives. In Q4, all of those are on track. I think we'll come in the full year slightly below the 125 basis points, but we continue to be very pleased with the progress that we're making there. In terms of operating margin, it remains where we expected it to be.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then my quick follow-up is you had also, of course, not given guidance on 2019, but you had said previously, you expect: sales for 2019 at the low end of the 2% to 4% range; the gross margin up year-on-year; corporate expenses, I think, down as much as $100 million. Again, these aren't officially guidance items, but just for our modeling purposes, as we sit here today, are they still reasonable projections, roughly?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","We really aren't going to talk about guidance until the late January call. So I don't know that we want to give any other additional perspective on that right now.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Right. We're still working through our plans, as we speak. And we'll be back to you in the fourth quarter call with more specificity.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Driscoll. Your line is open.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Good morning, everybody.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Morning.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Patricia, I'm not sure if we're going to get to hear you on the January conference call, but if we don't, I really do appreciate all your help over the years. My question is just on this emerging momentum within the chocolate franchise. I believe you called out the four week data at up 3.2%, and market share up about 24 basis points. Can you just spend a little time here and talk about the competitive dynamic? Where do you see the momentum really building? What I'm trying to get at here, is it really the seasonal piece of it, so that'll carry through the fourth quarter, but then when we get to the first quarter, it's got to kind of flip to the core franchise?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, so thanks for the question, David. So we certainly are seeing a big impact from seasons. As you know, Halloween and holiday are some of our largest seasons. We had a very strong sell-in to retail. So the retailers bought. Then, obviously, the key is we need to see consumers buy. And we're really thrilled that we're seeing that sell-through, where consumers are buying and the season is up. And oh, by the way, that bodes well for the (37:21). If we sell-through well, the buy is then very strong. As we look to the end of the quarter, we anticipate a good holiday because, again, we have a good sell-in for holiday and so we're expecting to see that as well.","The other place that we are really seeing some momentum and anticipate a bit more momentum is, though most of our velocity or momentum right now is on seasons, we have distribution gains that we've shared with you in the past that we are working towards that we are starting to secure. And we do believe that we'll see more of the benefits of those distribution gains as the year progresses and into early next year. And we've also seen some velocity increases, particularly on the variety brands, where we've invested incrementally, as well as on Hershey and Reese. So we believe that we're seeing kind of the green shoots of that, that we anticipate will continue. So as we look at the fourth quarter, we believe that we'll see continued takeaway strength, you know, we believe at 1% or perhaps greater.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then, just a quick follow-up, Patricia, if you could just address North American pricing. In your script, I believe you said pricing was negative 1.5%, but that retail level pricing wasn't really changing. So if you're giving lower prices to your customers, what did you get for it? So it's not lowering the price at retail, which I would expect to have like a positive volume benefit, but if you don't get lower retail prices, what are you getting for that price investment?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, so we had a number of impacts in the third quarter, and some of them are the accounting that Michele already mentioned. So some of our costs moved from our marketing expense off into trade. (39:16) We also had a little bit more prior-year adjustments than we've had -- or we've had more of an impact of that. So that's a piece of it. That's actually not quite half of the change.","In terms of the rest of it, different promotional programs deliver different benefits. And we are always trying to mix those out so that the consumer, as well as the retailer, gets the advantage of it. And we see different impacts, in fact, across different segments and classes of trade of our business. We just didn't want to give the impression that we're seeing a deflationary impact on the prices. So we think that our overall trade is working hard for us. We always want to make it work harder. And we continue to feel really confident that the pricing that we talked about earlier will bear the fruit that we're expecting.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, I'd just also clarify and remind everyone that the pricing action we took really will impact us in 2019. If we look at some of the straight pricing in terms, we anticipate we'll see the benefit in Q1. We'll start to see some of the wait-out that we took on our consumer packaged candy line in Q2. And then, as you know, we plan seasons out very far, so some of the benefits around seasons from pricing will come as late as Q3, just so that you all remember that.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Morning.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","What role would you say the distribution gains are playing right now with the acquired brands with SkinnyPop? And looking forward into 2019, can you give us some viewpoint as to not only in the Amplify brands, but the Pirate brands that are coming up, are there opportunities to grow through distribution? And again, how much of the growth right now is distribution-driven versus, you know, same-store sales, if you will, or velocity? Thanks very much.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, on this piece of the portfolio, Jonathan, both distribution and velocity are opportunities. So we're certainly seeing some distribution gain benefits, because one of the greatest synergy values that we can bring as a company is the category management piece, where in many places, SkinnyPop velocities were the strongest on-shelf within the category, but the distribution or the facings did not match with that velocity strength. So we're about right-sizing that. We are also about expanding distribution into the classes of trade where we have the strongest presence where SkinnyPop was underdeveloped. It was underdeveloped at Walmart, convenience stores, et cetera. We're realizing some of that now, but there's more to come. But velocity is also very important. And we're pleased that we're continuing to see strength in velocity on these brands as well. So you're going to see a mix of both on the entire portfolio of acquisition brands.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good morning. Just a question on organic sales, it feels like the fourth quarter might be one where you could have shipments be even stronger than consumption. You mentioned holiday demand or seasonal demand is strong and we've heard that, too. And you talked about some new products that are coming, some of which that may be shipped ahead of the first quarter. So I know your organic sales guidance implies something similar for the fourth quarter as to what you have done year-to-date, but should we be thinking that the fourth quarter would be higher? Thanks.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, David, I would say the answer to that is no. As you know, we have noise between takeaway and net sales, given the dynamics of our category, particularly given the fact that about a third of our business is seasonal. And we also have a promotionally-driven business as well. So those things combined with the impact of SKU rationalization, and then as some of you have called out, some inventory contraction. We have some consolidation in the industry that's leading to that. We also do have some retailers who are looking to increase inventory to ensure that they can minimize out of stocks. But as we planned this year, we anticipated that net sales would be below our retail takeaway in the fourth quarter because of some of these factors I talked about, and we're continuing to believe that that will be the case.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So I know you're not giving an outlook for next year, but could you give us some commentary around the progression of the gross margin? You're obviously lapping tough comps. They're getting easier next quarter. We should get more towards the flattish area on the gross margin next quarter. You've got pricing kicking in in a positive way. I'm not sure how much of a headwind some of the other factors like freight and packaging are likely to be next year, or where commodity costs are going. But will we be right in thinking that things are getting easier on the gross margin side from here on out?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, let me provide overall commentary. And I'll let Patricia go a little bit deeper. So, Alexia, I would say that I don't know if I would say things are getting easier. Because it feels like they never get easier. But we do believe that we will be making improvement on margins as we exit 2018, and as we go into 2019, part of that, obviously, driven by pricing and the impact that we will get as our pricing hits next year. But do you want to talk a little bit about cost inputs, Patricia?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, there's been a lot of discussion about freight and logistics, so let me start there. We started to feel the impact of that about a year ago. And that has certainly continued, and I don't expect that to change going forward into next year, because the structural reasons that freight costs are higher are not going to go away, in terms of some of the cost pressures that those give us. Commodities are always something we look hard at. We make sure that our hedging program is focused on really giving us cost visibility into those parts of the portfolio. And we're not expecting a huge impact from that. So, overall, I think what we will see is continued improvement, as Michele said, driven by pricing and our continuous improvement program that we're always extremely focused on.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning, John.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Michele, I wanted to come back to the A&C spend. I understand the concentration of resources and also your spend level relative to peers. But when we think about confectionery versus other snacks, I mean, the share of stomach is still under pressure. So, whether it takes the form of ad spend or the other in-store expenses and I think trade pulling up in flat (46:49) for about the last four years or so as it is, why doesn't absolute spend still have to be higher? I mean, is the incremental ROI on core brands leveling off at this point? I'm just trying to square the comments versus the absolute growth.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure, so when we think about the right investment, while certainly spend can be a benchmark, the real thing we look at are the number impressions that we're delivering and how we're delivering impressions. And so, if we can get better, more targeted, better insights, better copy, a better media approach, or the addition of social media and earned impressions in the mix, that really influences our decisions about how to support each and every brand.","And the other piece simply is, as we look at the portfolio, a lot of this really does come down to some of the smaller brands, where we spent against some of those a bit more like they were a big brand model. And some of the more emerging brands are really driven more by an impact at retail, making the brands visible at retail, ensuring they have the right facings on shelf. And mass media spend is not the right approach for some of those smaller household brands, brands that have, call it, 5% household penetration, versus a brand like Reese that has 55%. So we are spending more on some of the brands like a Reese, and we do testing constantly to understand where there is upside, where we think that we can spend even more and get more. But it's really all based on looking at those impressions we can deliver.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Does that help?","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, absolutely, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate that. First, a quick housekeeping question, you started the year with a tax rate around 20% to 22%. It's now drifted to 19%. Is 19% a good number to assume for next year or is there risk that this drifts higher?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, again, we haven't planned out all of the 2019 pieces of the business that allow us to hone in on the tax rate, but I think that's a reasonable planning stance.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. And I want to go back to Michele's comment on some gross margin improvement as we go into 2019, with pricing playing an important role. Of the 250 basis points of price, we're getting to around 200 basis points coming from the wait-out initiative on the multi-serve bags. Is that reasonable?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","No.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","What do you have?","Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.","Jason, this is Melissa. We had said of the 2.5, about 50 basis points was the retailer terms and then of the remaining 2, it was about half and half between the straight price and the wait-out, so we've called about 100 basis points of the 250. (49:32-49:44)","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And on that wait-out, you mentioned that it's being accompanied with a packaging upgrade. And we were down there in August and, as we discussed, it's clearly a more expensive pack. Does the cost benefit of the wait-out outmatch the incremental cost of the packaging or do you actually get some surplus?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","I don't know that we really want to get into the details of margins by items that we have in the portfolio. I would say that we feel good that as we add value to the consumer, that we are netting out in line with a good value proposition that enables us to cover the incremental costs and still have very strong margins across the business. So I'd say you can think about it as it's net in line. We're not losing anything. We're not realizing a windfall, but it's net in line in terms of covering the costs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Totally. So that kind of net's neutral. We're left with about 150 basis points that can cover the rest of the inflation in the system.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yep.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","That's fair.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much. I just had a simple question on International. Obviously, there was a sizable step-up in volume performance in the quarter and then the operating margin, I believe, was around 13%. So, I asked last call, is the low double-digit kind of run rate over the next couple years still feasible on International and the answer was yes, but we're seeing it now, not two years out from now. So the first question is just is that 13% a rational expectation going forward into 2019 and Q4 and what have you and then also just the volume performance in International, what's driving that outside of just the divestment of Golden Monkey, and is that sustainable?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So let me talk about the volume performance and then I'm going to hand it over to Patricia to talk a bit about the margin. So, I feel really good about the sustainability of the volume performance. If you look at what we've done over the past couple years here in our portfolio, we have transitioned our portfolio to highly branded higher gross margin items. Our number one focus is on the Hershey's brand and our Hershey's portfolio, and the growth we are getting is from that brand, and from the other invested brands in the marketplace. So, the growth looks to be very sustainable and especially as we've divested parts of the portfolio that really were creating the biggest drag, both in terms of the top line but also profit. So, I'll turn it over to Patricia now to talk a bit about margin.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of International in the third quarter. They really delivered and, frankly, over-delivered versus where we thought they'd do at the beginning of the year. So we're pleased. The margin performance, though, is pretty seasonal. And fourth quarter is always the lowest margin business because we are spending against Chinese New Year that has not occurred yet. So that's just always a low margin quarter and you'll see that again this year.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our last question today from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Rob.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. So I did want to follow-up on the distribution gains and how it relates to inventory. And I do think you're doing the right thing by taking a conservative approach to forecasting inventory de-loading. But you said that your core business distribution has been expanding. When we looked at Nielsen data, I guess overall distribution is still declining this year. Do you have a number for your overall distribution, and is that up or down? And then, I have a follow-up on taxes as a going away present for Patricia.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","I'm not going to go away yet. You can hold it.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, Rob, I guess as you think about distribution, our biggest focus on driving distribution is on driving productive distribution and really taking a look at what's on the shelf, and ensuring that the highest velocity items are gaining distribution. So while overall points of distribution, given they're not all equal, may not be up, what we're feeling good about is that we are making some really good calls to get more productive items on the shelf.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And does the SKU rationalization cause any further distribution declines, just for the overall footprint?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, if you look at total points, I would say yes, because the key things we would be getting rid of are the less productive items. And so some of that can come through, though some of the SKU rationalization is around merchandising units as well, which it doesn't translate to a strict SKU.","Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, and, Rob, this is Melissa. We had talked a little bit before when we talked about the SKU rationalization program, that you probably would see more of an impact on net sales than you would retail takeaway, as you're taking some inventory out of the system for some of those merchandising vehicles and other things that won't show up as much in retail, but you would see some inventory contraction there.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then, Patricia, thanks again for all your help over the years, but for the tax rate guidance now at 19%, that's a little lower than before, but it's related to your other income line because of the government tax program. So where is that line going to come in? Is that going to be around like last year at $95 million because I think the original guidance was a lot lower than that?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, we haven't changed our guidance on that. Our full year 2018 outlook is still $65 million to $70 million for the other income and expense. It was lower in the third quarter, as you point out. And that's why you saw the flip up in the third quarter tax break.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So then if your tax rate then implied for fourth quarter is like 9%, does that mean that your expectations for operating income were a little lower than they were three months ago, or were in line?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","So, really, nothing has changed for the full year. We always have variability related to this investment tax credit program that we have. And I'll also point out that now there's pension expense in that. The non-service pension expense is in that other income line as well, so that is also creating a little bit of noise, but it's really nothing in the fundamentals has changed.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, all right. Thank you very much.","Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.","All right, thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning.

My name is Steve and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company's First Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark Pogharian","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's first quarter 2015 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO and I will provide you with an overview of results followed by a Q&A session.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC.","If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally.","The non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP, rather the company believes the presentation of earnings and excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss 2015 first quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $9.7 million or $0.02 per share diluted and gain on the sale of a trademark of $10 million or $0.03 per share diluted. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","J.P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. While our sales and earnings performance for the quarter was mixed, I was happy with the progress that we've made in key areas, particularly in the U.S. business were operating and marketplace performance was in line with our expectations. We completed the Krave acquisition towards the end of March and we began the integration work. We can now begin to share snaking inside related to consumer and market segmentation as well as distribution in channel opportunities.","As we said in January at that CAGNY, we expected first quarter sales and earnings to be pressured to the Easter timing as seasonal net sales occurred at pre price increased levels. However, Q1 results were lower than we anticipated due to some unexpected softness in China. The weakness was across the majority of the consumer package good space in the China modern trade. The acceleration of this softness in the first quarter versus Q4 was unexpected.","Chocolate was one of the few categories in Chinese that grew in the first quarter although less than last year. In China, Hershey's slightly outpaced the category and gained market share. However, the pace of growth slowed significantly.","Mark will provide you with additional financial details. So let me give you an overview of the business.","Overall, total company Q1 net sales, excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates increased 4.6% driven primarily by pricing and net benefit from acquisitions of 1.6 points. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate was 1.1 headwinds. Our expectation was for adjusted earnings per share diluted to be about the same as last year. So the $1.9 that we earned was largely due to lower than expected international sales growth.","Including Easter's seasonal activity and the year ago in current period the candy, mint and gum or CMG category, increased 3.9% for the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2015 within the xAOC+C channels. Gum continues to underperformed and excluding yet the chocolate, non-chocolate and mint categories increased about 4.2%.","Excluding Easter's seasonal activity in the current and year ago period combined growth of chocolate, non-chocolate and mints was up 3%. Hershey, first quarter, CMG retail takeaway and the xAOC+C universe was 4.6% benefiting from an Easter versus last year. We had a good Easter and believe we will gain share in this important season. Excluding Easter seasonal sales Hershey's everyday marketplace performance continues to improve. Specifically, Hershey's xAOC+C CMG retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending March 21st, excluding Easter seasonal sales in the current and year ago period increase plus 3.1%.","Perhaps the easiest way to assess performance given seasonal timing is by looking at absolute market share results. We gained market share both with and without the Easter seasonal activity. All in including the seasonal activity Hershey first quarter CMG market share in the xAOC+C universe increased plus 0.2 points. U.S. first quarter organic net sales of nearly 3%, seasonal sales roughly one quarter of our business in the first quarter declined year-over-year due to a shorter Easter season. ","This was more than offset by our everyday business which I'm pleased to say increased mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. This is slightly ahead of everyday retail takeaway of 3.1% due to the timing and shipments of second quarter promotions and new products. In the second quarter we believe our everyday momentum will continue with the broader roll out and launch of Ice Breakers Cool Blast Chews, Hershey's Caramels and additional Lancaster Cream flavors. In Hershey's first quarter xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway excluding Easter was up 3.3% resulting in chocolate market share gains in 0.6 points. Importantly, retail takeaway was solid across many of core chocolate franchises including Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, Kisses and Brookside.","Switching to non-chocolate candy or NCC in the xAOC+C channels, Hershey's NCC business excluding Easter in the current and year ago period declined 2% as we were lapping the year ago launch of the Lancaster product line. We anticipate that our NCC performance will be a bit better over the next couple of quarters supported by Lancaster in store sampling events, national FSIs and some summer fun flavors of Twizzlers. While not as large as chocolate, at NCC we continue to do well within the gum and the mint categories, specifically our Q1 gum and mint retail takeaway within the xAOC+C universe was up 11% and 10.5% respectively. ","As a result our gum market share increased by 0.4 points to 5.2%, our mint market share increased 0.7 points expanding our segment leading position to 40.3%. In the C store classic trade where the seasonal impacts are minimal the CMG category was up 5.1% driven by pricing. As it relates to the previously announced price increase volume elasticity trends are tough to discern in the xAOC universe given the influence of seasonal candy on shelf at pre price increase levels. However conversion appears to be on track. ","Total Hershey's C store performance was solid with retail takeaway up plus 4.8%, it was driven by pricing of 9-10 points offset by volume elasticity of about 5%. This is relatively in line with our modeling for this channel, our C store chocolate and mint retail takeaway was particularly solid up 4.9% and 8.9% respectively. These gains were driven by core brand advertising, in store selling, merchandizing and programming. International results were mixed in the first quarter giving greater than expected unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and China retail softness that impacted overly grocery as well as the chocolate category growth. Recall during last quarter's conference call we stated that chocolate category growth in China was about 8% and that was less than the historical 10-11%. ","In the first quarter chocolate category growth was 4% again softer than we would have anticipated and less than the year ago period. Given the Chinese New Year holiday the first quarter is typically the biggest quarter of the year for chocolate consumption. Some of this softness is most likely due to government policy related to gifting, however macroeconomic news indicates things have significantly slowed and this could be impacting overall consumer confidence. This is evident when looking at Nielsen data for the broader CBG group which was also soft.","Our chocolate retail takeaway in China was about 5% in the first quarter resulting in a market share gain of 0.1 point. In all of the markets where we operate our goal is to ship to consumption so the consumer has a good experience related to freshness and taste. Therefore our China first quarter net sales moderated and declined 47% versus year ago. We will continue to execute against plans with our retail partners in China to drive store traffic and in store activity over the remainder of the year. As a result our China chocolate plan reflects the first quarter miss and remains relatively intact versus our initial plan. We have made some adjustments on how we\u2019ll get there.","We expect to enter some Tier 2 cities will increase the level of in store sampling to drive everyday trail and repeat.","Additionally, we're beginning to get Brookside out into the market and using Golden Monkey distributor assets that help us to achieve that. Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is progressive. In the first quarter Golden Monkey was diluted to our earnings. However, results will be stronger in the second half of the year supported by a solid pipeline of snack and non-chocolate candy new products.","In Mexico, first quarter constant currency net sales increased about 16%. As expected our business is sequentially improved over the last three quarters as consumers have adjusted to the VAT tax instituted last year. Importantly, the chocolate category increased about 13%. We estimate that Hershey's retail takeaway was up about 12% driven by Hershey's spikes and a King Size Q1 event at some selected retailers.","Over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of in store activity planned to highlighting new packaging designs and pack types that we believe will generate solid net sales growth.","In Brazil, first quarter constant currency net sales increased about 18% results benefited from an easy comp versus the year ago period and an earlier Easter. Although note that we don't have a broad Easter portfolio on Brazil as the big Kiss offering is our primary seasonal item. Hershey's Tablet Bar performance was good and while all small Reese is starting to gain attraction in Brazil.","Despite mixed international results in the first quarter we remain confident about plans over the remainder of the year. We\u2019ve made adjustments where necessary and have the right mix of innovation and in-store activities to achieve our objectives. Our international growth profile excluding Golden Monkey is similar to prior years and driven by performance in the second half, particularly the fourth quarter.","However, foreign currency exchange rates remain volatile and over the remainder of the year, the other favorable impact on net sales is expected to be greater than our previous estimate. Given this backdrop and first quarter softness in China, we now expect international net sales excluding the benefit of Golden Monkey, to increase about 5% versus our previous expectation of about 10% increased.","Now to wrap up. Core brand merchandising, programming and innovation accelerates over the remainder of the year. There is no change to our advertising and marketing methodology and we continue to expect that it will increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. We believe these investments should generate full year organic net sales growth or constant currency sales excluding M&A and FX impacts of around 3.5% to 4.5% in 2015.","We expect foreign exchange rates to be greater than our previous testament by about a half a point and be about 1.5 points unfavorable in 2015. We continue to estimate that the net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures will be around 2.5 points. With the profitable U.S. business on track and increase in gross margin expansion and Golden Monkey accretion later in the year, we expect an increase in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share diluted of 8% to 10%, including dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of $0.03 to $0.05 per share.","Before we provide you with additional financial details, I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome Patricia Little our CFO as of March 16. Patricia is a season financial leader who knows how to create shareholder value and develop talent and we believe will be a benefit to our global organization and all of our shareholders.","Patricia Little","Thanks, J.P. I'm pleased to be here and it's a privilege to be part of the Hershey team, especially given the many opportunities in front of us. I follow the consumer package goods states as a board member at another company. So while I\u2019m a bit familiar with the category, I still have a lot to learn over the coming months. However, in my first few weeks on the job, it's clear and the confectionary category are advantaged. Our business is growing in the profitable North America market and in our focus international markets the category has a long runway. I'm committed to long term value creation, as is our board of directors and look forward to helping our company reach its potential.","Overtime, I look forward to meeting all of you and sharing what I learned and opportunities that continue to exist for the Hershey company.","With that let me turn it over to Mark, who will provide you with further information on first quarter results.","Mark Pogharian","Thank you, Patricia. Good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. First quarter net sales of 1.9 billion was up 3.5% versus the prior year, excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.1 point, about half a point greater than estimate net sales increased 4.6%. The fluctuation in the Canadian dollar was responsible for about half of that FX impact and the Mexican peso and Brazilian real, the majority of the remainder.","As we indicated last quarter given a shorter Easter, volume elasticity related to the U.S. price increase and the timing of innovation, we expected consolidated net sales growth in Q1 to be around the low end of our long-term target. However, we didn't anticipate the anomaly in China that J.P. referred to. Pricing and net M&A was at 3.8 point and 1.6 point benefits. Partially offset by volume that was 0.8 point headwinds.","Importantly, North America organic net sales excluding FX and M&A increased 3.4%, relatively in line with our expectations. North America pricing up 4.3 points was partially offset by volume that was up 0.9 points due to elasticity related to the price increase and lower seasonal sales. International and other segments net sales increased 8.5% driven by the Golden Monkey acquisition, a 13.3 point benefit, while FX was a 4.8 point headwind. International and other segment organic net sales were about the same as last year.","As we stated in January first quarter EPS would be pressured, our expectation was for adjusted EPS to be about the same as last year due to seasonal product sales that accorded a pre-price increase level and our plan for higher SM&A expenses. However we did not anticipate the lower levels of growth in China within the biggest cities and hyper markets. This impacted chocolate categories growth in the quarter as well as some of our decisions related to Golden Monkey go to market strategies. Hence adjusted EPS diluted of a $1.9 down about 5% versus last year was off versus our plan primarily due to China chocolate sales and Golden Monkey dilution.","Turning now to margins, in the first quarter adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points driven by supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives as well as the net price realization which more than offsets higher input cost, earlier this month we implemented select input cost strategies that we believe will enable gross margin to increase a 155 to a 165 basis points for the full year. Adjusted EBIT in the first quarter declined 5.6% versus last year resulting in adjusted EBIT margin of 20.3%. The decline was driven by higher SM&A expenses that increased 12.3% versus last year. Looking at a couple of the pieces, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 8%, selling, marketing and administrative expenses excluding advertising and related consumer marketing increased about 15%. This increase reflects the addition of Golden Monkey, investments in mark-to-market capabilities in the US and the international markets, as well as knowledge based consumer insights. ","Let me now provide you with a brief update on the international business. Similar to prior years our expectation entering 2015 was for international net sales growth would be back half weighted. We still believe that will be the case given our plans for advertising, merchandizing programming and new products. Q1 international net sales increased 8.8%. Note that this excludes global retail and licensing results which was relatively in line with expectations. Looking at our focus markets we believe China chocolate category softness was impacted by consumer confidence given all the negative headlines you've all see like slowing GDP growth.","Although we were encouraged that March Nielsen data showed an acceleration in category growth versus January and February. Over the remainder of the year we expect net sales growth in China to sequentially improve, although it will be driven by performance in the second half of the year. We've adjusted our China plans to generate greater in store activities, support faster growth in the hyper markets, we'll be entering some Tier 2 cities and we have plans to increase our exposure in the fast growing e-commerce channel. ","On a constant currency basis net sale in Mexico and Brazil increased mid-teens on a percentage basis versus last year due to easier comps. Recall that at the beginning of '14 we had the headwind of the back tax in [inactive] in Mexico, and volume elasticity related to the price increase in Brazil. We expect Mexico and Brazil performance to be better than last year however we expect the Real and Pesos to remain volatile and be a major headwind related to reported net sales.","Moving down to P&L, first quarter interest expense of 19.2 million, declined 2.2 million versus last year. For the full year we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $75 million to $80 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 35% in line with our estimate. For the full year we expect the adjusted net tax rate to be slightly lower than the year ago rate of 34.5%. This is a little different from our initial analysis and guidance that the full year adjusted tax rate would be about the same as last year. For the first quarter of 2015 weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 222.7 million, a 1.9% decline compared to last year. ","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow, at the end of the first quarter net trading capital increased versus last year's first quarter by 69.2 million, account receivable was lower by 13.8 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by 67 million and accounts payable declined by 16 million. The net increase in trading capital was driven by acquisitions, excluding net acquisitions and divestitures net trading capital increased 7 million.","In terms of other specific cash flow items total capital additions including software were 62.7 million in the first quarter, for the year we expect total capital expenditures to be about 375 million to 400 million including capital related to the Johor Malaysia project of about a 110 million. Excluding this project CapEx is about 275 million or about 3.5 % of net sales. Depreciation and amortization was 58.3 million in the first quarter in line with our estimates, during the first quarter dividends paid were over 114 million. The company repurchased a $173 million of outstanding shares in the first quarter against a February 2014 authorization which is now complete; no shares have been purchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015. This authorization is in addition to the company's policy of repurchasing shares in the open market related to issues in connection with stock option exercises. In the first quarter the company repurchased a $134 million of common shares to replace shares issued in connection with exercise of stock options.","Cash and short term investments at the end of the first quarter were up 405 million. As J.P. summarized, in 2015, we have a solid pipeline of innovation, merchandising and programming. In addition marketing expense is expected to increase that greater than net sales growth. As a result we expect 2015 net sales to increased 4.5% to 5.5%, including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of around 2.5 points and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of about 1.5 points.","Excluding these items, organic net sales are expected to increase 3.5% to 4.5% versus the previous 4% to 6%. While we remain confident in our business plans, a narrowing of the sales range reflects to global macroeconomic challenges that continue to persist. But decline of the lower end of the range by half of point primarily reflects the first quarter China underperformance. We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin and expect that the previously announced price increase as well as productivity and cost savings to result in gross margin expansion of 155 to 165 basis points. Combined with a slightly lower net cash rate and Golden Monkey accretion in the second half of the year, adjusted earnings per share diluted is expected to increase 8% to 10%.","Before we open it up to Q&A just a couple of thoughts on the second quarter. We have planned to generate solid gross margin expansion over the remaining quarters. However the second quarter is typically our smallest quarter as it relates to overall net sales. And our international sales profile is similar to prior year with annual growth primarily driven by fourth quarter performances. Additionally, Golden Monkey will be dilutive in the second quarter before ramping up in the second half of the year. While small [crave] margins are lower than the company average and it will also contributes to the increase in total consolidated SM&A expenses in the second quarter.","Therefore second quarter net sales, including M&A and FX is expected to be at near the low end of our full year sales target of 4.5% to 5.5% before accelerating in the second half of the year. Given all these moving parts, we expect second quarter EPS diluted growth to be pressured and around the same as last year.","Thank you for your time this morning and we'll now take any questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar","If the more sizable part of the top line weakness in the quarter as you talked about was international and SGM, I just want to make sure that I'm clear on why the these full year organic sales target is coming down? Is it just the organic piece of the international particularly China that you talked about or is there some North American angle to that as well? I just want to make sure that's not changed.","J.P. Bilbrey","It is the China flow through at the first quarter Andrew that you\u2019re seeing; the U.S. business [indiscernible] is off to a good start and is forecasted to be as we anticipated earlier in the year.","Andrew Lazar","Okay and then despite this [indiscernible] the sales weakness in SGM, I guess you talked about still looking for the same full year contribution from acquisitions but I guess you only have, I think maybe two quarters left to make up for that first quarter weakness in SGM because I think you start lapping it in the fourth quarter, if I'm not mistaken. So I'm just trying to get sense of what gives the comfort level there that the acquisition contribution can still be the same despite the first quarter?","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes, that's correct. Last year we had two months if you recall from Golden Monkey and the fourth quarter. And as we start of the year we had a similar pattern as we did in the chocolate business, we were lower in terms of the Chinese New Year. What we have in Golden Monkey, which is different than the regular chocolate businesses, we have a part of the business which is not so seasonal, which is the [bean curve] business and we also have a lot of innovation which kicks in after new year and that's been the typical pattern, where we have distributor meetings early in the second quarter for that innovation and there is a very strong innovation pipeline for that. And so our expectation is that we will be on target for that accretion during the full year and that will come into back half. The other small acquisitions and divestitures whether the Mauna Loa or Krave kind of offset each other. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane","Just the follow up to Andrew's question and I just want to make sure, I called all these pieces the -- in the first quarter the downside relative to your internal plans was really partly at least more dilution from Shanghai Golden Monkey. But for the full year you're not -- you expecting the dilution to be similar or the same in terms of what you thought it was going to beginning at the year? But it sounds like you're going to spend more money for some of this in market activity to try to boost sales. So, trying to piece those pieces together. Why it wouldn't be more diluted if you\u2019re having to spend more money to drive sales, special since it was already more dilutive than you thought in the first quarter. So am I thinking about that correctly, I guess?","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes, not partially -- not exactly. Let me explain. We always said Shanghai Golden Monkey would be slight accretive to the year and all we\u2019re trying to do is reconfirm that despite a slower start attributable to new year. We did have -- Obviously, lower operating income in the rest of the China business for the same reason that we had a slower start. What we're saying in this case is that the Shanghai Golden Monkey's slight accretion to the year remains intact, based on the activity progress that we have in place.","In terms of you know higher spending, we\u2019re not projecting higher spending in the international business in terms of getting back to you know our targets for the year and we're also given the magnitude of the China sales miss, we're not projecting that we can make up that sales miss which is part of what Mark explained on the call down on the lower end. We do have higher year-on-year cost in the sales force that's our program as we actively go into more cities and we did still have advertising in the first quarter during Chinese New Year although it certainly wasn't as effective as we thought it would be.","Mark Pogharian","And those comments are related to the China chocolate business, Brian, so it's not only did you have the SEM dilution you had all the investments we made in the China chocolate business throughout '14 that happened perhaps in the back half that are [indiscernible] that are in your pace, that will be in the pace of the first half this year.","Bryan Spillane","Okay.","J.P. Bilbrey","Like in sales force, et cetera.","Bryan Spillane","And then just one last follow up to that is just, it sounds like you know in terms of when you built this plan in I guess October and November versus where we are today, Chinese New Year was weaker than expected and a lot of this I guess is more macro, it\u2019s not just specific to Hershey and so I guess as you go forward in terms of as you've done the planning going forward has it incorporated that maybe that you know the macro environment is just not as strong as it was when you initially planned 2015 or is the expectation that it's the same? I'm just trying to understand how it accounts for what seems like just slower growth generally in China. ","J.P. Bilbrey","We've taken that into account and as we looked, to your point, as we developed the plan last year and we said during the January call that we expected Chinese growth to be approximately the 30% that we grew in '14, so we weren't -- while we were seeing some slowdown, let's call it in December, we weren't planning for as poor a performance. We know, we think there's a lot of this is cyclical based on what you're hearing, GDP, consumer confidence, things that we've already mentioned. We don\u2019t think it's as much structural, in fact some of the structural changes we think actually help us in the long run, things like urbanization, as well as more of a consumer economy which is what the government's pushing but, we've lowered certainly the overall year expectations, as you know we said we'd be somewhere around 30 and that the category would be in the low double digits. We certainly lowered that to high single digit. Still think we can do two-three times the category growth rate but we certainly lowered that overall year expectation, not trying to make up the first quarter.","Mark Pogharian","Let me just add one other comment, it's really important for the perspective of our company in China is, we continue to be in a brand building and portfolio expansion mode, Shanghai Golden Monkey is of course critical for the distribution, build of that, and so we really continue -- we believe we have the right brands, the right growth plan, markets will moderate as we're certainly seeing right now over time, but on a long term basis we continue to believe our model's a good model, obviously volume is a magic elixir on some of these things, so you also have to manage pace in investment along with that but we really believe that we have the right plans in place and over time we\u2019ll continue to grow in China, mainly around distribution and portfolio expansion for the near term anyway.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan; your line is open,","Ken Goldman","I had a question for Patricia if I could, and first welcome to the food industry, I'm curious and I realize it's still early days right, but is there anything you're seeing that you might consider sort of low hanging fruit you'd like to pick, I don\u2019t know whether that's in the balance sheet or M&A strategy, really anything, is there something you're looking at and saying you know what we can and I guess should be doing this differently.","Patricia Little","Thanks for the question, I don't think it's so much that I'm going to come in with those kinds of answers, what I've seen is leadership team here who's really focused on all of those things, on the M&A, on the cost leverage on how they manage the brands on how they focus on growth both in North America and the key focus markets, I view my job as to be really a catalyst to help that team bring all of their great ideas to fruition, so I wouldn't say that there's low hanging fruit that I come in to see, what I see is a group that's working on all of those very actively.","Ken Goldman","Okay, and then this is a question, just one more for anyone really, you're one of the first food companies to report since the Kraft Heinz deal and I recognize you've already made significant improvements to your cost base over the years and I appreciate you're more of a growth company right than either Kraft or Heinz, but I guess when you read some of the -- read about some of the massive margin improvements 3G is able to implement, you know, I guess on some level do you think to yourself boy there's, maybe there's a lot more we can do than what we're currently planning on, or do you say this is our plan, we'll need to balance top line growth with margins and so forth? I\u2019m just curious how you react, what seems to be a continued trend here in food.","J.P. Bilbrey","So, I think as you rightly point out we're very focused on growth, we've been investing in our business is about the new geographies and I think very importantly in capabilities. So I can\u2019t specifically talk about 3G, what I do thing is very important and as I mentioned on the last call at CAGNY, we're really looking about -- we\u2019re really looking at how we evolve our business mode, how we allocate and reallocate resources against what we believe are opportunity, you\u2019ve heard us talk about knowledge and insight. We continue to believe that's really important and we're investing in different skill sets there than we have and so we have to be mindful at the pace of our business. We have to make sure that the volume continues to be the elixir that makes all things affordable.","So you should expect us to continue to take hard look at the leverage we have against our P&L and you\u2019ll hear us talk a bit more about that we're doing a lot of work in that area. But I think for our company we strongly believe that there has to be an ongoing balance between brand building and P&L leverage. That obviously takes cost as one of the key leverage, but we want to make sure that we maintain the right balance and focus on all those things.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","John Baumgartner","John, as you look to your cost basket here, gross margin are tracking bit more favorably relative to your last update and with that sailing going for you, do you find your still needing to reinvest the incremental benefit in sales force or marketing, or have you reached the position where SG&A budget is more of less fixed and those cost can flow through more to products going forward?","J.P. Bilbrey","Well, I think that, there is a couple of thing to probably seeing as we raised our gross margin outlook, part of that is around commodities and input cost and then as I said, we want to make sure that we continue to look at the levers that we put in place. So yes we've invested in our selling capabilities and we want continue to invest in our brands some of that's in our international markets but it's also importantly in our U.S. market as well, where we get the right see store level of coverage where we get the right frequency in stores so that we can win in merchandising and so, if we look at our overall business model we think we\u2019ve got the right approach. And to make sure that, you continue to be reassured that we are mindful about what we can afford and non-afford obviously we want to make sure that we continue to grow into those investments at the appropriate pace.","But I think over the long-term again we're really committed to our business model and we also feel good about the markets that we're in. We think, we're in the right markets long-term and it will have to whether some of the volatility of the short-term up and downs. But we're in this business to stay, we\u2019re been here a long time and we planned to be here either longer.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Eric Katzman","Couple of questions, I guess, kind of following up. This is -- should we read this like select input cost strategies as a kind of one time in nature? I mean did you like just favorably locking some hedges or something that makes this -- the gross margin improvements locked in for this year?","J.P. Bilbrey","I think, Eric, we look at what we believe are the right strategies to protect our brand investment in our pricing and our -- I would just reiterate that we can be anywhere between 3 and 24 months hedged on some of our key commodities. Certainly coco\u2019s been volatile so we\u2019ve looked for opportunities to price went we think the -- it's a good value and then the entire industry is getting some benefit out of dairy and you know well, I'm not trying to predict, where dairy goes, it feels as though it\u2019s in a direction which could benefit. But if you look at lot of the tree nuts and so forth, those are going up largely and so again we try to look at the overall commodity basket and we feel pretty good about how we've been able to take a forward view to protect our current plans.","Eric Katzman","Okay and then -- thanks for that. And then just kind of talking about the U.S. business overall, I mean as I've been travelling around -- again it's not a scientific sample, but it just seems like there is more promotion in the market, I see kind of BOGO, it seems like a lot of the pegboard and mini products that have been introduced in past years are on sale a lot, I think J.P. you've mentioned in the past seeing more kind of snack based competition and so maybe can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in market and is that are those observations fair appraisal?","J.P. Bilbrey","Eric, I think what we would say is that across snacking we are seeing that there is a lot of activity out there, if you look at the overall snacking wheel and the share performance you can see that there's been some moderation there with the exception that CMG is sort of returning more to its historical performance base, you\u2019ve see meat snacks which continues to perform really well and obviously we're encouraged by Krave.","But I think we're in an era where the snacking continuum and the occasions of snacking are broadening and therefore consumer choice is greater and so we have to work hard at making sure that at the point of sale our brands are winning in terms of merchandizing etc. I\u2019ll tell you the one thing, that if I -- as I personally have a takeaway from the first quarter that I feel better about than anything else we probably could talk about on this call is that we're seeing a strengthening in our everyday business and if you take Easter out and you know all of the previous quarters and all and you just look at what's the health of the everyday business. We're doing a -- our everyday brands are up and importantly that's always a measure of advertising effectiveness. So the combination of advertising working for us and seeing our everyday business improving outside of that environment, that is a very, very healthy sign and for me that's the thing I feel best about in the entire first quarter.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research, your line is open.","David Driscoll","Wanted to follow up on two points, the first one on Ken's question regarding kind of the cost structure of the company. J.P. I think you indicated in the release here that SG&A investment kind of excluding the acquisitions was up about 10%. Yes, I think over the years you guys have really been adding to your \u201ccapabilities\u201d within that line, and the question here is, is all of that 10% increase focused on these emerging market opportunities or how much of it is really focused on the U.S. And then how do you think about that in light of Kraft-Heinz and [ZBB] and all of these commentary regarding the US marketplace where it seems as if folks are really taking costs out of their U.S. operations not putting them in. ","J.P. Bilbrey","Well I think David first of all a couple of things, I would tell you that as consumer insight driven company, a brand building company, we're going to always be focused on growth and growing our brand. The cost is a lever, and it\u2019s an important one, so look, I mean if we can all capture synergies in our business via acquisitions and add-ons and making sure that we've got P&L leverage, we absolutely have to be focused to get that because the investments that we make have to pay for themselves.","But first and foremost we have a business model you know that we want to pursue. So, yes I think there's some very good reminders in the marketplace that suggest that, listen, you got to make sure you're not getting fat, but you also have to make sure that along the way to not getting fat, you're allocating resources in a way that you can win in the market place on a go in basis. So that's important.","If I come back to the first part of your question, we're balancing those investments both internationally and in the U.S. So we've proven over and over again that the passion of our sales organization, our feet on the street represent us better than any other choice we could make, I've also seen some evidence in the market place where some other companies are coming to that conclusion as well. But for our company we continue to be focused against those investments, and the only way we can grow our brands in these new markets is to forward invest in the capabilities that make them broadly available to consumers and we'll continue to do that. But we\u2019ll do that in the most effective and efficient way we possibly can.","David Driscoll","Okay and just a follow up on international, so I think what you guys wrote is that Mexico, Brazil and India were up 15% and that was in line with your expectations, so that seems to be tracking and then all of this international stuff is related to China, that's where the short fall is, so hopefully I have that correct and then kind of the question here is, you know 47%, of course every time you read a number like that on a company like this you do a double take to make sure you didn't misread it. I think the takeaway here -- but this is the question, is the 47% decline in the China business, it's an inventory adjustment essentially, so that in 4Q you had massive shipments of product to retail, anticipating something like a 30% growth in the first quarter in China. First quarter China retail I think you guys said was 5% for Hershey products and hence that requires a massive change in the shipment pattern in Q1. [Bert] am I putting all this together right.","Mark Pogharian","Yes, let me -- to your first point, it is largely China, there were other small bits right, so there're a couple of our export markets where the dollar is making the product quite expensive, example could be an export market like Japan, obviously which, they're actually in quantitative easing so their currency's going the other way, So there were a few markets and certainly our export business was impacted but it was largely a China story in the scheme of things. And you're quite right, as we anticipated the growth in the first quarter for Chinese New Year and didn\u2019t see that coming along we obviously shipped less into the marketplace, because J.P. mentioned earlier I think in his remarks, we try to ship with the consumption pattern is, we don't expect that will be made up in the rest of the years, so we've adjusted down or growth although we think the rest of the year should be more normalized than what we saw during the Chinese new year.","David Driscoll","Okay. So, kind of short version here is this you do the big catch up in the first quarter to get this thing, the distribution inventories on track and then the remaining three quarters are negatively impacted by a fundamental view that the China growth rate is lower than what you had previously thought, is that right?","Mark Pogharian","I think, that's correct. Again don't forget a lot of the next wave of China business, Golden Monkey\u2019s is little bit less seasonal, does come in the last four months of the year","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line on Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan Feeney","Just following up more directly with David here, I mean, if China was down -- Shanghai Golden Monkey 47% on 5% take away, what were you hoping China was going to do in the first quarter? And maybe for the year and approximately by how much -- did you lower that internal forecast?","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes, we don't talk about quarters, we did say in the first quarter call that we expected the China business to grow around at 30% that we grew last year, I think, last year we were up 34. And so we expected to similar growth. I'll just reiterate we -- that would translate into category and the low double digits, we've lowered that to the high single digits reflecting the first quarter miss.","Jonathan Feeney","Makes a lot of sense, thanks. And of that growth, how much of that is channel penetration of the former, Shanghai Golden Monkey -- enabled by the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition and if you can -- can you tell us, you look at the 13.3 impact, I assume that's all from Shanghai Golden Monkey, I assume that of this year sales, can you tell us, what apples-to-apples if it's possible the Shanghai Golden Monkey business is trending?","J.P. Bilbrey","On the first part of your question, the synergy aspect of Golden Monkey, we're in the very early stages of that, so there is very little of that. And the reason for that is -- as we plan for those synergies; let's take an example, chocolate products through Golden Monkey sales force. We're still on the process of designing different pack size, different price points which are more appropriate for those markets. So, there is not a lot of the miss that's accounted for by not penetrating Hershey products to Golden Monkey. On a year-over-year basis we haven't given that type of information, the Golden Monkey certainly had a similar impact in the first quarter as you would see in our chocolate business based on the same lower New Year.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you. And do you continue to expect that or do you expect that cross selling opportunity once you get through the appropriate pack sizes remains to be significant?","J.P. Bilbrey","Very much. Well it's not -- well it's all incremental to what their business model has been all along. A lot of that welcome toward the end of the year as we designed these pack types and we start to launch into the next wave of Chinese new year if you will, which comes later in the year but we're fairly confident that we have the right products, we have to reconfigure them and they suddenly have the capability to get them into lower Tier cities and traditional trade.","Jonathan Feeney","Thanks and I just ask one last question, you have a -- in the first quarter clearly, you had -- looked like some pretty good in North American performance at least as far as both the everyday business and overall. And you -- it seems is this gross margin would have outperformed your expectations were it not for the impact of international, can you give us a sense -- weighs the full years gross margins, so can you give us the sense how much maybe mix or performance in these international business affects gross margin versus if it we're just say in North America, that extra growth in international you're expecting, affects the consolidated gross margin versus if you're say just North American business experiencing that 4 plus percent pricing in modest line decline, thanks","J.P. Bilbrey","I mean, Jon, I guess the way, I would think about it, don't forget that seasonal was about 25% to 30% of our overall North America sale, so that's why it's not up as much as you would have maybe have anticipated. Again when you go to some of these international markets, the growth -- absolute level of gross margin in China for example, would have been down year-over-year, when you think about the 5% take away and perhaps how we think about trade there to make sure it all gets out eventually at the end of the day. So that was the little bit of a drag at the gross margin on the international side.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open","Ken Zaslow","Just two follow ups, one is -- I think, this is what you said is, but the incremental gross margin expansion for your guidance is entirely related to the money environment or there anything operational you are doing to increase that? I didn't get that full answer.","J.P. Bilbrey","Well I think what is said is, is that meaningful piece is really related to the commodity improvement on our input costs and our outlook there. You also have the benefited mix as you get through the year with the pricing you know that really begins to show up in the US business as well. So you got a combination of things that are helping us there. And then as the US business continues to perform well there's always a positive mix effect that happens. Therefore, I made some commentary around the everyday business on one of the earlier questions, so I think you've got several factors.","Mark Pogharian","I guess Ken there's no change, if you think about the initial 135 to 145 bps, it\u2019s all about the pricing and it\u2019s the incremental 20 basis point increase is related to the [indiscernible] on the commodity strategy.","Ken Zaslow","Okay, great, my second question, Tier 2 cities, when you think of them in China, does the long term growth opportunity as well as margin opportunity compare to Tier 1 cities or are they significantly lower, how do they scale up over time?","Mark Pogharian","No, they're -- I mean from a margin perspective they're very comparable. There are some slight benefits, as an example advertising rates are a bit lower as you spread into lower Tier cities. But there's no penalty in terms of pricing and as you go into Tier 2 and Tier 3, the further down you go obviously the pack size change and there's more traditional trade that's part of the mix. But that doesn't cause a margin penalty.","J.P. Bilbrey","The other comment I would just make is that and I kind of come back again to the long term perspective, you know the category growth in China and brand building is still the biggest story and what happens with their pace of urbanization, obviously everybody wants to participate in that, at the same time you have a large dispersement and that's why -- of people and that's why we feel good about the acquisition of Shanghai Golden Monkey and the ability then to put both our brands -- both of the brands of the two entities across our entire distribution chain.","Ken Zaslow","What would make you work for 2016, what would create Chinese growth to be restored to last year's growth level, can you speak to that, and what would you need to see that would change, that would make you think that 2016 could compare with 2014?","J.P. Bilbrey","We haven't started to talk about '16 yet, I think that's a little premature, I think what I mentioned earlier is that certainly what we see in China today you know feels more cyclical in terms of what\u2019s going on with GDP, what's going on with consumer sentiment. You've seen the government react to some degree, last weekend I think the Central Bank lowered reserve rates in order to put more monies into the economy, particularly for small business. I think the structural changes favor CPG categories in terms of urbanization which J.P. mentioned as well as a more consumer oriented economy versus exports, so I do see given to see that evolution, we\u2019re structural, I think helps us and then the cyclical right now will all have to hold hands and see how soon that gets resolved, but I do think that's more cyclical in structure.","Mark Pogharian","Operator, we have time for one more question; want to respectful of other peers that are reporting today.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard, your line is open.","Alexia Howard","Can I ask about the everyday items, you mentioned that you were encouraged about that would trend and could you give us some numbers around that? About the progression there, maybe first half last year, second half last year and then what you\u2019ve seen this latest quarter. And what do you think is driving that, are you seeing better traffic in the stores, you mentioned the advertising effectiveness was another piece of it. Thank you and I'll pass it on.","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes, Alexia the thing that I would point to and I'll try to give to give you a couple of things here, if you look at the quarter, Reese's was about nine-tenths of a point, Hershey's up 2.4%, Kit Kat was up 3.6%, Kisses up over 9% and Brookside was a big number and because it's a new brand, may not be meaningful to talk about it, but it was a big number. So for me the fact that the everyday ex-Easter was healthy until all of our core brands grew and that's the piece that I was feeling so good about and you know the first quarter last year was -- so some of the comparable in terms of the total CMG may be a little bit harder to look at, the first quarter of 2014 last year was up about 4.6% or so and a lot of that was driven by non-chocolate products with Lancaster and some big Twizzlers type promotions. So if you really isolate our biggest brands and those core brands and look at their performance that really shows you, we remember we talked about -- we were going to try to be very focused against merchandizing, against our core and big brands making sure they were available to consumers, that appears to be working for us.","Mark Pogharian","And to answer your TRIPS question Alexia, I would say it looks pretty the [tripped] in by channel. I mean, I think our performance and category performance looks pretty similar to last year, we see store dollar in one of the largest retailers in the country continue to really, really shine.","J.P. Bilbrey","I'd make one other point just broadly as I had been out and about talking to retailers and have listened to other manufacturers is, people are saying that they believe the basket is more constructive than they've seen for a while, so that strengthening of the basket is also probably a really good sign for the overall industry, that's a North American comment as well.","Alexia Howard","Thank you very much and I'll pass it back to you. Thank you.","Mark Pogharian","Thank you very much for your time today. I'll be available for any follow up question that any of you have.","Operator","This conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect. "],"10673":["The Hershey (NYSE:HSY) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 25, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Mark K. Pogharian - Director of Investor Relations","John P.

My name is Lisa, and I will be your conference operator today.","At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company Third Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Pogharian. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Bert Alfonso, Senior Vice President and CFO; and I will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We also welcome those of you listening via the webcast.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2011 filed with the SEC.","If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.","As we've said within the Note, the company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","We will discuss 2012 third quarter results excluding net pretax charges of $34.9 million, or $0.10 per share diluted, which are primarily related to the Project Next Century program. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges, non-service-related pension expense and acquisition and integration costs related to the Brookside Foods.","With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","John P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark. I want to thank all of you on the phone and webcast for joining us today. I'm pleased with Hershey's third quarter results. As we anticipated, Hershey's U.S. marketplace performance accelerated in the third quarter.","Hershey chocolate, non-chocolate, mint and gum retail takeaway was up in the measured channel universe of xAOC+C-stores, resulting in market share gains across all segments. Retail and core brand net sales volume trends continued to sequentially improve. This growth is driven by the faster growing channels like convenience and dollar, which are pacing ahead of the more traditional classes of trade.","Before we get into the details, I'd like to give you an update on a couple of announcements we've had since our last conference call. On September 28, we acquired the remaining 49% stake in the Hershey Godrej joint venture. We're very excited about the opportunities that exist in India.","The Mahalacto and Nutrine candy brands and the Jumpin juice and soy-based beverage brands are good businesses and in growing categories.","Similar to what we've done in other international markets, we'll make disciplined brand building investments and improve upon selling capabilities and expand distribution. We'll focus on expanding margins via aggressive cost control and margin enhancing innovation while also evaluating the global Hershey portfolio to determine the best products for the India consumer and marketplace.","We've learned a lot over the last 5 years and have gained valuable consumer insights that will serve us well. We believe we have the right brands, products and people to give us the ability to grow in the marketplace as we fully control our future.","Moving on to sustainable cocoa. Earlier this year, we announced that Hershey's Bliss chocolates will be Rainforest Alliance certified and available to consumers by year-end. Bliss joined Hershey's  Dagoba organic chocolate, which is already 100% Rainforest Alliance certified, and Scharffen Berger, which will source 100% certified cocoa by the end of 2013.","Currently, certified cocoa accounts for less than 5% of the world's cocoa supply. Earlier in the month, we announced that we'll source 100% certified cocoa for our global chocolate product lines by 2020. Hershey and its cocoa suppliers, as well as African governments, will work together to increase farmer knowledge, improve incomes and help cocoa communities increase the volumes of certified cocoa.","No company or single organization can solve this complex and long-term issue. That's why Hershey will continue to work effectively with numerous public and private partners on a precompetitive collaborative basis as we strive towards our 2020 goal.","Over time, we expect this will help farmers and lead to a more efficient cocoa supply chain as greater certified cocoa becomes available. The investments related to this commitment are included in the long-term targets that we discussed at our June investor update.","As it relates to the third quarter, net sales growth of plus 7.5% was essentially in line with our expectations. Net price realization was a 3.9 point benefit in volume; excluding the Brookside acquisition, it was up 2.1 points.","The organic volume gain was primarily driven by new products. Core volume trends improved sequentially and were up slightly this quarter.","From a profitability perspective, earnings came in a bit better than our expectations due to the timing of SM&A expenses.","In terms of Hershey's marketplace performance, Hershey's CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending October 6, 2012 in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business was up plus 5.9%, resulting in a 1.1 market share gain.","Year-to-date, Hershey U.S. retail takeaway and market share is up 5.2% and 0.4 points, respectively.","Year-to-date, the CMG category in the xAOC+C-store channels is up 3.8%. As we approach midyear, the category began to lap the price increases instituted last year. Additionally, the Gum category continues to underperform.","Therefore, CMG category growth for the 12 weeks ended October 6, 2012 slowed and was up 2.2%.","Looking separately at chocolate, non-chocolate and mint categories tells us a different story as each of these segments grew within or above the historical category growth rate of 3% to 4% in the third quarter.","Additionally, the categories beginning to lap the innovation and limited edition introduced by major manufacturers over the last few years. We've had a solid innovation pipeline that we estimate will be at least 1 point of our net sales algorithm on an annual basis.","Hershey Q3 FDMx CMG growth was plus 4.3%, resulting in a market share gain of 1.3 points. In Q3, the FDMx CMG category was flat.","While the broader food group debates what is happening to trips and basket size in some channels, note that there's no evidence of retailers pulling back from the confectionery category in terms of aggregate levels of xAOC distribution points and programming. Importantly, the other measured channels, such as convenience, dollar stores and large mass customers, are growing towards the high-end of the historical category growth rate and represent about 55% of our U.S. sales.","As it relates to Halloween orders, shipments and sell-through is on track. We believe we have the right mix of seasonal, specific advertising, coupons and programming support that sets the stage for another winning season.","We will not have a complete read on sell-through for another couple of weeks, but our preliminary analysis indicates that our Halloween market share and xAOC is projected to increase for the fifth consecutive year and it will build on our 37% plus share of this important season.","For the 12 weeks ended October 6, 2012, xAOC+C-store chocolate category growth was up plus 3.6%. xAOC+C-store chocolate retail takeaway for Hershey improved sequentially as expected and was up plus 4.5%, resulting in a gain of chocolate market share of 0.4 points driven by core brands in our Rolo Minis and Hershey's Simple Pleasures new product launches.","For the 12 weeks ended October 6, 2012, xAOC+C-store non-chocolate category growth was up about 3.5%. Hershey's non-chocolate xAOC+C-store retail takeaway was up 9.2%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.9 points. The solid performance was driven by continued Twizzlers momentum, as well as the new Jolly Rancher Crunch 'N Chew product which is getting good trial and more importantly, repeat purchases.","In the C-store class of trade, CMG third quarter category growth was up plus 4.3%. Total Hershey's C-store performance was particularly strong with takeaway of plus 8.9%, resulting in a share gain of 1.3 points. Hershey's C-store performance was balanced with retail takeaway up 8.7%, 6.4% and 24.6% in chocolate, non-chocolate and mints. These gains were driven by new products, core brand advertising and merchandising and programming, including a Reese's and Coca-Cola promotion on a summer program to win free -- in a summer program to win free gasoline.","As it relates to breath refreshment within convenience stores, we've gained mint market share for 56 consecutive quad weeks or about 4.3 years and now have about a 42-share of category in this channel.","As it relates to our 2012 innovation, recall it's balanced between chocolate and sweets and refreshment. The launch and rollout of new items, such as Jolly Rancher Crunch 'N Chew and Ice Breakers Duo, occurred earlier in the year. We've reached ACV distribution targets on these products with trial and repeat on track versus our plans.","Rolo Minis and Hershey's Simple Pleasures were launched around midyear. Rolo Minis achieved fast distribution and is tracking ahead of expectations. Repeat is about 25% above our target and remains above that of similar hand-to-mouth products during the comparable time period.","ROLO brand advertising started in mid-July for the first time in 25 years, resulting in sharp increases in dollar velocity for the ROLO base business and Mini pack type.","Simple Pleasures, a late Q2 launch is in line with our assumptions. Initial ACV distribution targets were reached in August and we ran a high-value FSI that generated solid results. Marketing plans are in place for the fourth quarter. And as we exit the year, we'll have a perspective on repeat purchases.","As we close the year, we'll be active in all classes of trade with solid brand building initiatives, including core brand merchandising, programming and consumer promotions around Hershey's S'mores tailgating, holiday and baking season and a Reese's NCAA Football and EA Sports promotion.","Additionally, full year advertising expense will increase and is now expected to be up 13% to 15% in 2012. This investment will benefit our business in the near-term and into next year.","Outside of the U.S., our International business on a local currency basis is on track. Year-to-date, the key markets of Mexico, China and Brazil are all above planned and up double-digits on a percentage basis versus last year.","We're growing faster than the category in these markets and feel confident that the disciplined investments and go-to-market capabilities will benefit the company in both the near and long-term. However, as I stated last quarter, given the strength of the U.S. dollar in 2012, foreign currency exchange rates or FX is a headwind. Therefore, we would expect full year 2012 international sales growth, including the impacts of FX to be just below the 15% to 20% growth we've realized in the last few years.","Now to wrap up. I'm pleased with our performance given the macroeconomic challenges that consumers and retailers are facing. Our advertising, consumer promotion, selling capabilities and merchandising have combined to help drive customer and consumer conversion, which has resulted in sequential volume improvement throughout the year. We'll continue to make appropriate investments to ensure a healthy category while driving our everyday and seasonal business over the remainder of 2012 and into 2013.","Organic volume trends continued to sequentially improve. Additionally, the Brookside acquisition will be about a 1.75 to 2-point benefit in 2012. Therefore, we've narrowed our full year net sales growth outlook and now expect it to increase 8% to 9%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","Now Bert will provide further details, but given our gross margin gains and SM&A profile over the remainder of the year, we have increased our full year adjusted earnings per share diluted outlook and expect it to increase 14% to 15% versus 2011 and be in the $3.22 to $3.25 range.","As we look to 2013, we'll continue to focus on core brands and innovation in both the U.S. and key international markets. In January, we'll launch Brookside branded products in the broader U.S. food, drug and mass channels. Therefore, we expect 2013 net sales growth to be within our 5% to 7% long-term target, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","As we stated earlier this year, we remain focused on gross margin. We have solid productivity and cost savings initiatives in place. And while early in the planning cycle, we don't expect input cost inflation next year. Therefore, we expect to achieve gross margin expansion in 2013 and growth in adjusted earnings per share diluted in the 8% to 10% range, consistent with our long-term target.","I'll now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some additional details on our financial results.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Thanks, J.P., and good morning, everyone. Hershey posted another quarter of quality results with consolidated net sales of $1.75 billion, up 7.5% versus the prior year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.87. The 7.5% net sales gain was driven primarily by the continued growth of our core brands and new products.","Net price realization, primarily in the U.S., was a 3.9-point benefit, in line with our estimates. And volume, excluding a 2.3-point benefit from Brookside, was up 2.1 points. The organic volume gain was driven by new products.","Core brand volume trends have improved sequentially throughout the year and were slightly up in the third quarter. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates were a 0.8-point headwind.","Adjusted gross margin in Q3 increased 70 basis points. Net price realization, supply chain efficiencies and productivity improvements were partially offset by increased commodity costs. Versus last year, input costs were about $30 million higher in the quarter and relatively in line with our expectations.","We have good visibility for our cost structure for the remainder of the year, and we continue to expect higher input costs in Q4 versus last year. However, our current inflation outlook for the full year is slightly better than our previous forecast.","Combined with our cost savings and productivity programs, as well as year-to-date price realization, we now expect adjusted gross margin to increase 120  to 140 basis points for the full year versus our previous estimate of 100 to 120 basis points.","In the third quarter, adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT, increased about 6%. This resulted in an adjusted EBIT margin of 19.3%, a 30 basis point decline versus last year due to planned investments in brand building and go-to-market capabilities. Specifically, advertising expense increased about 12% versus the year ago period.","We are now planning a slightly higher investment in advertising in the fourth quarter and expect full year 2012 advertising expense to increase 13% to 15% versus 2011. This is greater than our previous estimate of a low double-digit percentage increase.","Adjusted SM&A, excluding advertising, also increased about 12% versus last year, although less than our previous estimate of a 15% to 20% increase for Q3. We will continue to invest in non-advertising brand building and go-to-market capabilities in both the U.S. and international markets. In the fourth quarter, we would expect another meaningful increase in adjusted SM&A, resulting in low double-digit percentage increase for the full year.","Now let me provide an update on our International businesses. On a local currency basis, net sales increased meaningfully in China and Brazil. In addition, local currency of sales increased in Mexico, although at a more moderate rate.","The investments we've made in these key markets are enabling our brands to gain momentum in the marketplace. We will continue to make disciplined investments in these markets in Q4 and 2013 to further drive distribution, brand awareness and trial.","Given the strong U.S. dollar in 2012, net sales in our businesses outside of the U.S. and Canada, including the impact of foreign exchange, are expected to increase 10% to 15%, although still on pace to reach $1 billion by 2015 as previously communicated.","On September 28, we completed the acquisition of the 49% stake in The Hershey Godrej joint venture that we did not own. We are very excited about the opportunities that exist in India.","In the coming weeks, we plan to pay off the existing local debt, which will essentially offset the additional losses we'll incur from owning 100% of the business. And as J.P. stated, we will now concentrate our efforts on building capabilities and portfolio development for Hershey India.","Moving down to P&L. Q3 interest expense was $24.5 million, up 6.5% versus the prior period. For the full year 2012, we expect interest expense to be approximately $95 million to $100 million.","The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 36.1% or 190 basis points higher than the prior year. Recall that in the previous quarter, we discussed the timing of certain tax items that adversely impacted the third quarter year-over-year.  We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be about 35%.","In the third quarter of 2012, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were $228.6 million versus $229.8 million in 2011, leading to adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.87, up 3.6% versus year ago.","Now let me provide a quick recap of our year-to-date results. Net sales increased 8.4%, adjusted gross margin was 44% year-to-date versus 42.6% last year. Net price realization of productivity gains were partially offset by higher commodity costs. Advertising increased approximately 12% on a year-to-date basis. Adjusted EBIT increased 14.4%, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin gain of 110 basis points from 18.4% to 19.5%. And adjusted earnings per share diluted for the 9-month period increased 17.4% to $2.50 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's third quarter by $96 million.","Accounts receivable was up $29 million, primarily due to higher September sales. Our accounts receivable aging remains extremely current.","Inventory increased by $72 million year-over-year, primarily due to the timing of strategic purchases of key ingredients that we discussed in the second quarter. We will continue to work through these inventories in the fourth quarter and expect that year-end 2012 inventory will be at or below the 2011 ending levels.","Finally, accounts payable increased $5 million. We expect net trading capital to improve in the fourth quarter as we cycle through the peak seasonal period of our business.","In terms of other specific cash flow items, capital additions including software were $66 million in the third quarter and $214 million year-to-date. The Q3 amounts included $9 million of Project Next Century capital expenditures.","For 2012, we are targeting total capital additions to be in the $280 million to $300 million. This range includes base ongoing CapEx of $215 million to $230 million plus Project Next Century CapEx of approximately $65 million to $70 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $53 million in the third quarter. This includes accelerated depreciation related to Project Next Century of about $3 million and adjusted operating depreciation and amortization of $50 million in the quarter.","In 2012, we are forecasting total operating depreciation and amortization of about $220 million, including accelerated depreciation and amortization related to Project Next Century of about $20 million.","Dividends paid during the quarter were $83 million. Also during the quarter, we repurchased approximately $279 million worth of common shares to replace shares issued in connection with stock option exercises. We did not acquire any shares in the third quarter related to the $250 million outstanding repurchase program.","Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $466 million. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow and has a strong balance sheet. Therefore, as mentioned in this morning's press release, we have increased our quarterly dividend by 10.5%. This action reflects our confidence in the long-term growth of our business.","Let me now provide an update on Project Next Century. I am pleased to announce that construction and line installation is complete and the plant is operational and our current focus is on line performance optimization.","The forecast for pretax GAAP charges and nonrecurrent project implementation costs related to the program has been increased from a range of $160 million to $180 million to $190 million to $200 million, primarily due to a non-cash pension settlement charge during the third quarter. As required by U.S. GAAP, the settlement charge occurred because employee withdrawals from pension plans exceeded certain accounting threshold levels.","During the third quarter, we recorded Project Next Century charges of $26 million pretax, of which $13 million was related to non-cash pension settlement charges.","As previously communicated, by 2014, we continue to expect ongoing annual savings to be approximately $65 million to $80 million.","Now to summarize. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. Over the remainder of the year, we plan to make incremental investments in our brands and business capabilities.","As stated earlier, full year 2012 adjusted SM&A expenses, excluding advertising, are expected to increase low double-digits versus the prior year in line with previous estimates. Full year advertising expected to increase 13% to 15% versus the prior year.","Halloween has gotten off to a good start and the Brookside acquisition expected to contribute 1.75- to 2-point net sales benefit in 2012 as our initial supply chain performance has enabled us to optimize product sales mix. Therefore, we've narrowed our full year net sales growth outlook and now expect net sales to increase 8% to 9%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","As previously communicated, while input costs will be higher in 2012, we have good visibility into our fourth quarter input costs. As a result, price realization, improving volumes and strong productivity will result in full year adjusted gross margin expansion of 120 to 140 basis points. Additionally, we expect Brookside acquisition to be slightly accretive for the full year. Therefore, we now expect 200 -- 2012 earnings per share diluted growth of 14% to 15% or $3.22 to $3.25 per share.","As we look to 2013, we assume that the economic environment for retailers and consumers will continue to be challenging. However, we will continue to focus on our core brands and leverage Hershey's scale at retail in the U.S, as well as continued growth in key focus markets. The Brookside integration and capacity expansion is on track and ready for broader launch early next year.","Overall, we believe that the investments we're making will enable us to deliver predictable and consistent top line and earnings growth. Therefore, our current expectation for 2013 is for net sales growth to be within our 5% to 7% long-term target, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","We have solid productivity and cost-saving initiatives in place. And while early in the planning cycle, we do not expect input cost inflation in 2013. Therefore, we expect to achieve gross margin expansion in 2013 and growth and adjusted earnings per share diluted in the 8% to 10% range, consistent with our long-term target.","We will now open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Market.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to dig in a little bit on the thought about 2013, your long term guidance. Because when I look at -- and I'm kind of a broken record on this, but when I look at the trajectory of what costs have done and how strong the pricing has been and now with volume working a little bit better and obviously raising for Q4. Can you tell me, are there any explicit factors I'm missing as to why you wouldn't see more gross margin expansion in 2013? Because when you do the arithmetic, you get to a little bit more aggressive gross profit growth trajectory.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, Jonathan, this is Bert. I -- we haven't really given a range on gross margin expansion, and we typically wouldn't this time of year. We are signaling that we certainly expect gross margin expansion. And frankly, we think it'll be at a pretty good level. But I think we're going to maintain what we typically do is to give a lot more color around that and provide a range in January. But right now, I think what we're trying to provide in terms of some information or some color is the fact that it's not an inflationary year, which the last 2 years have been, and that we still have strong productivity coming through.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Great. And if I could just ask 1 follow-up. A competitive landscape, gaining some significant share here, does that maybe give you caution going into 2013? I mean, picking up 1.1 points a share this quarter is excellent. I mean, are you going to be able to sustain that? And how are you feeling in the marketplace in Halloween competitively?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Well, first of all, we feel good about Halloween. The programming that we would've expected to be out is all materialized. The early sell-through while it's not the whole season, we certainly are seeing sell-through. And as I said in my comments, we expect to grow share in Halloween once again. So from a Halloween standpoint, we feel as if we're very much on track. We've also had good results from our innovation that we've had. Most of ours has been in the second half of the year. You know that from a competitive standpoint, there was a lot of innovation early in the first quarter. And then we get off to the start of the year with good innovation as well. So we'll have Brookside, which we'll be expanding in the U.S. and we're very excited about that. As you know, we've had the manufacturing expansion project that doubles our capacity on Brookside as we go into 2013. And then we feel good about our overall new product pipeline. So it's always our goal to grow share, and we also feel -- the one thing I would just end on is we also feel good about the progress we're making in our conversion. As we said, we hope to be back to about 100% on volume growth somewhere around the first of the year, and all indications with sequential improvement each quarter would suggest that's going to happen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","As I look out to 2013, you mentioned the last couple of years were inflationary years, and we've seen the price increase go through in 2011 and 2012. For next year, I'm assuming the algorithm will change with less price growth and more volume growth. Could you maybe just talk about, of the 5% to 7% top line growth, roughly how much do you expect to mean maybe price and mix effects by trading consumers up to higher price products versus volume?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Well, I don't think we'll comment on exactly what we think the split will be. But we would hope that as we get into 2013, volume growth, of course, will be an important piece of the overall growth. And we continue to be on track for that to happen. We -- as Bert mentioned, as you think about gross margin, and we're not giving specific guidance, that we do believe if you look at the overall commodity complex with the exception of dairy, which there is no futures market on, we have good visibility and we would expect while there will be volatility, it will move more in a more modest range and probably more sideways than it has for a while. But we continue to believe that we're still in a longer-term bull market, but you might see a bit of moderation here for a while.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then just a quick follow-up. On the commodity cost outlook for 2013, how locked in are you for next year at this point? Obviously, I think you have longer-term forward looks on cocoa, but the dairy market is pretty volatile here. Can you just give us a sense for how confident you are that the other numbers will be pretty flat to down?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. Alexia, we don't provide specific hedging figures for competitive reasons, and obviously many of our competitors don't provide any information whatsoever. What I would say is, our K says we're normally in that 3- to 24-month range. The fact that we're already signaling that we're fairly confident around gross margin expansion is that we have reasonable coverage within the amount of information that we're able to provide. And you've seen that the commodities have seemed to level out a little bit. Cocoa is a little higher than it was recently, [indiscernible] sugar spot prices. And the spot price is obviously not indicative of how you might project this. But peanuts are a little better, sugar is a little better, dairy is the one that's going the other way based on higher corn. But overall, I would say even energy, the basket itself is a bit more stable to down. And we hope to -- we're expecting to benefit from that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. A couple of questions. In the measure channel data, it looks like extensions, Rolo Minis; Simple Pleasures, of which is not an extension but a brand; and then Jolly Ranchers varieties, those are doing great, something like a few points of growth in total from those. Air Delights doesn't seem to be lapping as well, which surprised me. Could you comment on the sources of innovation lift? Obviously, you can see more of your business than we can.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think your comments are correct, in that we feel really good about the -- those most recent innovations. I think with regard to Air Delight, we're still trying to work through our communication messages. We think the product's a terrific product. It's a form that does well in a number of different countries around the world. We do well with it in Brazil. And so, we're really working through what we think the messaging is. So I wouldn't say that it's something that we're not committed to because we're very committed to getting it figured out, but I think it's also different enough and new enough that it's going to continue to take some work for us. And -- so that would be my comment there. We feel really good about the emphasis we put on the breath freshener and non-chocolate business we have this year. As you mentioned, in non-chocolate, we're up about 9.2% versus a category up 3.5% in the most recent 12 weeks. And in breath fresher, about 20%, with the category up about 13% across xAOC. So those have worked really hard for us. And then we're very excited about what we have coming in 2013. So again, we've talked about our philosophy on innovation, and we want to make sure that we stick with these things, that we advertise in the second year and really look at them as long-term as possible. Churn is not really good for the category. And if we can have a stickier innovation, it's really better for everybody. And we feel good about the things that we've been doing over the last several years and certainly this most recent freshman class of innovation.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And a second question on Brookside in particular. It looks like ACV is 37% in measure channels and it was representing about 70 basis points of your sales in the last 12 weeks. I'm trying to think about how you are thinking about the potential lift of this product. It seems that it would be able to be doubled at least in distribution. And then maybe an advertising push or marketing push might get you even more. So 1 to 2 points of lift from that product. I mean, how are you thinking about what that can do for you in '13?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I really like the way you're thinking about it. And just to give you a sense of our own confidence competence as I said in my earlier comment, we have doubled our manufacturing capacity for the brand. We've -- it's been exceeding our expectations so far. And so we have, outside of Costco, really the U.S. expansion coming in 2013. And then, we're hopeful that this brand can play even broader than that, although we're taking it one step at a time, but we're very positive about the contribution Brookside will make.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit more detail about how you performed in C-stores in some states like California where retail gasoline costs were higher? I'm just curious to what degree you were hurt by that? Or maybe you even picked up some velocity by consumers filling up more often? Just curious how that went.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I'm not sure that I can add a lot of value on California specific. If you look at total CMG, the category in the 12 weeks was up about 4.3%. Hershey was up about 8.9%. We gained 1.3 share points in that time frame. And so we continue to hear very positive things from the C-store channel as we talk to operators. And so I would just say, Ken, that these guys are positive. I would anticipate that if gasoline -- we have pretty consistently said that we don't believe gasoline prices in our category have really negatively impacted how we've been doing. Now as we see that gas -- the price of oil is moderating and gasoline may come down a quarter or more. If we've been wrong about that all along, then I guess, we should get a nice tailwind from that. But -- so those would be my only real comments. But I feel good about the way we continue to perform. And more importantly, that channel feels good about the way they are performing.","Mark K. Pogharian","Yes, Ken, this is Mark. The only other thing I would add, J.P. mentioned that C-store CMG takeaway was up 4.3%, and that's with gum being a mid-single digit tailwind for the category. So that means chocolate, non-chocolate and mints in C-stores grew greater than the historical growth rate of 3% to 4%.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then one follow-up regarding gum there, Mark. Are you guys seeing anything -- there's been some innovation in the category, there's been some more focus from the branded leaders on value items. I realize gum isn't a huge deal for you, obviously, you'd rather it do better than worse. But are you seeing any signs of life in the category? Anything from the leaders that is giving you some hope there? Or is it just too early to tell?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, Ken. I don't think that we see anything different than the comments that probably all of us have batted around. It's a category that innovation is important. When there's innovation, there tends to be advertising. And those are the basic drivers within the category. And so if we begin to see something different there, then the expectation may be different.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Granger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just 2 questions on Asia. First, just wanted to get your latest thoughts on capacity utilization levels in the region and in China specifically, and how you might choose to address your capacity needs, whether you think that something you anticipate reaching a decision on during the next few quarters. And just to revisit the JV in India and your decision to buy out your partner's interest there. In the past, you talked about having some concerns about the quality of the brands and the pricing power that they had in the market. And I guess, just in the context of those prior comments, I just wanted to get your thoughts again on the benefits of bringing those brands into your overall portfolio.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, let me address Asia first. So we've made a long-term commitment to our Asia business, more importantly, China. The joint venture project that we have with Lotte and our factory outside of Shanghai is essentially fully utilized. And we continue to look at our Asia footprint for manufacturing. We were at a point where we need greater capacity to meet the needs of our domestic business. So where that plant has supplied product to some of the other Asian markets in addition to China, we'll probably think of that more as a China domestic plant, and then look at how we expand manufacturing under some combination of a new footprint. And there's several options that we're looking at there that could include additional manufacturing in China for China or in Southeast Asia. And as those things become clear to us, certainly we'll communicate what that is. In our India business, first of all, we simply feel good about being in control of our own destiny there. And we've commented on the background of that some. We have a portfolio there that doesn't really have any of the Hershey brands, with the exception of Hershey's Syrup, which does very, very well in the Indian market. And so we're in a couple of states in the south. We have a very basic sugar confectionery portfolio, with the exception of a couple of very interesting beverage brands, which we're optimistic about growing. And so what we're really focused on is building out our sales capability to broaden our footprint, bring what we feel are stronger brands -- Mahalacto is a good brand. And we believe that we can communicate some brand benefits behind that. And so, really distribution penetration in a broader geography, increasing our sales capability and then communicating with consumers around those brands, which we feel bring benefits, and then expanding the Hershey portfolio as appropriate in those markets is really what our plan is. I think India is a country for us where it's more of a journey than an event. And so that's really how we think about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolas.","Daniel Stephen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is Dan in for Chris. This is actually Dan for Chris. We were curious, do you expect heavy SG&A spending again next year? I mean, should we think about it at a rate much faster than sales growth?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. I think when we were last talking about that from a future perspective was back in June. And given our plans, particularly outside of the U.S., although to some degree in the U.S. as well, we think of SG&A as an investment area over the next couple of years, which would be a bit higher than what we're projecting for sales growth in that 5 to 7 range. The reason for that really are more in terms of sales capability and sales force expansion in markets such as China, continuing to do our market research and putting infrastructure on the ground as we expand the 5 global brands into more of the countries where we operate. So could be somewhat comparable to what we're seeing this year in terms of an annual rate. So I would say, yes, slightly above what we think of as sales growth. Let's say, in the next year or 2 -- when you look at the back half, I guess, of the 5-year plan that we talked about in June, we would expect about that point to be getting leverage out of SG&A.","Daniel Stephen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, is there anything unique in the phasing of the SG&A investment? I mean, is it going to support -- is it going to be lumpy at all? Or is it going to relatively even through the year?","Humberto P. Alfonso","This year, it was a bit lumpy, I would say, in terms of year-on-year growth, right? We started in the first quarter, it was single-digit, and then I think we were at about 10% to 12% for the last couple of quarters. And we expect it to be somewhere in that range in the fourth quarter. So I think you're going to see it be mostly even but there is some lumpiness, and you saw that this year in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to know a little more specifics on India and China. Can you tell me specifically what you're investing in for 2013 for China? And what kind of a step up could that deliver in terms of sales? Or do we really have to wait until '14 before the platform gets significantly bigger? And then secondly, as you talk to your U.S. retailers about global brands and your commitment behind these global brands, has that helped you gain distribution for hard candy items that may not have been emphasized as big as before?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, let me talk about China first, and then we'll talk a bit about the global brands and how that's worked for us. We're still very much in an invest mode in China on several fronts. So you may recall, in June, we talked about expanding our 5 global brands. Certainly in China, the expansion of our portfolio is very important. KISSES is a primary footprint -- or really a primary portfolio brand for us today, and so we'll be expanding that portfolio beginning in 2013. We're also increasing our sales capability and coverage as we put more feed on the street, and we're increasing our advertising across more cities than we've had before. So those are 3 pretty big fundamental investments that we'll continue to make in China. And then I think if you come back to one of Bert's comments earlier, we will -- if you look at our current 5-year plan and you start to look at the real leverage on these investments, it's really going to be more in the second half of that 5-year plan, although we expect strong net sales performance out of that kind of portfolio expansion. So while I don't want to project a specific number of category growth obviously across those key markets placed into that, but this is a market we want to win in and really grow our business, and so we're very dedicated to that. In terms of global brands, the one example that I would give you is, Walmart has a program in some of their different markets where they put in an American type portfolio in the stores. So brands like Reese's in Japan have benefited from that, part of our portfolio has benefited from that in Europe. And you see other retailers which have similar types of programs where they have U.S. sections and U.S. brands. Costco is certainly another brand that does that in some of their Asian markets as well. So where we have customers that -- retailers that we work well with here and they have some of those specific kinds of programs, our brands tend to benefit from that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask really quickly on advertising. You're on track this year to have grown advertising investment at nearly a 30% CAGR since 2006. This comes at a time when many staples companies are talking about opportunities to find efficiency savings to this line. So first, can you talk about the returns you're getting out of this investment? And second, do you believe you're close to a point where we could start to get some margin leverage on advertising spend going forward?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, first of all, let me just talk about that decision philosophically is, we believe that it's been very good for the category and certainly a key driver of why our category has maybe performed differently than some other areas in the store because it's supported [indiscernible] with strong in-store merchandising, it brings people into the stores. So we feel good about the philosophy that we've had about being a brand building company and being able to invest in those brands. And I also remember, in that number, we're expanding advertising across a broader part of our portfolio and in markets that we've never made advertising investments before. So there's a lot of different parts to that. The other comment I would make is, we are very rigorous about measuring the ROI of our advertising. We have sophisticated models that help us understand lift and certainly isolate that. We wouldn't continue to be advertising the way we are if we didn't think we were getting a good return on investment. And then because of the level of investment we're making in the category, we're actually getting a higher GRP delivery versus the actual dollars that we're investing. So there's also efficiencies beyond the dollars that you see. Our actual GR delivery rates are higher actually even than the spend, so that's another way to think about the leverage that we're getting off of that advertising.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate the philosophy. I appreciate it quite a bit. It's a healthy sort of investment. But it must come with some degree of diminishing returns as you continue to ramp it. Is there a point where you say, \"Enough is enough. We've kind of reached a steady-state.\" And are you close to that point?","John P. Bilbrey","Well on some brands -- so think of it as an S-curve and there's a point in that S-curve by which you move from growth levels to maintenance levels and then a point where the variable spend wouldn't be very efficient. So we're just continuously reviewing what is the right point along that curve. And then also remember that we've introduced innovation around our core brand -- innovation, a lot of that has been around core brand. So you also get a halo effect, you get a benefficient -- an efficient use of being able to move that advertising from purely core into some of the innovation and also try to tweak the investment that way. There's a point by which the advertising doesn't have an effective return. We certainly don't feel as though that we've reached that point. And I'll reassure you that we're quite rigorous in making sure that we don't waste a single dollar.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I may have missed it, but can you just talk about why your SMA was actually lower than your expectations? Was it -- did it have to do with any investments internationally? And have you -- you have your international investments in lower or higher than your initial expectations? Just if you could just address those 2 issues.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. Ken, I think overall, it was a bit of timing between the quarters, and so we're focused on completing some of that work in the fourth quarter. And it's a mix of U.S. and international. So it's not really more pronounced in one or the other. There continues to be sales force expansion, and that is primarily an international focus. But market research around product launches and some of the work that we're doing around advertising new brands, those are the primary areas. And so while we thought we'd be a bit higher in the third quarter, we think some of that sort of levels off in the fourth. So it's not really, to be honest, focused in 1 market versus another, other than, again, with that caveat of sales force expansions primarily outside of the U.S.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So just to be clear, your rate of investment internationally has not changed in any way? And there's nothing that gives you any evidence that you should be slowing or increasing or -- your commitment to international has not waned at all.","Humberto P. Alfonso","No, I would say that -- I actually said that while the rate itself of investments are higher just given the different base outside of the U.S., the planned investments and how we're thinking about it in terms of completing this year and working on the things that will help us to grow next year aren't really different.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I know that M&A particularly on the international side is a high priority for use of cash. It has been for a while. And I know your midterm international goals in terms of the sales that you're looking for would certainly require some activity in that level or in the M&A side over the next couple of years. So I'm just curious, any change there that you're seeing in either the pipeline that's out there? Or availability of potential assets? Or changes in multiples, that change of thinking there? Really just trying to get a sense if anything's changed there since we haven't talked much about that today.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. Andrew, I don't know that there's been a significant change. We continue to have discussions around M&A opportunities in the areas that we've discussed in the past, local brand, good sales force capability and distribution and those types of things. I would say that the multiples are not that different. They continue to be higher in Asia than you would find in other markets for the obvious reasons, expectations around higher growth rates. We're -- continue to focus on the use of cash in the M&A space. We don't include it in the model. And then we've kind of -- I guess, given some feel for the size of it in the -- on our aspiration of a $10 billion number that we put out there. But I would say it's steady as she goes. We're hopeful that we can make M&A part of our value creating formula, and that's the way we think about it.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just a quick follow-up. Just maybe sort of an update on just how the sort of the joint venture,  if you will, that you've got with Ferrero around some of the distribution and warehousing and things. And just how has that played out? Has it delivered on kind of what your sort of hopes had been? And to the extent that there's some other opportunity along those lines, would this I guess experience suggest that there's more that can be done, whether with that player or other ones down the line?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, I would say that it's progressing well. We talked about the development of a distribution center in Canada. We're executing against -- both parties are pleased with the progress we've made in terms of carrying the product together, and we're realizing the savings that we thought we would. It's logistics-based. I agree with you that those are the types of opportunities that we think are available to us in other markets. As you said, whether it's with Ferrero or someone else, these sort of pre-competitive collaborative arrangements that save money for both parties, I think we'll -- you'll see more of that in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'd like to start off with the -- going back to Brookside a little bit. Can you -- and I think you mentioned this earlier but I missed it, the timing of the new lines that you're adding, when do they come on stream?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, Dave, we're building inventories now in anticipation of our launch in the U.S. That's still enabling us to meet what is a growing existing business. And in early Q1 is when that will really be up and running at capacity. So that's why we have the U.S. launch happening in the first quarter because we will have the ability then to feed demand behind that expansion and distribution build.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Will you have the full slate of the Brookside product lineup included in the \"first quarter launch?\"","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, the line as it exists today will certainly be fully available. And we're always looking at what the total portfolio for Brookside could be.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just continuing on this. The current Brookside in the United States is mostly in Costco, and so the incremental focus would be getting all the other food classes of trade -- I think that's the primary focus of it. How does C-store and other classes of trade fit in with Brookside?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, the initial launch would be focused on the channels that you described, but we believe Brookside, especially because of its hand-to-mouth usage, has a place in C-store. And we're evaluating what those packages ought to look like.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And final question, is this a mix positive product for the portfolio?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, Brookside is a very attractive product for us from a gross margin standpoint.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on the volume trends or the volume trajectory for your base business. So if you look at volume growth in excluding new products, in excluding acquisitions in the U.S., it looks like it's improved a bit sequentially. If you could just give us a little bit of color in terms of where it stands now relative to kind of where your expectations were related to just elasticity taking a lot of pricing in the last 1.5 years? And how do you feel about the volume -- kind of where volumes have recovered relative to the pricing you've taken? And  then if you look into, I guess, 2013, part of the model is going to depend upon that volume improving, just what gives you the confidence that, that occurs in '13?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, I would tell you that we're about where we thought we would be. And I use the word about, this is not a perfect science. So as we would look over this whole timeframe since we took the pricing, I really emphasize what we've said all along that we think by the end of 2012, we'll have achieved conversion to volume. And so we've seen some quarters where versus the model that might be up or down slightly. But actually, we feel pretty good about where it's at. It was up in this most recent quarter, so we feel good about that. And we think it will continue in 4Q to where ultimately we're predicting it to be. You saw that in the mix numbers across the total business. And our core brands really are tracking again about where we thought it would be. So we don't feel any differently than what we've been communicating.","Operator","Okay, there are no further...","Mark K. Pogharian","I guess -- thank you for joining us for today's conference call.

My name is Keith, and I'll be your conference operator today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","This call is scheduled to end at about 9:30 AM, so please limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many of you as possible. Please note this call may be recorded. Thank you.","Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's fourth quarter 2016 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; Michele Buck, Chief Operating Officer; and Patricia Little, CFO will provide you with an overview of results which will then be followed by a Q&A session.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC.","If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income, prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believe the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss fourth quarter results excluding net pre-tax charges of $148.9 million, or $0.62 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses. These charges defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P.","John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.","Thanks, Mark. Good morning to all of you on the phone and the webcast. And I apologize for my voice, as I'm fighting a head and chest cold.","In 2016, we made progress against our strategic plans that strengthened our business model and positions the company for future growth. Our productivity and cost savings initiatives drove EBIT margin expansion in full year EPS growth of 7%, the midpoint of our long-term target. And we continue to generate solid operating cash flow, about $1 billion in 2016, which gives us a lot of financial flexibility.","Looking at marketplace performance, our core U.S., CMG and snacks business progressed as we anticipated. Retail takeaway and market share performance in the second half of the year was better than the first half of the year, which was impacted by shorter Easter and merchandising and display strategies at select customers. This resulted in full-year snacking market share growth of about 10 basis points.","We also began a strategic review of our global cost structure that should result in solid margin expansion and EPS growth. We look forward to talking about our business in these plans in more details on the March 1 at our investor update.","Let me now provide you with some detail on our fourth quarter results. Net sales and marketplace performance, both retail takeaway and market share, were relatively in line with expectations. Operating income and earnings per share diluted exceeded our forecast, driven by the early implementation of some cost savings efficiencies and a lower-than-expected tax rate. Patricia will provide you with more details on this in just a bit.","As we anticipated, U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improved. Total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended December 31, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels increased 2.2%. This represents all Hershey snack products sold at retail such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave and snack bars.","Importantly, Hershey's U.S. CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, retail takeaway increased more than three times the rate of the category, driven by chocolate and was up 1.9%. Our fourth quarter U.S. chocolate performance was solid with retail takeaway up 2.9%, resulting in a chocolate market share gain of 0.9 points.","Despite the slow start to 2016, we gained 0.4 points of chocolate market share for the full year. Our brands responded positively to the investments we discussed in July and October. Reese's, our biggest brand, continued to gain momentum driven by variety, news, core two-cup advertising and in-store merchandising and display. The Reese's Pieces Cup innovation, NCAA football, in-store merchandising and strong Halloween and holiday performance generated retail takeaway of 7.2% this quarter. Results were similar to last quarter and impressive, given that this is nearly a $2 billion brand at retail.","In 2017, we'll look to expand and improve upon our NCAA basketball and football relationship via innovation and targeted 360-degree activation programs given the customizable promotional entitlements available to us with this sponsorship.","We were also pleased with the Kit Kat franchise. Fourth quarter and full year retail takeaway of 5.5% was about the same for both periods, driven by the success of the Big Kat new product launch, as well as the core Kit Kat instant consumable item that benefited from TV and digital marketing programs such as Chance the Rapper and Kit Kat thief.","In 2017, we'll continue to bring variety and news to the brand with limited edition red velvet flavor for Valentine's Day. The wafer sticks are not red like the classic southern cake, but the candy itself is red velvet flavored and coated in white cream.","In the first half of 2016, The Hershey mega brand campaign didn't work as hard for us as we anticipated. However, in the second half of the year, results improved driven by Olympics, S'mores and seasonal programming. In the fourth quarter, Hershey's franchise retail takeaway increased low single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. The launch of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch is underway, and we believe this will reenergize the brand.","While early results are encouraging, distribution continues to build and advertising is scheduled to begin in early February. As we previously have mentioned, our consumer demand for multi-textural eating experiences across various snacking occasions is increasing, and this product fills a white space opportunity. You'll see additional innovation in the marketplace this year that also delivers on a textural experience in Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup and Hershey's and Reese's Crunchers.","Our consumer research has indicated that millennials want new flavors and textures, especially the Reese's consumers. Reese's is the fastest growing largest instant consumable franchise, so we do a lot of work here trying to bring the right level of investment to the core two-cup and variety news to the brand. In 2017, we'll launch Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup in an instant consumable pack type.","Within the cup are cookie bits versus a solid cookie, which consumers told us was less intrusive in terms of texture. The result is a product that delivers on all the sensations consumers want: smooth, creamy, sweet and crunchy. And the Crunchers product line is targeted for that shareable snacking hand-to-mouth occasion, leveraging the appeal of sweet and texturally complex snacking. These light, crispy and crunchy combinations are a perfect bite-sized snack for a different and unique eating experience. So, we're making progress, but there's still a lot of work to do.","We're not satisfied with our non-chocolate candy. In Brookside performance, the work is underway to improve their trends. Although it will be a multi-step process, we continue to believe that candy, mint and gum is an attractive category capable of solid growth over the long-term, when supported with the right mix of customer and consumer marketing.","Now for an update on our international markets, where fourth quarter net sales growth was relatively in line with our expectations and up about 3% on a constant currency basis versus last year. I was particularly pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where we generated solid constant currency net sales growth.","In Brazil, our growth was fueled by distribution gains in core brands and the continued rollout of the Hershey's Special Milk and Hershey's Special Dark bars, which was launched in Q3. As a result, in Q4, market share increased 0.5 points. And in our Mexican business, chocolates, spicy sugar, confectionery and drinks are tracking relatively in line with our initial plans.","Our marketplace performance improved in the fourth quarter, with chocolate retail takeaway up about 9.5%. And our traditional trade initiative with Sigma is progressing, and we're gaining chocolate momentum driven by Kisses.","Net sales in India, driven by the brands we're investing behind, Hershey's branded syrup, spreads and milk booster, as well as JOLLY RANCHER and Sofit, increased about 25%. Late in the fourth quarter, we launched Brookside, primarily in the modern trade where we don't expect much of an impact from demonetization. While small, this launch gives us exposure to a value-added segment with above average margins for the India business.","In China, the modern trade hypermarket environment continues to be challenging across many categories. In Q4, China chocolate category sales declined about 4%, the same rate as the second and third quarter declines. Our Q4 net sales in China declined about 11% on constant currency basis, slightly lower than our estimate. Sell-in related to Chinese New Year drove Q4 net sales, and advertising and in-store programming occurred just as we had planned. Our e-commerce business continues to progress, and our market share here is estimated to be greater than our share in brick and mortar.","Now, I'd like to pause briefly here to just say thank you. It's been an honor to lead The Hershey Company and these quarterly conference calls as Chairman and CEO. I'm so proud of our company and what we've accomplished. I've always appreciated the questions and feedback we've received on these conference calls, and in all of the various meetings that we've participated in with you. I've shared many of your thought-provoking questions and insights with my team, and I feel it's made me a better leader and Hershey a better company, so I say thank you.","And now, I'm proud to turn the call over to Michele Buck. As we announced in December, Michele will become Hershey's 12th CEO on March 1, and I'm pleased to be staying on as Chairman. I know that many of you have met Michele and know her, and agree that she's an experienced executive with excellent operating, marketing and strategic capabilities.","Now, let me turn the balance of the call over to Michele.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thanks, J.P. I am very honored that on March 1 I will become the next CEO of The Hershey Company.","As you know, Hershey is a special company with great brands, people, capabilities and processes. Combined, these attributes make up a business that over the long-term has delivered sustained results and will continue to do so going forward. We've a team of remarkable employees who come to work every day with a sense of purpose, fostered by our Founder, whose values and legacy are still part of our culture. This has served the company well and resulted in solid financial and marketplace returns.","I want to say a special thank you to all of our colleagues across the business, many of whom listen in to this call. I believe it's their passion and dedication, along with our strong brands, advantaged retail sales presence and supply chain capabilities that will contribute to our further success.","I was pleased with the progression of our business in 2016. After a challenging start to the year, we did not lose focus. We executed against our plan, and we gained momentum as the year progressed. As we look to 2017, I'm excited about our innovation, our activation plans for Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch and the investments we're making in expanding the Reese's franchise. The targeted and precision-based approach we've taken to growing Reese's with the Crunchy Cookie Cup and into the hand-to-mouth snacking area via the Crunchers product line will provide incremental growth to our business.","I'm also pleased with our balanced approach to marketing mix as it relates to trade and advertising. We're continuously improving analytics to enable us to further optimize investments within these two areas, and we'll see some of the benefits of this in 2017.","As we've mentioned before, we started to take a fresh look at our business operations and our investment choices in 2016, and we'll share more about this in March. The goal of these margins for growth efforts is to improve overall margins, particularly in our international and other segment. We expect that this will be a multi-year program, enabling us to achieve strong margin and EPS growth in 2018 and 2019, and provide us with the fuel to deliver consistent annual net sales and EPS growth post implementation.","The impact and benefits related to these efficiencies in 2017 is modest, given that we accelerated some of the non-restructure related work into Q4. This enabled us to deliver additional operating income growth and margin expansion earlier than planned, resulting in full-year EBIT margin of 20.4%, about 30 to 40 basis points greater than what we had anticipated.","We're focused on EBIT margin expansion and expect that it will expand again in 2017, although the gain may not be as great as it was in 2016 as a portion of the savings are being reinvested back into the business. We believe the investments we're making this year are in areas of the business that set us up for continued growth over the long-term.","Investments are underway in IT capabilities and additional analytic approaches that will enable operational effectiveness and efficiency, and be a differentiator in the marketplace over the next few years.","I'm also excited about the concepts we're testing related to the commercialization of our integrated demand landscape. I look forward to discussing all of this and our long-term vision with you on March 1.","I want to underscore my optimism about Hershey's future. We have many opportunities to leverage our globally recognized brands, our capabilities and our U.S. scale. I couldn't be more excited to lead Hershey into the future. I look forward to continuing to work with all of you, as we focus on building value for all Hershey's stakeholders.","I'll now turn it over to Patricia who will provide you with details on our financial results.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Michele. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast.","Fourth quarter net sales of $1.97 billion increased 3.2%, in line with our forecast. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.17, an increase of 8.3% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to savings from our continued focus on our cost structure and 110-basis-point decline in the adjusted tax rate.","Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 50 basis points, net sales increased 3.7%. Net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates at a 60-basis-point headwind, primarily due to higher levels of trade and merchandising activity related to our core and seasonal businesses as well as new products. Volume was up 3.4 points, driven by our performance in the U.S. Acquisitions were a 90-basis-point benefit due to barkTHINS, which we acquired in second quarter.","By segment, fourth quarter North America net sales increased 3.8%, driven by a 4.1-point contribution from volume. Acquisitions were a 1-point benefit, and net price realization a 1.3-point headwind due to planned higher levels of direct trade supporting increased in-store merchandising and display activity, new products and seasons. Our U.S. seasonal business was relatively in line with our expectations with Halloween and holiday market share up 30 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively.","Turning to the international and other segment, excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 3.2 points, net sales increased 2.7%. Volume was off 10 basis points, as solid Latin America, India and select export market performance was offset by lower sales in China. Net price realization was a 2.8-point benefit, as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were lower.","Turning to margins, adjusted gross margin declined by 50 basis points in the fourth quarter, as productivity and cost savings were offset by unfavorable manufacturing variances, the aforementioned unfavorable trade rate and slightly higher supply chain costs driven by initial year absorption of overhead related to the Malaysia manufacturing facility.","For the full year, adjusted gross margin declined about 40 basis points, relatively in line with our original plan. We have good visibility into our 2017 input cost basket and don't expect inflation. Additionally, we have productivity and cost savings initiatives in place that should enable adjusted gross margin expansion of about 15 to 25 basis points in 2017.","Adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter declined half a point. As expected, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased in the fourth quarter of 2016. Selling, marketing and administrative, or SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing increased 6.6% in the quarter, driven by higher employee-related costs and increased depreciation and amortization. Note that this includes SM&A related to the barkTHINS acquisition.","Unallocated corporate expense increased 11%, or $12.6 million, as efficiency and cost savings initiatives were offset by higher employee-related costs and an increase in corporate depreciation and amortization. As we've stated throughout most of 2016, we're focused on our cost structure. We're instilling an ROI mentality to ensure that every dollar we spend works as hard for us as it can.","As a result, in the fourth quarter, we generated about $20 million in efficiency savings related to the margin for growth initiative. This enabled us to partially offset higher levels of trade, benefits inflation and other employee-related expenses, as well as manufacturing variances in overhead. As a result, full-year adjusted EBIT margin expanded 40 basis points to 20.4%.","Now, let me provide a brief update on our international and other segment. As J.P. stated, we're executing against our plans in the key markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India. Constant currency net sales in Mexico, Brazil and India increased nicely. Adding to his commentary on China, overall CPG performance in the modern trade is not where we thought it would be.","As a result, many categories were sluggish, including chocolate where the category declined about 7% for the full year. As expected, our China gross sales declined in the fourth quarter. Given the soft retail takeaway in the quarter, net sales were slightly off versus our previous forecast. While our Chinese New Year sell-in was good, we'll have to wait until sell-through data is available to determine our net seasonal results.","For the full year, excluding China, international and other segment operating profit increased nicely, and I'm pleased with the progression. As we mentioned last quarter, as we look ahead we're committed to profitability in this segment.","Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $23.4 million increased $4.2 million versus last year. For the full year, interest expense was $90.1 million and in line with our estimate. In 2017, interest expense is expected to be in the $95 million to $100 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.2%. The decline was due to the mix of fourth quarter international operating results and increased favorable tax credits and other incentives, including research and development. The full year tax rate of 31.3% was about 90 basis points less than our expectation of about 32.2%.","In 2017, the company anticipates its effective tax rate will be between 28.5% and 29%. The reduction versus 2016 is driven by favorable international taxes, investment tax credits and other incentives as well as a 75-basis-point benefit to the tax rate from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments.","The fourth quarter other income and expense amount of $7.5 million was primarily driven by investment tax credits. In 2017, we'll continue with this strategy and estimate that the investment tax credit expense will be in the $45 million to $50 million range.","For the fourth quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 213.9 million shares, down 4.6 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.17 or an increase of about 8.3% versus a year ago.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the fourth quarter, net trading capital declined by $71 million, accounts receivable was lower by $17.7 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $5.3 million and accounts payable increased by $48.3 million.","Total capital additions, including software for the fourth quarter and full year, were $101 million and $269.5 million respectively. For the full-year 2017, we estimate the CapEx will be in the $270 million to $290 million range. Total adjusted depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter and full year was $67.3 million and $253.3 million, respectively. Dividends paid in the fourth quarter were $127.8 million.","In the fourth quarter, the company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In the fourth quarter, the company repurchased $140 million of common shares in connection with the exercise of stock options. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $297 million versus year ago at $347 million.","Now to summarize. Work related to the margin for growth program is progressing. As mentioned early, fourth quarter implementation of certain efficiency initiatives related to this work enabled us to exceed our profitability targets in 2016. Note that this is a multi-year program designed to improve overall operating profit margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses.","However, the impact in benefits related to these efficiency initiatives and included in our 2017 guidance is modest as greater levels of savings and margin expansion is anticipated in 2018 and 2019. As J.P. and Michele summarized, in 2017 we have a lot of innovation, variety and seasonal plans in place. We'll benefit from a longer Easter and have good visibility into these orders.","Additionally, Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch is off to a good start. We continue to refine our marketing mix modeling and expect advertising and related consumer marketing expense to increase in 2017. And as Michele outlined, we're also making investments in other parts of our business.","As a result, for the full-year 2017, we expect net sales to increase around 2% to 3%, including a benefit from acquisitions of about 50 basis points and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of about 25 basis points. As I stated earlier, we expect adjusted gross margin expansion of 15 to 25 basis points and the tax rate is expected to be lower than last year. As a result, our expectation is for 2017 adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase around 7% to 9% and be in the $4.72 to $4.81 range.","Thank for your time this morning, and we'll now take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And congratulations to you, Michele, and all of the best to you, J.P.","John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.","Thank you.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, I guess maybe just one question, related to the operating leverage, I guess, in 2017. Can you maybe talk about in terms of gross margins with inflation being basically non-existent or commodity inflation being pretty benign this year, why there isn't more maybe gross margin leverage in this year? Is it trade spend or is there something else happening that's kind of holding back more a growth margin expansion in 2017?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Patricia, why don't you take that one?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so as we said, we see commodity inflation is relatively benign as you said. Yes, we are continuing to invest behind our brand, our innovation, our seasonal activation. And so, we have pretty good visibility into our gross margin. We're also very focused as being a gross margin company. And I'm pleased that given the investments we're making in the brands that we do have leverage on that line.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And, I guess, just as a follow-up. As we're thinking about your marketing spend or your investment this year, some of it happens at the sales line, and some of it's happening within marketing. Is that part of the way we should think about it?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yes. I absolutely think about it that way. A lot of the work that we've been doing this year, and will continue into 2017, is really getting the balance of those different kinds of spend right. We have good capability improvements in both of those to make sure that we're putting the right \u2013 and Michele talked about this, the marketing mix model as well as some revenue management improvements in our capabilities to look at the way we spend our trade promotion.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, everybody, and congratulations J.P., and best of luck, Michele.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thank you very much.","John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Quick question on EBIT margin expansion, or the outlook for 2017. I think, Michele, you said you expect some EBIT margin expansion, though, not necessarily at the rate that we saw in 2016. And, I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of whether that's a shift at all in thinking, maybe relative to last quarter. I think on the third quarter call, company was talking about top quartile performance on the top line, and I think from a profitability standpoint.","And I guess, now \u2013 so it struck me maybe that you didn't necessarily view 2017 as a reinvestment year per se. And now it does sound like maybe you've got, Michele, some specific or discrete things that you want to reinvest in. So, I'm trying to get a sense of is that a little bit of a shift or maybe I'm reading that wrong. And if so, what are really those key items where some of that reinvestment has got to come into play?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure. So I'll take that first, and then if Patricia has anything she wants to add. As we think about our financial goals, clearly we want to be in the top quartile from a net sales perspective, net sales growth amongst the S&P food group. We're very proud of our EBIT margin, around 20%, certainly one of the highest out there. We want to continue to grow that. So, we want to be in the top quartile relative to EBIT margin.","John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.","That's absolute.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","The absolute, not the gross. So, we've some work to do, as others have focused on their EBIT margins to expand that and to get even more a higher rate there.","As we think about the business versus Q3 when we spoke to you, I guess I'd say two things. First of all, probably the biggest change is, we really got an accelerated delivery of margin expansion. So, we had started a real focus on margin expansion across the company. And hey, our organization over-delivered versus our expectations. So, some of the margin expansion we expected we'd get in 2017, we actually got in 2016.","Then on top of that, there are several areas that we do want to invest and are investing for future growth. One of the biggest areas is around technology in the new ERP system and enterprise connectivity, which we'll talk to you more about in March, as well as some marketing related expenses around the demand landscape, packaging, et cetera that you'll see in the marketplace.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you. See you in March.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Okay.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody, and congratulations to J.P., and looking forward to working with you, Michele. So, can I ask about the outlook for commodity costs? We've obviously seen the cocoa price on the CME come down fairly substantially over the last several months. Is that going to benefit you in the near term, or are you hedged out for a couple of years as I think you've typically been in the past? How are you thinking about the commodity cost outlook at this point?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, Alexia, if you look at us, we've got a pretty big cost basket of inputs, and certainly every year some are up and some are down. Definitely, we've seen cocoa prices come down. And the real goal of our commodity hedging program is to make sure that we don't have a lot of volatility in those input costs, because that makes it easier for us to manage. And I think that we stated before, we typically have between 3 months and 24 months of coverage for various raw materials. And so, drops that you see right now don't necessarily translate into the current year P&L.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And next we'll go to David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you, and good morning. And congratulations, Michele and J.P. Really appreciate everything over the years, and certainly with your role going forward, we hope to still continue to get to talk to you.","I'd like to ask Patricia about the tax question, the tax rate. So, there is a lot of questions on this from clients this morning. And Patricia, is it just fair to say that the old guidance used to be like an ongoing rate of like 33%, and that's what we were modeling. So then the differential to, say, the top end of 29%, your guidance, looks really big. It's like a 400-basis-point delta. But on this other line, that's where you purchase those tax credits, and it's a significant $50 million expense I think you said in your script. But I think it's correct that you got to net these two things together to really understand what's going on, on taxation for the company. Did I state those things correctly? And can you maybe give any clarity where I've made a mistake?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Thanks for the question, David. Let me start by just saying that in total on taxes, yes, you're right, the investment tax credits that we've been purchasing for the last couple of years are a driver of our tax improvement, one of the drivers. We have other drivers as well. We continue, as we said, to be very focused on our international operations, improving those. So the mix of international is part of it as well, plus we are doing a good job, I think, of taking advantage of our R&D investments that we're making, things like the new ERP system that Michele answered.","So, we have a number of things that we've been focused on in tax, and we're also making sure that the changes that we make are sustainable, and not highly volatile to our tax rate.","And, Mark, did you want to clarify anything on the...?","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, David, you're right. The other income and expense related to the investment tax credit is there. It's about the same amount in 2017 versus 2016, give or take. And that got you down to that 33-ish, 32-ish range on the tax rate. Some of the other initiatives Patricia talked to, as well as making sure we take advantage of all our legal entity structure is what drives it to where it is now, and that we think you can use going forward.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","One follow-up for me. You guys have mentioned these efficiency initiatives, and then previously you had upgraded, I think you call it the CIP program, your cost savings, continuous improvement program. Can you just give us a rundown of where these numbers stand for what's in your 2017 guidance right now? I think it wasn't so clear. We know they're positive, but can you just run us through the savings that you actually expect to realize in 2017?","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. I mean, what we've said to-date, Dave, and we'll obviously give more color on March 1 on this margin for growth program. Our normal productivity program was $50 million to $70 million, and we upped that to about $100 million a year for 2017 through 2019. I think Patricia had mentioned there was about $15 million or $20 million in the fourth quarter we got around this margin for growth program. It'll be probably around that same range around there for 2017, and then we'll provide you with some broader ranges and outlook as it relates to 2018 and 2019 on March 1.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","But the correct characterization is that the $20 million of efficiency that shows up in 2017, it's just a very small part of this much bigger efficiency program that you will reveal to us in March, is that fair?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yes.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","And to be clear, the $20 million was in the fourth quarter. So, we were calling out the pull-ahead that Michele referenced earlier.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much. I'll pass it along.","Operator","And our next question is from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, there. Thank you, and congratulations to everybody. When I was thinking about 2017, one of the bigger savings that I had assumed was in China, because I thought that China's overhead expenses had been built up under the assumption that it was going to be a much bigger business in terms of sales. And it's obviously \u2013 the expectations are much different now. So, can you focus a little bit more on what to expect for your overhead and spending in China in 2017? Is there an opportunity in 2017 to reduce that overhead, or is it really 2018 and 2019 when that would happen? Thanks.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure. So, we're going to talk more about that in a lot more detail in March. Certainly, we're focused on profitability there. There are certain measures we can take to increase profitability as we go. There are others that take a bit more time. But we'll get into a lot more details on that in March. But it is a focus, for sure.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I'll pass it along.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks. And J.P., congratulations, and Michele, look forward to a great run. One question with a couple of parts. I think looking at the gross margin for 2017, there's a couple of pieces, right? You got manufacturing leverage, and you got costs. Now, on the latter, obviously, cocoa prices have declined somewhat precipitously in the fall. You've given any color you can give us about what that means for the P&L, how that typically flows through. And maybe if you don't want to give numbers, fine, but you'll give us a sense of how far you're typically hedged, and how you'd expect to move like that to kind of roll through in any offsets.","And on the first part of it, I guess, I would think Cookie Layer Crunch is a positive price mix. And I would think doing more North America than international is also a positive, I say, I mean, gross margin mix. I would think Cookie Layer Crunch is a positive gross margin mix. So, I guess, I'm struggling a little bit. If you're going to grow volume in 2017, is it just that you're going to promote away what would apparently be gross margin lift? Thank you very much.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, I'll address the first part of the question first. And relative to cocoa, as I mentioned before, we typically hedge 3 months to 24 months out. And so, the cocoa prices aren't going to directly relate what's happening in the cocoa market with the current P&L. So, that's really a longer term impact.","Relative to mix, certainly you're right that North America has strong margins. Cookie Layer Crunch we feel good about. We also have some investments we're making in expanding the portfolio to participate more broadly in other snacking occasions, things like Krave and some other snack initiatives that are lower margin than the core very high margins we have in the core confectionery business. And we continue to believe that those are important investments to drive growth for us into the future.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Got you. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, and congratulations J.P. and Michele. First, a question on the Hershey Cookie Layer Crunch. You said it was having encouraging early results. In the scanner data, it looks like the sales mix was maybe less than 50 basis points in the fourth quarter, but it's been building to over 1% in recent weeks. Do you see that ramping more quickly as the advertising hits? And where do you think distribution can build to from here? And I have a follow-up.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, yes, I would say, we haven't begun advertising. Advertising is just starting. And so, I would expect that we will see another lift in velocity as we go on air. We did have a strong push as we went into distribution to get merchandising on the floor, to attract consumers to the proposition, but I would expect that we'll see another lift with advertising. And I would expect we're going to have pretty broad distribution. We have a strong focus on getting broad distribution as quickly as we could. But I think if you look at many of our new product launches, I would expect that we'll get to 80%-ish kind of distribution on this one, as we have with most others.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","If I were to have a second question, it's about the Reese's brand. You've kind of kept it simple over the years, and advertised a lot against that brand. And it's perhaps your best power brand and it feels like if there is a way to describe 2017 other than the snackfection and with different mouth feels and different constructs, it could be the year of Reese's, because you have the Reese's Pieces Cups, Reese's Crunchers, Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup. It seems like the year of the Reese's extension. Is that fair? And do you think that this could be something that you could push on a multi-year basis?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, first of all, I would agree with what you're saying on Reese. Given that it is our largest $2 billion-ish type of brand, any lift we get on that brand obviously is very meaningful for our P&L. Strong profitability. We feel really good about the lineup of activity we have on Reese. We also feel good that we have done a lot of work to optimize how we're spending our marketing dollars, and we're seeing a lot of benefit from that on the base.","I would also say, though, I look at 2017 as a strong year for Hershey, with the focus that we have against that. We always focus on driving our core. So, those big brands with high profit margins critically important for us to deliver the year, Hershey, Reese, Kit Kat, et cetera.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, this is Josh Levine on for Ken. Thanks for the question. Just a quick question. I may have missed this. But just on the Cookie Layer Crunch and Crunchers innovations, have you mentioned how much you expect they sort of be pipeline filled this year versus the replenishment?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","No, we haven't talked about that. I don't think that we usually typically go into that. I mean, if you think about the Cookie Layer Crunch, we obviously got off to a strong start in Q4. So, if you look at even the results of takeaway, you can assume that there was a lot of pipeline for Cookie Layer Crunch that came in Q4, and Crunchers is all coming this year because we had no distribution last year.","John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. I mean, we give the volume breakout in North America Josh. So, if you were to look at North America, the volume and subtracted the takeaway, I mean, it's not perfect math, but it would get you to how we thought about it in the fourth quarter in December. Right in line with what we thought.","Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And just to make sure, I mean, are there any other pipeline fill comps that we should be sort of thinking about as we look at modeling the volume cadence for this year? Thanks.","John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.","So, as we've talked, the first quarter should really drive a lot of the growth. I think if you look at the sales, first half, second half will be quasi similar, although the first half will be driven by the first quarter. We had a lot of, I'll call it, productivity and cost savings in the second half of 2016. So, again, if you were to think of EPS growth probably more first half, first quarter driven.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","The other thing you might think about is, because of the way Easter is structured this year, the difference between takeaway and sales, last year with the Easter being earlier there was a disconnect there. You'll see the reverse of that this year.","Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very much.","Operator","And we can take next David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks for taking the follow up. I wanted to ask J.P. and Michele, J.P. you've commented so much on this in the past about the competition in the grocery store and in the perimeter in getting display, and I feel like the characterization last year, I mean, it was so tough, in the first year it was so tough, and now things just feel so much better. Could you just give us some color as to kind of what's changed? I know you put in a little bit more promotion to get more space. But can you just give us more color here on things, because it really feels different today. And I'd like to hear your perspective, and Michele, your perspective on how things have changed. And then is this something that we can feel good about as sustainable that the sales growth in North America and the United States, in particular, is not going to be under as much pressure as we saw, say, back, I remember end of 2015 and beginning of 2016, it was just so tough. Thank you.","John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.","Hey, David, I'll give you a macro comment and then Michele can follow up if she wants. I was at FMI last week. And one of the things that seemed to be pretty broad based across a number of retailers, and as I was hearing comments across manufacturers is that people were optimistic in terms of their plans, and I felt as though people were looking to really invest in their business from a merchandising standpoint and promotion.","I'm really speaking about retailers as they were talking to us as well as others. And so, I felt really good that people really wanted to go out and execute against good plans. It didn't feel quite as conservative, I would say, as it did the previous year. So, I just took that as a fairly optimistic tone that people see their destiny as in their hands, and they're going to go execute against their business.","And I don't know, Michele, if you want to add to that?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. I'll add two things. I mean, you specifically asked about merchandising as one part of the question, and I would say, there were some big retailers that implemented cleaner floor policies, and it really took us through mid-last year into Q3 to kind of lap that. And I think once we did we started to see similar momentum there. And I'd also say the other thing I'm encouraged by is, where there has been strong activity in certain categories or with certain brands, there have been strong results. And I look at the high-single digit results we saw on Reese, on Kit Kat, on Ice Breakers this past year, so I feel confident that where we have those we can really drive impact. And I think the results we're seeing on Cookie Layer Crunch speak to that as well.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, one follow on then, Michele. The Cookie Layer Crunch, this looks like this could potentially be a $100 million product for you all. We haven't seen that in a while. Do you guys believe you've gotten the innovation machine at Hershey kind of back on track, and then it'll be more consistent than maybe in the last couple years where innovation just fell? I mean, it was, what, 2011 when we had the Reese's Minis, and that was a blockbuster. The Minis franchise was great, but it finally petered out. And now it feels like you're back here with CLC, but can you characterize innovation?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure. So, first of all, I'd say, we're very bullish on Cookie Layer Crunch, yet at the same time it's early. So, we need to make sure that we get repeat and see the response to advertising, but we remain optimistic. I do believe that based on our research results that can be a big platform for us. And I also believe, I guess I'd say two things. First, I feel really good about the innovation we have in the pipeline. I think back half of last year, if you look at snack mix, Reese's Pieces Cup, Big Kat, Cookie Layer Crunch and Crunchers this year, I think we really are building momentum there. But at the same time, I'd say innovation is hard, and it's hard to get the homerun. So, we're focused on trying to keep at it, and I feel good about what I see for 2017 into 2018.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll also take a follow-up from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations to everyone as well. I guess two questions if there's time, first is a follow-up to Driscoll's question, I guess. But your sales guidance, obviously, incorporates an expectation of stronger contribution from new product innovation than we had this year. And there's also some noteworthy new products activity that's been launched by competitors and probably will be merchandised. So, I'm just curious if you could characterize the sales contribution from innovation in 2017, relative to what you'd expect on a normalized basis going forward? Is this going to be kind of a peak year? And then more generally, the 2% to 3% sales outlook, what kind of improvement in category trends that predicated on?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yes. So, as we look at the category, based on everything that you've mentioned and certainly those same things that we've seen at industry shows, it looks like it's going to be a big year of innovation for the category. And if we look historically, whenever there's been a lot of innovation in this category, given the variety-seeking nature of consumers, the accessible price points, it tends to be a pretty strong category year.","So, as we look at the category, we anticipate that we might see growth around 2% or 2.5%, certainly accelerated growth versus what we saw in 2016. We expect that it would perhaps be more in line with what we saw back in 2014, 2015. So, we think that all of those things are good for the category. And certainly as we look at our business, we like getting a nice chunk of growth from a big innovation. So, we like to see that. It's a big focus within our P&L.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So, it would be fair to say that you're optimistic about your market share prospects, but your 2017 guidance doesn't necessarily embed a level of certainty around market share gains, if you expect the category to improve?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","I'd say, that we would expect that we'll see some gain in market share. I think at the same time, we try and be realistic about where the overall macro environment looks like, and some of the volatility that we've seen in the marketplace, it's harder to predict than it's been in the past.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And, Patricia, just a quick one on barkTHINS. I think there is still some amortization headwinds in 2017 that will result in dilution there. But, as you ramp up investment and some of the amortization subsides, what are you expecting in terms of lower dilution or improved earnings contribution on that business?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. Thanks. You're right. We do have the amortization of barkTHINS. We had some of it in 2016, we'll have it in 2017. Overall, we're really pleased with the way that integration is growing. We've been particularly doing well with the synergy part of it, the supply chain savings is becoming greater than we expected. So, we feel really good about that acquisition.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. I don't know if I'm jumping ahead of others in the queue, but I would like to know about all these IT investments that need to be made. Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 do you think that you fell behind your peers in terms of IT investments? Like, why is all of this happening now? And how do you think it will help you improve marketplace performance?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","I'd look at the opportunity that's in front of all of us right now of what data and analytics and technology can enable. And as we've talked about before, we've always believed that that's critically important in our business, the knowledge that we have has an advantage. And so, we're very focused on looking at all the applications of data that can create competitive advantage in the marketplace. And we believe that needs to be a big focus of ours. So, we really are focused on that right now.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And can I assume that that goes into corporate expense? And if so, will corporate expense be higher in 2017?","John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.","Well, Rob, we'll talk to a lot of this on March 1, especially some more detail around what some of these IT investments are at the business level, to ensure people are working most efficiently as possible, as well as at the corporate level. So, I think you're going to see a little bit of both. I don't want to get out ahead of ourselves on March 1 here, but there's a lot of things in the market changing very faster than they ever have before, and we're trying to bring solutions to retailers and be where the customer is going. So, I think you'll see more of this on March 1.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. We'll share some specific examples.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Thanks.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","All right, operator. We'll end the call here. We thank everybody for their participation, and we'll be available for any follow-up calls that you may have.

My name is Phyllis and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2014 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark Pogharian","Thank you, Phyllis. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's fourth quarter 2014 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO and Bert Alfonso, President International and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions will provide you with an overview of our results followed by a Q&A session.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2013 filed with the SEC.","If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally.","These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss 2014 fourth quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $32.5 million or $0.30 per share diluted primarily related to a noncash trademark impairment charge and loss on disposal of $24.8 million or $0.10 per share diluted and business realignment cost of $4.7 million or $0.02 per share diluted. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","John Bilbrey","Good morning all of you on the phone and webcast. In 2014, Hershey made progress against its strategic initiatives. U.S. CMG, xAOC+C market share reached 31.4% up 0.3 share points versus last year. We acquired Shanghai Golden Monkey which more than doubles the company\u2019s presence in China.","We expanded into snacks and adjacencies with the launch of Hershey Spreads and the related Snacksters Graham Dippers. And we sourced 30% of our cocoa needs from certified and sustainable cocoa farms, putting us in a solid position to deliver on our 100% goal by 2020.","There are also challenges. In 2014 we believe lower retail store traffic, changes in consumer spending patterns as a result of the SNAP program and a more competitive snacking environment for contributing factors that impacted how consumers participated in the snack segment. This resulted in fourth quarter and full year sales and earnings that were below our expectations.","Specifically, growth in snacking alternatives and an evolving retail landscape are impacting what consumers buy and where and how they make purchases.","Higher income consumers continue to ask for simple ingredients, health and wellness, and millennials view brands and brand attributes beyond traditional transparency to include social responsibility. They are also interacting with media differently.","Now let me share with your some of the things that we're doing to address this. Our R&D and innovation teams continue to make progress on new confectionary and snack products that enable us to offer great confectionary products and increase the breadth of our portfolio.","Later this year, the Club channel will be introducing Brookside, dark chocolate, fruit and nut snack bars. Building on our snacks and adjacencies strategy, earlier today we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Krave Jerky, which enables us to enter the rapidly growing meat snacks category.","We are really excited about this acquisition and the opportunity to participate in the 2.5 billion meat snacks category that's growing at a double digit rate.","While snacks and adjacencies is a lever in our long term sales algorithm, we are very focused on confectionary. It's who we are and it's our name sake.","We have a lot of CMG innovation this year that I'll talk to in a moment. But we also have a meaningful new product pipeline that gives me confidence that innovation can continue to contribute at least one point of growth to our net sales algorithm on an annual basis. So I remain bullish on the CMG category and our ability to keep increasing market share.","As it relates to simple ingredient and transparency, we've actually done a lot of work here. We have at leverage what we've done as our plan is to move a large portion of our portfolio in this direction.","We are building the capability and have made progress to source non-GMO sugar and RSBT free milk for products in the United States. We've already begin this work with key sourcing suppliers here in the U.S. and we\u2019ll have more news on this later in the year.","On the media front, we expect that advertising and related consumer promotion will increase at a rate greater than sales. Included in this is a greater proportion of investment in digital advertising on programs, consumers view on their mobile devices via traditional networks, user generated content and sources like BuzzFeed. So we are making investments that will benefit the company in the near and long term. And we'll have more on this at CAGNY, so let\u2019s move on.","I was satisfied with improved results in the convenience store, large mass retail, and dollar store channels especially in the second half of the year. However, FDMx non-seasonal candy performance was not inline with our initial plans.","Lower retail store traffic, greater levels of in-store activity by broader snacking manufacturers and continued economic challenges for a segment of consumers in these channels impacted our non seasonal candy growth.","Looking at total xAOC+C store retail takeaway, U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improved throughout the year. Hershey fourth quarter retail takeaway of 3.8% was greater than the category growth of 2.2% resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points.","Marketplace performance was greater than 4Q net sales given solid Halloween and Holiday sales, a portion of which shift in the third quarter. The timing of the buy-in related to the price increase as a portion of third quarter net sales would have normally occurred in the fourth quarter. And that lapping of the strong year ago period when select retailers increased inventory levels.","Driving our fourth quarter takeaway results were improvements in convenience stores, large mass retail and dollars stores. These were the channels where many of our second half initiatives were focused, so I was pleased with the results.","The programming and execution changes we made in the FDMX and Club channel simply required a longer lead time to impact in-store merchandizing activity. Hence our sales mix and lower than forecast category growth impacted profitability and margins.","Let me now talk about 2015 where our focus will be on restoring our U.S. momentum. We have a solid line-up of new products that will bring variety, news and excitement to the category.","In addition to the carryover benefit of Brookside Crunchy Clusters and Reese's Spreads, we're also launching Kit Kat White Minis Hershey\u2019s Caramels, Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews, Reese\u2019s Spreads Snacksters Graham Dippers and some other yet to be announced new products.","Additionally, the Reese\u2019s brand is leveraging its NCAA relationship and is becoming the official sponsor of ESPN College Football Game Day. These initiatives are tied into customers, specific merchandizing programs and big core brands that should result in higher quality merchandizing versus last year.","Additionally, we're increasing our reach as we're adding incremental headcount to our sales force that will result in hours in store being up mid single digits. We'll complement this with increased levels of advertising that I mentioned earlier.","We believe the investments we're making across our business, positions us for future growth. The dynamics of the confectionary category, impulsivity, conversion rate of check-outs, season, multiple pack types are all an advantage.","As a result, in 2015 we anticipate that the plans we have in place will help mitigate the volume elasticity related to the price increase and it will outpace the category and again, gain market share.","Let me now provide you with some information on our international business. For the full year, our international net sales increased nearly 15%, including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and positive contribution of about $54 million for Shanghai Golden Monkey.","Excluding SGM and unfavorable FX, international net sales increased 10%, a solid number, but less than our expectations due to macroeconomic headwinds that have yet to subside and will most likely remain a challenge this year.","The Hershey Golden Monkey integration work is underway and on track. In 2015 we will distribute acquired confectionary and protein based bean curd snacks into the China modern trade and we expect to have deeper Tier 2 city coverage of some Hershey chocolate products.","We're also leveraging newly acquired manufacturing capabilities. In China, Brazil, Mexico and India we've made solid progress against our planned initiative of investing in go-to-market capabilities and portfolio expansion.","In select markets, we launched Reese's and is off to a good start. Additionally, we're testing additional products as we look to build out global brands over the next few years. Therefore in 2015, including a negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the impact of M&A, we expect international net sales growth to increase around 10%.","Including SGM, reported international net sales are expected to be around $1.2 billion by the end of 2015. By country, our chocolate business in China had a solid year. Chocolate category growth in 2014 was about 12%. Historically the chocolate category has increased 10% to 11% in the fourth quarter.","However, it's slowed to around 8% as we see less gifting behind the Government policy changes. Hershey fourth quarter retail takeaway of about 20% was less than our expectation. Importantly, our market share in Q4 increased a full point to around 11%.","In Mexico, chocolate category growth in the modern trade in 2014 was around 1%. The category and consumer struggled during the year although trends were better in the second half of the year with chocolate category growth of 3%, but this is still below the historical growth rate of 7% to 8%.","Hershey Mexico chocolate retail takeaway for the year was up around 2%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.3 points. We expect 2015 to be better than last year albeit in a continuing challenging environment.","Our performance in Brazil has sequentially improved as the year progressed. For the year Brazil chocolate growth was 1% versus about 5% in recent years. Hershey retail takeaway was up 2%.","Our performance was driven by our Hershey tablet bar growth and the launch of Reese's. We look to build on this in 2015.","Now to wrap up, our consumer and customer plans as well as our investment profile for 2015, clearly reflect the learnings from 2014. Our plans are focused and the investment profile was concentrated in the areas to leverage Hershey's advantage brands and go to market strength.","Investment in our brands, innovation and capabilities as well as an increase across all channels and merchandizing and programming, positions the company to compete effectively in confectionary and across the broader snack continuum.","We believe these investments should generate organic net sales growth or constant currency sales, excluding M&A and FX impacts of around 4% to 6% in 2015. This is less than our previous estimate and reflects the macroeconomic headwinds in international markets and the slowly improving U.S. non-seasonal trends.","I typically just talked to net sales with and without M&A however, when we established our long-term sales target, we didn't anticipate the U.S. dollar being this strong. Given the current backdrop, we expect foreign exchange rates to be greater than our previous estimate and be about one percentage point unfavorable in 2015.","We estimate that the net contribution for acquisitions and divestitures will be around 2.5 points. We continue to focus on growth initiatives and margin opportunities behind continuous productivity improvement initiatives. With the conclusion of the Project Next Century program, in 2015 we'll focus on with the next largest opportunities are for future incremental productivity and cost savings.","A portion of any particular savings from this assessment would be reinvested in our CMG and snacks business to accelerate our growth and we'll provide more information on this at the upcoming CAGNY Conference.","I'll now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some additional detail on our financial results. Bert?","Bert Alfonso","Well thank you JP and good morning, to everyone.","It's a pleasure to be here to talk about our results as well as some of the recent M&A activity. As Mark mentioned, I've been very close to all of this as I have responsibility for the M&A function as well as our international segment. So let's get started.","Fourth quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.7% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.04, an increase of 20.9%.","As JP stated, the sales increase was lower than our expectations, primarily due to lower retail store traffic. Net price realization, mostly in the U.S., was a 3.1 point benefit. Excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey, volume was off 2.3 points due to price elasticity associated with the U.S. price increase announced in July and lower than expected non-seasonal sales. The Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition was a 2.7 point benefit and foreign currency was a 0.8 point headwind.","Q4 U.S. seasonal sales primarily driven by holiday increased high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Full year seasonal sales were a bit higher given a later Easter in 2014. Conversely Easter is 15 days shorter in 2015 and will be a headwind this year.","From a market place perspective, our Halloween and holiday market share increased 0.9 points and 1.1 points respectively. International net sales in the fourth quarter, increased 28% including a benefit of about $54 million related to the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition.","Excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey, international net sales increased 8% as reported and 11% on a constant currency basis as unfavorable FX was greater than anticipated. Macroeconomic headwinds in Q4 led to international sales being lower than our expectations.","Turning to margins, fourth quarter adjusted gross margin increased by 30 basis points. The increase is driven by net price realization, slightly favorable input cost and supply chain productivity, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and other supply chain costs.","Fourth quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT increased 17.5% versus last year, generating an adjusted EBIT margin of 18.7%, a 240 basis point increase versus last year. The increase was due to the higher gross margin and lower SM&A cost that declined about 5% due primarily to lower employee related costs.","In Q4, advertising was up about the same as last year and as we said throughout the year, advertising GRPs were up mid single digits on a percentage basis versus 2013.","Now let me provide a bit more detail on our international business. China continues to drive international net sales growth and excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey increased about 35% in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. We anticipate a similar profile in 2015.","I'm very pleased with the progress we continue to make in China and remain optimistic regarding confectionery growth in both the modern and traditional trade. We'll continue to expand our selling capabilities and expect growth in 2015 to be balanced between velocity and distribution games.","We will also expand cross-selling of products between Shanghai Golden Monkey and Hershey China in the coming year. And finally we were very pleased with our 1.6 point share gain in chocolate in 2014.","In Brazil, Q4 net sales were about the same as last year on a reported basis, an increase about 12% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, net sales declined about 3% on a reported basis and increased about 7% on a constant currency basis versus last year.","Despite the difficult category environment, we were pleased with a small share gain of 0.1 points.","In 2015, we're exploring other go-to-market options together with our current JV Partner Bauducco. Our distribution JV with Bauducco has enabled us to double our market share in the last few years. However, we are considering having total control over the selling and distribution function to give us more flexibility and investment options.","In Mexico, fourth quarter net sales declined 6% on a reported basis and were flat on a constant currency basis versus last year. For the full year, net sales declined to 8% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis compared to 2013.","Again our chocolate performance is favorable with a 0.3 point share gain driven by both velocity and distribution gains. Trends in Mexico are getting better and we expect continued improvement throughout 2015, although still below the historical growth rates.","We\u2019ve made solid progress against our international strategic plans. We remain committed to our core markets and we\u2019ll continue to make the necessary investments to build distribution capability, brand equity, and drive trial and repeat purchases.","Moving down to P&L, the fourth quarter interest expense is $21 million, was about the same as last year. The before year interest expense was $85 million and in line with our expectations.","And for 2015, we expect interest expense to be $75 million to $80 million. The adjusted rate for fourth quarter and the full year was 34.5% in line with our estimates. In 2015, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be similar to last year.","In the fourth quarter, with average shares outstanding on a diluted basis, we're approximately $223.5 million, we need to adjust earnings per share $1.4, an increase of 20.9%.","Full year adjusted EBIT increased 5.8% versus last year, generating an adjusted EBIT margin of 19.6% or a 40 basis point increase. The increase was driven by lower SG&A.","Turning now to the balance sheet and to our cash flow. At the end of the fourth quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's fourth quarter by $240 million. The cash receivable was higher by $119 million primarily due the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition, Lotte China consolidation and traditional credit terms provided to our largest customers in China.","Inventory was higher by $141 million to the Shanghai Golden Monkey in Lotte, as well as higher raw material inventory levels, primarily dairy that we mentioned in the last quarter. And accounts payable increased by $21 million.","Capital additions including software were $139 million in the fourth quarter and $379 million for the full year in line with our expectations. This included capital related to our manufacturing facility that we're building in Johor, Malaysia. In 2015, we expect CapEx to be in a $375 million to $400 million range.","The company repurchased 2 million outstanding shares in the fourth quarter and 202 million for the full year. Repurchases of 125 million were against the prior authorization and 77 million were against the current 250 million repurchased authorization approved in February of 2014.","In addition, 32 million of common shares were repurchased in Q4 to replace shares issued in connection with the exercises of stock options.","Depreciation and amortization was $59 million in the fourth quarter and $212 million for the full year in line with expectations.","Dividends paid during the quarter were $115 million and $440 million for the full year. Cash and short term investments at the end of the fourth quarter were $471 million slightly below our expectations due to the lower sales.","The company remains well positioned to fund our dividends, working capital, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions.","Let me close by providing context into our 2015 outlook. As J.P. summarized in 2015 we have a solid pipeline of target innovation, merchandising and programming that can drive pack type and channel growth.","In addition, advertising related to consumer marketing expense is expected to increase at a rate greater than net sales growth.","As a result, we expect 2015 net sales to increase from 5.5% to 7.5% including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about 2.5 points.","This includes the acquisition of Shanghai Golden Monkey and Allan Candy that closed in the fourth quarter, as well as the agreement entered into over the last month to acquire Krave Jerky and divested Mauna Loa.","We expect the Krave and Mauna Loa transactions to close in the first quarter. Excluding that acquisitions and divestitures, sales are expected to increase 3% to 5%. This is lower than our previous estimate due to the continued macroeconomic headwinds as well as greater than initial estimates related to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.","And we expect foreign exchange impact to be greater than our previous estimate and have an unfavorable impact of approximately one percentage point on our full year net sales growth.","We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin and expect the previously announced pricing action, as well as productivity and cost savings to result in 2015 gross margin expansion of 135 to 145 basis points.","Adjusted earnings per share diluted are expected to increase 8% to 10% and that includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of $0.03 to $0.05 per share.","Before we open it up for Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on the first quarter. Remember that Easter is two weeks shorter this year and being sold in at the old price points which will pressure gross margin.","Our international sales profile is similar to prior years with annual growth primarily driven by second half. Therefore total first quarter net sales including M&A are expected to be around the low end of our annual sales target.","Additionally, brand building as well as investments and selling capabilities will ramp up in Q1. Given all these moving parts, EPS growth is expected to be pressured in the first quarter and higher as the year progresses.","I thank you for your time this morning, and will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John Baumgartner","J.P., did I hear correctly about a sales force increase in 2015?","John Bilbrey","If you think about the total investment we're making on our go-to-market strategy both in international as well as North America, the U.S. will continue to invest in hours for store in our sales organization. Then of course in China we've been talking about a geographic expansion there. So it requires a broader go-to-market strategy.","So yes, we are really investing again in our go-to-market capabilities.","John Baumgartner","So just digging deeper in the US increase, is it in terms of just why now. Is it more of a sense the competitive environment is maybe shifting beyond your current capabilities? Or is it more related to shifts in channel shopping by consumers and the irregularities there?","John Bilbrey","Well I think the biggest driver for us is, we look at 2014 in a competitive nature of merchandising and being in the right place and being able to responsive. We really see that as always being one of our core advantages and we continue to believe that. We're going to invest in those resources at retail.","John Baumgartner","Thanks J.P.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","So I had a question about as we're looking into next year and the parts of the revenue, the drags on revenue relative to target right now, aside from FX, are the non-seasonal, confections business in the US. And the international, collectively, the international business is below long-term targets.","So if you could talk about first, on the non-seasonal business, are you seeing any sequential improvement in January or so far year-to-date, just simply because you've got some pressure? Gas prices are lower, jobless numbers that look better. Just any insights into how non-seasonal is maybe tracking as you moved into the first quarter.","John Bilbrey","Sure. There's a couple of things and we\u2019re encouraged with some of the things we're seeing as we deconstruct the weekly data. So you\u2019re correct, the non-seasonal FDMx sales has been the biggest drag in our business.","So we feel good about the fact, the fourth quarter we saw improvement we continue to grow ahead of the category and it was really a result that we think improve focus on merchandising in specific channels.","In FDMx it's a slower built there because the planning cycle is also different. But there\u2019s a couple of things that we were seeing, and if we look at the weekly data when you get the most recent quarter, you're going to see that we're making good progression from a share standpoint. We think that reflects some of the changes we made in merchandising.","One of the other things that we're seeing is a trips continue to be negative although they are getting better but negative and off course that continues to effect the consumer business, as everyday business, people log into story, you loose that instinct consumable piece. So we are very focused on that.","There is a piece of data that I recently looked at for our brand specifically that would in the trip, there is an increase in actual purchase size. So the trips that we're getting purchase side is actually up. But the one caveat I make, keep in mind with the fourth quarter you have some seasonal, so that can be part of it.","But in the weekly data, and this is all home scale information, we do have some really encouragement there. So I feel good about what I'm beginning to see anecdotally as you talked to retailers, I would say that I\u2019m hearing some of those same kinds of sentiments echoed.","And then of course we all are aware that the consumers had a lot of pressure at the bottom of the economic pyramid and its still yet to be seen how that consumer participates in the market. But for the total, I think I\u2019m encouraged.","Bryan Spillane","That's really helpful. And I just wanted to clarify. In terms of the -- your revenue outlook for this year, and actually the gross margin because it's affected by it as well, are you expecting a material improvement both in international or non-seasonal? Or at this point, will an improvement be upside to where the guidance is?","Bert Alfonso","You started the questions by started comparing what we were thinking in the third quarter versus more recently. And if you think about the international side, a half of point is really just incremental drag from FX, back then we\u2019re thinking closer to half a point today, we\u2019re firmly at a point and we'll see where that goes, hopefully the dollar starts to stabilize a bit.","When we look at international business, we're probably closer to around 13% back than we alluded to 10 as J.P. mentioned. The macro economy has got little tougher in places like Brazil and Mexico.","We saw a little bit of slow down in China in the fourth quarter but we worry less about that. We've had a lot of momentum going into Chinese New Year but certainly what J.P. talked about in terms of some pickup on the everyday business and little bit lower expectations at least for 2015 in international is what makes the biggest difference.","We also had a little pressure on our export business which while is not huge is very profitable and as you can imagine the currency into some of these markets also has some impact.","Bryan Spillane","Thanks, Bert. That's helpful. And again, as we tie that altogether, does the guidance assume that things really improve, or would improvement in both of those areas be upside to where our revenue guidance is?","Bert Alfonso","We're hoping for - although we haven't baked it into our plans, gradual improvement. But we would say back half versus first half.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan Feeney","So I have three questions, but they're all kind of related. The first is, about what percent of your North American volume do you assume is going to be under the new price increase this year? You mentioned Easter was, and about what percent would that be?","Related to that and secondly is, is there some negative mix factor I'm missing that why gross margins would only be up 120 to 130 rough gross margin? When you've got this magnitude of price increase, you're number two commodity dairy is now in free fall, and I know you've bought forward to some extent and that's understandable. But it looks to me like your cost bucket might be flat to down exiting the year. But is there something I'm missing as to why that margin expansion is so small, and how that might pace over the year?","And then third and finally, can you give us a sense of what kind of volume you're thinking globally associated with this guidance? So maybe I can understand if there's some deep manufacturing deleverage like we saw in the fourth quarter? Thanks very much.","John Bilbrey","Let me take the pricing one first and then let Bert talk a little bit about the gross margin.","The best way to think about the pricing is as we move through the year, there is still some activities that are under the old price certainly around the seasonal business.","So you\u2019ll begin to see that have a greater impact in Q2 and Q3 and then if you think about getting through the end of 2015, we continue to model the elasticity at about one to one rate in terms of volume and price.","So by the time we get to the first quarter of 2016, our modeling would suggest that we\u2019re back to a whole environment or back to 100 in terms of volume contribution to our growth.","So that's the way I would think about it broadly. There is a lot of movement still, but as we look at some of our channel modeling, there is nothing that we're seeing that would cause us to believe that it would be any different than how we planned.","As you know, when we were increasing advertising in a very rapid rate back in 2008, 2009 and 2011, there might have been a little bit of a faster conversion rate but we think the way we\u2019ve currently model this its probably about right.","Bert Alfonso","Let me try to fill your end on your question around gross margin.","As we think about our gross margin expansion, we're expecting 135 to 145 basis points. We are coming off the year when we\u2019re actually down at gross margin first time in a long time. We did start to see a pick up in the fourth quarter slightly below what we thought.","When you look at our year end year commodities, I won't talk specifically about hedging program but clearly cocoa is still on average at higher prices than it was in our 2014 standard. And that\u2019s really a function of - as we roll out of commodity program in a environment of increasing costs and we've seen cocoa increase pretty dramatically.","Obviously, you may have some of the lower hedges rolling off and are buying into little bit higher market.","So, while we\u2019ve seen some improvement recently and that\u2019s good. We still have cocoa that's higher than 2014 level. So that does have some, a bit of an impact in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about the expansion.","The other thing as J.P. mentioned, our profile for 2015 is driven by pricing. So we are expecting five to six points of pricing and one to two points of lower volume. And that lower volume does pressure our absorption in the plans, and so you don\u2019t get the full benefit of that until as you get later in the year as J.P. mentioned we start to recover the pre price increase volume.","So some volume impact doesn\u2019t work through the price of elasticity. And while some commodities are clearly in a better place like dairy, and sugar we do still have higher cocoa prices year-on-year.","So that\u2019s helping to mitigate to some degree what might be otherwise larger growth margin expansion.","Jonathan Feeney","Great, thank you. And if I could just add one follow-up real quick about the mix. Is there any big mix the factor we ought to know about, whether it's geographic or whether it's in the portfolio? Anything that's really affecting either the present quarter or 2015 that maybe isn't obvious?","Bert Alfonso","In the first quarter we certainly have the mix of Easter at the lower or old prices right, because that particular season is still protected. Once you get beyond that, then you have seasons.","So if you do have that, and J.P. already talked about the everyday business starting to improve but the more that improves quicker, the better we look on a mix basis.","We did have as is already explained, not as good a mix in 2014 as we thought we would just based on the every day.","So certainly a first quarter impact on Easter at old prices, and then improving throughout the year as pricing kicks in.","Mark Pogharian","Jon its Mark, just one thing so you would expect that we would have the most pricing than in the second and the third quarter and looking at it total company for the full year you\u2019re probably thinking \u2013 think about it as five to six points a price volume of 1.5 to 2 points because most - a lot of the international business is all going to be volume driven and then you got a point of FX so that\u2019s I guess how to think about the full year.","Jonathan Feeney","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","So a couple of quick questions. It was a little alarming to hear about how the candy mint and gum category growth has slowed to about 1.7% in 2014, and how there might be some encroachment from other snacking categories. Are you worried that some of those types of shifts may be more structural I guess? Are you seeing -- are you worried about smaller brands continuing to come up?","And then my second question is actually more about the acquisition strategy from here. As you've bought the Krave business and moved very clearly into a very different snacking category, might we see more of those types of moves that you end up bulking up in snack categories that are maybe more in line with where the consumer is heading? Thank you very much.","John Bilbrey","Alexia to your first question around the category my answer is no. I don\u2019t think there is anything structural that's going on here. One interesting piece of that is, helpful penetration actually went up through our brands in 2014. And so I think the thing that we\u2019re seeing is potentially several fold.","So 2014 there were lot of moving parts in terms of macroeconomic influences on consumers so we see that.","The trips piece for business like ours which has this everyday component is certainly an impacted people audience stores. And I think there is a real consumer strata influence there that I think has to be dealt with.","Then in terms of let's just talk about the consumers themselves. I do believe there is an evolution always happening with consumers and the relationships they have with brands, I think some of the smaller brands have done a very good job of resonating with some of the on trend things that consumers talk about and we can talk separately about Krave here in a second of why we think that's on trend product uniquely positioned within that particular segment.","But as we saw takeaway improved throughout the year, we feel we became a more competitive company, responding to some of the just things that are happening within the category and consumers of course have broader choices.","What we see happening almost everywhere though and I'm very optimistic about how this plays to our strengths, is that snacking and snack and portable snacking is not just a short term, this is really a trend and its becoming a habit if you look at the way the number of meals people have during the day, they have broader options on the menu of how to participate that.","We just have to be competitive and we have to be competitive with the brands we have that are within the core of the Hershey Company, our confectionary products, we are expending brands like Brookside which have a nice hallow effect of goodness.","And then we also see ourselves as we\u2019ve talked about expanding across a broader snacking continuum. And even if you talk - even if you think about China in a brand - our bean curd, in China that\u2019s a product, it brings protein, it's on trend in terms of being a snacking on the go brand.","So we just see that being more and more important in terms of consumer trend and so as a company we have to adapt to where the consumer head it. We talked about simple ingredients with GMO.","So if you think about a chocolate bar, there is really only four components in a chocolate bar. So we should be talking about the simplicity of that in responding to the transparency that consumers want, and we\u2019re doing that. So I'm very optimistic about all of these things.","You set us up nicely to talk about Krave. Michelle Buck who is the President of North America was very, very involved with the acquisition for Krave. She's here so, why don\u2019t I give her a chance to just talk for a couple of minutes about the acquisition.","Michelle Buck","Thanks J.P. As J.P. mentioned, we\u2019re seeing consumers continue to snack more and graze throughout the day and as such their snacking need are really evolving.","We\u2019re going to be focused as we continue to look at the growth of our company as a snack company and how we meet those needs. One of the areas that we\u2019ve seen a lot of consumer interest in is affordable nutrition and protein-based snacking.","So, as we look at that marketplace, clearly one of the categories that's really meeting consumers need is meat snack category that is one of the fastest growing, growing double digit in the U.S. this past year and over the past several years.","Household penetration is expanding so household penetration is only up 31% but it continues to grow through two points this past year. So clearly its meeting a lot of consumer needs.","And as we look to that category Krave was interesting to us because Krave is really playing in the fastest growing segment of the meat snacks category, the better for you premium segment.","So we really like the brand, we think it has tremendous potential, the product preposition has a unique point of difference with a great taste, a texture, it's a culinary inspired kind of profile, and we think that there is a lot of potential as they can continue to bring new consumers into the meat snacks category in the marketplace first to leverage Hershey strengths and supply chain, consumer insights and retail to really drives the business.","So we couldn\u2019t be more excited about how it would continue to help us to meet consumer's needs as we stay very focused of course on winning in our categories.","John Bilbrey","Alright, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","Two quick things. One, J.P., would be -- and maybe you'll cover this a little bit more at CAGNY, but I think it's important just to cover the topic. I certainly appreciate the evolution of where consumers are going, and Hershey's desire to cover off on that a bit more with snacking adjacencies and such.","But the last time Hershey did this, albeit in a different set of broader snacking categories, the execution really wasn't where the company wanted it to be. The sustainability of some of those items, whether it was cookies in the C-store, nuts, things like that, weren't exactly I guess as sustainable.","So is there something now that is different about capabilities, the way you're planning for these sorts of things whether it's KRAVE or things beyond that that make you feel a lot better about the sustainability of it? And then I've just got a quick follow-up.","John Bilbrey","Andrew I think the biggest thing in my mind is the ability for us to execute against I think a clear business model today than we've had in the past. I think that if you look what we\u2019re doing in China and we\u2019re going at a plan for thoughtful to execute against the right R&D, the right distribution, the consumer insights and supporting it with advertising et cetera.","I think that\u2019s where we're probably doing a much better job today than we have in the past. And so admittedly not all things work perfectly but I think that we have a clear sense of how we want to execute it against these \u2013 against these things and I expect this to be successful.","Andrew Lazar","Thanks for that. And then I certainly understand your thought process around no structural changes to the core CMG category growth rate. Do you think for planning purposes that perhaps the historical 3% to 4% rate as a category in 2015 may prove overly optimistic, or do you think that might still hold for this year as well?","John Bilbrey","As we\u2019ve thought about the category we certainly plan to go market share within that category. We think long term, the 3% to 4% growth rate for the category is still the right way to think about it.","You know these things are sometimes a bit of up, sometime it's a bit low but as we\u2019ve seen some improvement over the - as I talked earlier about, the quarter and the weeks et cetera, we think that it's still a good planning stand for this year to think about, positive category growth. And the most important thing is that in environment we have to win.","Andrew Lazar","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche.","Eric Katzman","A couple of questions. Kind of related to that comment about the category broadly in the U.S. It seems like the premium end of it is gaining some share for RO, Lindt, et cetera. The company, kind of like and snacks years ago, tried to get into premium but wasn't really all that successful. J.P., perhaps you could touch on that, and what that means for the category and your growth within it?","John Bilbrey","I think Eric if you look historically the premium as we sort of defined it over time, is somewhere around 7% or 8% of the total category in good economic times it always tends to grow and expand in terms of space, some of that growth is driven by distribution and then in more difficult economic times usually the distribution in category contraction goes along with it.","I think what it speaks to in the current environment is the top end of the economic pyramid is fine and the consumer that participates there has the ability to participate. And I also think that part of the category has in many ways a clear message to the consumer also that is around sometime ingredients and so forth.","So, I believe that\u2019s what we are seeing more than anything else. I agree with you we have not done a good job in the premium space. We are spending a lot of time right now on how we want to participate in premium, we\u2019re pushing up some within our \u2013 the middle of our portfolio certainly with products like Brookside which takes us up a little bit you\u2019ll see some of the innovation we have this year which will also do that.","And then we\u2019re looking stronger our brands like Scharffen Berger and trying to make an effort to see how we can play differently with those brands.","So we are not going to ignore that. I think in the past we have not done a good job. We want to reiterate ourselves a bit there and then its still problematic for the consumers are participating in the category.","So you will see some category expansion from that space but I think the overall category really will continue to be driven by mass products.","Eric Katzman","Okay, thank you for that. And then, Bert, the long-term margin goals for international, obviously, the world has become more volatile, a bit slower, input costs have moved up in certain respects versus when you laid out those goals. Any comments about your ability to still achieve double-digit EBIT margins in international by 2017?","Bert Alfonso","We will probably get deeper at CAGNY but I think your point is a good one, we have seen depreciating currency not so much in China even though there we\u2019ve seen slight - that certainly has had an impact.","We continue to invest behind the brands because we think we\u2019re in the right top line response. So I always as we think about our margins overseas we could be if you think about 2017, but we think directionally we still in the heading in the right direction, our China margins are very, very close to company average which is our biggest expanding business.","And right now we are seeing a blip in our exports and in markets like Brazil. So there is certainly possibly we could be off by a year but I think directionally we are still on path to get what we said as low double digit like by 17, 18 yes.","Eric Katzman","Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it off.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll","Wanted to ask a question here about pricing. I think on the last conference call, you guys discussed 2015 pricing to be up about 6.5 points. And I think today, you're saying 2015 pricing up 5 to 6 points. Maybe on one side of it, 50 bips, maybe that's just in the margin of commentary. But the low end of 5% seems considerably lower than what you were talking about last quarter for 2015 price realization. Can you guys just talk about today's thoughts on pricing?","John Bilbrey","I don\u2019t recall the exact commentary from Q3 at this time but obviously you know when looking at the sales target this year in general, it is little bit lower than what we provided back in October.","I mean obviously it does reflect how we exited the year particularly in the FDMx or call it legacy. Legacy channels that\u2019s certainly is part of it as well.","David Driscoll","Okay. So what you're saying is that part of this reduction in the revenue guidance is related to pricing, not specifically all volume. I think when I read the release, it felt like what you guys were saying was that the volume performance in the non-seasonal was below expectations. And my interpretation was that was the flow through to 2015. But I think now you're saying that it's a combination of both lower price expectations in 2015 and lower volume expectations in 2015 versus prior guidance.","John Bilbrey","I think excluding the M&A the 3 to 5% reflects M&A roughly a half of point greater than our expectation. Some of the international headwinds that Bert talked about on the international business that will have ending up around 10% up in 2015.","And then again some of the trend certainly not getting back to what we thought it would be in the non seasonal business exiting in the fourth quarter. We think if it gets better what it probably is not going to get a bigger pick up until post Easter and the second quarter when some of the innovation starts to launch there.","David Driscoll","When you guys talked in your script about higher advertising running ahead of re-rated sales growth in 2015, can I just be slightly more clear about this? This seems like it's vastly higher. So if we have 135 basis points of gross margin expansion, I think the math comes out to somewhere between a 20% or 25% increase to the A&C budget. Is that the right neighborhood to think about, or is there something else going on in the G&A line that would require a substantial investment?","Bert Alfonso","Yeah let me try to clarify that for you below gross margin. What J.P. mentioned was that, certainly our advertising would be higher year-on-year and we\u2019re talking in the neighborhood of two times sales.","There is something that you should try to understand on SG&A. The SG&A as we planned it out with M&A is going to be in the mid-teens. If you strip Alan Candy, crave which we're expecting will close in the first quarter. And then the biggest piece by far Shanghai Golden Monkey that gets you down sort of the high single digits.","And it's that mid teen to high single digits with and without M&A so apples-to-apples that should make it sort to think about what happens below that. Not that advertising up 20%, we are saying it's going to be up around two times sales.","David Driscoll","That's extremely helpful. Because that part of it's hard to forecast. Just final question from me then is that when you just simplify all of this, your expectations for U.S. category growth in the chocolate candy category is more or less something around 3%, 3.5% for 2015? Is that right?","Bert Alfonso","That's right.","David Driscoll","Okay. That's all I needed. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","Just two quick questions for you. If I could follow on the line of questioning Dave had there. As I look at the fourth-quarter, it's not clear to me why the U.S. gets better. That is, that you had a high degree of elasticity.","So is it as simple as, and you've given us some good information your sales reps and the increase in coverage there, the increase in marketing or advertising would help certainly as well. Anything else that we're not considering, maybe is there a larger new product benefit for the coming year, things that can help us get a little comfort around that 4% to 6% underlying growth.","John Bilbrey","One thing I would mention Chris and I know there were lot of moving parts in the fourth quarter but certainly in the North America business the third quarter one point time shift because of the volume certainly that was a headwind in the - for the fourth quarter but there were some positive that we certainly saw in the fourth quarter.","I mean we saw the C-store class of trade did very well at the high end of our 3% to 4% long term category growth rates. One of our largest retail partner was - had takeaway in the fourth quarter certainly greater than the 3% to 4%, dollars store continue to do well.","In the trends that we \u2013 again and we are seeing very early in January, are in pace with that, certainly in some of the FDMx, again building, not quite at the level of those other channels but getting better than we had given up the fourth quarter. So those are some signs of encouragement there.","Bert Alfonso","You know a couple of other things as you start to lap, the SNAP which was an event that back in November the previous year in 2013, so you start to get that back into the base.","And then I think the unknown and keep in mind we never talk about gas prices in terms of leading sales up and down. So in difficult times we seem to be pretty good in terms of those linkages.","However, what we don't know to answer to yet, I don\u2019t think is that the real income that the lower fuel prices are bringing to consumers is really significant. So how that makes it way through to behavior, I don\u2019t think we know yet but I think that\u2019s more likely a positive than a negative, I would say for food in general and consumer products in general and then obviously we\u2019re going to fight for our share there.","John Bilbrey","I guess the way to think about it and hopefully you\u2019ve this team now, is that and to clarify maybe what Bert said, we continue to feel very good about our business within CMG. I think Bert has set a category previous, we actually think the category could be some that, we think we will be better than the category.","And we\u2019ll gain shares just as we did this year and our result - if you look first half, second half from a takeaway and share perspective they are much different profiles.","Chris Growe","That's good. Just a quick one if I could. The Krave acquisition, I see a lot of ways in which that fits, and you're operating the same channels. It's obviously snacking category. I think at first glance, and I wrote a note to this effect, and I'm sure that you've as well. It's just that it's a very different category for you from an input cost standpoint.","And I'm just curious, should we assume that there are the snacking categories beyond the obvious confectionary categories where Hershey will be looking in the future to bolster its growth?","John Bilbrey","I think the simplest way for me to address that is, as you get to learn more about Krave, you\u2019ll really see how the positioning of the brand, we believe is very on trend and creates differentiation within that segment.","We\u2019re always looking for both in our product development as well as potential acquisitions for things and we believe could fit well with portable nutrition and broader snacking.","We will always be diligent to not distract ourselves from the core business that we\u2019re in but we are also in the consumer products business and have to make sure that we\u2019re meeting what consumers are always desiring. We think that\u2019s definitely within the core businesses that we\u2019re in. And we think because of our go-to-market capabilities, our R&D and ability to make things taste great that there are opportunities for us in broader snacking.","Chris Growe","That\u2019s good. Thank you for your time.","John Bilbrey","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow","Not to belabor the point, but I guess taking a bigger picture look at this. Do you think your long-term growth algorithm, both not only one just a sales line but also on the bottom line, is a little bit more challenged because as it seems like Hershey needs to take greater risks in terms of product integration. You're taking more risks on acquisitions, more risk on creating a new brand, having to add new salespeople.","It feels like we're going into a different era with Hershey versus two or three years ago where it was not low hanging fruit, but a little bit easier to get the growth and now it seems a lot more challenging, and you have to do bigger risk items for it. Can you comment on that?","John Bilbrey","Well first I tell you it feel challenging every day, but you know, I think the way to think about it is, we feel good about our long term guidance. We know that there\u2019s going to be these periods of times where there\u2019s pressure on businesses and you know, if we look back I\u2019m sure over our 120 year history and I remember hearing people talk about cocoa being at $7,000 a ton and the world was going to end.","There are always, these periods of times, which seem more challenging maybe than others. But if you think about our footprint and our portfolio, the countries that we\u2019re focused against, despite there maybe currency headwinds and these kinds of things, these are some of the best high growth GDP markets around.","We don't have a lot of legacy businesses that we have to drag along with it. I look at China by itself and, largely we're a Hershey\u2019s business there, more specifically we\u2019re a Hershey's kisses businesses there.","As we expand our category, our portfolio within the category, that gives us a tremendous amount of runway. We advertise in - like I think only about 20% or 25% of the cities that the leading competitor in the market does. So as we continue to expand that, and our household penetration grows, we can talk about what\u2019s the right GDP for China, but if think about an emerging middle class and our portfolio over time, we have a tremendous amount of runway there.","And so as we execute against our business model in a thoughtful, plan-full way, we have this very precious North American business that I have a tremendous amount of confidence in. I think that our guidance is absolutely right for the long term. We want to continue to be acquisitive and so I think we've got great future.","Ken Zaslow","And my just final -- just add on a little question is, the skill set for Hershey in terms of being very focused on chocolate is that your ability to hedge and just understand the input costs associated with Hershey is far superior - because of your knowledge base. Now you're getting into a meat category, which has a whole another host of issues which buying and selling. Does that raise concerns for you?","John Bilbrey","Well we have people in our organization in specifically in our both R&D as well as our supply chain that have a lot of experience in their background specifically within protein and in meats.","So while it maybe a new endeavor for some of our folks it\u2019s certainly not for all of our people, we\u2019re acquiring what we thing are people with great skill sets. Obviously we\u2019ll do everything we can to learn as much about the business as fast as we can.","But when you think about food science we have a technical center with 250 professionals sitting over there many of them PhD\u2019s in food science and they already are experts in proteins. We certainly don\u2019t go into anything with any arrogance we\u2019re going to be eager to learn, but we also believe that we bring some capabilities to the category that will service as well.","Ken Zaslow","Great. I thank you very much","John Bilbrey","All right. Thank you for joining us today and we'll see you all in a few weeks at the CAGNY conference.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"10982":["Hershey Co (NYSE:HSY) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call February  1, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Mark Pogharian - Director, IR","Michele Buck - President, CEO & Director","Patricia Little - SVP & CFO","Analysts","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities","Andrew Lazar - Barclays PLC","Steven Strycula - UBS Investment Bank","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","David Driscoll - Citigroup","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Alexia Howard - Sanford C.

My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this call may be recorded. Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark Pogharian","Thank you, Erica. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements, which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section.","Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.","The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss fourth quarter results of 2017, excluding net charges of $0.18 per share diluted related to business realignment activity, derivative mark-to-market gains, non-service-related pension expense and an estimated impact of a onetime mandatory tax on the previously deferred earnings on non-U.S. subsidiaries. These net charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","And with all that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Michele Buck.","Michele Buck","Thanks, Mark. Good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast, and a special welcome to the many Hershey employees, including our new Amplify colleagues who are listening in. As I step back and review 2017, we had a solid year, making good [indiscernible] strategic plan that strengthens our business model and positions the company for future growth.","Looking back, I'm pleased that we drove our core chocolate brands with mid-single-digit growth, expanded our snacks portfolio with the acquisition of Amplify, delivered EBIT margin expansion and strong EPS growth and maintained our market share in a competitive environment. And we did this while continuing to transform the business to a position that we believe will enable us to achieve our long-term sales target during our strategic planning cycle.","I'm less satisfied with our momentum slowing as we ended the year. Importantly, we understand where opportunities exist and have plans to improve upon our performance. Let me now provide you with some further color. We are fortunate to operate in a profitable and growing category in our core U.S. market. For the year ended 2017, our CMG - that's candy, mint and gum, and snacks retail takeaway increased plus 1.6%. Most of you scrutinize the IRI or Nielsen-measured channel marketplace data on a regular basis, so I don't need to tell you how choppy CPG trends continue to be from quad-to-quad.","In this environment, we were able to maintain our market share while transforming the business. And being a company focused on growth as well as growth and EBIT margin expansion, I was happy that in 2017, we delivered sales growth of 1%, increased our EBIT margin by 30 basis points to 20.7% and grew EPS about 8%. And after the last several years of evaluating snack assets, I believe Amplify's scale, brand product proposition, marketplace performance and margin structure give us a strong foundation, off of which to further build.","As you look across the retail box, U.S. snack real growth has been consistent, and we believe snacks consumption will continue to increase. We have the right portfolio and brands to win, and we're committed to the CMG and snacks growth strategy we outlined last March. This business model should enable us to deliver our long-term targets, which would result in increased shareholder value.","Looking at full year performance. Net sales growth was slightly below the outlook we provided in October. That growth, combined with productivity and cost savings initiatives, drove EBIT margin expansion and full year EPS in line with our estimates, excluding the greater-than-expected expenses as related to M&A due diligence initiatives. And we continue to generate solid operating cash flow, about $1.2 billion, which gives us a lot of financial flexibility.","We finalized the Amplify acquisition yesterday, and I am very excited about the opportunity ahead of us to bring scale and category management capabilities to the warehouse salty snack aisle. Our goal is to capture more consumer-snacking occasions with a broader portfolio of brands. So the acquisition of Amplify is a step in our journey to becoming an innovative snacking powerhouse.","While preliminary, Amplify Q4 net sales and EBITDA were in the guidance ranges they provided in November. Additionally, January is tracking in line with plan, which gives us increased confidence in our outlook for the business in 2018 and beyond.","Amplify will continue to be based out of its current offices and operate as a standalone business as we look to maintain and leverage the entrepreneur mindset embedded in the culture, as well as the benefits of scale and synergies for certain functions that Hershey brings to the table. We'll also share knowledge and insights between Amplify and our emerging brands group. I look forward to sharing more of our snack strategy with you at the CAGNY conference in a few weeks.","Turning now to Hershey's performance. Our Q4 U.S. combined CMG and snacks retail takeaway was about 1%. As expected, this was greater than fourth quarter net sales growth due to the timing of total sales we discussed last quarter. For the full year 2017, total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway increased plus 1.2% and was in line with U.S. net sales.","Looking at just CMG, both the category and Hershey, increased about 1.7% for the full year. Our growth and industry-leading 30.6% CMG market share puts us in an enviable position as it provides us with financial flexibility to invest in the business, expand margins and hold a leadership role with major retail customers.","For the 12 weeks ended December 31, CMG category growth was plus 1.7%. Due to the timing of our programming and innovation and consistent with our plan, Hershey Q4 CMG performance lagged the category, with market share off 0.3 points. As the first quarter progresses, we expect marketplace trends to improve, driven by the excitement in the marketplace for Hershey's Gold, which will have merchandising and program tie-ins with the Winter Olympics, which begin this month and an early Easter.","Importantly, within the combined chocolate and non-chocolate candy segments where we derive the majority of our U.S. sales, full year category growth was plus 2.5%. Recall, this is greater than total snack real growth of nearly 2% and CMG category growth of plus 1.7%, which includes softer performance related to the gum and mint category.","Our core chocolate brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat and Kisses, continue to drive growth, and I'm particularly pleased with their marketplace performance this year. The combined retail takeaway on these power brands in Q4 and for the full year, increased about 2% and 5%, respectively, with market share of these combined brands up in both periods.","As we discussed in prior quarters, this was partially offset by planned declines on select chocolate and non-chocolate candy brands as we focus on reducing complexity and improving overall velocity rates at retail. We have plans to improve the performance of select variety candy brands in 2018, and expect them to contribute positively to marketplace performance this year.","For example, work started already on the Twizzlers brand, and early results are promising as Q4 retail takeaway was up 2.3%. More on this as we work our way through the year. I was pleased with our innovation this year, particularly Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch and our snack products. We expanded our snack mix and Snack Bites products with the launch of Hershey's and Reese's Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels, primarily in large-format, take-home bags. While early, results are encouraging. Trial and repeat are in line with our expectations and consumer reaction is positive when our brands are merchandised in the snacks aisle.","The transition for lay-down bags to stand-up pouches on our core chocolate candy products is progressing. New retail-ready packaging began shipping to one of our largest customers in the fourth quarter, and select expansion will occur in 2018. This initiative enables product to get on the shelf quicker with less in-store labor and improved shopability in the aisle.","While these packaging initiatives have an impact on gross margin in 2018, we believe this is the right long-term investments for our brand and business as it should result in improved shelf presence and visibility. We feel good about 2018. We have made solid progress against key capabilities, such as our multiyear ERP program and e-commerce. We have a dedicated cross-functional team responsible for the strategies and execution of our e-commerce plans, headed by a new senior executive who has a deep CPG sector digital e-commerce experience.","This group is responsible for the strategies and execution of our e-commerce plans in developing the next generation of online impulse solutions. We're working with all the key strategic partners and we'll be validating and testing concepts in 2018 that we believe will lead to a sustainable business model.","Additionally, stand-up and retail-ready packaging as well as innovation, such as Hershey's Gold, Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate and Reese's Outrageous, bring the right level of brand newness and variety to the category. We are excited about our innovation of these core chocolate brands and platforms, as well as new advertising campaigns and in-store merchandising that should drive consumer engagement and growth across our portfolio that we believe puts us in a position to deliver on our net sales and marketplace objectives.","Now for an update on our International and Other segment. Net sales for the quarter were relatively in line with our estimates. Our strategy and execution in the marketplace in 2017 enabled us to generate full year operating income of $11.5 million in this segment. After being in the red in 2015 and 2016, we now have our sights on eclipsing the 2014 operating income high from this business.","I continue to be pleased with our performance in Mexico, Brazil and India as combined Q4 and full year constant currency net sales growth in these markets increased 11% in both periods. In China, we're executing against the Margin for Growth program we discussed on March 1 that should result in a sustainable ongoing business model. This efficiency and effectiveness initiative is progressing nicely and is on track.","We're optimizing our in-country supply chain and streamlining the operating model as we strike the right balance between in-country investments and near-term market opportunities. As expected, China fourth quarter net sales declined about 30%, driven by volume declines related to SKU optimization and our focus on pack types that meet marketplace velocity thresholds.","I'm pleased with the progress we are making and expect our focus on profitable growth in this segment to result in continued operating income improvement in 2018.","Now to wrap up. Confections is one of the largest segments within the $100 billion U.S. snack market, and the acquisition of Amplify broadens our participation in salty snacks, one of the fastest growing sub segments. Our strong U.S. marketplace presence and solid financial position give us the flexibility to smartly invest in confectionery and other warehouse salty snacks, as well as in the capabilities that will give us a competitive edge at retail and with consumers.","We believe the foundation we have set in 2017 and the investments we're continuing to make this year are in the areas of the business that set us up for continued growth. Investments such as enterprise resource planning system and a refreshed approach to analytical processes should enable operational effectiveness and efficiency and be a differentiator in the marketplace over the next few years that drives top line growth and market share gains. With the goal of increasing margins over the long-term, via both cost control, and importantly, top line growth, I anticipate we'll continue to increase shareholder value.","Patricia will cover the details, but we're in the process of evaluating the cash benefit of tax reform and believe that it will complement our existing cash usage priorities. I am confident in our business model and strategies, and I'm excited about the opportunity in 2018.","We remain focused on driving growth in our core confectionery business, while expanding our presence in salty snacks. I believe our combination of 5% to 7% sales growth, Amplify accretion as well as Margin for Growth savings will generate solid base business EPS growth within our long-term target and double digits when accounting for incremental brand building and the new tax rate.","I'll now turn it over to Patricia who will provide you with details on our financial results.","Patricia Little","Thank you, Michele. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. As anticipated, fourth quarter net sales of $1.9 billion declined 1.6% versus last year, including a 0.4 point benefit from favorable foreign currency translation. Volume was up 2.3 points, and net price realization was a 0.3 point benefit. As previously discussed, the expected decline in net sales was partially due to the timing of shipments last quarter and the launch of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch in the year-ago period.","For the full year 2017, net sales increased 1%, including an FX benefit of 0.2 points. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.03, a decline of about 12% versus last year, primarily due to lower year-over-year sales. Versus our outlook last quarter, note that corporate costs related to merger and acquisition due diligence initiatives were greater than our estimate. Excluding this, we would've delivered full year EPS growth closer to the guidance we provided in October, as we were able to offset the lower volume and the gross margin softness with SG&A savings.","By segment, Q4 North America net sales declined 0.9% versus the same period last year, including favorable foreign currency translation of 0.4 points. Volume was up 0.6 points and net price realization was a 0.3 point benefit. The decline was partially due to the timing of shipments discussed last quarter as well as the tough comp in the year-ago period.","Total International and Other segment net sales for the fourth quarter declined 5.4% versus last year, including a 1.2 point benefit from foreign currency exchange. Volume was up 6.6 points in line with our estimates, driven by planned decline from China.","Turning to margins. Adjusted gross margin - adjusted gross profit declined 5.6% resulting in adjusted gross margin of 42.7%, a decline of 180 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year. Supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, as well as slightly lower input costs, were more than offset by cost increases, which included unfavorable sales mix and fixed cost absorption of overhead given lower volumes, unexpected manufacturing variances, and higher freight and distribution costs and other supply chain expenses.","Given Q4 results, full year 2017 gross margin was in line with last year and less than our expectation of about a 25 basis point increase. We have good visibility into our 2018 input cost basket and don't expect inflation. Additionally, we have productivity and cost savings initiative in place that should offset the higher packaging costs that we discussed last quarter and unfavorable mix. As a result, we expect adjusted gross margin in 2018 to be about the same as last year. This includes Amplify, which has a gross margin profile similar to Hershey.","Adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter of $325.1 million resulted in operating profit margin of 16.8%, a decline of 240 basis points. As expected, SG&A productivity and cost savings were more than offset by the decline in gross profit as well as higher go-to-market expenses and corporate-related costs.","In Q4, North America advertising and related consumer marketing increased about 3%, in line with our estimate. This was offset by the planned decline in the International and Other segment, resulting in consolidated advertising and marketing decline of 3%. As we looked at 2018, advertising on our CMG brands will be about the same as last year. Total Hershey advertising and related consumer marketing, excluding Amplify, will be slightly down as we focus our spend on brands that have the highest ROIs.","Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. On a constant currency basis, net sales declined 6.6% and was relatively in line with our forecast. The China supply chain transformation is on track, with a majority of the work expected to be complete by the end of 2018. The reorganization within SG&A functions, which began in Q2, is still progressing. The benefit from this work is evident in segment operating income. Our SKU analysis and operators efforts negatively impacted gross sales or volume in 2017, and this work will continue in 2018.","In Q4, as Michele referenced, China net sales declined about 30%, driven by our focus on pack types that meet certain marketplace velocity thresholds. The SKUs that we're driving within our four focused core provinces slightly grew full year market share. Importantly, preliminary results indicate that China chocolate category sales in brick-and-mortar will be up low single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, while e-commerce is expected to grow to around 15%. We expect similar category growth rates in 2018.","Fourth quarter International and Other segment operating loss of $15 million was about the same as the year-ago period and in line with our forecast. Combined operating income and margin improvements in Mexico, Brazil and India were solid. Performance in China was [indiscernible] estimate with Margin for Growth program savings more than offset by the timing of select investments and marketplace expenses.","As a result, operating results in China more than offset the combined operating income in our other international markets. Our 2018 plan is to continue to drive a strong profit-focused mentality in this segment, driven by measured sales growth and Margin for Growth program savings.","Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $25.8 million increased $2.4 million versus last year. For the full year, interest expense was $98.3 million and in line with our estimate. In 2018, interest expense is expected to be in the $130 million to $140 million range, including debt related to the acquisition of Amplify.","The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15.5% versus 28.2% in the year-ago period. The decline was primarily due to the timing of investment tax credits and favorable foreign tax rate differential. This resulted in a full year tax rate of 26.7% that was in line with our estimate. The recently passed U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will have a favorable impact on our net income, earnings per share diluted and cash flow.","Like most companies, we continue to evaluate the details within this legislation. But it is clearly favorable versus our 2017 effective tax rate. Our preliminary estimate indicates Hershey's 2018 effective tax rate should be around 20% to 22%. The company is evaluating the cash benefit of tax reform and believes that it will complement its existing cash usage priorities, such as business investment, including both brand building and capital expenditures that result in growth, dividend, share buybacks and debt reduction. The lower tax rate and the brand building reinvestment is included in the 2018 outlook.","The fourth quarter and full year other income and expense was $42.1 million in $65.7 million, respectively, and was primarily driven by investment tax credits. In 2018, we'll continue with that strategy and estimate that investment tax credit expense will be in the $60 million to $65 million range. For the fourth quarter of 2017, average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 212.6 million shares, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.03, a 12% decline versus a year ago.","Total capital additions, including software, for the fourth quarter and full year were $109 million and $257.7 million, respectively. For the full year 2018, we estimate that CapEx will be in the $330 million to $350 million range, including Amplify needs of $10 million to $15 million, supporting increased capacity for U.S. core chocolate brands that are growing mid-single digits, and in capabilities related to our multiyear ERP implementation.","Total adjusted depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter and full year were $67.5 million and $255 million, respectively. The company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January of 2016 or against the $100 million share repurchase authorization approved in October 2017. There is $100 million remaining on the January 2016 authorization.","Furthermore, in the fourth quarter, the company did not repurchase any common shares in connection with the exercise of stock options. Dividends paid in the fourth quarter were $134 million and $526 million for the full year.","Now to wrap up. As Michele summarized, in 2018, we had a lot of variety, news and innovation in place. Hershey's Gold, in an instant consumable pack type, is off to a good start. The take-home package launches later in Q2 and should be a benefit in the second half of the year to both net sales and retail takeaway. The same holds true for Reese's Outrageous, which also launches late in Q2.","However, headwinds such as a shorter Easter season in 2018 and our continued SKU optimization in the International and Other segment, will pressure sales growth. As a result, in 2018, organic net sales are expected to increase in the range of slightly up to 2% versus last year. Additionally, the acquisition of Amplify will be about a five-point benefit and foreign currency exchange is expected to be negligible, resulting in reported net sales growth of about 5% to 7%.","As I stated earlier, we expect adjusted gross margin to be about the same as last year. And as we discussed on March 1, we'll continue to make investments in the businesses that we believe will improve our go-to-market capabilities and industry-leading knowledge and insights.","Additionally, we're reinvesting a portion of the EPS benefit related to tax reform. However, Margin for Growth program savings and Amplify accretion should enable us to maintain EBIT margin in 2018. Therefore, including the lower tax rate discussed earlier, we estimate 2018 adjusted earnings per share diluted to be in the $5.33 to $5.43 range, an increase of 12% to 14% versus last year.","Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to the line of Robert Moskow from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","So I guess, the theme of the call here is reinvestment, and I guess higher costs also. When I think about just your core guidance for 2018, just on the core confectionery business, is it fair to say that you're guiding here to kind of flat operating income growth just for the core business? And is that because of the headwinds you're kind of talking about? Reinvesting a portion of the tax benefit, the higher freight cost and then also the shorter Easter and the SKU optimization? And then maybe you could help me understand, if weren't for those Easter and SKU things, do you think you would be closer to your normal algorithm for the core business or not?","Michele Buck","I'm going to let Patricia handle that one.","Patricia Little","Yes. So thanks. On the margin side, I think it'll be - I think you have a good take on it. But I will point out that that's not going to translate into income, because obviously, with the growth that we do expect in our core category, that will drive higher dollar income for us.","Michele Buck","Relative to your question on shorter Easter and SKU rep, I assume, Rob, you're asking the impact on the top line. And certainly, those do create some pressure as we look at the delivery on the top line. Certainly, a longer Easter benefits not only our total takeaway as well as our share. As we look at our plans for '18, what we're really focused on [indiscernible] growth we've seen on the core brand that is low to mid-single digits, really start to activate part of the portfolio around some of our variety brands, which we have not been doing. So we're going to optimize our spending to activate those. And we started doing that in Q4 and started to see nice results in a lot of the brands that we activated. And then a real focus on stabilizing some of where the leaks have been, particularly around the emerging brands. But the combination of Easter and the SKU definitely creates about a one point headwind for us.","Robert Moskow","And can I ask a follow-up? A lot of us have seen data that shows that your biggest competitor in the U.S., Mars, has regained a lot of market share. I found it hard to determine whether that was just a comparison issue versus a year ago when you had the Cookie Layer Crunch launch. What are you seeing differently from your biggest competitor? And has that factored into your plans for '18 at all?","Michele Buck","Yes. So I'd start by saying, hey, it's always our goal to gain share and we're pleased that we were able to maintain share despite heavy competitive activity. Certainly, I feel better about the first part of the year where, you're right, Cookie Layer Crunch was a big driver for us in terms of helping really to generate the share gains we saw in that part of the year. As much as we'd like our performance to be consistent on a quarter-to-quarter basis based in our programming and competitive programming, it doesn't always shake out that way. So what we always focus back on is the key levers that drive the category are those same levers that I think all the competitors need to focus on, which is do we have the right activation of our brands from an advertising and consumer marketing, do we have the right invest - innovation to drive each piece of the portfolio and superior execution to really drive displays and especially focusing at winning with the customers who are winning trips. So that's really our focus, and I think that's probably our competitors' focus as well.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John Baumgartner","Michele, just in terms of the packaging change. You mentioned that it's a long-term investment, but it's also a drag on gross margin. So is there a way to think about how far along you are in making these packaging conversions? Is it still an appreciable drag in 2019 and beyond? And have you seen any real benefits thus far in terms of shelf placement at retail or in-store to sell through?","Michele Buck","Yes. So that's a great question. So the way I would think about packaging is packaging is a lever that we are focused on improving in the marketplace. And we certainly believe the upgrade we did in packaging created some nice momentum for us versus the lay-down packaging that we had on shelf. However, we really view the packaging as an evolution. And what you're going to see is us continue to improve upon that packaging to make it even stronger [indiscernible] out of it. And as we do that, really, try to optimize the total P&L impact around that [indiscernible]. So it is out there, but you'll see more to come from us. Certainly, it is a drag right now on gross margin.","John Baumgartner","Okay. And just a follow-up on ad spend. Hershey's ad spend peaked in 2013, both in absolute dollars and relative to sales. And it's also coincided with the 20% increase in trade promotion over that period. So it seems like the trends here is pretty clear. As you think about how the category is evolving, how do you strike that balance between promo and ad spend? I mean, promo does kind of increase structurally, does that just kind of place a ceiling on gross margin over time?","Michele Buck","I think we're always striving to get that right balance between advertising and trade, and we think both are critical. So we're doing a lot of work on trying to optimize marketing mix. As you look at 2018, what you're going to see is we're going to optimize our spending on DMEs even more. You'll see us probably be about flat in terms of our advertising support on our core, but really optimizing our lines across the rest of the portfolio; investing in the variety of brands, which are highly profitable; and kind of rightsizing the investment on some of the smaller emerging brands and rebalancing between DMEs and SG&A.","So for example, some of the emerging snack brands, feet on the street to build displays on some of those brands, we're going to get more from that than advertising. On trade, we're - we really look at the benefit based on everything that we've seen on trade. As much as we can drive display, it's really just display that drives that activity. So we try to make sure that we are being nimble and constantly optimizing through strategic revenue management to get a price that's appropriate to drive display but not to be giving away product and creating a deflationary pressure that doesn't - that just subsidize an already planned purchase. So that's the way to balance there.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","I think Hershey laid out the Margin for Growth targets at your Investor Day last year, and it was, I think, 200 basis points of operating margin improvement by 2019. And I think it was expected to be pretty evenly split at the time between cost of goods and SG&A, with much of it coming in the years of '18 and '19. So in the context, I guess, of the flat gross margin expectation for '18, I'm just trying to get a sense of are those benchmarks still right? And if so, I guess, given the gross margin piece, what's sort of making up the difference, if you will, to get those 200 basis points by '19?","Michele Buck","Andrew, I'll start with just one comment, and I'm going to turn it over to Patricia to really dig into those numbers. I will tell you that as we look at our performance for Margin for Growth, we have over delivered on the SG&A component of our expectations. We thought that was going to be a difficult piece of the work. And as we really did some - made some tough decisions, we actually found we were able to [indiscernible] a culture that enabled us to really deliver even more than we expected there. But I'll let Patricia do a step-back to talk a little bit more holistically about it.","Patricia Little","Yes. So, you're right, we expect the savings to come both through the cost of goods as well as SG&A. A lot of the improvement in the International piece you see coming through the cost of goods, although there's an SG&A piece of that as well. In U.S. business, I think it's a little more weighted to SG&A, especially as we look at both the corporate functions as well as our commercial functions. In general, I would say that, as we look forward, it is a - we really do need the sales that we're driving investment against to help us deliver that leverage looking forward.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Steven Strycula from UBS.","Steven Strycula","I'll start with a question on Cadbury license, actually. I wanted to see, you guys have put some - a little bit of money here over the brand over like the last 12 to 18 months. Wanted to see what do you think the brand awareness of that is in, call it, the mass premium market? And what is opportunity for - to scale that in the U.S. longer term? And if it doesn't make sense, how do you think about monetizing it? Then I have a follow-up.","Michele Buck","I mean, I'd tell you that the strongest piece of that Cadbury business for us is the seasonal component. The Cadbury Eggs are a phenomenal piece of our seasonal portfolio, whether it's at Halloween or Easter, they're unique in the marketplace. And so our focus is really there. We are not prioritizing building the everyday mass premium nature of that brand. But there's tremendous value in the seasonal piece, so we believe that's the right focus.","Steven Strycula","Okay. And then to just follow-up on Andrew's question. For the 2019 margin targets, should we think about, just given what's happened in the industry since you've announced - held your Analyst Day, that the reinvestment pressures are just a little bit higher so maybe the net effect of it all is just a little bit more muted than maybe it was last spring.","Michele Buck","I think that's fair. I mean, I think we see a path of getting to the range that we laid out in March. But we do think that it might take us just a bit longer to get there. We see a path to the low end of the range. And yes, we're going to make those constant decisions of balancing getting there with making the right decisions on the business.","Mark Pogharian","Yes, Steve. I think, I mean, we've been very good over time of maintaining and increasing EBIT margin, it's certainly always been a focus and a hallmark of the company. So I think we'll continue to make progress. We'll continue to make progress there. But as Patricia alluded to earlier, certainly sales in 2017 being a little bit lighter, lost a little bit of leverage there. But there's still a path to get there, and I think we'll talk a little bit more about that in CAGNY.","Michele Buck","Right. And our goal is still industry-leading EBIT margin. And we feel confident we'll be there.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer","Just a couple of times in the earnings release you mentioned unfavorable sales mix in regard to the quarter, but also 2018. Could you give a little detail on this? How much of a drag is - are you talking about this with regard to margins or revenue per volume, and the degrees that it comes from category channel or pack type?","Michele Buck","So the biggest drivers on that would be certainly the snacks portfolio, which is lower margin than our core. And then as instant consumables, particularly in the second half of the year as we were lapping - had weaker instant consumable innovation than we did the prior year.","David Palmer","And just to follow up on the previous comments about brand building reinvestment. You said that was included in your EPS guidance. But I was unclear about how much of that is going to be an offset to your tax rate benefit from an EPS perspective in '18?","Mark Pogharian","Yes. I mean, we didn't disclose that, Dave, for competitive reasons. But I mean, if you're trying to put everything on an apples-to-apples basis, I mean, I would certainly start with - look, the base business, we're always looking to get to 6% to 8% EPS growth. So use whatever tax rate you want from last year to kind of normalize it, and you'll get back into it and get a sensitivity that way.","Michele Buck","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of David Driscoll from Citi.","David Driscoll","On the fourth quarter, the revenue trends ended weak. Organic, minus two. Can you just talk about the first quarter? And does that fourth quarter trend kind of give us a little guidance here that Q1 is also going to be soft and that really sales growth guidance is weighted to the second half of 2018?","Michele Buck","Yes. So we expect that we'll see some sequential improvement versus Q4 as we get into the year. But I think it's very fair to say that the strongest performance will be in the back half of the year. Certainly, the first half of the year will be lapping the long Easter, which that alone creates a differential in terms of the first half, second half performance. And then the pacing of our innovation. We've got gold that'll be coming out the blocks pretty strong; and then the Reese's Outrageous, which is our other innovation, is really more midyear. So I think the way you're thinking about it is accurate.","David Driscoll","And then, Michele, on the long term revenue objective of 2% to 4% organic, in light of the '18 guidance, do you still think that long-term objective is valid?","Michele Buck","I do. We are in the process of transforming the business model to respond to the changes we're seeing in the marketplace. I feel like we're making really good progress on some of those capabilities that are going to be big enablers around building our digital commerce business where we've brought in some really - a really strong leader, experienced leader in that space. That's going to help us tremendously. We have key investments in capacity, and we've been a bit constrained over the past 18 months with some of the demand on our core brands butting up against capacity. We're making investments, we have a Reese line that just came online now [indiscernible] that comes online later on the year. We've got Amplify that we have a lot of confidence in. So we continue to feel good about our ability to get to that long-term sales guidance over our strategic planning horizon.","David Driscoll","Yes. Patricia, two quick follow-ups for you just to clean up a couple of items. On the tax reform, so you're saying that some of the tax reform benefit was reinvested back into brand building. But I just want to be clear. I believe the plan laid out at Analyst Day was always for reinvestment in advertising. So are you saying that there is even greater advertising reinvestments because of the benefits of tax reform? That's kind of the first one. And the second one is just Margin for Growth, $60 million in '18. That literally has to go against the higher costs, so we're going to see flat EBIT margins. Do I have that part right?","Patricia Little","Yes. You do have that part right. And on the tax reform piece, I would say that our focus is really more around capabilities, things like investment in the e-commerce that Michele mentioned, focusing on those capacity improvements, some technology improvements that we want to give to our sales and marketing areas. And that's really where we see the opportunity, as tax reform comes in, to evaluate good ideas and potentially pull them ahead. Less around direct advertising is just the one thing I would make sure you're clear on.","Operator","We'll go next to Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Just a couple of quick ones from me. First, I just want to make sure I was clear. In terms of the earnings growth build for 2018, share repurchases are not part of the EPS build, is that correct?","Michele Buck","Patricia, do you want to cover that?","Patricia Little","Yes, we make assumption as we look at our EPS build of a share repurchase program that's really normalized. If you look at the past several years, we have sort of an assumption that we make around sort of our standard share repurchase as a nominal planning piece. It's not a big driver of our EPS. And I'll remind you that we also always repurchase shares related to option programs and other equity grants.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then, I mean, I don't know if I missed it. But did you give 2018 depreciation and amortization?","Patricia Little","We don't give that. We give the CapEx piece. You're welcome to give Mark a call and - if you need more details on that.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then just the last one. In terms of the decision to reinvest or spend more this year because you've had some tax savings. Would you have made these same investments if you didn't have the tax savings? It just sounds like the things you're spending on are sort of needs in the business. And I'm just curious to know if you're actually executing these things because you had the savings or you would've done this anyway?","Michele Buck","I think that these are important investments in the business. And really, the way we're looking at it is it gives us an opportunity to accelerate enacting them, and therefore, accelerate our project progress to our strategic goals.","Operator","And we'll go next to the line of Alexia Howard from Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Can I ask about the China business and the International outlook in general for 2018. It looks as though things deteriorated profit wise at the back end of the year in 2017. So I'm wondering if you can just give us some color about when - whether we expect that whole business, China in particular, to get back to at least breakeven during the course of 2018. And I'll pass it on.","Michele Buck","Yes. So that deterioration was largely due to some of the trade spending associated with the Chinese New Year. So I wouldn't look at that as a trend carrying forward. We feel really good about the profitability improvements that we've made in that sector across all of International. As we mentioned, we've really hit kind of a high mark here in terms of what we're able to deliver with that $11 million of OI last year. And we're expecting significant OI improvement this year that, as we said, we think we'll eclipse the 2014 previous high that we've had in terms of operating income for that sector.","Operator","And we'll go next to the line of Rob Dickerson from Deutsche Bank.","Robert Dickerson","I just had a question on strategy on the core brands relative to the noncore brands. We could kind of in the data set that - and what your referenced this morning, the core brands continue to do fairly well within chocolate. So that would - if they're growing, let's say, at the same rate as the category or above the category, they might even be taking some shares, especially what we've seen out of Reese's. But then you also have all your other brands within chocolate, and they seem to be more of a drag. So I'm just curious, as we look out in a few years, if you say - let's say, in '18, then probably more of the spending or marketing would go to higher ROI brands that are perhaps larger, you'd get a better lift. Like how are you thinking about your other kind of non-power brands within U.S. chocolate?","Michele Buck","Yes, I'm glad you brought up the question because we actually see that as one of our key priorities in 2018. So we absolutely grew share on all of those core chocolate brands throughout the year. So we're really pleased with the performance we've seen there. And you're right, the investments on those brands are easy because the ROIs are so big because of the scale of the brand. But we're really excited and think we have tremendous opportunity for select variety brands, brands like Twizzlers, Almond Joy, where we have a unique product in the marketplace that really owns a certain space. And we believe that we have an opportunity to better balance our DME spending. And so as you look in 2018, that's absolutely where we're going to have a focus. And if you look into the future, it's continuing to have some level of support against some of those variety brands. That benefits us not only from the lift you get from advertising, but there's a holistic package of where you advertise and then you drag velocity, you actually get greater distribution or avoid distribution losses.","And we think that's an opportunity for us that we haven't fully taken advantage of because we do have that breadth of portfolio. So that's definitely a focus for us in '18. Continue the growth in the core, activate variety and then stabilize those emerging brands, which actually had been declining.","Robert Dickerson","Okay, great. And then just a quick question. Obviously, you didn't - I'm not sure if you did or not, but you obviously didn't show it, to not purchase the Nestle assets. Just any thought around what you saw and you didn't see in them, kind of how that progressed, et cetera.","Michele Buck","So obviously, we can't talk about what we - any activity that we've done or not done in the M&A space. I would say, we've competed versus those brands in the marketplace over the life of the company, and so I think we're well familiar with that portfolio. And as we always focus on how we drive our business and also looking at what might happen in the marketplace, we do that every year, and this will be no different. So we will continue to run our playbook in terms of driving our own business.","Operator","And we'll go next to the line of Matthew Grainger.","Matthew Grainger","I guess, two quick follow-ups. Patricia, I might be asking for more detail here than you want to give, so please feel free to shoot me down. But I guess, with respect to the flat gross margin expectation, there's a lot of moving parts, and I think both we and investors have tried to decompose this, but you have positive productivity, input cost deflation and then the offset from negative mix and higher packaging costs. Is there any, I guess, directionals there? I guess, any assistance you can give us in trying to dimensionalize those puts and takes in terms of where gross margin might be solely on the basis of productivity flow-through and input cost deflation if you weren't also working through these packaging costs and mixed headwinds.","Patricia Little","Yes, I probably won't get into numbers, but I can certainly help you with the pieces a little bit. Over the long run, we expect supply chain productivity to equal, I'll say, offset base inflation, excluding commodities, or beat it. So that would be our goal every year. We don't hit that every year. I'll say that this year and looking forward to next year, we have had some headwinds. And let me just talk about them a little bit. You mentioned two of them in terms of the packaging and mix. But I'll also say that we are seeing the same sort of pressures on freight that many people in the industry are having as we - and I'll also say that as we strive to hit ever-higher service delivery goals, we will prioritize that, getting the product onto the shelf even if that means some extra cost in either our manufacturing or distribution network. So that's a piece of that.","And we also, I think, have an opportunity - and it's been a little bit of a hit on us on planning because we have seen, as actual takeaway or sales deviate from our plans, the effect can also drive some pressure in terms of our manufacturing or distribution network. Michele mentioned, and I think this is really importantly, on the opposite side of that, we are adding this new capacity, we've been very tight on capacity and that's been one of the issues. And we're also working to manage our complexity better. And I think that those are better improvements that will help us in the full year '18. And when you add all that together, our best estimate is that we'll be about flat.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, great. And I guess, I'll leave it at one more follow-up. But from a freight cost perspective specifically, clearly, it's not getting better yet, so unclear how worse maybe the cost issues there could ultimately be. Can you give us a sense, just as a percent of cost of goods sold, a rough range? Just what percent of your operating costs or your cost of goods are - sort of fall specifically into that bucket of transportation and shipping?","Patricia Little","Yes, Matt. We don't give that specific breakdowns of the pieces of our cost of goods sold.","Mark Pogharian","Yes, Matt. There was a slide on March for - that kind of give a little bit of pie chart or breakdown of materials and packaging, and then I think there was a little distribution and overhead in there. So take a look at that pie chart and it may help you out a little bit.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","Two questions, please. On SKU rationalization, I think a few of us have been through at least one cycle of just the natural kind of expansion and contraction of SKUs around the edges. So I guess I'm wondering, how much is total SKU count up at Hershey, roughly, just, say, over past couple of years? And within that, how much what you're doing right now as far you taking the opportunity to make - improve your velocity, get that assortment right, is a result of things going on at the retailers level, things they want? And how much of it is just kind of the age-old balance you're always trying to find between optimizing that revenue? What's new that's causing you to rationalize SKUs? And my second question is, just trying to get a sense so we can understand this, what kind of tax rate were you planning on for 2018 as of early December after your planning process but before you knew what Congress was going to do?","Michele Buck","Patricia, do you want to talk a little bit about tax? I can throw out a few comments around SKUs, and then I'll ask Patricia to comment on that as well. As we are prioritizing customer service, we are really trying to make sure that we're being very focused on [indiscernible] of the entire business and the productivity of these SKUs. And so as you think about SKUs, what you should think about is not just how do we take out the less - lower velocity SKUs but also we're looking at merchandising vehicles that create complexity and how we really simplify those. And you should also think about that happening both in our U.S. business but also in our International business.","So in both areas of the business, there's a real focus on that to maximize efficiency and make sure that we're really then able to develop and deliver even greater customer service. So I'd say that, hey, over time, you rationalize SKUs and then SKUs work their way back into the system, and I think it's a constant process that you really need to clean up. And I think part of it is just making sure that we're tighter about what we are willing to do on customer-by-customer, each-by-each basis because sometimes you become a little too accommodating. Patricia, anything you'd add to that?","Patricia Little","No, I think that's right. We really are thinking about it as managing the SKU count and managing our complexity that it drives. I think that's the important takeaway. On tax, we've always set the model at 27% to 28% tax number long term. We've tended to beat that. I have to say that I think we might've beat it '18 as well, but honestly, tax reform came along and got us focused on that instead of figuring out more tax planning strategies. So that quickly became our focus in the last part of last year.","Operator","And we'll go next to the line of Fintan Ryan with Berenberg.","Fintan Ryan","Just a few questions, please. Firstly, on the environment you're seeing with deflationary raw materials - the sugar, cocoa, should be a benefit. But are you seeing any signs of increase of competitors, potentially putting down pricing or any softness or increased promotional activity as a result of those lower input costs? And then secondly, I think you did mention weakness in sugar confectionery and gum, and one of your competitors has also mentioned that quite recently. But just from your perspective, what can be done to get those sugar and gum confectioneries back to growth? This - do you think this is more of a cyclical downturn? Or is it more sort of structural change of consumer preferences, ultimately?","Michele Buck","I mean, I'd start with relative to big competitors using any kind of deflationary raw material cost to increase promotion, I would tell you that, over time, in this category, that's not usually a behavior that we tend to see. I would say we've seen it more a little bit here or there, particularly maybe with some of the smaller competitors in the sweet, sugar area of the category over time. But that's not something that we generally see. So I'm not seeing any more changes there than we do any year in terms of promotional changes.","Patricia Little","And also just add that, well, some of our input costs are down, others are up. And what we said is that we don't see that deflation for next year.","Michele Buck","What was your second question, I'm sorry?","Fintan Ryan","Just what visibility do you have on the improvement of the sugar confectionery and gum categories? And is this cyclical sort of softness in the category? Or do you think there's more sort of structural factors at play?","Michele Buck","I would say on sugar confectionery, we've seen pretty strong performance on that segment of the category. And as we look at gum, our own business, we've done exceptionally well in the marketplace and have gained share. So I think it tend - those segments, like chocolate, tend to just be about having the right innovation in the category, having the right new news. And I think, for each of those segments, the years when that happens, you'd tend to see [indiscernible] and a strengthening of that segment. And I think the segment - the brands within those segments that have done that are seeing a lot of growth.","Mark Pogharian","Great.

My name is Leo, and I will be your conference operator today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","This call is scheduled to end at about 9:30 AM, so please limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many of you as possible. Please note this call may be recorded. Thank you.","Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Leo. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's first quarter 2017 conference call. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO will provide you with an overview of results which will then be followed by a Q&A session.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC.","If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income, prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as a key metric for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss first quarter 2017 results excluding net pre-tax charges of $216.6 million, or $0.71 per share diluted, which are primarily related to business realignment cost and long-lived asset impairment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Michele Buck.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast. Hershey's first quarter results were solid and I'm pleased with our performance. Net sales growth was 2.8%, delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of at least 2% sales growth, which we're happy with, given the choppy food industry retail trends in the U.S. and the macroeconomic challenges in some international markets.","Gross margin was up nicely in Q1 and is expected to increase for the full year, fueling higher levels of advertising and other brand building initiatives. Adjusted EPS was $1.31, a strong start to the year and puts us in a position to deliver on our commitments.","The Margin for Growth Program we discussed on March 1st is on track. This will not be a big benefit to our 2017 results. However, this multiyear program should enable us to achieve strong margin and EPS growth in 2018 and 2019 and provide us with the fuel to deliver consistent annual net sales and EPS growth post implementation.","Preliminary analysis of Easter data indicates that we had a good season with sell-through in line with estimates, putting us in a position to gain share in this important season. We believe this will result in total Hershey U.S. candy, mint and gum, or CMG, April year-to-date retail takeaway of about 2.5%.","While we don't like getting ahead of ourselves before results are final, given the timing of Easter, we thought this was an important metric to share. Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending April 8, 2017, in the xAOC+C-store channels declined 7.9%.","As we stated on last quarter's conference call, first quarter net sales would be greater than retail takeaway due to Easter timing. Recall that Easter occurred on April 16th in 2017 compared to March 27th in 2016. Perhaps the easiest way to assess performance given seasonal timing, and therefore, noise in the data, is by looking at absolute market share results.","In the first quarter, we gained market share, both with and without the Easter seasonal activity. In total, including the headwind from the year-ago seasonal activity, Hershey U.S. CMG market share increased plus 0.4 points.","Our core power brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, Kisses and Ice Breakers, which had 2016 retail sales of $5 billion, continue to perform well. In the first quarter, combined non-seasonal retail takeaway on these brands increased 5.6%. Our Reese's NCAA basketball program and the launch of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, or CLC, helped drive results.","While we're pleased with our first quarter market share gains, non-seasonal CMG retail takeaway was softer than we anticipated, resulting in Q1 net sales coming in less than our plan. As you are all aware, Q1 marketplace performance across most of the U.S. food group was soft. While the perimeter continues to grow faster than center of the store, its growth rate also slowed.","Our analysis points to several factors contributing to the softness. Some of them appeared to be Q1-specific, such as the tax refund delay while others are a continuation of the challenges like benefits inflation or channel shifting that we've been living with and we continue to solve for. Additionally, retail trips within xAOC+C-store channels was about the same as the year-ago period, although dollars per trip were down.","Dollars per trip were better in March. And as I mentioned earlier, preliminary Easter sell-through is in line with our estimates. We have a lot of variety, innovation and in-store programming over the remainder of the year as well as higher levels of advertising. We think categories within the snack wheel will outpace center of the store products given the impulsivity and percentage of merchandising and display allocated to snacks. As a result, we expect Hershey non-seasonal U.S. CMG marketplace trends to improve. However, given the uncertainty regarding overall U.S. brick-and-mortar retail trends, our updated full year U.S. net sales growth rate is lower than our previous forecast.","Looking at some of our 2017 activity, it starts with Hershey's CLC, which has gotten off to a good start. In the first quarter, CLC net sales and marketplace results were in line with our estimates. Internally, we refer to CLC as a vertical launch, as our goal was to attain 80% distribution by early February. We achieved this in eight weeks and had product available in all major channels to coincide with the beginning of TV and digital advertising.","The take-home stand-up pouch is doing very well followed by the king-size pack-type. Sales by class of trade are tracking as expected. C-store results are particularly strong with retail sales two times that of any other channel. While early, repeat purchases are tracking nicely. Although retail sales trends did slow in April given the Easter period as there's not a seasonal pack-type or packaging for this product yet.","With the launch of Reese's and Hershey's Cookies 'n' Cr\u00e8me Crunchers, we are looking to expand our power brands to capture broader snacking occasions. Our research continues to show that snacking occasions have increased throughout the day. The modern snacking model indicates 90% of consumers snack multiple times throughout the day. We expect that Crunchers will capture a portion of these snacking occasions as it combines powerful growing brands with sweet and crunchy textures to deliver a light, crisp eating experience.","The take-home stand-up bag is currently available at a few select retailers, and the instant consumable tubes will be available by the end of June. We have a strong integrated Crunchers marketing plan to build awareness and trial, including a national FSI in Q3, in-store merchandising and display, as well as advertising.","I'm also excited about the late Q2 launch of Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup. The excitement of this launch started in February when the Reese's brand team started using social media to engage consumer with clues to a new chocolaty Cupspiracy. The team posted various graphics and videos to hype the followers; and in March, announced the upcoming launch of the Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup, a peanut butter cup infused with crunchy pieces from a chocolate cookie.","This product, only available in an instant consumable pack-type, begins to ship in Q2. And I think you'll find that the crunchy cookie bits are a complementary texture with the peanut butter that makes it a very satisfying experience.","Additionally, our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites products continue to do well, and we're leveraging some other equities as well such as ALMOND JOY and TAKE5. These items have enabled us to expand our breadth across the snack wheel and capture new usage occasions.","That was just a brief summary of some of the activity we have in North America that we believe will grow our business over the remainder of the year. We feel that our brand support, innovation, consumer spending and investment and go-to-market capabilities will enable us to deliver our full year net sales objective.","Snacks, which confectionery is a large part of, is performing better than many of the center of store categories, and we expect that to be the case going forward. Investments in the CMG category in the form of advertising and innovation are present from most major manufacturers. Therefore, given the high household penetration and the impulsive nature of the category, as well as affordable price points and solid margins, retailers continue to value the confectionery category. As a result, we would expect the category to continue to secure key merchandising and programming space.","Now, for an update on our International and Other segment. Net sales were essentially in line with our plan and on a constant currency basis up 4.2% versus the first quarter of 2016. I was particularly pleased with Mexico, Brazil, and India, where constant currency first quarter net sales increased a combined 15%.","In Mexico, our chocolate retail takeaway increased solid double digits, although slightly less than the category growth of about 15%. Constant currency net sales increased 13%, driven by a combination of volume and pricing. Sales were strong across all categories and brands, particularly Kisses and Hershey's chocolates, Hershey's milk drink box, and Pelon Pelo Rico. Our new Hershey's CHOCOYOGO and Hershey's milk sticks are resonating with consumers and gaining traction.","In Brazil, while preliminary, we estimate that the chocolate category increased 7% to 8%. Our retail takeaway in Brazil was about two-and-a-half times the category growth rate, fueled by distribution gains on core brands and the continued rollout of the Hershey's Special Milk and Hershey's Special Dark Bars, which were launched in the second half of 2016. As a result, in Q1, our market share in Brazil increased 0.6 points to about 4.5%.","Constant currency net sales in India increased about 16%. Growth in the brands we're investing behind Hershey's branded syrup, spreads, and milk booster as well as Brookside, JOLLY RANCHER and SOFIT increased more than 50%. The launch of Brookside, primarily in the modern trade, is progressing and on plan. While small, this launch gives us exposure to a segment with above-average gross margin for the India business. Importantly, the transition of the portfolio is enabling a higher-margin business, which should put us in a position to invest and win in the marketplace with a sustainable operating model.","As we end the second quarter in China, we'll begin to implement the Margin for Growth Program we discussed earlier this year. The program includes an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our China business. Patricia will discuss and review the impact of our impairment test of China's long-lived assets. But the overall goal of this program is clear and will focus on improving global efficiency and effectiveness, optimizing the company's supply chain and streamlining the operating model. China chocolate category sales in Q1 were about flat versus a year ago, and better than our estimate. This was similar to trends of other impulse products, which declined.","Given the typical inventory levels we had post-Chinese New Year and the soft category in March, the temporary plant closure of about three weeks to four weeks due to an unscheduled inspection by regulators did not have a big impact on our business.","Our chocolate business in China underperformed the market in the first quarter, with market share off one point. As we right-size our business and portfolio over the next year or two, we're looking to prioritize cities, classes of trade, brands, and innovation to satisfy the needs of this dynamic market. We're working closely with our local team, including our e-commerce group, which continues to show promise.","Now to wrap up, I'm excited about our future, and I believe The Hershey Company has a long runway ahead of it. I'm supported by a great team of leaders, who have a lot of broad-based CPG experience.","As we've shared with you on March 1st, we know what we need to do to succeed. We are executing on our model to expand margins by reallocating resources to initiatives with a higher rate of return. We're investing in capabilities like go-to-market and building on our intellectual capital while also leveraging our core power brands and equipping our organization with the resources and tools to win in the marketplace.","These investments in growth and capabilities should put us in an advantage position to win with retailers and consumers, and ultimately, deliver on our financial commitments on our strategy of balanced top and bottom line growth and build shareholder value.","I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Michele. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. First quarter net sales of $1.88 billion increased 2.8% versus last year. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.31, an increase of about 19% versus last year, driven by solid gross profit margin growth as well as the timing of some SG&A investments that are expected to flow through over the remainder of the year.","Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of 10 basis points, net sales increased 2.7% versus the year ago period. Net price realization was a two point benefit due to lower levels of trade.","Net volume increased 70 basis points, including the contribution from the barkTHINS acquisition of 90 basis points. By segment, North America net sales increased 2.7% versus the same period last year. Volume was a 30 basis point contribution to sales growth, driven by seasonal growth; and as anticipated, net price realization was a 1.2 point benefit due to lower direct trade. The barkTHINS acquisition and foreign exchange currency rates were a 1 point and 20 basis points benefit, respectively.","We were pleased with seasonal results, the initial rollout and off-take of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, and Reese's NCAA basketball programming. However, similar to trends experienced by the broader U.S. food group, other portions of our everyday or non-seasonal business were softer than the anticipated. Importantly, in the first quarter, retail trips within xAOC+C-store channels were about the same as the year-ago period. Our preliminary Easter sell-through is in line with expectations, and we expect non-seasonal U.S. CMG trends to improve over the remainder of the year, although the growth rate is slightly lower than our previous forecast.","Over the remainder of the year, we feel good about the level of innovation, brand investment and in-store merchandising and display to deliver on our forecast. Total International and Other segment net sales for the first quarter increased 3.7% versus last year. Excluding the 50 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, International and Other segment net sales increased 4.2% versus the year-ago period. Price realization was an 8.7 point benefit, primarily driven by lower trade in China.","Turning to margins: Adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points in the first quarter, driven primarily by favorable trade, lower input costs, and supply chain productivity, and cost savings initiatives were essentially offset by unfavorable manufacturing experiences, initial year absorption of overhead related to the Malaysian manufacturing facility and higher freight and warehousing.","For the full year, we expect adjusted gross margins to increase about 50 basis points. This is somewhat greater than our previous estimate of 15 basis point to 25 basis point increase. The full year gross margin is driven by productivity and cost savings initiatives as well as improved input costs. Adjusted operating profit in the first quarter increased 10.5% versus the year-ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 23.2%, an increase of 170 basis points. The increase was driven by the higher gross profit and by lower SG&A. Investments in technology and go-to-market capabilities as well as higher depreciation and amortization were more than offset by cost savings and efficiency initiatives.","Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense was about the same as the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect that advertising and related consumer marketing expense will be higher in Q2 and for the full year.","Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total international business delivered on their Q1 plans. As Michele stated, in China, we're beginning to implement the Margin for Growth Program we discussed earlier this year. The program includes an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our China business. We deemed this to be a triggering event requiring us to assess whether the value of our China long-lived asset group is recovered by its related cash flows.","As a result of this testing and our revised estimate of fair value for the asset group, we recognized impairment charges, totaling $106 million to write-down certain intangible assets that have been recognized in connection with the 2014 Golden Monkey acquisition. And we wrote down property plant and equipment by $102.7 million.","During the first quarter, we also recognized estimated employee severance and related charges relating largely to our initiative to improve the cost structure of our China business, as well as our initiative to further streamline our operating model.","China chocolate category performance in Q1 was relatively in line with our forecast. We remain optimistic about the long-term outlook in China. However, consumer spending still appears to be mixed in the modern trade and impulse categories underperformed. Therefore, our full year sales outlook in China is slightly lower than our previous estimate.","We expect China net sales in 2017 to decline single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Because direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances should be lower than last year, gross sales will be down by a greater amount.","However, given the choppiness in the China market over the last 22 years, this outlook could change if there's a pullback in the market. We're executing against our plans in Mexico, Brazil, and India where constant currency net sales in these three countries increased a combined 15%.","First quarter International and Other segment operating income of $1.7 million improved nicely, and I'm pleased with the progression. As we stated on March 1st, we are driving a strong profit-focused mentality in this segment and expect the bottom line trends to improve meaningfully in 2017. However, the exact timing and implementation of the Margin for Growth initiative impacts when we get fully back into the black. More on this as the year progresses.","Moving down the P&L. First quarter interest expense of $23.7 million increased $2.7 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $95 million to $100 million range. The adjusted tax rate declined in the first quarter to 31.5%. The lower tax rate versus the first quarter of 2016 was driven primarily by a favorable rate differential related to international operations.","For the full year, the company anticipates its effective tax rate to be between 27.5% and 28%. This is about 100 basis points lower than our previous outlook as we continue to look at various tax strategies and to secure higher income tax credits. As such, in 2017, other income and expense is expected to be around $55 million. For the first quarter of 2017, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 214.5 million shares, down 3 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.31 or an increase of about 19% versus a year ago.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow: At the end of the first quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year \u2013 last year's first quarter by $14 million. Accounts receivable were higher by $52 million due to higher Easter sales. Inventory was higher by $25 million and accounts payable increased by $63 million.","Total capital additions, including software, were $33 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we estimate that CapEx will be in the $270 million to $290 million range. During the first quarter, adjusted depreciation and amortization was $65 million, and we paid $128 million in dividends. The company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. Additionally, we did not repurchase any shares in connection with the issuance of stock options.","Now to summarize. The Margin for Growth Program is on track and progressing. We continue to forecast strong productivity and cost savings initiatives in 2017, and don't expect input cost inflation.","Over the remainder of the year, we're focused on driving our North America core brands forward and achieving trial and repeat targets related to new product launches such as Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, Reese's and Hershey's Crunchers and Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup. We expect non-seasonal U.S. CMG trends to improve although the growth rate is slightly lower than our previous forecast.","As a result, for the full year 2017, we estimate full year net sales growth around the low end of the 2% to 3% range, including a net benefit from acquisitions of about 0.5 points. We expect the impact of foreign currency exchange rates to be minimal versus our previous estimate of a 25 basis point headwind.","As I stated earlier, we expect adjusted gross margin expansion to be greater than our previous estimate. Additionally, our brands typically respond positively to marketplace investment, and we expect that advertising and related consumer marketing expense as well as SG&A will increase for the full year 2017 versus 2016. Combined with the lower tax rate, we expect 2017 adjusted earnings per share diluted to be towards the high end of the 7% to 9% range.","Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on the second quarter. Given the timing of Easter and the expected lower sales in China, second quarter net sales growth is expected to be lower than the full year growth rate.","In Q2, we're targeting investment tax credit expense that flows through the other income and expense line to be about $10 million. And that should result in a second quarter tax rate of about 26%.","Additionally, Q2 advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase mid to high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Therefore, we expect the Q2 increase in EPS to be lower than the full year EPS growth rate.","Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you, everyone. Question \u2013 two for me. First, you've reduced your sales guidance, raised your gross margin guidance. Thank you, I appreciate some of the color you gave on the call today about that. I'm just curious maybe if you could help us bucket how much of that change in terms of the increase in the gross margin or maybe I guess the decrease in the COGS is due to cost savings versus maybe some commodity costs like dairy coming in maybe a bit more favorably than what you were looking for.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Patricia, do you want to handle that one?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. The overall year-over-year increase is primarily driven by the efficiency and cost savings initiatives that our supply chain is delivering for us in COGS. The change between what we gave guidance to you on a few weeks ago, the biggest driver of that is the lower expectations around input cost inflation.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Follow-up for me would be, last week, and I know they've talked about this before, but CVS has been discussing a little more aggressively moving some candy away from their checkouts. I appreciate Hershey's, there are some offsets there in terms of what Hershey can add to the front of store and so forth. And I'm just curious a little bit how you're looking at the risk of other customers may be following CVS' footsteps, or maybe you're thinking this is more of a one-off situation. Just trying to get some of your thoughts on what's happening there.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Absolutely. So as you know, we work closely with all of our retail customer partners. And I think we mentioned last July that we were partnering with CVS on some of the work that they were doing around evolving their store layouts. And we partner with all of our retailers along those lines. And March 1st, we mentioned a different customer we're also working with those efforts on.","I guess how I would tell you to think about it is, we service a broad range of retail customers. They all have very different strategies. And as some of our customer partners are making certain decisions on portfolio regarding store layout or front end, we have other of our customer partners who are actually looking to add incremental space behind confection, who are looking to take some other non-durable goods off the front end and put increased consumables and edibles; either overall at the front of store or as they have built their self checkouts and they hadn't yet built impulse around those. So we feel good about the growth we're seeing in the marketplace in indulgent categories. And if you look at the growth in categories, in indulgence and better-for-you, we're seeing growth across both and we have several customers who are really looking to leverage that growth.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move next to David Driscoll of Citi. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you so much. Good morning.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I wanted to ask about the revenue guidance. If the April year-to-date is expected to be at 2.5%, then maybe I'm just curious why guide to the low end of the 2% to 3%. Why guide to the 2% number? Said differently, if the full year average is 2%, doesn't that mean like the second half of the year would need to be something like 1.5% in order to kind of weight it out? And basically, this just comes down to why do you expect this to be a slowdown from this 2.5% rate of growth that you talked about year-to-date through April? Thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thanks, David. No, I would say two things. First of all, if you think about year-to-date, a large part of the acceleration of growth was driven by Easter. So, Easter is a big piece of what you see year-to-date. At the same time, we really look at the impact of the slowdown that we saw in the total box in Q1. And we saw that have an impact on everyday.","So as we look at the balance of the year, we are looking for our everyday business to accelerate. And we believe that that takes to make for the back half of the year is very achievable. We'll be looking at ensuring we have adequate investments. So we'll actually have some higher levels of spending in the back part of the year to drive that acceleration in the form of advertising. And we feel good about that. But a lot of it is that Easter, the big boost in Easter and we really are looking and calling for an acceleration of everyday as we go into the back part of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is open.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. I just have two quick ones. One is just a follow-up to David's question. When you look at the 2.5% year-to-date sales growth through April, could you disaggregate that between like seasonal growth and non-seasonal growth, kind of, how is it going year-to-date? If you did that already, I'm sorry I missed that.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. If you \u2013 without getting in too many specifics, if you think about that year-to-date performance, you would see seasonal items grew about double digits. So think about that in that double-digit range. And if you look at our non-seasonal core power brands, kind of the biggest five brands, they were up mid-single digits. So, obviously, there was a little bit of softness across some of the non-core piece of our portfolio. But really double-digit growth on seasonal is what's a big component of 2.5%.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just to...","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","This was all planned to be the driver of Q1 no matter how the box started the year. I think looking out over the remaining parts of the year and where the in-store merchandising and programming from S'mores to the innovation, that all comes the remainder of the way. So I think we feel pretty good about that.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up then on the level as SM&A that's down in the quarter. So when I see advertising flat, trade promotion down and then SM&A overall down. I guess what you're telling me is that in Q2 it's going to start to pick up. So as I think about this being more of a reinvestment year, it sounds like that really starts in earnest in the second quarter. Is that the right way to look at that? So SM&A probably will be up as a percentage of sales?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yes, that's right. So in the first quarter, trade was down as we lapped some incremental trade merchandising that we had shared with you last year. We made some big investments in incremental trade. And as we have constantly worked to optimize our blend across trade and advertising, we made some different decisions this year. And yes, our advertising expense was closer to flat in Q1. And as we go out to the balance of the year, we'll see increases.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Two really short ones on the input costs side of things. Are you already starting to see some deflation on the cocoa side within that or is it other ingredients that you're seeing release on? And then on price realization in the U. S., you've obviously got good price realization this quarter with the cutback in promotional spending. Do you anticipate that, that will continue throughout the year even if competition steps up and maybe given further deflation on the input cost side? Thank you and I'll pass it on.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Thanks, Alexia, it's Patricia. Let me talk about the input cost first. So, as you know, we hedge a number of our input costs, our commodity basket out somewhere between 3 months and 24 months. We don't hedge all of them. There a few commodities for which there is not a good market to do that and those obviously flow-through directly in the year. So it's a mix of both of the pieces that you're talking about. And that's what we're seeing come through that allowed us to raise our gross margin guidance.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And then on the pricing?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","On the price realization, you definitely saw the biggest impact of that in the first quarter. As Michele said, we're lapping some heavier direct trades that we put in, in the U.S. We're also not seeing a repeat of a lot of trade and recurrent discounts and allowances that we had in China last year. So the biggest impact of that price realization is absolutely in the first quarter and we would expect it to moderate over the rest of the year.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning everybody.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Just two things. One, with your margin targets that you laid out at the Analyst Day going out to 2019. I know you've given some pieces here and there to help put it together. But if we take it sort of all in and we think about how that margin comes through in either from gross margin versus SG&A. Just trying to get a better sense of holistically whether it's more heavily weighted out to 2019 between one or the other or fairly equal?","And then just curious if some of the lower tax rate you've talked about, given some of the reorganizations you're doing. Is that thought to be more sustainable going forward as well?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","I'll go ahead and tackle those. So what we said is that we would expect improvement in our operating margin to be about half COGS and about half SG&A. And we're on track to continue to deliver that. Yes, I would expect that, overall, the tax rate, all things being equal in the tax world to be sustainable going forward.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks, everyone. I guess just to follow up on some of the snack, sort of the snackfection initiatives that you have had in place for the past few quarters, perhaps if you could just give us an update on the momentum of KRAVE and barkTHINS. And given some of the weakness you saw in non-seasonal and the confectionery part of the portfolio, how immune were takeaway trends in these adjacent categories to the broader weakness that we saw across food industry in Q1?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, we have continued to see some very strong growth on barkTHINS as we are still in the process of driving against expanding distribution and gaining trial amongst consumers on that franchise.","So, I would say given the big piece of the growth curve that we're on, on that business; we've continued to see very strong growth there. And I think we mentioned that it was a pretty significant piece of growth for us in Q1. And as I look at KRAVE, we're continuing to feel good about the momentum that we are seeing there. So we've continued to gain share.","We feel good about where velocities are. Like any new brand, we're learning in terms of really optimizing how we make sure that we drive that hardest in the right \u2013 to the right consumers and into the right channels. So, in some cases, we overextended distribution, and we've right-sized that a bit. But we continued to see very nice growth there.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks Michele.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thanks. I just wanted to try to get a sense of how aggressive the assumptions are for back half growth in North America. A couple of headwinds I thought I saw was, unlike in the first half, where you were shipping ahead of consumption, you're probably going to ship behind consumption in the back half, because you're up against a December launch from the Cookie Layer Crunch item?","And then the second element, I guess, I would raise is, it requires every day confectionery to start reaccelerating. And I think it also seems to imply that the non-core piece also gets better, too. Is that correct that all those things kind of have to happen and to what degree? Is it \u2013 does your consumption have to improve also? Or can the consumption kind of continue on at 2.5 points in the first half and 2.5 points in the second half. That's a lot of questions, but I hope you can help.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So \u2013 yeah. Our consumption and retail takeaway does not have to be at 2.5 points. So we're actually planning for the takes to make there to be less than that, closer to slightly below 2 points.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","More in line with the takes to make.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, exactly. In line with the takes to make on that sales end. And we anticipate that generally, our net sales and our takeaway are directionally pretty in line. So you're right that we had a big benefit in shipments in Q4 behind Cookie Layer Crunch. But as we look out to the back half of the year, across all the quarters, we think that we'll be relatively in line, plus or minus in that 0.5 point range.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele, I'm wondering if you could speak a bit more on the top line algorithm in terms of the net pricing contribution? I think since the start, we've seen Hershey's implement a sizable list price increase every few years. But it seems that now trade promotion is becoming a larger component. And looking at the price points of some of the recent launches, mix is also now a much larger factor as well. So as you think about those levers on pricing, list prices, the mix, the trade support, how is the category or consumer changing, and maybe what are your analysts telling you about managing that balance going forward?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. That's a great question. I mean, obviously, we can't speak directly to pricing or any kind of foreshadowing around the pricing piece. But I would say that we think about all of those as very viable levers and probably even more so today than we did in the past. So I think you're right that price mix is something we aggressively have our teams focused on, which we can drive through, focus on pack-types, focus on channels, build it into the innovation. And I think perhaps that's a lever that we have not used as aggressively in the past.","We've spoken to you before about our whole focus on strategic revenue growth management and a lot of that as well is about really maximizing that net price realization by really, really scrutinizing all of the investments we make in trade and getting the value equation right on every pack-type and brand. So, we're putting more focus there than we have in the past.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. And I'd add if you remember on March 1st that we talked about 2018, and we just talked about looking at the most productive SKUs and do we need to have all these different pack-types out there. We said, no. It could be a little bit of a headwind in 2018. We're, actually \u2013 there's a little bit in 2017 less than what we had expected from 2018. But to your point, that's how we're thinking about it.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So, maybe just to build on that. In terms of the cognizance around the year-to-date softness in your non-core brands thus far. Is that softness more a function of reduced brand support on your end, or maybe just managing that as expected, or is it more of a change in consumer preferences where these drags are continuing for the non-core part of the portfolio?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Well, I guess I'd say if I think about the first part of the year, I'd look and say Easter drove a lot of sales. And there is some sourcing from Easter across the base portfolio. So, I think it's hard to look just at the everyday business trends because there's interaction there with Easter.","Certainly, I feel good about the fact that we have increased consumer investment as we go into the rest of the year, because we know that our category is very responsive. We continue to get very strong lift, and I feel really good that that combined with the very strong innovation that we have this year and customers are very excited about consumers are \u2013 are really going to help to drive consumers to the category and really boost the everyday business.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Pablo Zuanic of Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Just two questions. First up, can you comment on your exposure to the border adjustment tax either in terms of what percent of your sales in the U.S. or Mexico, or what percent of COGS come from outside the U.S. and contingency plans that you could have around that, please? And then the second question, are there any plans for J. P. Bilbrey to become a member of the Hershey Trust Board? Thanks.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Pablo, it's Patricia. I'll answer that. We continue to stay very close in monitoring all the proposals for tax reform out there. In terms of the border adjustment tax, specifically, the vast majority, over 85% of our U.S. product is sourced here in the U.S. We really want to do that to provide the freshest product sourced closest to our consumer. And that's an important part of satisfying our customer and our consumer.","As I said, we keep close look at all of our responses that would happen to any kind of tax reform. Frankly, without any details out there, it's hard to know what we would actually do. But we have a lot of contingency plans in the event that something does come out. In terms of your question about J.P., no, we would never comment on the Trust. That's a separate entity from us.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Right. And I just have a very quick follow-up. Regarding last week's announcements about all these adjustments you are making in terms of low-calorie in the various products that you sell. Would you say that these concerns are bigger than they were \u2013 with the consumer are bigger than they were one year ago or five years ago, or is it just this part continuing? It's just there seems to be a bigger issue now with the consumer than before. But correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So I would say, Pablo, we continue to see, if you at look category growth of various snack categories across the store that there is strong growth. There's growth in indulgence and there's also growth in health and wellness. So I don't know that I see a greater acceleration. We always start with the consumer in mind. And we are delighted to delight consumers with our indulgent portfolio.","At the same time, we've been a leader in choice and transparency, and we always want to provide options to consumers. Now our Hershey's Kiss was one of the first forms of portion control at 25 calories for a Kiss. We led the smart labeling initiative in the industry. So we are just constantly evolving and updating our portfolio to help to meet consumer needs as best possible.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm not sure if I caught this or if you said this earlier. So if you have, forgive me. But I guess in terms of just total snacking in North America in the first quarter, appreciate your comments about the CMG category and the non-seasonal maybe being a little softer than you thought. But was total snacking also just sort of softer in 1Q than you expected?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yes, it was. It was consistent with the total box. If you look at every category in the box, the trend was the same across the board. And as we mentioned in the comments, we think that there \u2013 I think everybody's been looking to say, okay, what was that factor that really drove that across the board, and common thinking tends to be the tax refund delay had a big impact. There were some lapping issues on a year-to-year basis. And then there's some continued pressures. But we feel good that we still see a rebound in March really. And we are focused on watching that very closely going forward.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. That's what I was just going to follow up on. It seems as we've gone through this reporting cycle, even Pepsi earlier today. It seems like it was better coming out of the quarter. Again just thinking about total snacking not specific categories, but it did seem like it improved coming out of the first quarter. And I guess that's what underlies your sort of confidence that it gets better throughout the rest of the year?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yes. And dollars per trip were actually up in March after having been down.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So yes. We have started to see that rebound and agree with that.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just one last one for me. In terms of the Easter holiday sales, was there any notable impact at all from a change in channel mix or sales from e-commerce? Is there anything that you've begun to see there where more of the sales might have shifted to online than previous years?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","No. Nothing that we saw there at all.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Strycula of UBS Securities. Your line is open.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning, guys. Two quick questions for you. The first would be on China. If I'm listening to Patricia's comments accurately, I think that the gross sales in China for the year sounds like Hershey \u2013 you're forecasting to lose implicit market share in China. If that is the case, can you clarify whether that's to local or multinational brands?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Thanks. Yeah, we are anticipating lower gross sales in China. And that would be a combination of competitive activity but also the overall impulse category in China and the way that's being addressed by the modern trade in particular. As Michele has laid out, we have a lot of change going on in our go-to-market model in China, looking at different brands, distribution models, cities, channels. And we expect that that will have some impact in our business in China for the rest of the year.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And a quick follow-up would be for the other expense and income item. What are you expecting that to be for the full year? You said the second quarter should be about $10 million.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","We said around $55 million.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","$55 million.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Got you. All right. thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Just one question on sources of growth in the U.S. It looks like if you look at the data, the chocolate continues to be a key driver for you and you're getting very good contribution and have continued to do this from Reese's and now doing so with line extensions. And you're getting nice smaller contributions from snack, mix is great, barkTHINS and a drag perhaps from non-chocolate candy. Do you see the general growth drivers remaining the same through the year? And what is your outlook to maybe improve the things that aren't working for you and improve upon maybe tough comparisons for Reese's and other? Thanks.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thanks for the question. Yeah, we continue to feel really good with the programs that we have on the core brands. And so I think in terms of the continuing the growth on something like Reese's, it is continuing the news. And some of our incremental investments in advertising towards the back part of the year will be made against those core brands to continue to leverage the momentum.","And then at the same time, we are absolutely focused on turning around and accelerating our growth trajectory on some of the other pieces of portfolio, namely on the non-chocolate sweets area. So we will be increasing our investment there. Although at the same time, we've right-sized those brands a bit. So as Mark mentioned, SKU rationalization, there are some areas where we have extended those brands and we had items in the marketplace that just weren't productive or profitable. And so we made a decision to take the hit on pulling back on some of that. But we do have teams very focused on accelerating the growth there. And I think that's an opportunity for us going forward.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Is your thinking on non-chocolate confectionery that that's simply not as well-positioned as some of your other categories and there's sort of a tip of the hat to the consumer trends in the day?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","No. I don't really think it's not as well-positioned. I would say, I think that we have opportunities to just fix our execution on that piece of the portfolio. There was a little bit more competition from smaller players last year where they went really aggressively on price. Some of the things that we weren't willing to do given our focus on margin. So I really think it's more about what we do versus that there's any kind of consumer trend issue there.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Your line is open.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks very much. Just a follow-up, kind of, detailed question and another detailed question. Do you ship any Easter at all in Q2, because I know when I go back to the quarter with the exact same calendar split in 2014, it looks like you shipped some Easter in Brazil in Q2, and that was 20 days in the second quarter. Now you have 16 days in the second quarter. If you could kind of clarify that. And if there's any shipment impact at all to Easter from it moving later?","And second question, if you don't mind, is how much of what's going on in China, you talked about, you took some PP&E write-down and this coincides with the ramp up of this Malaysia plant. Do any of those PP&E write-downs relate to the Malaysia plant costs? And how much, if you could \u2013 anyway of giving us a ballpark of how much of the absorption cost of that plant, which are presumably at below plant capacity, impacting gross margin on the quarter? Thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Sure. So, let me start, and then I'll transfer it over to Patricia. There is almost no \u2013 there is no shipment impact from that timing of Easter. I mean, we shipped almost nothing in terms of Easter into the second quarter. So that's not an issue at all. And relative to the write-offs, we feel great about Malaysia. So the write-offs that we talked about are not at all related to Malaysia.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","And in terms of the cost base, that came online April 1st of last year. So that impact will be getting smaller going forward or really going away in terms of fixed cost absorption.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","So you already would have taken the \u2013 I guess most pain for that that wouldn't really be a possibility going forward?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. It's all in the base now.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take a follow-up question from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Just a quick one about second quarter. I think you said it's your tougher comp on the revenue side also. I know its North America in particular has a tough comparison. Is it possible that revenue for the overall company would go negative in second quarter, or do you still think you're in positive territory?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. We still feel good that we're in positive territory. Yeah, the quarters always come in a little bit different depending on the promotion and innovation calendar. But there's nothing that we'd be fallen off that kind of a cliff in the second quarter.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Well, great. That's all we have operator. We'll thank everybody for joining us for today's call, and we'll be available for any follow up questions you may have.","Operator","We do have a follow up if you're available.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Okay. Well, patch in. Operator, thank you.","Operator","Very good. We do have a question from Kenneth Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","He, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I'll keep it short. On China, can you guys just talk about what is the key steps and timeline for us to get a better understanding of which markets you're going to go into? And how are you going to assess that situation? Can you talk about how we're going to be thinking about this in the timeline?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So as part of our Margin for Growth and Margin Expansion Program, we've started immediately in terms of taking the necessary steps to reset our investment in that marketplace and make some of the tough decisions. At the same time, the local teams have built very focused plans in terms of where we are focusing to grow and build a sustainable business model.","So we are focused on multiyear program. But beginning now to really focus on a couple of key provinces on our core portfolio and on a profitable mix of brands across the portfolio. As you all know, the cost structure in some of the channels in China have changed and so we are shifting to more profitable channels and really try to capture some of the growth both in the second and third tier cities as well as e-commerce. So it's a multi-year program that's underway now and I'd say we can continue to update you as the year goes on.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Do you plan on letting us into the information as you kind of feel like which cities, which avenues, which products or is it going to be one of the things we'll see in the results as they come? I just don't know what's the timing and how we should think about the strategy there?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. I mean, I think for competitive purposes, we prefer not to go into all of the details. But we can give some thoughts to you, what we can share that might help you as you're building your model.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And just my final question on China. The online side of it. How \u2013 what type of infrastructure do you have? Is that enough to offset some of the weaknesses across the other part of it and how do you see that growing over the next two years to three years?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","We see \u2013 we've done very well with online e-commerce in China. As it's a big piece of the marketplace, it's been a nice growth driver for our business. We've continued to see nice growth there and it is clearly amongst the channels, probably our number one area of focus from a channel perspective in that marketplace. So we have \u2013 we've built some infrastructure and that will continue to be a place that we'll want to invest in China going forward as in the U.S.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. I appreciate. Thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Okay.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Thanks so much for joining us today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company's Third Quarter 2014 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Dave Tacka, Senior Vice President and CFO; and I will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We also welcome those of you listening via the webcast. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2013 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss 2014 third quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $13.8 million or $0.05 per share diluted related to a noncash trade impairment charge cost associated with Project Next Century, a net gain related to the Shanghai Golden Monkey transaction and non-service-related pension income. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these charges.","With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","John P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. As expected, net sales, retail takeaway and market share sequentially improved versus our first half of the year trends. Our U.S. CMG, or candy, mint and gum, retail takeaway in the xAOC plus convenience store channels increased 3.3% and was about double the category growth rate. We gained market share in nearly every 4-week quad during the quarter and across every segment. That's chocolate, non-chocolate, gum and mint. Where we focused our investments, results were good.","Last quarter, we stated that there would be increased levels of in-store activity in the convenience store channel. I'll provide more detail in a moment, but C-store merchandising and programming generated 4% retail takeaway in this important channel.","I was also pleased with our marketplace performance in large mass and value channels. However, store traffic in the food channel was irregular in the third quarter. Our market share in the food channel increased 0.3 points in the third quarter, but category and Hershey growth was less than the historical growth rate of the category.","While preliminary Halloween sell-through in all channels, including food, is tracking with expectations, Halloween orders, merchandising and programming were executed in the marketplace, and we believe it's the right mix of seasonal-specific support that sets the stage for another winning season.","However, food channel nonseasonal candy during the third quarter and into October was soft. As a result, unfavorable product sales mix pressured profitability.","Similar to what we did in the C-stores, we have food channel-specific activity in the fourth quarter that we believe will improve upon these trends.","As was the case last quarter, broader snack category growth and in-store activity was present across many channels, although it tempered in Q3 versus the first half of the year increase.","Given this backdrop, I was pleased with the Hershey-specific programs by pack type and channel that was executed in the third quarter, enabling us to compete effectively and generate retail takeaway of 3.3%.","As it relates to the pricing action we announced in July, in the fourth quarter, we expect consumers will see higher nonseasonal everyday price points. As such, we expect an initial price elasticity impact to result in lower volume in both the fourth quarter and 2015.","We will work with our retail customers to ensure that the implementation of the price increase is supported with greater levels of advertising and the right mix of customer trade promotions and merchandising to reduce the impact of volume elasticity. As it relates to the buy-in, we estimate that about 0.75 points of net sales growth in the third quarter was attributable to volume, which normally would've shipped in the fourth quarter.","And I'm excited that we completed the initial closing of Shanghai Golden Monkey. The strength of their portfolio, manufacturing expertise and overall distribution capabilities, especially within the traditional trade, is an opportunity for us to leverage scale to make the iconic brands of both our companies even more powerful.","This acquisition will make China Hershey's second largest market by the year-end 2015 with anticipated net sales of around $500 million.","Now for some marketplace performance.","In the third quarter, Hershey's CMG growth in the xAOC+C channels was 2x the category growth rate. Specifically, the CMG category increased plus 1.6%. Gum continues to be a drag on total CMG performance, and excluding it, candy and mints was up a combined 2.3%. Total Hershey CMG retail takeaway for the third quarter in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business increased plus 3.3% with market share up 0.5 points.","As a reminder, this represents xAOC+C store data consisting of the food, drug, MassX and C-store channels, plus the inclusion of Walmart and Partial Dollar Club and Military channels.","Third quarter xAOC+C chocolate category growth was plus 2.3%. Given the upcoming Halloween and holiday season, we expect markedly greater chocolate category growth over the remainder of the year. Hershey's xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway was 3%, an acceleration from the 2% June year-to-date amount, resulting in a Q3 chocolate market share gain of 0.3 points.","We expect to build on our chocolate marketplace performance momentum over the remainder of the year given our strong seasonal plans to launch Brookside Crunchy Clusters and the new look and packaging of Hershey's Miniatures take-home packaged chocolate.","While early, the new advertising support on Hershey's Miniatures is showing positive results. Third quarter non-chocolate candy, or NCC, category growth was plus 1.8%.","Hershey's NCC retail sales increased to 2.7% with market share up 0.1 point. We're pleased with our Lancaster brand performance. However, we're lapping some Jolly Rancher innovation and the successful year-ago summer Twizzler promotion. Lancaster continues to show very positive results, and after 8 months in the market, is the leader within the soft caramels category. Trial and repeat is in line with expectations, and it's revitalizing the roughly $250 million caramel category that's up about 20% this year.","Lancaster sales were solid in the summer, but lower versus Q1 due to seasonality.","We expect sales to be strong in the fall and winter as merchandising support is executed in the marketplace. The aforementioned nonseasonal chocolate and non-chocolate activity should benefit the food channels where, as I mentioned, overall store traffic continues to be mixed. And we continue to do well within the gum and mint categories. Specifically, our Q3 gum and mint retail takeaway within the xAOC+C universe was up 16% and 6%, respectively.","As a result, our gum market share increased by 0.8 points, and we now have a 5.1% share of the market. Our mint market share increased by 0.1 points, expanding our segment-leading position to 39.5%.","In the C-store channel, Q3 CMG category growth was up 3.4%. Hershey's Q3 C-store retail takeaway increased 4%, driven by solid candy and mint performance, resulting in a 0.2 market share gain in this channel.","I was pleased with our C-store chocolate retail takeaway of 3.5%. The programs I mentioned last quarter such as the King of Summer program, the Coca-Cola and Reese's promotion and the 7-Eleven Big Gulp and King Size promotion drove our solid performance.","In the fourth quarter and into 2015, we have C-store merchandising and programming as well as innovations such as seasonal-shaped Reese's products and the 2015 launches of Kit Kat White Minis, Reese's Crunchy Cup and Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews that should enable us to win in the C-store channel.","I'd also like to provide you with an update on our category segment whose marketplace performance is excluded from the CMG Nielsen database.","The Hershey's Spreads launch is relatively in line with expectations. Trial is progressing, and in the third quarter, one of our larger retailers, the Hershey's Spreads' instant consumable pack type was the company's fifth-largest SKU at the front end.","Reese's Spread in a jar ships in Q4 and the instant consumable will launch in 2015.","Our entry into chocolate spreads is driving category growth of almost 20% this year. As a result, we're getting good collaboration from our retail partners.","Now moving to international. As expected, similar to last year's profile, third quarter international net sales increased in the teens, up 18.4%. China continues to do well and is the driver of our overall international net sales growth. China chocolate category growth increased 11% in Q3. The category is developing as anticipated with instant consumable and take-home growth both up double digits. Hershey third quarter retail takeaway was about 4x the category growth rate.","For Nielsen, our year-to-date market share is around 10%, driven by the Hershey's and Kisses brands, which have gained 0.9 and 0.7 market share points this year. We've carried our momentum into the fourth quarter and have begun shipping Reese's. It's been a milestone year for us in China and we're on track to achieve about $200 million in China chocolate net sales in 2014.","Third quarter net sales growth in Mexico and Brazil were slightly below our estimates. In the modern trade, chocolate category growth in Mexico was up about 4%. Hershey Mexico chocolate retail takeaway was up 6%, resulting in a modern trade chocolate market share gain of 0.4 points. Volume has been gradually improving throughout the year as consumers get used to the higher prices.","Trends in Brazil have improved versus the soft start to the year with third quarter net sales in both U.S. dollars and local currency up mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Year-to-date, the Brazil chocolate category, as well as Hershey retail takeaway, is up 1%.","Looking at the subsegment of chocolate wafer candy, Hershey's Mais retail takeaway is up 16% year-to-date. We'll look to build on our momentum here as it's a unique form in this competitive market.","Over the years, we've also had success in growing our international export business. Our products can be found in over 70 countries in both developed and emerging markets. We have a profitable export business model and targeted balanced growth with an objective of maintaining the right level of distributor inventory so consumers experience fresh product. Given macroeconomic challenges in some of these markets, demand has tempered. Our go-to-market philosophy of shipping to consumption applies to these markets as well.","As a result, we now expect full year international net sales growth, excluding the contribution from Golden Monkey, to increase low double digits. We're focused on the long term and believe the aforementioned challenges facing international export consumers is a short-term issue.","Dave will provide you with additional financial details of our Q3 results and our full year outlook, so let me now provide you with some of my closing thoughts.","Macroeconomic challenges persist, putting pressure on consumers and retailers. Over the remainder of the year and into 2015, we have targeted innovation, advertising, merchandising and programming to address the needs of consumers by channel and pack type. In the fourth quarter, holiday is tracking as expected, and we're excited about the launch of Brookside Crunchy Clusters, Reese's Crunchy Cup and Reese's Spreads. Along with the carryover benefit of our fourth quarter innovation, in 2015, we're bringing a lot of variety, news and excitement to the category with the new product launches of Kit Kat White Minis, Hershey's Caramels, Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews, Reese's Spreads instant consumable as well as some other yet-to-be-announced new products. These initiatives will be supported with greater level of advertising and related consumer marketing that's expected to increase in 2015 at a rate greater than sales growth. These initiatives should position us and to deliver against our objectives.","I remain optimistic about our future. Globally, the investments we're making in our scale chocolate brands and go-to-market capabilities are having the desired effect. Kisses and Hershey's are gaining momentum and are true global brands with around 45% and 25% of total brand sales now achieved outside the U.S.","Reese's is rolling out in a measured and well-supported pace in China, Mexico and Brazil and initial consumer response is in line with expectations. And Brookside continues to post strong double-digit sales growth and tests well in our international markets.","So there's a lot to be excited about. We have plans in place that positions us to win wherever we compete. Our brand-building model is evolving and we expect to grow market share across all of our key markets. We remain focused and know what we need to do to succeed and increase shareholder value.","I'll now turn it over to Dave, who will provide you with the financial details. Dave?","David W. Tacka","Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $1.96 billion increased 5.8% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.05, an increase of 1% from last year.","Organic net sales growth in the quarter was 6% and was driven primarily by volume. Foreign currency exchange rates, primarily involving Canada, were a 20 basis point headwind. Sales were driven by strong Halloween seasonal growth, new products and instant consumable items in the convenience store channel. Core brand and new product volume growth contribution to net sales were roughly equal in the quarter.","By geography, net sales increase included growth in North America and international markets of 4.2% and 18.4%, respectively.","Turning to margins. As expected, adjusted gross margin declined in the quarter, driven by higher input costs, primarily cocoa and dairy; greater levels of trade support for in-store merchandising and programming; and other costs related to executing the price increase. However, the 240 basis point decline in gross margin was greater than our forecast as a result of a less favorable sales mix, higher-than-forecast freight and warehousing costs related to the price increase and higher costs related to aged inventory, packaging material write-offs and the timing of certain fixed cost deferrals. In the fourth quarter, gross margin is expected to increase as the company begins to lap the higher input costs it began to incur in the fourth quarter of a year ago. However, as a result of the higher supply chain costs and expected lower sales volumes, we now expect full year gross margin to decline about 75 basis points versus 2013. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes in the third quarter increased 1% versus last year, generating adjusted EBIT margin of 19.4%, a 90 basis point decline versus last year. The decrease was due to the lower gross margin.","During the quarter, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 1%, while selling and administrative expenses declined 1%.","As we stated last quarter, GRPs, which are gross rating points or impressions, will be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year.","Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. Similar to last year, 2014 international sales growth is back half-weighted, given the timing of distribution gains, new product launches and seasonal growth.","Third quarter international net sales increased 18.4%, slightly below our estimates, primarily in Mexico and certain export markets. Net sales in China were solid and were in line with the retail takeaway that J.P. referenced. Plans are in place to generate similar results in the fourth quarter that should result in full year China chocolate net sales of around $200 million. In Brazil, third quarter net sales on a reported and constant currency basis increased about 5% versus last year.","In Mexico, third quarter net sales on a reported and constant currency basis declined about 4% versus last year. Our businesses in both Mexico and Brazil are improving, albeit slowly. As expected, the macroeconomic operating environment in both countries remains sluggish, and as a result, we continue to expect net sales in 2014 to be slightly below the prior year. As J.P. mentioned, fourth quarter order flow and demand in select international markets has tempered given macroeconomic headwinds. As a result, we now expect full year net sales growth outside the U.S. and Canada to increase low double digits versus our previous estimate of about a 15% increase. Note that this excludes the contribution from Shanghai Golden Monkey.","Moving down the P&L. Third quarter interest expense of $21 million was about the same as last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be around $85 million. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 34.8%, in line with our estimate. For the full year, we continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be around 34.5%.","For the third quarter of 2014, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately $224 million, leading to adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.05.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's third quarter by $224 million, $107 million of which is related to acquisitions.","Accounts receivable was higher by $127 million, primarily as a result of the Golden Monkey acquisition and the higher sales levels. Our global accounts receivable aging remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $138 million as a result of the Golden Monkey and China manufacturing facility acquisitions, together with some higher raw material inventory levels in North America. Accounts payable increased by $41 million, primarily as a result of the acquisitions.","Capital additions, including software, were $83 million in the third quarter. For the year, we now expect total capital expenditures to be about $360 million to $370 million, lower than our previous estimate of $380 million to $390 million, primarily due to timing related to the manufacturing facility we're building in Johor, Malaysia. Depreciation and amortization was $53 million in the third quarter, in line with our estimates.","During the third quarter, the company repurchased $75 million of outstanding shares against the $250 million repurchase authorization that was approved in February of 2014. Additionally, $31 million of common shares were repurchased to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. All $106 million of acquired shares were repurchased in the open market.","During the quarter, dividends paid were $115 million. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter of $575 million was in line with our forecasts. Seasonal working capital requirements, combined with closing on the Shanghai Golden Monkey purchase at the end of September, caused us to take on approximately $300 million of commercial paper debt in the U.S. that we will pay off in early November.","The balance of the short-term debt increase relates to the Golden Monkey acquisition and the needs in our other international markets.","The company remains well positioned to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions.","Now to summarize. We made progress in the third quarter as net sales, retail takeaway and market share improved versus the first half of the year. Halloween and holiday are tracking nicely. The company's chocolate business in China continues to be strong and is the driver of our international sales growth. However, challenges in nonseasonal sales growth, particularly in the U.S. food channel, combined with the pushback launch of Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews and weakness in certain international export markets, have caused us to lower our organic sales growth projection for 2014.","We now expect 2014 net sales to increase around 4.75%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rate and the contribution from Golden Monkey sales of about 0.75 points.","Given year-to-date results, combined with higher supply chain costs, unfavorable sales mix and lower sales volumes than previously forecast for the fourth quarter, we now expect full year gross margin to decline about 75 basis points versus 2013.","Total selling, marketing and administrative expenses will be about in line with a year ago as the company leverages investments made in go-to-market capabilities established over the last few years. As a result, the company anticipates 2014 adjusted earnings per share diluted growth for the full year to be around 8%.","The impact of Shanghai Golden Monkey in 2014 is minimal, given the late September closing date.","As J.P. summarized, we have a solid pipeline of targeted innovation, merchandising and programming that should drive pack type and channel growth in 2015. Additionally, advertising and related consumer marketing expense is expected to increase at a rate greater than net sales growth.","We're focused on the plans and investments to drive top line growth and believe these initiatives will resonate with consumers and be a catalyst that enables the CMG category to increase within its historical growth rate of 3% to 4%.","There are a couple of other items expected to impact 2015 sales growth. The company has signed a definitive agreement to purchase The Allan Candy Company in Canada for approximately $28 million. This company co-manufactures products such as Jolly Rancher Hard Candy and Lancaster Caramels for Hershey. It also has other confectionery product sales of around $30 million. The primary goal of the acquisition is to increase capacity and manufacturing capability for Hershey's sweets and refreshment products. The transaction will close upon completion of regulatory reviews, which we expect to be by the end of 2014. We will also make product line changes in India that will negatively impact sales growth by about 40 basis points. These changes include the termination of edible oil sales as our brand license expires. We will also rationalize certain other low-margin products as we focus on our product portfolio. As a result of these, we expect 2015 net sales to increase about 7% to 9%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a contribution from acquisitions of around 2.5 points. We continue to be a gross-margin-focused company and expect that the previously announced pricing action, as well as productivity and cost savings, will result in gross margin expansion in 2015.","We expect increases in advertising and direct marketing expenses to increase faster than sales and continued SG&A cost discipline. The resulting growth in adjusted earnings per share diluted is expected to be in the 9% to 11% range.","Thank you for your time this morning. J.P., Mark and I will now take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I guess, the question, just looking forward into 2015 and trying to get a sense for -- there's a lot of moving parts and just trying to get a sense for how aggressive your underlying plan is for next year. So if I kind of think about headwinds and tailwinds this year, probably the biggest hurdle was that gross margins came in below expectations. And even though you had sales softer than expected in nonseasonal, now in the food channel and you've had some softness in the export business, the biggest sort of hurdle from an earnings perspective was gross margins coming in below expectations. So can you just kind of frame for us, as you think about high end, low end of your guidance range for next year, some of the puts and takes that are important in terms of getting you to the top end versus the low end and whether this guide for '15 maybe has some more flexibility or some more caution into it than maybe what you were looking at when you started '14?","David W. Tacka","Okay. Well, Bryan, I'll start with that. When we look at the gross margin and the issues for this year, the biggest issue really wound up being around our commodities and the dairy costs and we've really addressed that with our pricing action that we've taken. In addition, we did, here in this quarter, have some additional issues around some obsolescence things and we'll be able to fix those. I mean, essentially, we didn't adjust to some of our production schedules as quickly as we probably should have in light of how the sales were changing. So fundamentally, overall, we continue to be on track with our productivity initiatives, and so we expect that we'll be able to continue to improve gross margin in 2015 and stay true to our business model where the margin will also increase enough to be able to be increasing our advertising faster than our sales growth next year, which is part of our plan to support the price increase.","John P. Bilbrey","Bryan, I would just add to what Dave said that I think one of the learnings we have from this year is really around how we executed by channel and some of the specificity of what we were seeing in channel. So I think from -- if I were able to change one thing this year, would really be around our quality merch on a channel-specific basis. So we're going to be doing more precision marketing as we go forward. And what you saw in the third quarter is the place is based on planning cycles where we were able to do that as we knew we were going to sequentially improve through the year in North America. We saw good results from doing that. So I think you'll see us ensuring that we're getting the right merchandising levels by channel to be able to win in the marketplace.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So is it fair to say, as we kind of look into '15, that your plan doesn't assume that there is going to be a real imminent reacceleration of growth in the food channel? You're still expecting that the export business in the next year will be soft. I guess you're expecting gross margins will expand, but it's -- you're not -- some of these issues that sort of have hit you, especially in the second half this year, it's not like you're expecting an immediate reacceleration incorporated in the guidance that you gave us.","John P. Bilbrey","No, I think the things that are in our control, we will be doing what I hope to be a better job of making sure that we've got the right support by channel to continue to win share, which we're doing that. I think there's caution globally around just the consumer environment in general. So there's probably some of that in our thinking, but I think we'll be executing very aggressively.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC","So I guess following up a little bit. So if I read you right, you have 4.5% to 6.5% organic net sales growth for next year, which, if I'm getting the -- and correct me if I'm wrong here, if I'm getting the price contribution, if I look at the list price, the region that's in, that's essentially looking for no volume growth for next year? And the last time you implemented a price increase, you did see volumes drop off, as to be expected, but maybe a little bit less substantially. I guess, in light of a little bit better consumer spending situation now than in, say, 2011, if you could just -- first of all, let me know if I have my math right about that for 2015, and I guess, a little bit more detail on why that is.","David W. Tacka","Yes, I think as you think about 2015, what I tried to point out in the comments is that we're doing some product line changes in India that have about 40 basis points headwind into the sales growth. So I think overall, in organic, without that, we would still expect to be in about that 5% to 7% range. And so I think for next year, what we're looking at is we're looking at price to be about 6.5%, and we're probably -- depending on how the sell-through and the conversions go, we would expect to have volume declines against that of somewhere from 0% to 2%. And of course, we would be being helped with that with some of the innovation and with the advertising and the other things that we would be typically doing to respond to the price increase.","Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC","Got you. And I guess that leads into -- the last time you took a big price increase in '11, '12, you raised ad spending over that period pretty dramatically, yet -- I mean, relative to sales. But that was off a much lower base and we've talked about how maybe you're at a more sustainable level now. Do you -- would you see ad spending as a percent of sales growing next year?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think that what you would see is that we'll continue to probably spend in a range of, call it, 2x sales growth. If you remember, when we were growing advertising in the previous price increase, it was off of a very low base. As you point out, we feel as though, at our current level of spending, we're probably at the right level to support the brand. So we always model these at about a 1:1 ratio. That's how we've modeled this one. We've done better in some of these, but that's how we model it and that's how we build it into our plan.","Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC","And just one last, detailed question. That little impairment you took, what brand was that? Or what region did that come from at least?","David W. Tacka","What -- we have to do impairment tests on our intangibles each year and this is particularly related to the Mauna Loa macadamia nut brand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You hinted that Hershey will be pushing back against the competitive in-store merchandising you're seeing, particularly in C-store channels and particularly with the instant consumables. There was king-size display activity you said you're rolling out, your limited editions. How would you say this incremental merchandising is working for you so far?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, I think we're very pleased with the results we got in both 3Q in C-stores. We saw it in Mass and a couple of other channels where we were able to increase our quality merch. We got really good results. The planning cycles there and our ability to respond are shorter than some of the other channels. So if we go back and analyze the first half of the year and some of the areas where, frankly, we -- you could say we got beat or we didn't merchandise at the levels we thought we should, we didn't get the results we wanted. And so we're really correcting for that and we felt really good about the results we were able to get. And so we're building that into our plans going forward. And then of course, as you know, in the first half, we weren't as chocolate-driven as we are in the second half and that's made a difference as well.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And one final question. On the resealable pouches, it seems that Hershey, over several years here, has been rolling out the -- that pouch-packaged Minis and Pieces and putting some advertising and merchandising activity behind that per brand. York has been the most recent benefit of this. Do you see that packaging rollout continuing to hit more and more of your business? Or is that benefit perhaps running its course as you get across the brands?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think one way to think about it is we see package innovation that can support occasions as a really important insight. So I think what you'll see from us is that we have a number of package innovations that we're testing and looking at that we -- we're pretty excited about. So yes, the pouches have been successful for us. It gets good price realization on the sizes, and it gets us into some places we haven't been, and we're going to continue to pursue some of those innovations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. I guess, a year ago, you raised your long-term growth target on the bottom line and a lot of things have gone against you since then. Now you're kind of not surprisingly kind of suggesting that the global markets, emerging markets are a bit more challenging, but you've got a lot of incremental, let's say, EBIT coming from those emerging markets if you, in fact, make your, call it, 10-plus percent margin goals. And so I'm kind of wondering how that all fits together, granted it's like a 2017 question. But is that -- are there things at risk here given that international is that much more challenging and that's a pretty big part of what grows your EBIT over the next couple of years?","David W. Tacka","Well, I think where we're at, Eric, is our goal continues to be to get to the 10% level in international. And as things sit in 2014, our biggest issue was really around the commodities and then some other costs that sat in the gross margin that I talked about earlier. I think we've taken steps to get those into line. With respect to the international growth, our China business continues to do very well. You're right, we're a little bit behind where we were tracking as we wanted to do that with respect to India and Latin America. So we may be a little bit later depending on the levels of investment that we continue to make and how we're able to kind of work through those couple of markets. But overall, I don't see any of those as being big risks to the overall corporate targets that we expect to hit in 2017.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And if I can just -- one follow-up. I think it's on -- maybe kind of following up on Bryan's question earlier in 2015. It seems like the one input that you can't really control is dairy and some -- there have been some players in the market who have suggested that dairy may come down. Others are less optimistic. Kind of how are you thinking about dairy costs into next year and in your plans for gross margins being up next year, have you basically assumed that dairy kind of remains where it is? Or did you expect some possible benefit in that?","David W. Tacka","Well, I guess, I don't want to really get into our specific view of individual market -- of individual commodities, but what I would say is we've taken our best shot at what we believe the market would do. And also, I alluded a bit earlier in the inventory discussion that we have taken on a little bit of additional inventory and some of that is also to help us with our dairy cost visibility for next year. So we think we've taken our best shot at where we're at, but you're right, there'll be an element of risk to that as we go through 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just as we think out to 2015, a key part, obviously, of your sales growth will be a category returning back to that sort of historic 3% to 4% level that you mentioned in the prepared remarks. In the third quarter, I guess, the CMG category seemed, from your numbers, to decelerate sequentially, even when you exclude the gum portion. And that was with, I think, some incremental activity in innovation and whatnot that you brought to the market in the third quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense, what drove that? And obviously, what bends the trend, as you see it, to get back to a 3% to 4% category growth rate next year? And then I've just got a follow-up.","Mark K. Pogharian","Yes. Andrew, before J.P. jumps in, I don't know if you're looking at Q2 or year-to-date, but Q2 certainly would've been impacted by the late Easter.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. I think I was comparing 3Q versus the first half that you talked about on your second quarter conference call. The overall category sequentially decelerated in the third quarter from the first half level.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, if I look at 3Q, I think what we're saying for CMG was up about 1.6 points. If you look at us, we were up about 3.3 points. So I think that...","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I'm talking about category here.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, yes, that's what I was talking -- yes, that's what I'm referring to there. If you look at chocolate in particular, it was about 2 to 3 for the category, we were at about 3. So again, I think one of the key differences for us was really around the acceleration of merchandising and winning in the store every day. We had a bit of a different lag in the food channel and a lot of that was that we didn't -- we weren't able to get into the planning to be able to get the kind of incremental coverage and merchandising that we did in the other channels. So I think that was a key difference. There was a difference in trips and so on, some of the everyday items. One of the things that we're observing is as you look at advertising effectiveness when you have trips that decline, that instant consumable piece of your business also doesn't have the same effectiveness as it would before. So it's really important for us to be able to get the right merchandising to get those brands to be responsive as well. So I think all of those things are happening. I think on the good news side, for snacking in general, there's elements of that in total, which I think continues to do very well. Consumers continue to eat on the go. They're looking for different alternatives there. So we continue to be very optimistic from that standpoint. I think our view is that we just have to execute well on a by-channel basis, maybe better more so than we have -- did in the first half.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then one last one. It looks like, at least by my quick math, you need about 100 basis points of gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter to hit the down 75 basis point gross margin look for the year. Is that just a combination of a little bit of the pricing kicking in and lapping some of the higher sort of incremental costs from last year? And is that...","David W. Tacka","I think you've got it pretty well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions. First, just to come back to gross margins. I definitely appreciate that dairy stayed higher for longer than anticipated and that creates some challenges when volumes are weak and you're waiting -- and pricing is such a structured process. I guess what I'm wondering is, when you run into problems meeting your gross margin target due to sort of persistent higher prices in a discrete commodity, does this call into question whether you maybe should be pursuing more aggressive productivity initiatives on an ongoing basis so you have greater flexibility to work through discrete issues like this as they arise?","David W. Tacka","Well, I mean, I think that our productivity efforts -- our goal is to try to be getting as much out of them as we're able to. So to hold a little bit in reserve in case we miss the commodity guesses or the commodity forecasts probably isn't how we would really like to operate. We certainly push forward and we certainly did, in 2014, put additional focus into productivity. We've put additional focus into SG&A discipline, and we also took a closer look at our DME. So I mean, I think we did that across the P&L, but the amounts that we had were just more than we could reasonably deal with this year.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And so for 2014, just in terms of quantifiable productivity, is that going to end up being higher than what you would've sort of targeted on a long-term basis?","David W. Tacka","Well, in terms of if you look at it strictly within gross margin, it's going to be about in line with what we were looking at on a long-term basis. But it actually hurt a bit because of the volume changes, that we weren't able to get quite the level of benefit from some of the productivity things we were implementing. And then similarly, some of the shipping patterns and that around the price increase also had some adverse impacts.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the C-store trends you highlighted. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the broader consumer environment, the acceleration you saw sequentially. Would you chalk most of that up to an improvement in quality merchandising? Or is there a portion of that, that you would, based on what you observed across the channel, would consider just a macro tailwind from gas prices, something along those lines?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, to talk about gas prices, we tend not to try to allow fuel costs get into our forecast, if -- we've seen a lot of different things happen over the years. When fuel prices were really high, sometimes you saw that the consumer put half a tank of gas in and they still went inside the store, and in some instances, we benefited from that. With gas prices being lower, you could say that we benefit because people aren't spending as much at the pump and they're going inside. So we actually don't try to derive too much from the cost of fuel. We really look at what's happening from traffic. So I think you continue to have a bifurcation of the consumer. I think the people at the top, if you will, are experiencing what I would call more normal kinds of times and habits and then I think you have folks that have kind of adjusted to their circumstances. So they may not necessarily have the job they want but they have one but yet they recognize this is how things are going to be and they've adjusted for that. So you see promotion effectiveness being lower from a price standpoint because people don't necessarily always have the cash to buy forward and take advantage of that or they believe something will be on sale at some point in time. So a lot of the things you've heard discussed in the CPG space, we certainly see as well. The big thing for us is really being in front of the consumer, making sure our instant consumable piece of the business is working hard for us. Consumers have costs that they didn't have before. The good news is health care is available but yet that's a cost maybe some people didn't have before. We all saw the impact of SNAP and we've also seen fewer trips, but yet, the good news is basket size seems to be holding up, and in some cases, growing. So I think we're just going to have to continue to work our way through here. So I'm not sure we have a lot of new insights to add, but we're certainly seeing a lot of things we're hearing our peers talk about as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First off, just an observation. For a company that's growing its EPS at 8%, several hundred basis points above the group, this is one of the tougher years that I've seen from you guys, just given these fairly constant reductions in both the revenues and the gross margins outlook. I think Bryan nailed it when he asked you guys what's your confidence in 2015. And J.P., if I could just push you a little bit on this thing, do you have real fundamental confidence that the outlook has a robust nature enough such that we're not going to be going through this every quarter? There's margin problems, revenue problems, that we're not on the bleeding edge of the forecast. Can I just start there? And I mean, it's the #1 question we're getting from everybody this morning.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes -- no, David, I'm optimistic about our business model. I don't think there's anything fundamentally wrong. Obviously, we learn. We have to adapt. You can't do the same thing forever and expect to continue to win. But I think the visibility we have on our brands, the things we're working with retailers, I feel good about. Even though we've talked about the export markets, look, those are prudent business decisions. I mean, we could have pushed into some of those businesses, but you put at risk what your results will be then following from that. So I think we're being wise and prudent around some of those things we can't see around the corner well on. But the things that are within our control, I think we have good plans. I think we've got a ton of runway and our strategies were, I'll call it, doubling down on China, if you will, in terms of what we think is possible there. So I feel good about things. And I think that we want to give ourselves some space here that we don't have surprises. We've got good visibility, I think, as best we can in terms of commodities. I'm glad to see that milk prices have -- dairy has softened some here. But I don't know if that's short term, long term, but we'll sure take it while we've got it. And from a cocoa standpoint, we've had a little bit of easing there. So there's some of the things on the cost side are good. We're rigorously looking at our operations all the time in terms of where we can find productivity and yet we continue to -- we're at a historic point in time for the company where we're investing in our future. So I'm not going to be overly concerned with a quarter that we may not be hitting our long-term aspirations but, boy, I believe that we're in a very good place in terms of the company's long-term outlook and potential, and we're going to continue to execute against that.","David W. Tacka","David, what I would add is as we look at '15 versus '14 gross margin, yes, I think we had some issues in '14 and really the persistent dairy cost and not adjusting quickly enough to some of the volume changes put some costs in there that I think we've taken steps to address. So I think we're rightly positioned for 2015.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two other quick ones. On the fourth quarter revenue build, I think the implied organic number is somewhere around 4.5%, and I think it should be kind of mostly price. But first off, do I have that right? And is that an actual deceleration from where the organic growth was in the third quarter? If so, can you just talk about the kind of the pressures quarter-to-quarter? I don't mean to be too crazy about this, but Andrew, again, another good question, trying to just get an understanding on the sequential movements and if there's a softening into Q4. I think it deserves maybe just a little bit of explanation.","David W. Tacka","Yes, I mean, I think the -- excluding the Shanghai Golden Monkey, the fourth quarter growth that's implied is around the 4%. And so within that, we are expecting about 5% of price.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then comparison to 3Q, I mean, do you see it softening a little bit?","David W. Tacka","Well, I think what we've said is in the fourth quarter, given the export and some of the softness in the food channel, that, that's kind of the thing that's been taking down the -- it is the reason that we took down the full year guidance.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Final question. The inventory obsolescence charges, quite honestly, I had kind of hoped to never hear those words again on your calls. I had the visions of the 2005 and '06 periods when all those limited editions were being -- inventory obsolescence charges that seem to never end. Is this a minor issue? Is this just some planning that went on in the -- or I think you mentioned changeovers or you didn't respond quick enough. Is this inventory obsolescence issue that you called out for the quarter, is that something that spills into Q4 and Q1 of next year? Or is it pretty much wrapped up here?","David W. Tacka","There could be a little that would carry over into Q4, but it won't carry beyond that.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, it's very internal, David. It's not a marketplace issue at all.","David W. Tacka","Right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'll keep my questions to one question. Shanghai Golden Monkey, I believe when you closed the deal, you said it was $205 million in sales in 2013 and that appears to be the forecast for '15 as well. I think when you originally announced it, the expectation was that it would be $225 million. I'm just trying to really understand why the reduction in the size of sales and why no growth expected for 2015, unless I'm getting my math wrong. And then maybe how are you integrating the business?","David W. Tacka","Well, yes, I think there's probably 2 things as you go through that. First, as we started on this, there was -- there's some adjustments between sort of how they keep their accounting in U.S. GAAP that had a little bit of impact in terms of where the sales were. But then in addition to that, just as we're basically working to be generating the synergies and actually take over the business, there's just some changes in the business that caused us to just want to make sure we're being cautious in terms of how we're defining how we get started. Because in terms of working with the distributors and how we're working with what products will be sold in what channel, what of our stuff is going to be through Golden Monkey's channels and what of theirs through ours.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Are you rationalizing the SKU count? Are you reducing inventory...","David W. Tacka","There is some of that also.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Just made the cut here, so I'll be very brief. The first will be in a bit of a follow-up to the fourth quarter. And really, as we look through the year, you did talk about some sales pulled forward into the third quarter. Does that mean those come out of the fourth quarter, if you will? I think related to that, or in addition to that, would be what your FX assumption is for the year, if I could, please.","David W. Tacka","Well, with respect to the first, our -- the guidance, as we're talking about it, reflects the shift between the third and the fourth quarter. So that's really reflected in terms of what we're talking about going forward. And then secondly, with respect to FX, we're probably looking at about a half, 50 basis points for the full year, and it's pretty much in line with what we had forecast. We forecasted it to be heavier in the first half and lighter in the second half.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could, just one follow-up. Dave, in relation to dairy costs and I know those are high, but they were really trending higher in the fourth quarter of last year. Based on that degree of pricing you're coming through -- or expected to come through in the fourth quarter, it would seem like you could offset your cost inflation in the fourth quarter. Would that be an accurate assumption?","David W. Tacka","Yes. I mean, we're expecting to see gross margin increase in the fourth quarter versus last year.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And then hopefully you'll be able to overcome costs, okay.","David W. Tacka","Yes, yes.","Mark K. Pogharian","All right.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company's Third Quarter 2013 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you, Phyllis. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Dave Tacka, Senior Vice President and CFO, and I will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We also welcome those of you listening via the webcast.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on our current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2012 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section.","Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss 2013 third quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $5.9 million or $0.01 per share diluted, which were related to costs associated with the Project Next Century program, non-service-related pension expense, and acquisition and integration cost.","Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","John P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark. I want to thank all of you on the phone and webcast for joining us today. Hershey had another good quarter with organic net sales of 6.6%, driven by core brand and new product volume growth, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.04. And I'm pleased with our marketplace results as we gained market share in every major channel within the segments of chocolate, mint and gum in the third quarter and year-to-date period.","Specifically, Hershey's CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, xAOC+C-store retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending October 5, 2013 in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business was up 5%, resulting in a 0.7 point market share gain. Year-to-date, Hershey U.S. retail takeaway and market share is up 6.7% and 1.2 points, respectively.","Third quarter CMG category growth in the xAOC+C channels was up plus 2.5%. However, similar to the last few years, gum continues to be a drag on total CMG performance, and excluding it, the category was up 3.9%.","Hershey's Q3 xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway was plus 5.2%, resulting in a gain of 0.5 points of chocolate market share. Core brands such as Kit Kat and Reese's, as well as Brookside, all gained share.","Third quarter non-chocolate candy or NCC, xAOC+C category growth was plus 3.5%. Hershey NCC new products in 2013 consisted of Twizzlers Bites and Jolly Rancher Bites in take-home pack types only.","As a result, we did not keep up with category growth.","Additionally, we're also lapping very successful year-ago NCC innovations and promotions, hence, Hershey's NCC retail takeaway in Q3 was up less than 1%. This resulted in a market share loss of 0.5 points.","As some CPG companies have noted, Q3 FDMx traffic was mixed. However, Hershey's Q3 FDMx CMG growth was 3.4%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.4 points. Here, our results were driven by the food class-of-trade, which generated solid CMG retail takeaway of 5.1%.","As it relates to Halloween orders, merchandising and programming, we're executing on the plans agreed upon with our retail partners. Sell-through is on track, and we believe we have the right mix of seasonal-specific advertising, coupons and programming support that sets the stage for another winning season.","We will not have a complete read on sell-through for another couple of weeks, but our preliminary analysis indicates that our Halloween market share in xAOC is projected to increase for the sixth consecutive year, and that will build on our 38 share of this important season.","In the C-store class-of-trade where there isn't a big seasonal sales impact, Hershey performance was strong, with Q3 retail takeaway up 5.7%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.7 points. Our C-store chocolate and mint retail takeaway was particularly solid, up 7.9% and 5%, respectively. These gains were driven by core brands that were supported by advertising, in-store selling, merchandising and programming.","In the U.S. marketplace over the remainder of the year, we have many exciting products, promotions, programs and merchandising in place across all channels, including things like the continuation of the Kit Kat Android K promotion, where consumers can win tablet computers, Kit Kat Minis and other prices. There's a Reese's NCAA Football promotion featuring a game day tailgate prize package and the opportunity to win season tickets. And strong plans for successful Halloween and the holiday seasons are in place.","And we continue to feel very good about our brand building. Full year advertising expense is expected to increase 22% to 23% in 2013, greater than our earlier outlook of about 20% increase. This investment should benefit the category and our business in Q4 and enable us to get off to a good start next year.","Brookside continues to do well and we've begun to ship an instant consumable 3-ounce pack type initially targeting the C-store channel. In 2014, we expect FDMx channels will also be interested in this pack type for secondary, high-traffic placement.","We're still managing, merchandising and programming of the 7-ounce package to ensure product presence remains in the candy aisle of all targeted stores. Repeat purchases are on-track, and we continue to anticipate that Brookside will continue at least 1 point of total company sales growth in 2013.","Looking North, our business in Canada continues to build on its momentum. Specifically, our combined candy and mints market share is up 0.4 points year-to-date and about 0.15 points away from becoming the leader in Canada.","In Q3, Hershey's, Reese's and Oh Henry! net sales on a local currency basis increased high mid-single-digits. Chocolate retail takeaway remains strong, with market share up 0.3 points. Our sweets and refreshments market share increased 0.8 points, driven by solid Ice Breakers and Jolly Rancher performance.","As expected, outside of the U.S. and Canada, international net sales accelerated and were up 14%, led by China, Mexico and Brazil. Export markets also performed well with sales trends nearly doubling in the third quarter versus the first half of the year.","Looking at some of the focus countries. China chocolate category growth accelerated in Q3 and year-to-date, the category is up about 12%,","the categories developing as anticipated with instant consumable and take-home growth outpacing gifting. Hershey's third quarter retail takeaway was solid and our year-to-date results are in line with our full year expectation of achieving chocolate growth of at least 4 to 5x greater than the category growth.","Per Nielsen, our national share is just above 7%, driven by the Hershey's and Kisses brands, which have each gained 0.9 market share points this year. We've carried our retail momentum into the fourth quarter and have begun shipping Hershey's Kisses Deluxe and Hershey's Drops. Additionally, the fourth quarter will also benefit from an earlier Chinese New Year, giving us confidence that we'll end the year strongly.","In Mexico, Hershey's Bliss and Kisses are having a solid year. In the modern trade, our Q3 and year-to-date chocolate retail takeaway was about double the category growth rate, resulting in a market share gain of 1.8 points.","Our overall chocolate market share in the modern trade is about 21% and the Hershey's franchise surpassed one of our competitors to become the #1 chocolate brand in these channels.","Consumer testing and validation of Reese's, primarily in the C-store channel, is progressing and should be a future enabler as we track towards our 2017 goals.","Our Mexico non-chocolate candy growth has not kept pace with chocolate; however, we have new product launches in Q4, as well as related marketing support that gives us the opportunity to end the year with momentum.","In Brazil, Hershey bars, tablets and Mice are on track. The chocolate category in Brazil is up about 8% to 9% in 2013 and Hershey retail takeaway is about double the category growth rate, resulting in a 0.3-point market share gain.","We feel good about the progress we're making in our International businesses and we like the growth outlook and prospects in the markets of China, Mexico and Brazil. Additionally, in a press release earlier this month, we announced that we'll be building a manufacturing facility in Malaysia to support our growing business in the Asia Pacific region.","Outside the U.S. and Canada, we expect that our International business will be up about 15% this year, putting us on track to achieve about $1 billion of net sales by the end of 2014.","Now to wrap up. I'm pleased with our performance given the macroeconomic challenges that consumers and retailers are facing. As I stated earlier, over the remainder of the year, we have solid merchandising and programming in place to drive core brands and new products in both U.S. and international markets.","The fourth quarter has gotten off to a good start. Halloween is tracking as expected. The holiday season is shaping up to be better than last year, and we'll begin shipping some select 2014 new products. Therefore, we expect full year net sales to increase about 7%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","We have good visibility into our cost structure and expect to achieve adjusted gross margin expansion of 240 to 250 basis points that should result in 2013 adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of about 14%.","As we look to 2014 and beyond, we will continue to focus on U.S. core brands and leverage Hershey's scale at retail. Our International business continues to progress and we're optimistic about the potential to accelerate our international presence behind our disciplined approach to organic investments and acquisitions or joint ventures. We believe the investments we've made and will continue to make have resulted in an advantaged business model, enabling us to deliver predictable and sustainable results.","As a result, this gives us the confidence to increase our annual long-term earnings per share diluted target to 9% to 11%.","In 2014, we'll continue to focus on core brands in both the U.S. and key international markets. Additionally, we have a solid pipeline of new products including York Minis, Hershey's spreads, Lancaster Soft Cr\u00e8mes caramel, as well as some yet to be announced products. And therefore, we expect innovation to contribute meaningfully to our net sales growth in 2014.","As a result, we expect 2014 net sales growth to be within our 5% to 7% long-term target including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","As has been the case for many years, Hershey is a gross margin-focused company. We have solid productivity and cost savings initiatives in place, and while early in the planning cycle, we expect adjusted gross margin expansion next year that will drive 2014 growth and adjusted earnings per share diluted in the 9% to 11% range, in line with our long-term target.","I'll now turn it over to Dave, who will provide you with some additional financial details.","David W. Tacka","Thank you, J.P., and good morning, everyone. Hershey posted another quarter of solid results, with consolidated net sales of $1.85 billion, up 6.1% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $1.04.","Net sales growth in the quarter included 6.6% organic growth, offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.5%. The organic net sales growth included growth in the U.S. and international markets that were within our targeted ranges.","Core brand and new product volume growth totaled 6.1 points, while net price realization, primarily in the U.S., was a 0.5-point benefit.","The Brookside business continues to do well, contributing 0.5 points to net sales growth in the quarter. Note that Brookside's net sales in the third quarter of last year included an additional month of sales as we completed the integration of the Brookside business into our financial and business processes. For the year-to-date period, Brookside has contributed about 1.3 points to our net sales growth.","Turning now to margins. In the third quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 300 basis points, driven by lower commodity costs, favorable sales mix, supply chain productivity, cost savings initiatives and fixed cost absorption from volume gains. Input cost deflation of about $33 million was in line with our estimates, and there's no material change to our input cost outlook over the remainder of the year. Given year-to-date results, we now expect adjusted gross margin expansion of 240 to 250 basis points, which is greater than our previous estimate of 220 to 230 basis point increase.","Adjusted EBIT increased 11.8% year-over-year, generating adjusted EBIT margin of 20.3%, 100 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2012. This increase is driven by the gross margin improvements.","Adjusted SM&A expenses increased 15.2% versus last year as a result of increased advertising spending and higher SG&A spending.","Advertising expense in the third quarter and year-to-date period increased 22% versus a year ago. For the full year, we now expect advertising expense to increase 22% to 23% versus our previous estimate of about 20%. We continue to believe that the advertising activities are a key factor in our sales growth and in our momentum in our focused international markets.","In the third quarter, adjusted SG&A, excluding advertising, increased 12.3% versus last year, less than our estimate of about a 20% increase due to timing. In the fourth quarter, we expect another meaningful increase in this line item.","These investments in non-advertising brand building and go-to-market capabilities in both the U.S. and international markets, will benefit the company in the near and long-term.","Now let me provide a brief update on our International business. As expected, net sales outside the U.S. and Canada accelerated in the third quarter, increasing 14.2%, driven by gains in China, Mexico, Brazil and our overall export business where sales trends nearly doubled in the third quarter versus the first half of the year. We continue to make progress in the 4 focused markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India, which collectively posted solid net sales growth of 22%, driven primarily by Hershey's and Kisses.","We expect international sales to sequentially improve again from the third to fourth quarter, given new product launches, core brand growth and our solid seasonal plans.","For the full year, international net sales are expected to increase about 15%, continuing toward our goal of $1 billion in net sales by the end of 2014.","Moving down to P&L. Third quarter interest expense of $21.8 million declined slightly versus $24.5 million last year. In 2013, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million to $95 million.","The tax rate for the third quarter was 33.3%, and lower than the year-ago period of 36.1%, due to timing of certain discrete tax items. We now expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be about 34.5%, slightly lower than our previous estimate.","In the third quarter of 2013, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 227 million shares versus 229 million shares in 2012.","Let me now provide a quick recap of our year-to-date adjusted results. Net sales for the company increased 6.1%. Adjusted EBIT increased 10.8% resulted in an adjusted EBIT margin gain of 80 basis points.","Advertising increased 22% on a year-to-date basis, relatively in line with the percentage now forecasted for the full year. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 46.8% versus 44.0% last year, a 280-basis point gain, driven by lower commodity costs, supply chain productivity, favorable sales mix and fixed cost absorption.","Year-to-date, adjusted earnings per share-diluted increased 14.4% to $2.86 per share.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. Net trading capital was flat versus the year-ago period. Accounts receivable was higher by $10 million as a result of increased sales and remains extremely current.","Inventory was higher by $36 million and accounts payable increased by $46 million.","In terms of other specific cash flow items, total capital additions, including software, were $70 million in the third quarter. In 2013, we expect capital additions to be approximately $320 million to $330 million.","As we announced earlier this month, we will be building a confectionery manufacturing facility in Johor, Malaysia, to meet the growing consumer demand for our products in our fastest-growing region. This will be a $250 million investment upon completion in 2015.","Included in our 2013 capital expenditure budget is about $35 million related to this project. The majority of the investment, $120 million to $140 million, will occur in 2014 with the remainder in 2015.","Depreciation and amortization was $52 million in the third quarter. In 2013, we are forecasting total depreciation and amortization of about $200 million to $210 million.","Dividends paid during the quarter were $105 million.","Cash on hand at the end of the third quarter was $701 million. We did not acquire any stock in the third quarter related to the $250 million outstanding repurchase program.","Now to summarize. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. Halloween has gotten off to a good start, and over the remainder of the year, we have plans and investments to drive top line growth. Therefore, we continue to expect full year net sales to increase about 7%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We have good visibility into our full year cost structure, and there is no material change to our input cost outlook for 2013.","Given year-to-date results, full year adjusted gross margin expansion is expected to be 240 to 250 basis points, slightly greater than our previous estimate. This increase, as well as the slightly lower tax rate, will offset the aforementioned increase in advertising expense and SG&A spending.","As a result, the company continues to anticipate 2013 adjusted EPS growth of around 14%.","As J.P. stated, we have also increased our long-term adjusted earnings per share target to 9% to 11%, based on our expectation of continued strong business performance.","As we look to 2014, we have a solid pipeline of innovation in both U.S. and international markets. Additionally, we will continue to focus on our core brands and leverage Hershey's scale at retail.","We expect 2014 net sales growth to be within our 5% to 7% long-term target. We have solid productivity and cost savings initiatives in place, and while early in the planning cycle, we expect adjusted gross margin expansion next year that will drive 2014 growth in adjusted earnings per share diluted of 9% to 11% within our revised long-term target.","We will now open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question about the change in your -- in the long-term growth goals. So in going from 9% to 11%, and I guess, maybe even more just looking at the goals you've set for between now and 2017, if I remember it right, you're expecting about $40 million to $50 million annually of productivity and gross margins to be, I guess, a little better than 43% by then. So could you just -- can you talk a little bit about whether that's changed at all? Are you expecting more productivity or better gross margins? Or is the higher growth goal a function of a more optimistic outlook on sales?","David W. Tacka","Well, I think as we go through it, I think our productivity outlook is still consistent with what we've stated. I think as we're looking forward with our sales growth and we're also looking at the leverage we would be getting in our SG&A, and hence making the change.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. I think -- I would just also add that we believe there'll be consistent top line growth, and that will reflect itself all the way through the P&L, and this is more representative of where we think our results have both been and where we think they'll be.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So is it -- I guess, is it fair to look at this and think that you're starting your outlook for the operating leverage you'll see in this international expansion is pacing a little better than what you were expecting when you laid those goals out about 1.5 years ago?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think that we're pretty optimistic about what we've been able to achieve around innovation. As you know, in our long-term growth algorithm, we've always talked about it being about 1 point. We found ourselves doing pretty consistently better than that. We would hope that, that would continue to be the case. And then, of course, that innovation is across broader geographies than it has been in the past, so I think those things all lead us to -- we just have confidence in raising the long-term EPS guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Janney.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","As you put up good volume growth this quarter off a significantly more difficult comparison. I'm concerned looking forward to next year. If you could give us -- first of all, maybe give us a sense how much of the volume growth this year has been Brookside. And looking into next year, like what inning do you think we are in that development. And what factors, maybe especially as you think about the second half of next year, give you confidence that we can sustain a level of volume growth that's like this, certainly above trend? Or maybe it's the case that it reverts back to trend. Any comments you could give me would be helpful.","John P. Bilbrey","Sure. I think the 2 things that I'd point out is Brookside is about 1.2 -- between 1.2 and 1.3 of our growth in 2013. It was less than that in the Q3 just because of the normalizing of that versus the base versus previous year. And then the other thing that we're very excited about is we're introducing things like Brookside 3-ounce, so that will be an instant consumable item, be largely focused on C-stores. But I would anticipate that, that would also be an instant consumable across other channels, certainly on the front end. We have Lancaster in China. Kisses Deluxe is happening in China. Hershey's Drops. Kit Kat Minis continues to be very, very well and we're on, certainly, the front side of that. We have some new things in our sweets and refreshment area around Jolly Rancher Soft Chewy Bites. That's also coming in, like a cup holder pack, which is a new package format for Jolly Rancher. We've got some new executions around Twizzlers. And then the one that I'm personally excited about is our Hershey's spreads product, which we're introducing now, the 13-ounce jar, and that has had great reception. It begins shipping in December, so we'll get the benefit of that in Q4. And then as that goes forward, we will also have another type of instant consumable pack that will go along with that, it's in 2014. So we have a lot of things that we feel really good about. And then there's a whole group of other 2014 products that I haven't included, but I think we've got a really full plate of things that we could do, and I continue to believe our consumer-centric approach to the business makes all of these things, as we like to say, stickier than we've been able to experience in the past. I think we continue to get better at that than we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Thinking about, I guess, building on the previous question and just thinking about the 5 to 7 top line target for next year. It sounds like from an innovation perspective, the pipeline is still quite full and perhaps you can still get above the kind of the 1% longer-term target from innovation that you'd like. I mean, thinking about some of the other components of the top line, I'm trying to get a sense of maybe what your expectation would be for category growth next year. Would you still expect some modest share gains as you've been able to do over the last few years in some of your core categories? And I assume pricing, at this stage anyway, given maybe where your visibility is around inputs, not likely a large contributor to next year either. So just trying to get a sense of the sort of the other puts and takes on the top line.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, we're not going to, obviously, speculate around any pricing, nor does that makes its way into any of our planning. We continue to have good core brand growth this year. Our expectation is to continue to grow share in 2014 just as we have ahead of the category in '13. And I think that we model that the category grows between 3% to 4%, it's actually grown a bit ahead of that. And I wouldn't be surprised that it's -- we hear in the marketplace, there will be other people who are looking at innovation. I think news in the category is good. And I also wouldn't be surprised if we don't continue to see the overall advertising spend grow in the category. And in an expandable consumption category, that's good for everybody. So frankly, I would not only look forward to that if that happened, but I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't happen. And I think that will continue to underpin the overall health of the category. And don't forget, this is a great category for retailers. They make good money and they have the same vested interest we do in seeing it grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the $250 million CapEx investment in Malaysia and what regions that plant is going to support. And the reason I'm asking is, I think China is, right now, a growing business, $125 million, $130 million in sales. So is it -- is this plant going to support more than just China? It seems like it's an enormous investment for what is a pretty small business today. And I know China's growing. And I was out there, I saw Hershey's Kisses everywhere. But it seems like your sales growth slowed in the third quarter, and I wanted to know what caused the sales growth to slow currently.","David W. Tacka","Well, let me start off by addressing the capital. We have had a manufacturing facility, it's a joint venture with Lotte that is in China, and that facility is manufacturing our product for China, as well as for our exports throughout the Asian region. And as we've said, we expect the China business within the next few years to actually grow to our second largest business, and we need additional capacity. So as we're looking at this particular facility, we're looking at having that facility support our overall growth in Asian businesses in the markets outside of China, and that would free up capacity in the existing facility to be able to support our China growth. And also, for certain products for China, it would also be being supported out of this facility. So as we look at the growth expectations that we have in the region, and it is China plus our overall Asian market, we feel it's the appropriate facility and the appropriate location and size to serve our growth needs.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. Let me build a little bit of that from a commercial perspective. So don't forget that what you're seeing in China today is a relatively limited portfolio. We continue to fan that around our core brands. And to be able to do that, that China manufacturing plant, which today supports exports also in the region, just doesn't have the capacity to do that. So that capacity in China really goes all to China, and we would expect the plant in Malaysia to also help us some there. So one of the things that happened in the quarter is, as we looked at some of our export businesses, we actually pulled some of those exports back, so we didn't supply them out of that China plant and we also didn't have the ability to do that because we don't have the Malaysia plant. So that's a bit in that number. But I think just from a macro level, if you go back and you think about this Brookside being normalized, with 4 months of business in the base in the quarter of previous year, that's 0.5 point. So if you just took the current organic growth and you added that 0.5-point, that's 7.1%. We feel awfully good about that performance. So one, I think in total, Asia, it gives us a lot better opportunity to have the right footprint, it allows us to expand in ways we're not expanding, and it allows us to have a fuller portfolio in China and then continue to build in the balance of the region. But if you put those things back together and you were to look at a 7.1% kind of number, that's certainly a good performance.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But John, how are your sales doing in China year-to-date? There's a talk of a slowdown in the consumer. I just wanted to get kind of a check in on that.","John P. Bilbrey","We're not experiencing that. And I think, again, it comes back to the fact that the category is growing really nicely in China. Depending on who you talk about, the category is growing at 12% to 15%. We're growing at 4 to 5x that rate. We continue to activate advertising. We're expanding the cities that we're in. So the size of the overall business there is still such that there's a lot of blocking and tackling that yields a very positive result, and these are accessible indulgences. So we're not going to experience the same kinds of things that industrial manufacturers are, and so forth. So people are participating in the category in an ever-growing rate. I think on the last call, I might have made this comment that you go back 5 or 6 years ago, and the category was about $500 million. Today, it's probably about $1.5 billion. And I'm talking chocolate only now. The sugar and confectionary is significantly bigger than that. So there's nothing about our business in China that I would characterize as slowing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the gross margin outlook for next year. I know it's still early days here, but can you give us any read in aggregate of whether you expect to see modest inflation overall across your input cost profile? And then, just to ask specifically about cocoa. Obviously, we've seen it move up meaningfully over the past few months. Do you view that as more of a seasonal dynamic or should we think about that as sort of a stabilized run rate for cocoa, perhaps, going forward?","David W. Tacka","Well, kind of 2 things. As we said, we're early in our planning process and so we'll fill out some of the pieces around how much gross margin expansion in that when we talk to you next quarter. But we're far enough along that we're comfortable that we can see the growth rates and that we will be committing to for next year. With respect to the cocoa market, this is a time of the year that's just before harvest and there's a bunch of news that seems to come out every day. I think we'll know a lot more as the cocoa comes to market over the next couple months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two quick ones and then a longer-term question. First one, I think you talked about the export market versus the first half, but everything else was regarding a year ago. So what was the export business versus the third quarter a year ago?","John P. Bilbrey","I don't have, Eric, on the top of my head that specific question, but you could give Mark a call and we can get into that. But the way to think about it is that we had some export business last year that we felt was less strategic than meeting some of our requirements in our core markets, China in particular. So it was creating some complexity for us that we felt put some other more important strategic business at risk. And so some of that business, consciously, we started making some selections around. So if you think about our export business -- and those are profitable businesses for us, by the way. But the way that we started thinking about it is really prioritizing where around the world do we believe we ultimately will plant flag, and then some of the other businesses, we made some choices around, just to make sure that we could meet the requirements within our supply chains. But Mark can give you a very specific answer around that.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's fine. And then you noted some pipeline fill in the fourth quarter. Did you quantify that? Did I miss that, like either what...","John P. Bilbrey","I didn't quantify it, but as we thought -- as we have looked at our overall guidance of being around 7%, certainly, those are included. And we have a number of things, as -- I had a fairly lengthy list earlier, things that are happening in the fourth quarter. But certainly, amongst the largest of that is Hershey's spreads, which begins shipping late November, early December.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just, I think going back to Bryan's question, I think it's -- for a company to change their long-term targets, it's a pretty big deal, and so I want to dig into it a little bit more. First off, is there any changes in your long-term assumptions around nonoperating items? So as you get international, are you now assuming the tax rate can come down? Is the balance sheet maybe being used a bit more aggressively to repurchase shares? Maybe that's the first question.","David W. Tacka","Well, I think as we go through and we look at it, the change is primarily driven by how we see the sales and the SM&A expenses and how we get leverage on that. And then beyond that, as we grow, there could be some changes in the tax rate, but that's not the primary driver.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then at CAGNY, I think you had actually lowered a bit your expectations for margins coming out in the international EM businesses from a mid-teens target to low double digits, and this would seem to kind of reverse that. At the same time, I think as Matt pointed out, that cocoa seems to be now moving up. So I'm a little unclear as to kind of if -- unless you've reversed that, I mean what -- I don't really understand what is the new driver of the higher-margin expectation.","David W. Tacka","From what we've said in the gross margin, we've really not changed our gross margin view, which is the kind of thing that you would be seeing with respect to the international. I mean, our view is consistent still with what you said that we would expect to be driving to a low double-digit in our international markets. But our gross margin is not changing as we've outlined this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, I'm just wondering if you could speak a little bit to your opportunities in the U.S. convenience channel. And it's been 5 years of some pretty solid and stable market share gains there. Where do you see the next opportunities for growth in that channel going forward? Either in terms of absolute growth or market share gains?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think that, we, over the last couple of years, have gotten greater penetration in terms of just total stores covered. I think that continues to be an opportunity for us. And then I think as we look at SKU productivity and we look at being able to get things like Brookside into an instant consumable package, Jolly Rancher getting into what would be thought of as a car cup-type pack, Twizzlers, which has largely been, as an example, a lay-down pack. We've also got some of those, what we call chews, and so forth, that come in a package that hasn't been available in the C-store channel historically. So I think packaging will play a role for us in that channel that leads us optimistic. And then I think our coverage and the way we merchandise in the channel continues to be a big opportunity for us. And then I just think in terms of macro consumer trends, we continue to -- our category continues to stay on the menu of consumers. So even as the format of convenience changes, I think for us, the environment continues to be very, very positive. So I wouldn't expect any kinds of disruption, which allows me to be optimistic about the other things that I just talked about.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just one follow up, in terms of long-term guidance in the Malaysian facility. So it seems like it's a pretty big investment. And the way you're discussing the long-term margin outlook, are you not looking for a cost benefit long-term in the manufacturing segment in Malaysia facility? And it seems like you'd get some leverage from that long term, at least in tax benefits. How are you thinking about that in terms of international cost?","David W. Tacka","Yes. Well, we have expected in our long-term guidance that we would continue to build efficiency in the Asian market, and the Malaysia plant is really just a continuation of what we're expecting to do there.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. In the long-term targets, John, that we talked about last year, I mean, we hinted to needing that facility anyway. So I mean it was already built into that 2017 target.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wanted just to say first off, congratulations on just continuing to execute the business plan. You guys are one of the few companies that I think just doesn't seem to have any problems. So congratulations on that, and a nice job. My question relates to 2014, and again, just Dave, you've got a couple of questions here on this gross margin. I want to ask just kind of -- I don't want to target a commodity, I just want to hear your thoughts about the commodity basket in 2014. I believe, just given your commentary, the short version of it is that the commodity basket for Hershey would be favorable. Would you agree with that statement? And then, can you guys talk a little bit about price and mix and your expectations in '14?","David W. Tacka","I guess, what I would say, David, is that as we're looking to 2014. As you know, we tend to take a view of the different commodity markets. And depending on those views, we will hedge from 3 to 24 months in advance. And obviously, we've continued to do that as we go forward. And so as we look at 2014, we will be completing that and we'll give you additional guidance and insight on that when we talk to you next quarter.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And how about the comments on price and mix in 2014? I mean, I think we haven't seen a pricing announcement, so I think that's pretty straightforward, unless I'm missing something. And then the mix issue, it seems like it should continue to be positive, but I'd really like to hear your thoughts.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. I think, David, if you look at -- if you really dig into the data over the last several periods, one of the things you would see is that some of the price -- some of the pricing information would look as though there's greater price realization, and what's happening is it's all coming -- a lot of that is coming out of mix. So the price per pound on some of the new things that we're introducing versus the average of what our line would've looked like, let's say, over the last couple of years, we're really benefiting from that. So even as we dig into the data, we're looking at some things that we're very pleased with we have -- of what the mix impact is. And then the other thing that just continues to hold true for us, and it's really a benefit in retail, but in terms of the percent products sold right off the shelf at full revenue, we continue to see that trend higher rather than lower. So you can read a couple of things into that, trade promotion is more efficient and advertising is certainly working. So those are all very positive things that are going on in the category, and I think that this is one of the benefits of what I would describe, as a more consumer-centric approach across the overall category, certainly, for our brands. But it's making the innovation better, it's filling white space, it's bringing people to the category, and then that is a higher order of mix impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You're holding a decent amount of cash still on your balance sheet, right? And I appreciate some of this is for the Malaysia plant. But even including that cost and after the plant is built, you'll probably, at least by my numbers, still have a lot of cash. So I know you've talked about this a little before, but can you add a little bit of color? What's your comfort level with this amount on the balance sheet versus the decision to maybe deploy a little bit either toward growth or returns to shareholders? And I think you said you didn't buy back any stock this period as well.","David W. Tacka","Well, what we've said and how we consistently look at this is we think that we have good growth opportunities, and so with our cash levels, that's how we would intend to deploy it. Some of that will be capital expenditures, and as you noted, the Malaysia plant. In addition to that, we continue to be working toward M&A activity that would fit our strategies and help us support our growth, and that is our primary focus at this point in time with the cash. Next, we did do a 15.5% dividend increase last quarter, and we've talked about our long-term target being about a 50% payout ratio in our dividends. And then beyond that, our next level would be to be looking at some share buybacks, but that's not our priority at the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions still standing, I guess. Malaysia, the plant you're building, should we expect any tax benefits on the back of this?","David W. Tacka","Yes. As part of that -- as it's up and operating in a couple of years, it will have a favorable tax impact.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Any chance you can kind of frame that up for us in terms of magnitude?","David W. Tacka","Probably won't do that at the moment. As we get closer to where we can see it, we'll talk about it more.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I'm going to stick on CapEx for a minute. You -- I think you said around $320 million or $340 million next year with $35 million in Malaysia. It was just a couple of years ago that you were talking about CapEx stepping down to $140 million to $150 million by this year. I know you revised it at your fiscal '12 Analyst Day. But bigger picture question, what's caused the high -- the rising capital intensity of this business if Malaysia is only $35 million next year?","David W. Tacka","Well actually, the $35 million is for this year in 2013. What we've said is that we -- that there's another $130 million -- or another $120 million to $140 million that will likely be in next year. So that's just clarifying the years. But fundamentally, what's happened with the capital is that we are having additional investment in growth with the volume growth that we've had and with the international growth that we've continued to invest in that, as well as we've had investments that are supporting our productivity programs, and also to continue to focus on enhancing product quality.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Thanks for the clarification there. Sorry, I must have misheard. Last question, and I'll pass it on. Competitive dynamics in North America. We understand that Nestle's North America business is under new leadership. Mars looks like it\u2019s gotten a little more promotional the last couple of months. Maybe it's just timing-oriented, but what are you guys seeing on the ground in terms of competitive intensity?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, if I think that I go back to the comment I mentioned earlier, we would have a sense that there's going to continue to be innovation in the category. Some of that, our competitors have announced some things that they are doing. And I would also continue to believe that there'll be investments in more communication with the consumer around advertising, digital, et cetera. So I think it will continue -- for me, it never feels like it's not competitive. But I would expect that the category continues to behave in a rational way and people invest in their brands. And as I said, in an expandable consumption category, that's always a good thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Andrew Strelzik","Andrew Strelzik for Ken. Following up on the last question, one of your competitors is entering the peanut butter cup category and supporting it with fairly meaningful advertising. Just wondering how you think that will impact the category, if we should expect any response from you. And if you could point to any similar events in the past and how that's played out.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, as you might expect, we'll continue to show up every day and execute the best we possibly can against the brands we have. And this wouldn't be the first time that a product similar to what's being introduced has been introduced in the market. But as I said before, competition is a good thing. News within the category is a good thing. And we'll all have to show up and do the best we can. I know that's what we're going to do.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I ask about your acquisition plans in Asia and how they're evolving? And does the announcement of the Malaysia plant mean it's more likely that you're thinking about going it alone in the region or you're still actively looking?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, Alexia. We continue to be active and looking at what we think are opportunities that give us the capabilities to accelerate the growth of our business. Things that seem to give us either manufacturing, distribution, brand, certainly. All are things that we look at. As you know, while there's a number of the companies, they're not all for sale, but we're certainly active in thinking through and assessing what we think might be good for the Hershey Company. The good news is that on a parallel path to that, we have plans that we believe will enable us to continue to grow and we really have to be able to -- we have to have the capacity that this Malaysia plant gives us the flexibility to grow in the region and also develop new markets, as well as meet the demands of our China business. So you should just take all of these things as reflective of our optimism around our future.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you for joining us for today's call.

Please note, this call may be recorded. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Poole, you may begin your conference.","Melissa Poole","Thank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for The Hershey Company second quarter 2019 earnings conference call and webcast. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Steve Voskuil, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, followed by a Q&A session.","Before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Federal Securities Laws. These statements are based on our current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events and those described in these forward-looking statements contained in our 2018 10-K filed with the SEC and today's press release.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors.

He joined the Company following our last call, and he's been a great addition to the executive leadership team. Some of you have already had the chance to meet Steve, and he and I look forward to visiting with more of you in the coming months.","Now on to business. We are pleased with our second quarter results and the momentum we are seeing behind our key initiatives for this year. Our balanced plans and capability investments are enabling us to deliver accelerated sales growth and differentiated earnings performance. We are maintaining our market share leadership in our profitable U.S. confection business, and driving incremental profitable sales with our snacking and international portfolios, both of which continue to perform well.","These have been and continue to be the strategic priorities of our business. And I'd like to take a minute to thank my colleagues across the business for their contribution to the strong quarter. As we look to the back half of the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our financial commitments for the year.","In the second quarter, net sales increased 0.9%, in line with our expectations. Organic constant currency net sales growth of approximately 1.8% was driven by pricing and the launch of key innovation, including Reese's Thins and Reese's Lovers, as well as our new packaged candy bags.","The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 60 basis-point headwind as the Tyrrells and Shanghai Golden Monkey divestitures offset our Pirate Brands acquisition. The majority of the impact of these divestitures has been realized, and we expect the net impact of M&A to be a benefit for the remainder of the year. Foreign currency exchange was a 30 basis-point headwind in the second quarter.","We had another strong quarter of gross margin expansion, which enabled brands and capability investments as well as robust earnings growth. While some of our second quarter margin and earnings gains were training related, the underlying trends remained solid. This strong gross margin expansion of almost 200 basis points drove second quarter adjusted EPS growth of 14.9%. Steve will share more details around second quarter gross margin performance as well as our expectations for the rest of the year.","As we've previously discussed, price realization is a strategic focus area for us. The price increase we announced last summer remains on track, and the final portion is implementing now as we execute our Halloween program.","Additionally, last week, we announced a new price increase on our confection instant consumables business. These products represent roughly one-third of our overall sales, and they were priced high-single-digits, contributing to an estimated two points of pricing to our overall portfolio. Consistent with previous practices, we will have a transition period for our retailers to adjust to these new prices, and we do not expect a material, sales or earnings impact in 2019 from this pricing action. We anticipate category retail prices for these impulse items to begin to increase in the second half of the year.","These actions reinforce our commitment to a more agile approach to pricing strategy that protects our advantaged margin structure while enabling continued investments in our brands and capabilities to drive category growth.","Other key initiatives on our U.S. confection business are also progressing well and on track. Retail takeaway was slightly ahead of our expectations coming out of Easter, due to accelerated activation of our Reese's Lovers in and out promotion. For IRI, Hershey candy, mint and gum retail sales, increased 1.9% versus prior year, since the Easter season ended. This was in line with overall category growth of 1.9%, resulting in flat shift. This growth was led by our powerful Reese's franchise, which grew 12% during the time period behind our new packaged candy bags, our Reese's Thins innovation, and or Reese's Lovers instant consumable promotion. Our new packaged candy bags are on shelf at all major retailers. And we are pleased with the increased branding and improved shopability that we are seeing to-date.","We are also excited by the response we are seeing from increased media on some of our smaller iconic brands. These profitable brands are a tremendous asset for us that deliver unique consumer proposition, and incrementality to our portfolio. We are leveraging our new media capabilities, both for content, as well as targeting, and increased investment to drive growth on many of these brands.","Over the past year and a half, we've increased support on our Almond Joy, Mounds, York, Payday and Twizzlers brands. Our strong gross margin performance has enabled us to support additional brands, Heath and Rolo, in the second quarter. Early results are encouraging with our Heath brand growing 37% and our Rolo brand growing over 7% over the last four weeks.","While not all of this growth is incremental, having more brands in our portfolio, staying relevant with our consumers and growing is critical to our overall category leadership. Our e-commerce business continues to perform well, with second quarter net sales growth of over 60%. Customer-specific data, as well as industry reports indicate that our growth is consistently outpacing competition by 10 to 15 basis points in 2019.","As we look to the second half of 2019, we expect to build on last year\u2019s seasonal success with solid performance in Halloween and holiday. Additional Kit Kat capacity is further enhancing our assortment bags for Halloween and enabling our Kit Kat Mint Duos innovation that was launched towards the end of the year.","Now for an update on our Amplify and Pirate Brands acquisitions. Per IRI, SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn grew approximately 10% in the second quarter, resulting in a share gain of over 100 basis points. We continue to focus on expanding distribution and optimizing our shelf placement, which is leading to consistent gain in household penetration. As we discussed on our April call, Pirate\u2019s Booty sales performance has declined recently due to distribution losses at a few key retailers and the lapping of some significant promotional activity from prior year. The distribution of losses occurred during the sales transition, but we remain confident that trends will improve in the second half as planograms reset and year-over-year promotional activity normalizes. Retail sales trends for the latest four weeks are already improving versus the last 12 weeks, and expect that that will continue to improve.","Now, for an update on our international business. Constant currency organic sales grew 8.3% in the second quarter. And we continue to demonstrate disciplined investment, resulting in segment operating income growth of 32% versus prior year. In Mexico, we grew our net sales high-single-digits in the second quarter, behind continued strength in our core chocolate business, and the launch of a new Pelon Pelo Rico flavor.","In Canada, our Reese's brand eclipsed Kit Kat and is now the number one brand. Our Reese's brand is also seeing great momentum in the UK, recently receiving the Gold IPM award for best new product launch for Easter Reese's Creme Egg. We will continue to focus on our core brand equities to drive profitable sales growth in the second half and beyond.","To wrap up, we have good momentum across all of our key strategies, with strong financial results in the second quarter. We will continue to invest in our brands and our capabilities to take this business to the next level and drive sustainable top and bottom line growth.","I'll now turn it over to Steve who will provide you with details on our financial results. ","Steve Voskuil","Thank you, Michele. Good morning, everyone.","Before I get started, I'd like to take a few minutes to say how excited I am to be part of the Hershey team. Hershey is a great company with strong brands, leading marketing positions and a balanced approach to profitable growth. I've been energized by the talented team here and their passion for innovation, growth and transformation. I look forward to partnering with Michele, our Board and the whole team to achieve our strategic vision, and deliver strong and sustainable shareholder return.","Now, on to the financial results. Second quarter net sales of $1.8 billion increased 0.9% versus the same period last year. Organic constant currency net sales growth of 1.8% was driven by net price realization of 1.2 points and volume growth of 60 basis points. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 60 basis-point headwind and foreign currency translation was a 30 basis-point headwinds. These results were all in line with expectations.","Adjusted earnings per share-diluted were $1.31, an increase of 14.9% versus the same period last year. This was driven primarily by gross margin expansion, and was ahead of expectation, driven by two key factors related to the price increase we announced last week. First, a few select customers increased inventory on our most profitable items in anticipation of a price increase, while total retail inventory levels were not up significantly from prior year. We benefited from positive mix for the quarter. Second, we increased internal inventory levels to support more demand from our retailers in the coming weeks as we transitioned to the new prices, which resulted in favorable fixed cost absorption. About 90 basis points of our gross margin expansion in the second quarter can be attributed to these two factors, and is expected to be offset in the second half, primarily Q3 as the internal and external inventory levels normalize.","We are pleased with underlying momentum against our margin expansion initiatives, the business reinvestment it is enabling and the balanced top and bottom-line growth it is driving.","By segment, North America net sales increased 0.5% versus the same period last year, driven by pricing, which contributed 1.5 points of growth in the quarter. Volume was a 50 basis-point headwind, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 30 basis-point headwind, and foreign currency exchange rates or 20 basis-point headwind. These results were in line with expectations.","North America gross margins expanded 180 basis points in the second quarter. As I mentioned, about half of this was driven by favorable product mix and fixed cost absorption related to the price increase we announced last week and is expected to reverse in the second half, primarily Q3. The remaining 90 basis-point expansion was consistent with expectations and was driven by favorable commodities, price realization from our July 2018 price increase, and improved ways as we continue to execute our SKU rationalization program. These factors are expected to continue contributing to solid underlying gross margin expansion in the second half, though will be partially offset by the reversal of Q2 gains from product mix and fixed cost absorption, as well as some additional supply chain costs associated with fully integrating Pirate Brands into our operations.","North America advertising and related consumer marketing expenses increased 2.7% in the quarter, driven primarily by advertising. We expect dollar investment to continue to accelerate as we move through the year due to the lapping of last year's media efficiency gains and increased investment in our confection brands.","Second quarter total International and Other segment\u2019s net increased 3.9%, driven by volume gains of 960 basis points. This was partially offset by a 320 basis-point headwind from divestitures, a 130 basis-point headwind from net price realization and a 120 basis-point foreign currency exchange headwind.","Organic constant currency net sales in our focus markets, Mexico, Brazil, India and China, grew 5% versus the second quarter of 2018. International and Other advertising and related consumer marketing increased 38% versus prior year. Most of this increase is driven by increased investment to support Ramadan in EMEA, our India Kisses launch and timing of consumer marketing spending.","Total Hershey adjusted gross profit increased 5.3%, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 46.5%, an increase of 200 basis points versus the second quarter of 2018. As mentioned, approximately half of this expansion was driven by favorable product mix and fixed cost absorption that are expected to reverse in the second half. The remainder was driven by favorable commodities, price realization from our July 2018 price increase, and efficiencies from our SKU rationalization initiatives.","Given the progress we have made year-to-date and our visibility into the second half, we now expect full year gross margin to increase approximately 100 basis points.","Second quarter adjusted operating profit of $370 million resulted in operating profit margin of 20.9%, an increase of 150 basis points versus the second quarter of 2018. Gross margin gains and continued SG&A discipline were partially offset by incremental advertising on our confection brands.","Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $34 million decrease $1 million versus Q2 last year. Full year 2019 interest expense is now expected to be in the $140 million to $145 million range due to lower interest rate.","The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 14.8% versus 16% in the year ago period. These declines were driven primarily by valuation allowance releases, and access tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by fewer tax credit investments. Second quarter other expense was $13 million, a decrease of $8 million versus prior year due to fewer tax credit investments.","We now expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be approximately 18% versus our previous estimate of 17%. However, we also expect our full-year other expense to decline to $80 million to $90 million as we expect fewer tax credit investments. The net impact to the full year of these two changes is expected to be negligible versus our previous estimate.","For the second quarter of 2019, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 211 million. This is a slight increase versus the first quarter due to an increased number of stock option exercises in the quarter. The Company did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter against our July 2018, $500 million authorization and $410 million remaining. The Company repurchased $56 million of common shares in the second quarter in connection with the exercise of stock options.","Total capital additions, including software were $176 million in the second quarter. For the full year 2019, we estimate cap adds to be towards the high-end of our $330 million to $350 million range. As a percent of net sales, this remains slightly higher than our long-term target, as we continue to implement our new ERP systems and invest in core capacity.","We continued to return cash to our shareholders with second quarter dividends of $149 million. This was our 358th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock. Additionally, this morning, we announced a 7% dividend increase, a testament to our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow generation.","To summarize, for the full year, we expect full year reported net sales to grow around 2%, the midpoint of our previously communicated range. We continue to anticipate approximately a 0.5-point net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures and the full year FX impact to be negligible, based on foreign exchange rates.","Full year reported earnings per share-diluted are expected to be around $5.58, comparable to prior year. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of around 6% to 7%, the top half of our previous range.","As we look to the second half, we want to highlight a few areas where we expect trends to vary versus the first half. Underlying gross margin is expected to continue to build as pricing builds. However, recall we expect approximately half of the Q2 expansion to reverse in the second half, primarily Q3.","Advertising and related consumer marketing expense is expected to grow more in the second half than the first half as we lap media efficiencies from last year, as well as increase support on our core confection brands. Given current sales and EPS guidance, compensation is anticipated to be a headwind in the second half of 2019 versus the second half of 2018. Due to the timing of tax strategies, we expect the second half net tax impact to be unfavorable versus prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect a slight benefit to EPS, from tax.","That concludes my financial discussions. And I'll now turn it back to Michele.","Michele Buck","Thanks, Steve.","We had a strong start to the year. The actions we are taking to drive core confection momentum, to capture growth via incremental portfolios and regions, and to invest in our brands and capabilities will continue to drive this business forward. We have a portfolio of beloved brands and amazing team of individuals that are excited and proud to come to work every day. And we remain focused on achieving balanced sales and earnings growth to continue delivering peer leading shareholder returns.","Steve, Melissa and I are now available to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody, and welcome, Steve. As you noted, consumption in North America was a bit above shipments, organic growth. And I assume some of that was certain things like SKU rationalization and such. But, I guess, with SKU rationalization, I think, expected to moderate some in the second half and pricing expected to build and certainly a greater level of innovation that will hit as well, given some of the, I guess, understatement, if you will in 2Q relative to takeaway, I guess, why wouldn't organic sales in North America, not necessarily keep, let's say a similar level of momentum, as we've seen more recently? And then, just, I may have missed it, but the incremental pricing that you've announced, is that all list pricing or similar to last year's pricing, where it was a mix of all the various revenue management levers? Thank you.","Michele Buck","Thanks, Andrew, it's Michele. Hey. So, let me get your first one -- your second part of your question first. The incremental pricing is indeed all list pricing. So, that's a pretty simple one. As we look in our consumption and our sales, let me start with, as we told you in the past, on a full year basis, we always expect our net sales and our takeaway to be relatively in line. But we continue as we have in the past, again this year, to have some volatility from a quarter-to-quarter basis.","I guess, the easiest way that I would advise you to think about it is, if you look at our takeaway trends, first half second half and you see that basically on our CMG business, we were up first half about 2.6%. So, we all know that about 1 point of that was driven by Easter. If you take the first half minus the Easter bump, we expect that same underlying trend to continue in the back part of the year. So, we think we're going to have -- continue to have pretty solid takeaway on a full year basis.","There are several puts and takes as you look at the net sales piece relative to a little bit less SKU ramp in the second half, but at the same time, we are -- have a bit of a harder ramp as we lapped some of those seasons, and as you recall how strong seasons were in the back half of the year last year, some inventory related things in the second quarter, but by full year ends, we think it'll level out as it has in the past.","Operator","We'll now go to Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi. Good morning. You said you don't expect a material sales impact from the new pricing action this year. But, I think, I also heard you say that category retail -- retail prices for these impulse items will increase in the second half of the year. So, I wanted to reconcile this a little bit, if I could. Are your customers taking up their pricing before you are? If so, why are you protecting your pricing? I just wanted to clarify when you expect wholesale and retail net prices to rise, and if there is any synchronicity with each other?","Michele Buck","So, we do expect that we will see some impact at retail on the everyday business, particularly in the fourth quarter. But, as you know, as you look at the back half of our year, we are heavily weighted towards seasons. So, seasons is a much bigger piece of the portfolio than the everyday piece. So, we expect we\u2019ll see some there. But, we also do some price promotion protecting. So, many of our retailers have price promotions, trade promotions that they have booked that we've committed to six months out, sometimes slightly more. And we do price protect those promotions, when we go out with our pricing action. So, that's why you don't see the full impact. Again, we believe the impact will not be material to us.","Ken Goldman","But, will the increased retail prices -- and maybe you're saying that there really won't be because they\u2019ll be built back. So, I just want to understand, will that potentially lead to a situation where you're not getting the pricing yet, but retail prices are going up and therefore your volume could get hurt because of some elasticity trends? Again, I just want to make sure I'm understanding all the puts and takes here from a net pricing perspective?","Michele Buck","There's a little bit of impact there, but it's minimal and all the pricing is baked into the guidance.","Ken Goldman","Okay. I'll let it go. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Driscoll","Thank you. And good morning, and welcome Steve. So, nice to have you on the call, nice quarter to join the Company. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing and the impact on the king size bars. I think, as we understand it, the king size bars will break the $2 price point, the over $2 and this may cause some down trading. So, just kind of building on Ken's question, just trying to understand the impact of the price increase here and how it affects the loose bar portfolio. Is this something where -- can you just walk us through these impacts, as I find it kind of complicated? King size was always such an important component of your loose bar business, so profitable. So, if it forces some down trading to the standard bar, walk me through the impact on how you see the price increase playing through on this issue?","Michele Buck","So, David, we have pretty sophisticated price elasticity modeling that we do. Whenever we take any price action, including this one, that model takes a look at the impact of crossing key price thresholds, it also takes a look at the relationship between regular counts, the single bar and the king size because there's an impact there. It looks that other competitive items in the marketplace and any impacts there. So, all of that is taken into account as we do those elasticity models that help us to predict the conversion curve. And then, we also take a look at that. And in some cases, if there's an area where we think we need it, part of our total pricing action could include some level of reinvestment in trade on specific areas to either maintain the current price point. We certainly also reinvest in advertising, because we know back from the past, if we take pricing and at the same time reinvest that that also helps to accelerate the conversion curve. So, we believe all that is taken into account as we do the analysis. And you are right that on some of those businesses, some of those -- you do hit some of those issues, but we think that's fully taken into account in our plans for the marketplace.","David Driscoll","One quick follow-up on your comments on Reese's. We also understand that the Reese's Lovers promotion was very successful. But ironically, the criticism that I heard was that it was such a good product, people were disappointed -- the retailers were disappointed, they couldn't reorder it. Can you give us some thoughts as to what you do with something like this that\u2019s gone this well? Is there any thoughts in making any part of that promotion and everyday part of the lineup, or do you just repeat the promotion sometime in the future? How do you think about that?","Michele Buck","So, David, it's certainly a great problem to have. And we will evaluate all of those things. Interestingly, there is sometimes a good thing to have something consumers love and they look forward to seeing it return to the marketplace. And I think frequently, we found that that's a really good strategy to employ. It was a great in and out promotion. And we could do it again in the future. So, we'll be evaluating those options -- all options to determine whether something like that should become permanent or we just leverage it to keep news and excitement, which is key in this category.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","I guess, I want to come back to the price increases as well and focus a little bit more on what's different this time. Looking back at some of the pricing cycles, particularly on single-serve, arguably, they were all cost justified? And we don\u2019t certainly see kind of what the cost justification is for this magnitude of pricing in single-serve. So, question number one is, are we missing some sort of cost pressure out there that necessitates this price? And if not, without the cost pressure, how might this be different? Do you expect to have to deal back more to reinvest more to keep retailers happy, or do you expect the relationship with retailers to be very similar to what we see in the past cycles?","Michele Buck","As we shared, we\u2019ve evolved our pricing approach from one in the past that was very much -- much more cost and commodity driven to much more of a strategic pricing capability, where we think strategically across the portfolio at where we have opportunity, on an ongoing basis more than versus that kind of episodic approach. But we approach it in much the same way as we have in the past in terms of how it gets impacted and executed through retail. And I wouldn't anticipate that we would see any type of different scenario versus other times when we price instant consumables in the marketplace. We haven\u2019t priced that part of the portfolio for probably more than five years. And we expect to see similar results based on what we've seen in our elasticity models.","Jason English","And looking back to the 2014 hike or even the 2011, the buy-in period -- the protection period was eight weeks in duration for both of those cycles, and it effectively caused the deferral of the P&L flow through benefit by one quarter. So, you announced in July last time, by the fourth quarter, we actually saw material flow through of price benefit. You're suggesting, this time will be different. It seems the entire thing is kind of consistent. So, what's the disconnect there? Why shouldn't we be expecting a more material benefit coming in the fourth quarter?","Michele Buck","I mean, we expect that we will see some impact in Q4, but we don't do view impact to be material. And I think some of that will be associated with what -- some of that varies on how much we see relative to what kind of inventory position people are carrying and how that kind of flows through.","Melissa Poole","Jason, it's Melissa. I mean, I think, the one piece that we had talked through that was a little different than the last time is we did have retailers kind of building inventory on these packs, before we announced. So, there is a little bit more inventory in the marketplace at those old prices. So, it\u2019ll take a little bit longer to cycle through that just because the speculation was out there in advanced. So, that is a little different from the last time.","Operator","We'll now go to Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, just I guess a question, first, just about Reese\u2019s Thins. It's been in the market now for I guess almost two months. And so, any sort of takeaways in terms of how that's performing in the market, better or worse than expectations and how you're thinking about that for the balance of the year?","Michele Buck","So Reese's Thins is performing well. It is exactly in line with our expectations. We are feeling good about not only the trial, but also the repeat, which is strong and building. And we believe that based on what we're seeing to-date, it will be a sustainable item for us, and that we may be able to extend further off that platform.","Bryan Spillane","So, I guess, following up on that, just in terms of extending off of that platform, is that possible to go with Thins across some other brands, maybe as we look into next year?","Michele Buck","Yes. While we don't want to make any firm commitments on our future innovation plans, I think, we clearly look at a platform -- an idea like that is something that really can be a platform that can be expanded. And if you look at how we've run platforms in the past, many times it is a basic idea that we take across brands and just allows us to get scale for merchandising, et cetera.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Alexia Howard","Can I ask about -- you made a couple of comments about the popcorn brand earlier. I'm curious about the pricing on the SkinnyPop line, it seems to have come down fairly sharply in the last, I guess, three quarters or so. The rest of the category doesn\u2019t seem to have followed. I'm wondering, if -- what the competitive dynamic were, what the thinking behind that was, and whether you anticipate needing to continue with that -- those kind of pricing strategies going forward? Thank you.","Michele Buck","So, one of the things we love about SkinnyPop and believe is a key part of the business prop is the premium pricing that we have on that brand. We are delighted that we're continuing to see really strong growth, overall strong retail growth in the double-digit range, which -- to us, which suggests that the price volume piece is working. Though this is a brand where given the channel dynamics, we can see bigger swings on promotional pricing impact in the marketplace, just given how that product skews by class of trade. For example, there's a bigger clubbed [ph] business on SkinnyPop than we're used to seeing on the rest of our portfolio. And that can drive bigger swings there. So, I wouldn't be concerned about it relative to -- that we are looking to change the pricing strategy on that brand.","Alexia Howard","And just as quick follow-up. I mean, you've made a number of diversifying snacking acquisitions of late. Are you still very actively looking for more opportunities to do that? Thank you. And I'll pass it on.","Michele Buck","Yes. I believe that M&A is a key component of our growth algorithm and of our strategic vision for the Company. And we continue to stay very active in the market, investigating categories and assets. So, as you know, it's all about finding the right one. But, you can expect to continue to see us be focused on further expanding the portfolio.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Steve, I hate to be the one to greet you with an accounting question, but you're CFO. So, the benefit you had in second quarter from the inventory build, and that relates to inventory and your own inventory, right, it hasn't shipped out the door yet?","Steve Voskuil","There are two parts that we talked about on the call. The one is, retailers or distributors built some inventory. And that doesn't benefit us from fixed costs, but the mix that they built and gave us a favorable mix impact. And then, we built a bit of our own inventory, because build our inventory this time of the year anyway for Halloween. But beyond that, we built some more in anticipation of the price increase. And that's the portion that drives a fixed cost absorption benefit, basically those cost and inventory until it bleeds out in the third quarter.","Robert Moskow","So, I understand, like your volume was down in North America in the quarter but retailers were building up inventory, does that mean, it would have been worse if they hadn't been building up inventory?","Steve Voskuil","In total, inventory, the retailers didn't build, as they built it, they built some in anticipation of the price increase in -- I'd say are more profitable brands that we touched on. In total, they weren't up. And so, I don\u2019t know if that sums around.","Michele Buck","The counting impact has more to do with our internal inventory than external inventory.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Well, then, the next question is, if it hasn't been shipped yet, how do you accrue for inventory benefits on that kind of volume? Is it like you just get better rates on your labor or better rates on your -- growing your commodities? Like, it seemed, you wouldn't enjoy that benefit until it actually shipped to a customer, but maybe I just don't understand the accounting.","Steve Voskuil","Yes. You're getting more efficiency in your plans by running more volume, and then it goes into the inventory, so off the P&L into the inventory until it comes back when you do the sale.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris Growe","I just had a question for you in relation to the price increase. Obviously, it's well validated by competitors taking prices up too. I guess, I'm just curious, with input costs down, are you getting much pushback, say from retailers, on this pricing strategy, especially at this time when input costs are more favorable?","Michele Buck","So, our retailer conversations around pricing have gone well so far. The retailers know and appreciate that we continue to invest in our brands that we provide a lot of investments to drive category growth in terms of our category management and other investments with the customer. And we really jointly work together to drive revenue growth and profitable growth, which benefits to all of us. So, at this point in time, we're feeling good. As you know, the category has price. So, it's been a category initiative. And we're feeling good at this point.","Chris Growe","Okay. And then, the next question for you, you talked about a second half North American sales growth rate largely in line with the first half, I think ex the Easter benefit. And if I understand that right, you're going to have pricing coming through at least at that that level? You've got marketing up and new product pipeline looks pretty solid. It would seem volumes could grow in the second half of the year, although I don't think that's what you were implying. So I'm just trying to understand those -- that factor and how that could affect your second half growth rate?","Michele Buck","Sure. So, as we think about the back part of the year, I did mention that some of the last were a little bit tougher for us as we look at the back half, given the strength we had in season. There's also a bit of pipeline fill that we had in the second quarter from our new products. If you think about the new products that we had in the marketplace, we had the new packaged candy bags, we had Reese's Thins, we had Reese Lovers. Reese Lovers actually hit the market a little sooner than we anticipated; it hit in Q2. We thought more of it was going to hit in Q3. And so, those things come out of our numbers in the back half of the year. And then, if you think overall about the business, we are increasing our DME spend and we'll have impressions up similarly to the first half of the year. But it's going to cost us a little bit more on that just because we're mapping some of the efficiencies that we realized as we brought some of our creative production in-house year ago. Hope that helps.","Chris Growe","It does. Yes. Thanks so much for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Palmer","Thanks. Just a little bit of a follow-up on Chris's question on volume and your return on advertising. This summer is the summer of Reese's, and you've already been spending back in the quarter on advertising. And it sounds like, you\u2019re going to be doing even more in the next quarter or two with the benefit of pricing behind you. So, I guess the question is about volume. It\u2019s been tough to grow for a lot of players in the instant consumables area. What makes you think or how confident are you that you're going to get a volume response from this advertising in the second half? And I guess, it doesn't seem like that's baked into the numbers. So, how are you going to be judging this return on investment? Thanks.","Michele Buck","So, generally, as we price, we expect to see a different volume. That's just how the conversion works. So, the first year of pricing, you take the drop in your volume, and then the consumer kind of converts and gets used to it. Certainly, we try to accelerate that conversion curve by spending into advertising, which we have found to help -- really drive that conversion curve to be a bit stronger than it otherwise would. So, that's really what's occurring when you think about that, because our last year price impact is really what\u2019s hitting the marketplace this year, just as this year's price impact primarily comes into the marketplace in 2020.","David Palmer","So, perhaps safer to say that you would be hoping to see a volume response as the year progresses, and perhaps that exit rate on volume is going to be how you judge this advertising push?","Michele Buck","Yes, I would say that -- yes, that progressive getting better piece towards the end would be how we judge it. Yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.","John Baumgartner","Michele, I just wanted to touch on the international business. The focus markets are growing mid-singles, but that's a slowdown from last year, especially in LatAm and India. So, how much of that decel would you say is just harder comps relative to anything incremental on the competitive front on the consumer side? And then, I guess secondly, the non-focus markets, I guess, the export markets. I mean, those are still in [indiscernible] part of the business and your growth seems to accelerating. And so, just what's driving that pickup? And how do you think about the export businesses fit in strategically over the longer term for you?","Michele Buck","Yes, absolutely. So, if you think about our international strategy, certainly, we believe international is an important part of our business model. And we will be continuing to focus on profitable growth across the key markets. The way we think about that business, we have scaled businesses in Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. We have a very highly profitable export business, just because we don't have those fixed costs of feet on the ground as we export. But we found that to be a very viable piece of our business model and actually growing increasingly, across the board, particularly we\u2019ve seen a lot of strength for Reese\u2019s brand in the UK, with very limited investment on our part. And then, the place that we're really placing bigger bets for the future are in China and India, the big emerging markets that have so much potential growth, and we're excited about those opportunities. So, yes, I would say the slowdown in the top-line growth is really a factor of, as we build scale that same kind of growth, just off a bigger base starts to drop down. But we're feeling really good about the performance across all those markets. They've been hitting expectations. India, we launched Kisses, feel good about what we're seeing there and about expanding that opportunity. So, yes, we're feeling good about that piece.","John Baumgartner","And just a follow-up on the pricing, just to be clear. It sounds like the second round of pricing you are taking is going to be in excess of commodity inflation. So, maybe thinking about benefit net of inflation for next year on your margins, or are you going to spend that back elsewhere in the business? Just to be clear on that.","Michele Buck","So, we definitely are -- run our business model in a way that we try and make sure that we are balancing pricing, margin expansion overall through smart cost management to enable reinvestment back into the brand. So, you know that we have a pretty active commodity management, hedging program, we try and look at what that outlook looks like, look at all the other cost factors and cost elements in the cost bucket, and just keep trying to get ahead in terms of pricing where we think it makes sense and where there's realization opportunities, smart cost management, and then thus investing back in. So, it's really kind of a -- it's a holistic approach to looking at the P&L versus just zeroing in on any one line.","Steve Voskuil","Yes. And I'd say, the key is, the proactive past year. So, we're not ready to talk about 2020 yet, but certainly having the pricing in place will be a good way to start the year.","Operator","We'll now go to Ken Zaslow with BMO. Please go ahead. ","Ken Zaslow","Just two questions. First is, on the smaller brands like the Rolo, the Heath, what have you done differently with them? Is it just activating marketing? What other brands have you not touched yet that may be in the potential? Then, I have a follow-up.","Michele Buck","So, yes, I would say, primarily marketing. So, on those smaller brands, over the years, we have seen evidence where a packaging upgrade on the graphics can have a nice impact on those businesses, given they don't have a lot of support when consumer goes to the shop, and you really refresh the package. So, we've done that on several of the brands. Definitely unlocking them through advertising, as if you haven't talked to consumers, and then they start to hear about those brands. From an advertising perspective, we definitely see a lift there. And I would say that is the primary activation. We have hit most of the smaller brands. There are a few that -- I would say, there's a couple more that we will consider investing in going forward. I can think of three. I don't know if I want to really talk about what those are for competitive reasons. But, there are a couple more that we would consider some minor investing. But, I would say, the ones that you've seen this year, including down to Heath and Rolo, you should think about those as the more sizable ones for which we would see the bigger impact.","Ken Zaslow","And then, my follow-up, I think, you said it earlier that you lost distribution in some of the -- one of the acquisition, I don't know which one. Was that part of the plan going into that? And what are the plans to regain the distribution back?","Michele Buck","So it was on Tyrrells brands, as part of the transition, it was one of those elements where -- yes, a distribution was lost due to retailer, a couple of retailers that shouldn't have been. As we took over the business, our sales team quickly went in and got the volume to get that distribution back. It just takes a little time because you can't actually get the distribution on shelf until the customer has a planogram reset, lined up, and the next planogram resets were in the fall. So, September, October timeframe, we expect to start to see that distribution come back. We have the commitments that it will come back. So, it really wasn't about not deserving the space. It was more of an integration hiccup. And we feel really good about the velocities we're seeing where we haven't lost distribution, we are very high-single-digit velocity gains on Tyrrells.","Ken Zaslow","And there's more distribution gains across the U.S. or are you there and you\u2019re just starting to execute now? I leave it there. Thank you. ","Michele Buck","No. I think, there's more opportunity in distribution across the U.S. ","Operator","And will now go to Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Strycula","Good morning. So, Michele, a quick clarification question for you. The price increase you took this year, meaning July 2018, that is going to be contribution about 1.5% for full year pricing, but on an annualized basis, it's 2.5%. So, there's a phasing effect. My understanding is from what you're saying on today's call is that the go-forward price increase is closer to 2%, but with no phasing. So, we should think about it being a clean 2% for next year. That's the first part of my question.","Michele Buck","Yes. That's generally fair way to think about it.","Steve Strycula","Okay. And then, the second piece a little bit on the strategy. The way I understand it to simplify the math is that North America breaks down a third center store, a third front of store and a third seasonal. And it sounds like you took pricing across two of these pieces of the third, meaning one-third is left untouched. Could speak a little bit about what's happening in that portion of your business and how we think about when might be appropriate times to also kind of monetize the pricing opportunity?","Michele Buck","So, yes, part of seasons, we have done some small pricing action. So, generally, we\u2019ve priced pretty broadly across the portfolio. We haven't taken as much on this sweets part of our business. But, we have had some increase in seasons as part of our broader increases. So, at this point, I can't tell you that there is a -- we don't talk about our future plans around pricing. But, we do feel like we\u2019ve taken some there. And on an ongoing basis, we're just going to constantly evaluate the entire portfolio and look at when and where we think there's opportunity for greater price realization.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Michael Lavery","Just back to the international business. Can you maybe give us a sense of the margin progression there and sort of what inning we're in? Obviously, divesting Golden Monkey is a big help. And you've done quite a bit to really improve the profile there, the trajectory of margin extension has obviously been really strong. But now, it looks the kind of the runway ahead over the last four quarters more indicative of what we should expect or is there still some big step-ups to come?","Michele Buck","I wouldn't expect a big step up. Certainly, we're going to continue as we do everywhere to look at every line item on our P&L and continue to look at opportunities to improve margin, because that's just a piece of who we are as a company. But, I think the really big step-ups have been taken.","Steve Voskuil","Yes. I\u2019d agree. And going back to the earlier question, in and out also matters, the mix between the export countries and the ones that we have feet on the ground. And as the feet on the ground grow, that will have an impact on how that margin progresses as well.","Michael Lavery","And is pricing a meaningful component of what you can push there to, or is really the pricing focused just North America?","Michele Buck","So, we have always had a very active pricing component in those markets. As you know, there are economic volatility components in those markets that are ForEx et cetera. So, we do continue to price in part of why our margins are where they are, is some of the pricing there, but it does vary by market. And given they\u2019re smaller piece, we just don't talk as overtly about that on the calls.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Melissa Poole","Thanks, everybody.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company Second Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Mr. Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you, Tabitha. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company second quarter 2012 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Bert Alfonso, Senior Vice President and CFO; and I will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We also welcome those of you listening via the webcast.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2011 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. As we've said within the note, the company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","We will discuss 2012 second quarter results excluding net pre-tax charges of $24.9 million, or $0.07 per share-diluted, which are primarily related to the Project Next Century program. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges, non-service-related pension expense, and acquisition and integration costs related to Brookside Foods.","With that out of the way, let me now turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","John P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark. I want to thank all of you on the phone and the webcast for joining us today. Today, I'm pleased to report that The Hershey Company had another strong quarter with strong marketplace performance. We achieved market share gains in virtually all classes of trade.","Total Hershey's CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, retail takeaway for the year-to-date period through June 16, 2012, in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business, was up 6.1%, resulting in a 0.3-point market share again. As a reminder, this is x AOC+C-store data consisting of the food, drug, mass, x and C-store channels plus the inclusion of Walmart and partial Dollar, Club and Military channels.","Our results for the second quarter were solid, as net sales increased 6.7% and adjusted EPS-diluted grew 17.9%. Bert will provide you with all of the financial details. But as it relates to net sales, growth was primarily driven by net price realization. New product contributed about 2 points to our quarterly sales growth while everyday core volume was off about 3 points.","In terms of marketplace performance, the reported IRI and Nielsen second quarter, the 12-week period ended June 16, does not encompass the entire Easter season in both the year-ago and current periods. Therefore, my remarks today will refer to year-to-date marketplace performance for the 24 weeks ended June 16, 2012.","As it relates to Easter, we had good sell-through and gained Easter market share of 0.9 points in the xAOC universe. We won Easter for the fourth consecutive year, and our market share in this key season expanded to about 36%. Although, note that the shorter Easter season in 2012 versus 2011 is a headwind to our overall chocolate market share performance this year.","Now for some further details on our overall year-to-date marketplace performance. Hershey marketplace performance by segment is progressing as planned. Recall, the year-ago period benefited from our major product launches, primarily Reese's Minis and Hershey's Drops, that occurred early in the year. Our more significant 2012 innovation builds in Q2 and beyond, and we expect this will have a favorable impact on our marketplace performance in the second half of the year.","xAOC+C-store CMG year-to-date category growth is up a solid 5.1%. The combined segments of chocolate, non-chocolate and mints grew 6.9%, while gum declined about 3.5%. Growth by channel has varied. However, the confectionery category is advantaged and ubiquitous. While we focus on all points of distribution, we've been flexible and focused on our efforts and resources with faster-growing customers and classes of trade. Specifically, year-to-date CMG growth in the expanded xAOC universe, which includes Walmart, partial Dollar, Club and Military, increased 7.4%. Hershey retail takeaway was solid across all of these channels.","For the year-to-date period ended June 16, 2012, xAOC+C-store chocolate category growth was up plus 6.1%. xAOC+C-store chocolate retail takeaway for Hershey was plus 4.3% with market share off 0.7 points.","As I mentioned earlier and as planned, Hershey's chocolate performance was impacted by a shorter Easter period and the timing of chocolate new product launches, as well as in-store promotions and programming. We have solid plans in place over the remainder of the year supporting new products in our core chocolate business and expect our chocolate marketplace performance to improve sequentially in the second half.","Year-to-date, xAOC+C-store non-chocolate category growth was up 8.5%. Here, we lead the way. And Hershey's non-chocolate xAOC+C-store retail takeaway was up 16.9%, resulting in a market share gain of 1.1 points. The solid performance was driven by continued TWIZZLERS momentum, including the twisted summers promotion, and the new Jolly Rancher Crunch 'N Chew product.","In the C-store class of trade, CMG year-to-date category growth was up 8.8%. Total Hershey C-store performance was particularly strong with takeaway up plus 10.6%, resulting in a share gain of 0.5 points. Hershey's C-store performance was balanced with retail takeaway up 9.7%, 16.2% and 19.4% in chocolate, non-chocolate and mints. These gains were driven by pricing, new products, core brand advertising and merchandising and programming, including our promotional tie-in with The Avengers movie. Convenience stores will be an important contributor to our marketplace performance in the second half, but as we lap the price increase, we would expect the growth rate to temper over the remainder of the year.","I'd like to make a note that Nielsen C-store service in the first half of the year was based on a sample of 12,000 C-stores with a mixture of scan and audit data collections. Nielsen C-store service for the second half of the year will increase by 7,000 chain C-stores, with all sample stores providing scan data. Therefore, we could see some slight changes in C-store retail trends over the remainder of the year from this improved service that is more focused on additional chain C-stores.","As it relates to our 2012 innovation, recall that it's balanced between chocolate and sweets and refreshment. The launch and rollout of new items, such as Jolly Rancher Crunch 'N Chew, ICE BREAKERS DUO, Rolo Minis and Hershey's Simple Pleasures, are tracking as expected and, as I mentioned, were a net positive to the top line. Although ICE BREAKERS DUO and Simple Pleasures got on shelf late in Q2, we believe they have yet to have an impact on our marketplace results.","Let me provide you with some additional new product details. In the non-chocolate segment, Jolly Rancher Crunch 'N Chew year-to-date takeaway in the xAOC+C-store channels is tracking as expected, making this product the largest non-chocolate candy launch this year.","While early, ICE BREAKERS DUO is showing strong end-market performance. ACV distribution is building and will close by our target at the end of July. Importantly, ICE BREAKERS DUO is experiencing good initial trial and extremely strong repeat. Advertising and sampling started in the mid-July, and we think there could be upside to our initial plan.","Rolo Minis launched in late March and is our latest extension in the hand-to-mouth space. It achieved fast distribution and is tracking ahead of expectations for both trial and repeat. Additionally, core Rolo brand performance is up versus last year and in late July, we'll activate TV advertising on this brand for the first time in over 25 years.","Initial distribution of Simple Pleasures is on target. This FDMx-specific product is garnering merchandising and programming at select customers. Marketing plans are in place, including advertising and a high-value FSI in mid-August, to drive trial and repeat.","In addition to our innovation, over the remainder of the year, we have many exciting promotions, programs and merchandising events in place across all of our channels. Some of the activity we have planned includes S'mores programming that will run throughout the key summer dates and into fall tailgating; a couple of TWIZZLERS summer programs, one is tied into the Spiderman movie and another that will award a lucky consumer a chance to win a new car filled with their favorite TWIZZLER products; as well as the summer Reese's and Coca-Cola promotion.","Outside of the U.S., our international business is on track, especially in geographies of China, Mexico and Brazil. In China, Hershey continues to be one of the fastest-growing international chocolate companies, as our chocolate growth rate is double the category in the cities where we're focused. In Mexico, we've seen strong growth in the Hershey's and KISSES franchise and on sweets and refreshments. Our Pelon Pelo Rico net sales are up double digits on a percentage basis, driven by the introduction of the Peloneta lollipop. In Brazil, we continue to make good progress. And following our distribution gains, we'll begin advertising in additional cities during 2012.","Given the volatility in the financial markets, we've updated our estimates for the full year related to the strong U.S. dollar. In our key international markets, we still expect double-digit reported net sales growth for the full year, but it is less than our earlier outlook and year-ago due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. As we outlined at our investor update last month, we'll continue our disciplined investments in distribution and go-to-market capabilities in these key markets that continue to drive solid local currency and marketplace results.","Now to wrap up. I'm pleased with the way the confectionery category and Hershey continue to perform in the marketplace. Macroeconomic challenges still exist. However, we feel good about the performance of the confectionery category. Shipments of back-to-school and Halloween essentially had no year-over-year impact in Q2.","To date, retail customer Halloween orders are on track with our outlook. Similar to Easter, we believe we have the right mix of seasonal-specific advertising, couponing and programming.","Over the remainder of the year, we're confident that our innovation, advertising and in-store execution will continue to drive top line growth. As previously mentioned, advertising will increase low double digits on a percentage basis versus last year, supporting U.S. and international brand-building initiatives. Our plans are on track, and we expect organic volume growth to accelerate in the second half of the year and be up for the full year 2012.","Therefore, including estimated net sales of the Brookside acquisition, about a 1.5-point benefit at current exchange rates, we expect full year net sales growth of about 7% to 9%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Bert will provide further details, but given our gross margin gains and SM&A investments to be made over the remainder of the year, we have increased our full year adjusted earnings per share-diluted outlook and expect it to increase 12% to 14%.","I'll now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some additional detail on our financial results.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Thanks, J.P., and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that Hershey posted another strong quarter. Consolidated net sales in the second quarter totaled $1.41 billion, up 6.7% versus the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $0.66, up 17.9% versus a year ago, was better than our expectations primarily due to solid gross margin and earlier resolution of certain tax items. I have more on each of these points shortly.","Net price realization, primarily in the U.S., increased 6.6 points in the quarter and slightly better than expectations. Excluding a 2.4-point benefit from the Brookside acquisition, net volume declined 1.1 points. Note that in the U.S., new products contributed about 2 points of growth, while everyday core was off about 3 points. While relatively in line with historical volume elasticity, Q2 core volume was slightly lower than our assumption when we last spoke. Finally, foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 1.2 points.","Turning now to gross margins. During the second quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 170 basis points, driven by greater-than-expected net price realization, supply chain efficiencies and productivity gains, which were partially offset by higher input costs of approximately $25 million. Commodity spot markets continued to be volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue in the upcoming months. As previously stated, we have good visibility into our cost structure, and there is no material change in our full year inflation outlook. Given our gross margin gains for the first 6 months of the year, we now expect adjusted gross margin to increase 100 to 120 basis points versus our previous estimate of 90 to 100 basis points.","In the second quarter, adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes, or EBIT, increased about 9%, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin of 17.5%, up about 40 basis points versus last year. As expected, SM&A, excluding advertising, increased mid-teens on a percentage basis versus last year. Over the remainder of the year, we expect SM&A expenses, excluding advertising, to increase 15% to 20% in the third quarter but lower in the fourth quarter. These planned investments are primarily concentrated in marketing and go-to-market capabilities in both the U.S. and international markets, as well as expenses related to our new R&D center in China and other employee-related costs.","Advertising expense in Q2 increased about 10% versus the year-ago period. For the first 6 months of 2012, advertising was up about 12% versus 2011 and in line with low double-digit percentage increase forecasted for the full year.","Now, let me provide an update of our international businesses. On a reported basis, net sales in our targeted focus markets, Mexico, China, Brazil and India, were about flat due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Despite the stronger U.S. dollar, on a local currency basis, we're pleased with our overall sales performance in these markets. Our business has continued to grow above category growth rates. And on a percentage basis, local currency net sales were up solid double digits in China and Mexico and high single digits in Brazil.","The investments we've made in these target markets are enabling our brands to gain momentum in the marketplace. We'll continue to make disciplined investments in these markets over the remainder of the year to drive brand awareness and trial.","For the full year 2012, we expect reported net sales outside of the U.S. and Canada to increase about 15%, in line with our strategic plan, including the negative impact of foreign exchange. Operating income outside the U.S. and Canada was down in the second quarter due mostly to the net season -- net sale seasonalization of our focus markets.","Moving down the P&L. For the quarter, interest expense was in line with the expectations, coming in at $24.3 million versus $23.4 million in the prior period. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $95 million to $105 million.","The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 32%, lower than a year ago and the outlook we provided in April. Various tax audits were concluded in the second quarter that we had planned for in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect the tax rate to be higher in the third quarter and below the annual average in Q4. For the full year, we continue to expect the tax rate to be slightly below 35%.","In the second quarter of 2012, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 228.9 million versus 230.3 million in 2011, leading to adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $0.66, up 17.9% versus year-ago.","Let me now provide a quick recap of the year-to-date adjusted results. Net sales increased 8.9% in the first half. Adjusted EBIT increased 19.6%, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin gain of 180 basis points to 19.6% from 17.8%. Advertising increased 12% on a year-to-date basis, in line with the low double-digit percentage increase forecasted for the full year. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 45 -- 44.5% versus 42.7% last year, or 180 basis points higher, as net price realization and productivity more than offset commodity costs. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted in the first half increased 26% to $1.62 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's second quarter by $200 million. Accounts receivable was up $56 million, primarily due to higher June sales year-on-year, in part due to the timing of last year's price increase. Accounts receivable aging remains extremely current. Inventory increased $133 million year-over-year, primarily due to production associated with the Project Next Century transition and the timing of strategic purchases of key ingredients. Over the remainder of the year, we expect these items to work through the system, and year-end 2012 inventory will be about at 2011 ending levels. And finally, accounts payable decreased $11 million, primarily due to lower capital spend levels.","In terms of other specific cash flow items, capital additions including software were $56 million in the quarter. These amounts include Project Next Century capital expenditures of $12 million. In 2012, we expect the ongoing CapEx to be approximately $240 million to $250 million, excluding Project Next Century. Our total 2012 CapEx estimate of $305 million to $320 million includes Project Next Century capital of approximately $65 million to $70 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $55 million in the second quarter. This includes accelerated depreciation related to Project Next Century of approximately $6 million. In 2012, we are forecasting total operating depreciation and amortization of about $195 million to $205 million, consistent with our previous estimates.","Dividends paid during the quarter were $84 million. We did not acquire any stock in the second quarter related to the current share repurchase program or replace shares issued in connection with stock option exercises. Cash on hand at the end Q2 was $590 million. And as we exit the second quarter, we are well positioned to support the seasonal working capital needs of the business, which peak in the third quarter.","Let me now provide an update on Project Next Century. We are pleased with the progress we've made at the West Hershey plant expansion. Construction and line installation are largely complete, and our current focus is on line performance optimization. The forecast for total pre-tax GAAP charges and non-recurring project implementation costs related to the program has been increased from $150 million to $160 million to $160 million to $180 million due to higher-than-expected disposition costs of the legacy facility. The higher projected costs could increase further if severed employee withdrawals from the pension plan in the second half of the year exceed certain accounting threshold levels, which trigger a pension settlement charge. Importantly, any pension settlement charges would be noncash. By 2014, we continue to expect ongoing annual savings to be approximately $65 million to $80 million.","Now let me summarize. As we enter the third quarter, we are well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives. As stated earlier, we expect full year advertising expenses to increase low-double digits on a percentage basis versus last year to support seasons, new product launches and core brands in both the U.S. and international markets.","Our plans are on track, and we expect organic volume growth to accelerate in the second half and be up for the full year. Therefore, including an estimated 1.5-point net sales benefit from the Brookside acquisition, we expect 2012 net sales, including the impact of foreign exchange, to increase 7% to 9%.","We expect that commodity markets will remain volatile. However, we have visibility into our cost structure. While we continue to anticipate higher input costs, there is no change in our full year inflation outlook.","As previously mentioned, due to greater-than-expected net price realization, we now expect the adjusted gross margin to increase 100 to 120 basis points.","As stated earlier, for the full year 2012, we expect SM&A expenses including -- excluding advertising, to increase low double digits on a percentage basis versus last year. We will continue to make planned investments in marketing and go-to-market capabilities in both the U.S. and international markets. As a result, we now expect 2012 earnings per share-diluted growth of 12% to 14%, greater than our previous estimate of 12 -- of 10% to 12%.","Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to provide a recap of the timing of unique items discussed earlier that will impact Q3 and Q4. So as you work your models, please note the following: Over the remainder of the year, we expect organic net sales contribution from net price realization and volume to be more balanced as we lap the price increase. Therefore, gross margin gains in the second half of the year will be less than the year-to-date gains. In the third quarter, we expect SM&A expense, excluding advertising, to increase 15% to 20%. And we expect the effective tax rate in Q3 to be higher than the annual rate. As a result of all these moving parts and higher SM&A in Q3, we would expect Q4 to drive EPS in the second half.","We'll now open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","How would you describe the overall category innovation environment right now, not just from you but your competitors? Because -- I'm asking because your market share gains are impressive across the board. I'm trying to get a sense of whether you're seeing competitors innovate as you'd expect them to or whether we're in a period where maybe some of your competitors are off their game. And I don't really know. I'm just curious if, in your opinion, you're beating the best at their best, or whether we should expect a tougher challenge going forward. I know that -- I know this requires a subjective answer. I'm just curious how you see things at the moment in that regard.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. Sure, Ken. Well, first of all, it always feels like we're competing against the best every day. But I think the innovation in the category, we're seeing a little bit more of a tick-up than we have over the last couple of years. And just kind of to put things in perspective, I feel really good about the overall category growth. I think the fundamentals in the category are good. Our competitors had solid innovation in the first quarter. Our second quarter innovation was very much around some of our sweets and refreshments brands. And therefore, you had a little bit of a difference between what our innovation looked like versus some of the competitors' innovation. But I think it's really good for the -- I think it's really good for the category. The final point I would just make from our standpoint is, is that our overall growth algorithm is to have about 1 point of growth from innovation. We feel good that we're probably going to, this year, be well above that, probably in the 1.5-plus point range, and we were better than that last year. So I think -- I think it's a good environment. And we have tough competitors and they're doing well, but I think that's good for everybody.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one more. I think last year you had, if memory serves, fewer Halloween products offered. I don't think there was -- you didn't do the harvest packaging after Halloween, I think. Did you address some of those issues? How should we think about how you're feeling about that season and correcting maybe some of the problems you had last year?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, we're correcting for those things and we feel really good about the visibility we have to Halloween and the holidays for the balance of the year. Remember, one of the things you don't want to do is win share the week after those holiday events, because that's when all of the significant markdowns are. So I think we're getting better and better every time. It's selling what we believe the consumer is looking to consume, and it continues to work well for retailers and we continue to grow well in the seasons and perform how we would like.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","With, I guess, much of the EPS upside in the second half that you expect looking to come from continued gross margin-related strength, I'm just curious, is that -- is that still going to be driven by, sort of, what you saw in this quarter, which is, I guess, a bit better-than-anticipated pricing coming through, at least relative to when you had started the whole, sort of, pricing action last year?","John P. Bilbrey","Andrew, I think I would characterize it a little bit different than that. If you think about -- we're looking for sales to come in again in that 7% to 9% range. We're slightly ahead of that at the halfway point, mostly because we had a very strong first quarter and we had the pricing on the Easter holiday. But again, that still calls for good sales performance in the back half. The pricing will actually play a smaller role in Qs 3 and 4 because we've completely lapped it at this stage, other than the Halloween and holiday period. And so we've averaged probably about 170 to 175 basis points of gross margin in the first half of the year. We will expect that, obviously, given our outlook of 100 to 120, to be somewhat less, specifically, because of the -- of pricing playing a smaller role. The counter to that is we certainly expect volumes to start accelerating and be more balanced between price and volume in the back half, which we haven't seen as much year-to-date. SM&A, I commented specifically on third quarter. We were -- we actually underspent a bit, as you recall, in the first quarter due to some timing. We're back to, sort of, where we thought we'd be. It's a little higher than the third quarter, so earnings in the back half driven by top line, a little bit lighter -- a little bit less gross margin due to lower price realization, a bit of investment behind the business to give us continued momentum against new products. And we think fourth quarter EPS is -- on a comparable basis, will sequentially be better than third quarter.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. The reason I asked is just because, given the $0.05 raise to the full year, a good part of that comes in the second half, which is still operating upside in the second half of the year. So I certainly understand what drove some of the upside in the second quarter, the margin side. I was just trying to get a better sense for what drives the rest of that upside in the back half. And I guess it's really just more of a combination of still, obviously, some of the pricing, although less significant in the first half, and then volumes starting to come back into a better balance into growth mode. Does that, I guess, make sense?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, that's exactly right. I -- that's exactly the way I would put it. We continue to get some pricing. But with the volume recovery there, we're expecting, despite the additional investment, that gives us the ability to upgrade the EPS outlook for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wanted ask you -- you gave a number early on, J.P., about -- when you were discussing the revenue growth for the quarter, and I think you said like a 2% benefit from new products and sort of your core down 3%. Was that referenced -- referencing just the U.S.? Or was that an overall comment for the company?","John P. Bilbrey","It's really a total number, but it's reflective of the U.S. business, so...","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess my only question in relation to that would be that international should have been a pretty solid contributor to that on a volume basis. And I just want to understand, kind of, how international played. And you mentioned, I think, double-digit reported growth but closer to maybe flat growth if you include FX in the quarter, if I heard that properly.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. From a volume perspective, international would've been a net plus. So we specifically -- we specifically broke out the U.S. piece just to be more transparent.","Mark K. Pogharian","But, Chris, international isn't a big driver in the second quarter, as much as some of it is -- some of the business is seasonal related, so there is -- you will probably see international being a bigger driver of quarterly results in the first and in the fourth.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Due to holidays and seasonal, I assume.","John P. Bilbrey","Correct.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just another question for you, just to be clear on the SM&A, sort of, guidance from here. You've indicated a pretty solid growth in SM&A in the third quarter. I'm sorry if I missed it, but how should we expect the fourth quarter SM&A, x advertising, to -- would that be down in the quarter?","John P. Bilbrey","It won't be down in the quarter, but it will be below the second quarter levels. And we said second quarter was sort of mid-teens. Third quarter is a little higher. 3 is up -- 3 up from 2, but 4 down from 2.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to know, is there -- as you head into fourth quarter, the guidance I think implies kind of a deceleration in EPS growth, which I think is totally fine. But I want to know, are you planning on doing any kind of reinvestment in fourth quarter? Sometimes that happens when you're heading into a really strong year.","John P. Bilbrey","Right now, our reinvestment plans are pretty close to plan. So I wouldn't say that as a result of a strong first half that we've decided to increase higher than planned rates. There is a tax impact, obviously, in the third quarter, but we're getting the benefit in the second because of just the resolution of a couple of tax audits that we thought would come in the back half of the year. So I wouldn't characterize our investments in the back half, while they're stronger than the first half, as being in addition to what we thought we would be doing early in the year.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up. You have, obviously, very good visibility into Halloween. What about convenience stores in the back half? That's been a huge driver of growth. Do you have visibility there? Is the momentum -- do you expect the momentum just to continue? And what are your customers saying?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, we have strong programming throughout the balance of the year, certainly, that's C-store focused. We continue to see strength in the channel, and so we feel really good about what our planning looks like and we can -- we continue to hear pretty optimistic commentary from our retailers as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I apologize in advance, juggling a couple of balls here, so I hope you didn't already comment on this. But volume this quarter -- I think last quarter, you were expecting it to be roughly flat. It's a little bit softer than that. Not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill here, but can you just help me understand where the shortfall was?","John P. Bilbrey","Sure. First of all, I would go back to the earlier comment I made about the category continues to perform well. We feel good about the fundamentals. We saw a little bit lower merchandising on our brands in the quarter than we do -- we did versus the previous quarter, which confirms for us some of the broad-based success of innovation in the category. So as we look at what we were lapping, what our programming was, we probably came in a little bit different than we did. Also remember, when we talk about innovation, even though that's on major brands and then we talk about the core volume, those are still core brands. So if you combine those 2, it's also really about 1 point there. FDMx was a little softer for us than was the balance but again, we grew. So I felt fairly good about that and while we would like to grow share in every category in perpetuity, we might not actually be able to do that, so...","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And one quick follow-up. I really appreciate the increased disclosure in terms of sales growth outside of North America. Can you add any commentary in terms of where we sit in terms of profit inflection there?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. In terms of our international business, the second quarter, I think Mark mentioned it, it's our lowest quarter internationally. You don't have Chinese New Year. Easter's big in a couple of the markets, particularly Brazil, a little bit in Mexico. And so the second quarter tends to be our low quarter, and we continue to invest at a pretty good pace as we build infrastructure in the selling and what have you. So we're actually, outside of U.S. and Canada, operating income net down. It's different from market to market. In markets where we've been longer, whether you talk about Mexico or Brazil, we tend to have a little bit more. In markets like China, where we're in a pretty strong reinvest mode, I'd say we're still a little bit further away. Now we can flex that as we think is necessary given the market conditions. But right now, we're seeing great top line growth, and we think making the strong investments now is the right thing to do for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Markets.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about seasonal execution, specifically. Because it seems to me that even last Halloween, but certainly Easter, candy as a whole and Hershey, specifically, has taken endcaps from other categories, gotten great display activity and that's resulted in not only Hershey share gains, but good holidays overall for the candy industry. I wonder if -- can you comment on whether those trends are still intact, if that's accelerating or it's the same? And where do we stand in terms of that promotional execution, say, versus this time last year?","John P. Bilbrey","Jonathan, it's interesting. We have worked really, really hard on what we call prescriptive selling around holidays and in our -- in basically our seasonal events. And I think we're getting much, much better at how we execute, both in getting it up at the right time and then ensuring that it's selling through at the right time. So when we look at these events, we actually could probably sell more than we do in terms of the sell-in. But as we work with our retailers, one of the things they're learning too is, is they need to get these seasonal events off the floor to get into the next one so that they can also be timely. And so getting the sell-through to occur more at the planned rates is really important. So we just feel good about the overall execution. It leverages our sales organization, which is in there. It's our seasonal navigator tool, which is proprietary, that we help manage the category. And so I think if you bundle all of those things together, we're getting better. We've talked about S'mores, how it's almost become a season, and then we've had a terrific event with TWIZZLERS this summer. So the -- you're right on when you describe what you're seeing and it's very, very much how we challenge our seasonal team to work with retailers to make these things as prescriptive as possible.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Great. If I could just have one follow-up. Can you -- where would you say -- could you characterize where you stand in terms of shipment into, if any, of seasonal activity at this point? Or where are you going to run in terms of that? Is that going to run heavier, sooner or in line with last year or whatever?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, what I don't want to do is talk about what those volume targets are. What I would tell you is, is there's certainly no disappointment from our side or discussions with retailers that we're not collaborating on what we think the right volumes are. And so read that as a positive, not a negative. I guess the overall comment I'd make, if you look at our takeaway and our shipments where we feel really good about is, is that we continue to see those running very, very close, which is always a positive sign for the overall supply chain and how products are moving through the total system, and that usually is found money for everybody when you're efficient throughout the entire system. So we feel really good about the planning of those events for the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And forgive me if I -- if this was asked. I missed the first part of the Q&A. But there's been -- I guess as we've gone through earnings season, at least on the -- from some of the beverage companies, there's been a bit a controversy about whether or not there's been some slowing in the convenience channel, particularly late, I guess, in the second quarter and\/or maybe the beginning of the third quarter. And so just your perspective on consumer behavior in that channel, whether you've noticed any change at all in your categories or just in general, just the consumer environment in that channel, would be helpful.","John P. Bilbrey","Bryan, first of all, I'll make a general comment that I think that it can be dangerous -- and I can't speak to the beverage guys. So I think it can be dangerous if we get too enamored by some of the short-term swings. However, in our business, we continue to see really robust C-store business. We continue to execute well. We've got good programming. So in the retailers that we talk to on our brands, they're pretty positive, frankly. And so while there's a lot of events, I think, and a lot of moving parts today that maybe didn't happen across channels as much over the last several years, for our brands, our category, we continue to see really good trends. And we feel good about the planning that we have.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And if I could follow up. Just now that we've-- we're closer to the end in terms of this last round of price increases, how do you feel about the optics for consumers? Have they fully adjusted to the price points that they're seeing on the shelf now, both in traditional food channels and also in C-stores? And how do you feel about there's -- given there's potential for volatility in input costs going forward, how do you feel about the base you have now in terms of consumers' comfort level with the price points they're seeing and the ability to basically have that as a base to work with going forward, I guess, potentially, at some point, if raw material costs increase, to raise prices off of this point? And also, do you feel comfortable that you don't have to discount back a lot from where you are now?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, Bryan, I would say that given the price realization that we've seen in the first couple of quarters and by and large, while we were a little bit off on our second quarter volume call, it isn't anything that concerns us. We see good continued trends for the back half of the year. So I'd say that the consumer has adjusted reasonably well to the pricing. If we look at how -- at Easter as an indicator of how consumers might be feeling around Halloween and holiday, that's a good sign. I won't comment on timing or anything, other aspects of a price increase. We did say in New York recently at our analyst -- on our analyst day that we felt that costs would actually be down year-on-year given trends in 2013. Don't know what'll happen beyond that. So from our perspective, I -- we think innovation continues to be a driver and all of that comes out at the new price points, obviously. And so as long as there's news in the category and programming and those seasons, which are traffic draws for the retailer, we think that prices will continue to be well accepted by our consumers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wanted to ask a little bit about the Reese's brand, and J.P., I'm sorry, I might have missed it if you said it earlier, but how did Reese's do overall? And then specifically, can you pull that apart a little bit and talk about Reese's Minis? I'm interested to hear how it does in its second year of launch. That was such a big product last year. And want to know if we're seeing any tailing off in that particular brand at this point. And then maybe, if you could talk a little bit about, how do you support a new product like that in its second year?","John P. Bilbrey","So let me start with the last part. If you think about how we're looking at innovation today, really, the most important thing is around innovation lifecycle versus just around what we knew, at one point, as a lot of limited editions, and those have a tendency to run their course and get tired. So we're very pleased with the innovation in total, not just on Reese's, but innovation in total that we have. We continue to advertise into year 2, and we continue to go beyond that because we really think that if our innovation is additive to our core business over time, that's obviously a good thing. If you look at Reese's in total, the Reese's core minus innovation, because of the amount of merchandising that happened in the introductory period of the Reese's Minis, you see the core merchandising was off a little bit in the quarter and that impacted the core business, which was down a little bit more than the innovation was up. So again, the Reese's business, we continue to feel really good about it. Reese's continues to grow for us. It's obviously a hugely important brand, and we think Minis is going to be around for a long time. And we hope that the whole hand-to-mouth occasion, not only on Reese's but across more of our brands, will continue to be a good growth builder for us.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And one follow-up. J.P., one of the things that, I think, really was so special about Hershey is that as the advertising spending increased in '08, '09, '10, '11 and now in '12 by such strong rates of increase, we saw that year after year, the places that you were putting the advertising on, those increases on, we saw very high rates of growth, almost as if the brands had just not been activated in a long time and reminding the consumers was causing high single-digit growth in most cases for the brands that you were activating. The question had been and continues to be, do you still see the same kind of momentum from the advertising campaigns today as you did in year 1 and year 2 of the initial increase in the advertising budget? Hopefully, that was reasonably clear.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. No, I understand. I think that when you think about initially activating a brand and certainly one that hasn't been nourished for a while, you get very good response initially. What's important in our overall plans is, is that we've gotten brands that were undernourished to what I would call sustaining levels. So you go through growth levels and you get to sustaining levels and at those sustaining levels, the goal is for those brands to continue to grow, which is what we're seeing. And then as we activate really in 2 different segments, we activate more broadly across our portfolio. But as you think about some of those brands like PayDay and York, et cetera, we have those brands that we will rotate through. So there's a segment of brands there that we believe we can do some rotation around. It benefits the brand. It keeps them current, in front of the consumer. And then the other segment I would talk about you're seeing as a part of the advertising is the investment in our international businesses in these core markets. So we really -- with our spend today, it's not just spending more on the same thing over and over again. We've really been able to become more efficient in terms of the GRPs we get, expand that across our portfolio and then further expand that across our geographies.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And, J.P., would you then say that this is the core of the thesis why you guys are continuing to be optimistic about not just 2012 but about 2013 and beyond that? Because it's not as if we're just going to reach a plateau and suddenly the benefits from the advertising stall out. This is how it continues in the future years. Is that more or less correct?","John P. Bilbrey","I -- Yes, I think that's right. And the real magic in so much of our growth algorithm and in our strategies is that we have these wonderful markets where you have GDP growth, the category is growing with GDP growth and we can participate in those markets, as we talked back in New York, that, that's not just a high-cost battle for share. That's really category growing. All manufacturers are participating. Consumers are entering [ph] the category. So it's very, very efficient to be able to grow that way and then we're very fortunate that we have a significant position in such a great market like North America. So if I look at the coming 5-plus years and our current strategic plan, I'm just really optimistic that we have a sound, disciplined approach to continue to deliver solid business growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It does looks like Hershey -- getting back to the innovation topic, which we've hit on already, it does looks like Hershey has rolled out fewer new products in terms of the number of new products than its competitors in this year, and that's striking given the fact that the market share gains are there. It seems like a year of pricing and reinvestment, widening the hit on advertising across more brands and allowing this year to be maybe a digestion year from the platforms and supporting year of the platforms that you rolled out in the last couple years. My question is, are you thinking that 2013 might be a year where you're past the digestion phase and the reinforcement phase of those platforms and you can get a little bit more active on the new product news front, maybe with a big platform or 2?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, I think, David, it's -- so we believe innovation is important to the category. There's no doubt about that. At the same time, when we're able to make the investments we want to make, execute against the fundamentals and pace our innovation in a way that we're delivering against what we see is a sound growth algorithm, that's what we're going to continue to do. And so we feel good about our pipeline. It's really about pacing. We believe that the right level of innovation for the category -- and we're seeing more innovation, I think, this year than we have. That's a good thing. We want to participate in that. But importantly, we want to ensure that we have sustainable innovation. And to the earlier question, lifecycle of these is important, so that we don't create so much churn in the category that really it's unprofitable for everybody.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And do you -- I mean, do you feel at this point that your -- that we've had enough time, lifecycle-wise, as you're saying, where you could see yourselves doing and your pipeline is offering you some highly incremental new news, that it may be time?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, I think as you -- I think as we look forward, first of all, we have initiatives out there. We're emphasizing our sweets and refreshments category in a way we never have before and we feel as though that's rewarding as well. Obviously, chocolate is extremely important to us and we have things that we're doing there. We're coming off of a couple of really big blockbusters with the Minis. And as we look forward, we expect to continue to introduce things at the right pace, and hopefully, that really resonates well with the consumers. So I think the way you're thinking about it is not inconsistent with how we think about it. But we probably have been far more disciplined in the way that we've done innovation than we have in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just have a quick question on Simple Pleasures. And I know it's early, but what's your impression right now who the consumers for this product? And where would Simple Pleasures take its market share from?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, Simple Pleasures is an indulgent product. It also has some benefit of lower fat content and there's this consumer we call -- let me think here for a second, but it's more of a permissible indulgence. Sorry, I have to search my hard drive there in my mind. But it's more of a permissible-indulgence type product, and so we believe that there's some trade-up type customers if you think about those brands that it would source some of its volume from, and it's a bit different than some of the other -- it has some nice differentiation from some of the other products in the category.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, in the press release, you talked about the CMG category outpacing -- continuing to outpace historic growth rates. Do we have to adjust our, kind of, assumptions for what the category could grow at? Or in other words, is this growth right now sustainable for the category?","John P. Bilbrey","We feel as though the category growth has -- I used the word, at one point in time, I think earlier, around the \"new normal.\" But if you look at the 3% to 4% historical growth rate and where the category is growing today, I think that the key difference that I see that makes me a believer in continued category growth, at least in the North American mindset, is the investment that continues to be made in the category in terms of advertising. We've talked a lot this morning about innovation. And then don't forget, in a tough retail environment, retailers are looking for categories that are good for them and our category is good for retailers. So I think we'll continue to get our fair share as a category of overall merchandising in the store and that, I think, are all positive fundamentals to future growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just wanted to round out the conversation on the channel discussion. I know you said something about C-stores and traditionals. Can you talk about mass and where you think the other growth, dollar stores, drugs? Can you talk about the distribution of growth that you saw during the quarter, just round it out?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think if I were to just put it in 2, sort of, macro comments, we saw FDMx had a bit of a grower -- a lower growth rate than the balance of some of the things you described. If you think about Walmart, Club, Dollar, those collection of the new part of the xAOC growth, so you saw a little bit greater growth there than you did in the others. We still saw pretty balanced growth across all of those customers for us in the category as well. So there -- the consumer seems to be moving around a little bit. But overall, that's how we see our category responding right now. And then of course, we talked convenience earlier and convenience continues to do really well for us.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Are there any channels that you still feel like there is market -- relative market share gains that you can have in terms of penetration that you need to still allocate more resources towards?","John P. Bilbrey","I think, for us, continuing to be dedicated to growth in our international businesses and the core markets that we talked about, increasing our capabilities there, so if you think about expanding our geographical footprint, which is the second thing that we talked about in our strategy, and then expanding our portfolio across those geographies, that's going to keep us pretty busy and that's probably where you'll see us...","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","There's no channels -- there's no retail channels that you still feel like you're underrepresented relative to where you want to...","John P. Bilbrey","I think that we're learning a lot about the Dollar channel and we're trying to do better there. We want to make sure we do it smart, just -- versus just putting things out. So that's an area. But if you look at our brands and our coverage, it's pretty ubiquitous.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And my last question is on the commodity outlook. Obviously, you sound like you're pretty well hedged through the year. Is there any concerns at all into 2013 in commodity? It doesn't look like it for you guys, but just in general, if you could just talk about the general outlook for commodities for you guys because it seems like everything seems to be under control. Milk's probably going up a little bit from here. But can you just talk to it a little bit?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, I mean, we mentioned that we had good visibility to this year. So clearly, our inflation expectation hasn't changed. We mentioned in New York that we felt that next year, at least, the trend feels favorable right now. You're right to point out the area. It's one that's not easily hedged and so we watch that closely as we do other commodities. But I wouldn't say that there's anything right now that we're extremely concerned about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I guess most of my questions have been answered. But just thinking back to the investor day and your strategy over the next couple -- 2 or 3 years as maybe the economy starts to recover, I remember a few years ago, premium was a big growth theme in this category and I think you had a couple of false starts in that area. As you start to think about the longer-term, is that an area that you're going to be focused on? And how might you prepare for that coming back?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, we talk about premium and if you look at the category today, and these numbers are probably some that you're perfectly familiar with, but I'll say them, premium and trade-up represents about 12% of the total category today. If you look at what's happened over the last several years, premium had declined some and it's now recovering some. Trade-up is declining some. So that percentage of the business, which has been relatively constant over time, is one that we have not, I would just say, succeeded at. Now, we feel very good about the fact that we concentrate in where the bulk of the category is today. We do well there. But we talk about and have projects in place around how to think about premium. We think there's potentially a couple of share points there in the total category that if we were to sort that out, we could benefit from. One of the issues for us is that we haven't convinced ourselves that we can do that more profitably than some of the other things that we're doing. And so solving for it within that context, because I don't want to chase share that could be less profitable for us than not. But I recognize your question and it's one that we, too, think about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A quick one. On the strategic inventory purchase that you mentioned, Bert, is that the nonfat dry powdered milk? Because I think, as Ken asked, that has hurt you in the past and I understand that there's an excess supply of that at the moment.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, I really can't -- or won't comment on specifically what inventories we've made strategic purchases in. You're right to point out that there is good supply of that in the marketplace, but that's really all I'll say, Eric.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe more importantly, I got a little bit confused, J.P., with all of the numbers and acronyms and stuff around the market share. But just let me try to frame it this way. So in the first 3 months, the market share was flat. In the second 3 months -- the second quarter, your market share was up. So you obviously accelerated your share sequentially as the year has gone on. But it sounds like most of that is coming in seasonal because every day, your shipments are actually down a couple of cent [ph]. So I guess, one, is that accurate? And two, what does that say about the everyday category? Is that -- did you gain share in everyday volume and therefore, the category is even worse based on the elasticity?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think, Eric, what we may want to do to get into a lot of the detail is we can probably take some of that offline and Mark can help us go through each of those numbers. What I would tell you is, across each pieces of the business, we continue to feel pretty good about the progress that we're making, with the exception that we were disappointed, just so we have a goal for ourselves to grow share across all of our businesses. And so chocolate was off a little bit. The everyday would have been impacted by the innovation that we were seeing. But fundamentally, I don't think that I would describe any of those events as causing us concern around what our overall plans are for the year. So our seasonal performance has been good. We did very good at Easter, as we described earlier. The instant consumable business is doing well. The Minis continues to do very well. Front-ends continued to do well. And so I think if you describe it, those are the places where it's a bit softer for us than maybe we would have liked. But I think we understand what's happening in the category. So it doesn't cause alarm bells. We're still going through a period of time where we said volume would be back to 100% by the end of the year. So as we look at that on a period-to-period basis, we always see some fluctuation there. So again, I'm more than happy offline to get into some further detail to help you understand that.","Mark K. Pogharian","Hey, Eric, it's Mark. And it's not an apples-to-apples because I think the flat share you're referring to in the first quarter was FDMxC and now we're talking about the xAOC+C universe. So -- and I think as you -- from our remarks, I think...","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Now I'm more confused. Because I'm just worried -- obviously, you guys are doing well in seasonal but I wonder about the category's health, because to Chris Growe's question, right, your volume is down 3 in everyday. That includes some benefit, maybe not all that material but some benefit from international, and so is the category's elasticity better than that, worse? I'm just -- I'm not -- so we can go over it, Mark, a little later.","Humberto P. Alfonso","The only thing I would say is that the minus 3 doesn't include the international benefit. We specifically spoke about U.S. to just be more transparent.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. We look forward to talking to you, Eric, offline.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","So -- I guess, again, kind of a follow-up from Chris' question and Eric's question. Can we just ask it and say if we look at the -- what we saw at the analyst day, what we're seeing in our data is just there is, obviously, deceleration within the C-store channel, at least as it pertains to confection. I don't know if it's price driven. You're seeing 3% down in core. So is the next -- does this all relate then to why there is, kind of, the next stage of growth should be coming from international? I mean, the core is obviously -- it's about -- I guess, about 1\/3 of your business, it sounds like. And if we see a deceleration continue as pricing is rolled off in C-stores, we -- and then we also saw some volume share pickup from Mars in Q2 within C-stores. And then as we think about '13, it would just seem as if there is a deceleration, kind of, in the core and then what we would expect to have happen is that advertising would be kind of going up even further and continued into '13 to really drive the international part.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, first, I would start by saying is I don't think we believe there is a broad deceleration in the C-store business. And we continue to be -- as we've talked about how we're looking at the balance of the year, we see sequential improvement in share, specifically in chocolate. And so -- again, I would come back to what we have visibility to across the balance of the year. We've had, as a category, very successful innovations in the first half and the things I would tell you that, that innovation has been not from a single manufacturer but from multiple manufacturers. That's good for the category. And so I think the context is not as you may be describing it.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay. Perfect. And then last question, easy one. The tax rate -- and I think, in your prepared remarks, you said that it was still 35%. In the call, you said it'd be slightly below. For Q2, you said tax would be slightly below year-over-year. It was over 400 basis points below. So just to clarify, should we be expecting a tax rate that's kind of 34% to 35% now for the full year?","Humberto P. Alfonso","No, I -- well, no. We already said the tax rate for the full year...","Mark K. Pogharian","Yes, closer to 35%...","Humberto P. Alfonso","Would be just a little below the 35% level, and that's consistent with what we've said all year. The only thing that occurred in the second quarter was that we closed a couple of tax audits which we had in the plan for the second year. So it's really more timing during the year. The tax rate is the same as what we anticipated early in the year.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you very much for joining us for today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions]","Mr. Mark Pogharian, please go ahead.","Mark Pogharian","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Hershey Company's first quarter 2014 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Dave Tacka, Senior Vice President and CFO; and I, will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We also welcome all of you listening via the web cast.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2012 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted or pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.","The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss 2014 first quarter results excluding net pre-tax charges of $13.4 million or $0.04 per share diluted, related to the net acquisition and transaction costs, primarily associated with Shanghai Golden Monkey, project Next Century, and non-service-related pension income. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","John Bilbrey","Thanks Mark. Good morning to everyone on the phone and web cast. During the first quarter, we made solid progress against the initiatives we discussed earlier this year that gives us confidence Hershey will deliver on its 2014 expectation. As we stated back in January and at CAGNY, we expected the first quarter to be pressured by year ago comp, and the timing of our 2014 innovation. However, Q1 topline results were a bit softer than we anticipated due to some unexpected anomalies related to U.S. consumer trip within the various classes of trade, and weakness in our Latin America business.","Despite Q1 store traffic issues, U.S. net sales increased 3.4% less than our expectations. Specifically in channels such as convenience stores and dollar stores, we are profitable and also instant consumable pack types drive sales, consumer trips declined more than we anticipated.","In the traditional food and mass channels, consumer trips were relatively in line with our expectation. However, the basket included a greater focus on staples. Importantly, as we got closer to the end of March and into April, it appears the consumer shopping behavior was returning to normal. While preliminary April Nielsen data for the four week ended April 19th, indicate a strong sell-through for the Easter season, and a sequential improvement in non-seasonal trend. Additionally, net sales declines in Latin America were impacted by the timing of Easter, macroeconomic challenges and new tax legislation in Mexico on certain food products, and volume elasticity in Brazil due to a price increase.","Overall, total company Q1 net sales increased 2.4%, driven primarily by volume. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates was a 0.8 point headwind. Organic net sales growth of 3.2% generated earnings growth that was slightly greater than we anticipated, due to the timing of SM&A expenses. Dave will provide you with additional financial detail, so let me provide you with an overview of the [indiscernible].","Before we get into the specifics, the U.S. retail takeaway, recall, that in 2014, Easter occurred on April 21, and in 2013 on March 31. Therefore, the timing of Easter has and will impact Nielsen and IRI data related to the March, April and May quiet period.","Including Easter seasonal activity in the year ago and current period, the candy mint and gum, or CMG category declined 2.7% for the 12 weeks ended March 22, 2014, within the xAOC+C channel. As a reminder, this is xAOC+C-store data consisting of food, drug, MassX and C-store channels, plus the inclusion of Walmart, partial dollar, club and military channels.","Gum continues to be a drag on total CMG performance and excluding it, the chocolate, sweet and the refreshment categories 2.2%. Excluding Easter, seasonal activity in the current and year ago period combined category growth of chocolate, sweet and refreshment, was plus 2.4%. Given the investment we continue to see in the category, in the form of innovation and consumer marketing, including the new product news and related activity we have planned over the remainder of the year, we continue to expect a candy of mixed category to increase 3.5% to 4.5% in 2014.","We are particularly excited about our innovation that ramps up in May, with the launch of YORK Minis and Hershey's Spreads as the consumable items in the third quarter launches of ICE BREAKERS Cool Blast's Chews and Brookside Crunchy Clusters.","Given the timing of Easter and our innovation calendar, Hershey's CMG retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending March 22 declined 3%. Excluding Easter seasonal activity at both the current and year ago period of better, yet still in perfect measure, our retail takeaway was up 1.4%. Despite the Easter comp, this was less than our expectation and reflects the impact of the lower trip that I referred to earlier.","A better way to assess performance given seasonal timing and therefore noise in the datas [ph] by looking at absolute market results. Hershey's first quarter market share within the U.S. non-chocolate candy, mint and gum categories increased. However, this was offset by a decline in chocolate market share, given the timing of new product launches, and related advertising and consumer marketing. As a result, Hershey's U.S. CMG market share, including Easter seasonal activity in the year ago and current period declined 0.1 point. While results are preliminary, we had a solid Easter and will gain share in this important season.","First quarter xAOC+C chocolate category growth, excluding Easter in the current a year ago period, was 3.6%. Hershey's xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway excluding Easter was up 1.2% and resulting in a loss of 1.1 market share points.","Looking at absolute market share results, KIT KAT and Brookside Chocolate market share was up in the quarter, however this was offset by Hershey franchise softness and Cadbury, which lost 0.5 chocolate share points. Cadbury is primarily sold during the Easter timeframe, so we would fully expect a reversal of the share loss over the next two quiet periods.","Switching to non-chocolate candy or NCC in the xAOC+C channels, the NCC category, including and excluding Easter in the current and year ago periods, declined 5.2% and 0.2% respectively. Hershey's xAOC+C store NCC business, including and excluding Easter in the current year-ago periods declined 4.9% and 2.7%. As a result, our NCC market share was slightly up, as Lancaster gains offset declines in JOLLY RANCHER TWIZZLER bites.","Lancaster is off to a good start and distribution is tracking to expectations. Advertising started on February 16, and is driving trial and repeat. While early, Lancaster results are similar to where Brookside was at this stage of the launch.","While not as large as chocolate and NCC, we continue to do well within the gum and mint categories. Specifically, our Q1 gum and mint retail takeaway within the xAOC+C universe was up 29% and 6% respectively. As a result, our gum market share increased to 1.3 points, and we now have a modest 4.8% share of the market. Our mint market share increased 0.7 points, expanding our segment leading position to 39.8%.","In the C-store class of trade, where the Easter impacts are minimal, the CMG category was up 3%. However, this was significantly impacted by the mid single digit percentage of decline in the gum category. Excluding gum and despite trips being down in this channel in Q1, C-store candy and mint category growth was up a combined 5%, driven by news and activity by major manufacturers.","Hershey instant consumable innovation and programming accelerates over the remainder of the year, and we would expect our C-store performance to materially exceed our Q1 retail takeaway of 1.5%, that resulted in a market share decline of 0.5 points.","In the U.S. marketplace, in addition to the many exciting new products I had previously mentioned, we had many exciting promotions, programs and merchandising in place across all channels. These include a Reese's NCAA Gameday football program; new and highly effective Hershey S'mores! advertising; a relaunch of Hershey's Miniatures, with improved taste and new packaging, supported with refreshed advertising; and a sweet summer showdown program, featuring TWIZZLERS and JOLLY RANCHERS.","The Hershey Spreads launch has gotten off to a good start. Retailer response has been extremely positive, driving spreads category growth of around 10%. Category growth has been driven by the chocolate spread sub-segment, which is up about 40%. Most major retailers have accepted all three flavors of Hershey Spreads.","Advertising and couponing started in February, and is driving initial trial and brand awareness which were leveraged when we launched the Hershey Spreads instant consumable product in May.","Outside of the U.S. and Canada, international results were mixed. China continues to be a standout. Net sales increased in the mid-teens on a percentage basis versus last year and exceeded plan. In China, Hershey continues to be one of the fastest growing international chocolate companies.","For the three months ended February, chocolate category growth accelerated, driven by gifting and timing of the holiday and Chinese New Year season. As a result, our chocolate retail takeaway of about 50% was more than double the category growth rate of almost 20%. Our seasonal sell-through was solid, as evidenced by a 2.3 point share gain and overall China market share of 10.1%. Reese's testing and expansion continues, and we are pleased with what we continue to learn. The team continues to refine the messaging, based on what we have learned to-date, and we will apply these best practices during a broader roll-out later this year.","In Mexico, our year-to-date chocolate market share in the Modern Trade increased 1.1 points. However, category growth slowed to the start of the year, given Easter timing, the VAT tax and a sluggish economy that's impacting consumer purchasing power and confidence.","As a result, Mexico Modern Trade chocolate category sales declined about 1%. This represents a slowdown, versus the low double digit growth -- ","[Technical Difficulty]","Similar information related to insights driven performance initiatives.","Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. Similar to last year, our expectation entering the year, was that 2014 international sales growth would be back-half weighted. We still --","Mark Pogharian","Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Pogharian here. We apologize for the technical difficulty. We believe JP, you got cut off. When JP started his remarks related to international commentary. So we will pick it up from there, and just the moment. Again, we apologize for the delay, and, please be patient while we pick up. JP, I will now turn it back to you, if you start with your international commentary.","John Bilbrey","Okay. Thank you everyone for your patience, and I am going to have to move here in the room, as we continue to make some adjustments, so please bear with us.","So assuming that you can hear me now, I will pick up with our international comments. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, international results were mixed. China continues to be a standout, net sales increased mid-teens on a percentage basis versus last year, and exceeded plan.","In China, Hershey continues to be one of the fastest growing international chocolate companies. For the three months ended February, chocolate category growth accelerated, driven by gifting and the timing of the holiday in Chinese New Year season.","As a result, our chocolate retail takeaway of about 50%, was more than double the category growth rate of almost 20%. Our seasonal sell-through was solid, as evidenced by a 2.3 point share gain and overall, China chocolate share of 10.1%. Reese's testing and expansion continues and we are pleased with what we continue to learn. The Team continues to refine the messaging, based on what we have learnt to-date, and we will apply these best practices during a broader roll out later this year.","In Mexico, our year-to-date chocolate market share and the Modern Trade increased 1.1 points. However, category growth slowed to start the year, given Easter timing, the VAT tax, and a sluggish economy, that is impacting consumer purchasing power and confidence.","As a result, Mexico Modern Trade chocolate category sales declined about 1%. This represents a slowdown versus the low double digit growth in 2013. Given these headwinds, we expect Mexico net sales growth to be pressured this year.","In Brazil, local currency net sales were a bit below our plan and year ago, as volume elasticity related to a price increase was greater than anticipated. Year-to-date, the chocolate category, the Modern Trade declined 4.9%, due to the timing of Easter. We primarily participate in the tablet\/bar and chocolate snack subsegments, and the categories declined here as well. However, Hershey tablet\/bar and chocolate snacks retail takeaway was up, and we gained share.","We expect our business in Brazil to accelerate over the remainder of the year on a local currency basis, and be up low double digits. We have a good foundation in our key international markets. We are building on our go-to-market capabilities, driving trial and repeat and gaining market share. We are focused on the long term, and not guided by the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, which is the factor on [ph], while we'd most likely see international net sales growth of around 15% in 2014.","I am pleased with the progress we are making. There are exciting things happening in our focus markets, and we remain on-track towards the aspirational goals, and we have shared with you over the last year.","Now to wrap up. We were not pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter. However, core brand merchandising, programming, innovation and advertising accelerates, and is expected to generate solid net sales growth over the remaining three quarters. As a result, we continue to expect 2014 full year net sales growth of 5% to 7%, and a 9% to 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share diluted.","I will now turn it over to Dave, who will provide some additional financial details.","David Tacka","Thank you, JP. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the web cast. First quarter net sales of $1.87 billion increased 2.4% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.15, an increase of 5.5% from last year. The sales growth was below our expectation for the quarter, primarily because of the U.S. market anomalies JP discussed, combined with lower sales in Mexico and Brazil.","We expected first quarter sales growth to be tempered by the comparison to the strong Brookside distribution gains last year, our innovation calendar in 2014, and foreign currency headwinds. In fact, foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real, negatively impacted sales growth by 0.8 points, resulting in organic sales growth of 3.2% for the quarter.","Sales growth was driven primarily by North America, which increased 3%. U.S. net sales growth of 3.4% was essentially all volume related. Canada achieved slightly higher volume growth, offset by unfavorable FX. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, net sales declined 2.4%. Results varied by country, with declines in Latin America and increases in Asia, driven primarily by growth in China.","Turning now to margins; adjusted gross margin declined by 10 basis points in the quarter, as higher input costs and an unfavorable sales mix, more than offset supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives. We incurred higher than forecasted dairy and minor raw material costs in the quarter, as well as lower fixed cost absorption, resulting from the lower than forecast volumes.","For the year, we now expect gross margin expansion of around 20 basis points. This is lower than our previous estimate of around 50 basis points, due primarily to higher input costs, primarily dairy, and a less favorable sales mix. Adjusted EBIT in the first quarter increased 3.7% versus last year, generating adjusted EBIT Margin of 22.3%, a 30 basis point improvement. The increase was driven by lower SM&A expenses.","Advertising expense in related consumer marketing decreased about 3% versus last year. Importantly, we executed our planned advertising programs in the quarter, including the recent CAA program, seasonal celebrations advertising, and launched support for the Lancaster and spreads introductions.","We expect advertising spending to increase over the remainder of the year, supporting our new product launches and core brands in North American and international markets.","SG&A, excluding advertising, increased 4% versus last year, but less than our previous estimate, as we delayed certain discretionary items, in light of first quarter market trends, higher input costs, and our initiatives to achieve SG&A leverage. We will continue to invest in expanded root-to-market capabilities, as well as knowledge based consumer information, related to the insights driven performance initiatives.","Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. Similar to last year, our expectation entering the year was that 2014 international sales growth would be back half weighted. We still believe that will be the case, given the seasonality of our business, together with our plans for advertising, merchandising, programming and new products, including the broader distribution of Reese's in Q3 and Q4.","Q1 international net sales declined 2.4% in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, they increased 2%. In our focus markets, China net sales increased high teens on a percentage basis, and continues to do well. Importantly, Chinese New Year sell-through was solid, and we are gaining market share.","In Mexico, sales declined. Our chocolate business in the Modern Trade is responding to merchandising and programming. However, our sweets, refreshment and beverage businesses have been pressured, given the sugar tax and other macroeconomic headwinds impacting Mexican consumers. We expect the Mexico business to continue to be challenged, but to improve over the remainder of the year.","In Brazil, sales declined as consumers are adjusting to higher price points. We expect that our business will grow over the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect international sales growth to be around 15%. Note, that this excludes the Shanghai Golden Monkey business, which we estimate will close in the second quarter of 2014.","Moving down the P&L, first quarter interest expense of $21.4 million declined $2.2 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be around $85 million.","The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 34.3%, essentially in line with last year, but slightly less than our expectations of 35%, due to the timing of favorable tax issue resolution. For the full year, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be around 34.5%. For the first quarter of 2014, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 227 million shares.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow; at the end of the first quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's first quarter by $103 million. Accounts receivable was higher b $104 million, primarily because of sales timing and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $52 million and accounts payable increased by $53 million.","Capital additions, including software, were $80 million in the first quarter. For the year, we continue to expect total capital expenditures to be about $355 million to $375 million, including the capital related to the Johor, Malaysia project of $120 million to $130 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $49 million in the first quarter, in line with our estimates. Cash outflows in Q1 included dividends of $105 million, and the repurchase of approximately $272 million of our common shares, to replace shares issued, in connection with stock option exercises. All shares were repurchased in the open market.","In 2014, we will make progress against the old share buyback authorization, which has $125 million remaining on it, before buying back shares related to the new authorization. At the end of the first quarter, cash on hand was just over $1 billion.","Let me close by providing some context on our 2014 outlook; as JP outlined. We have initiatives in place that we believe will drive net sales growth across our business. We are confident of our plans, and we expect 2014 net sales growth within our targeted range of 5% to 7%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We believe we have concluded a strong Easter season and April Nielsen data is showing solid improvements in our every day business. We expect net sales gains to build through the year, driven by core brand volume growth, and innovation in U.S. and international markets. Complemented by in-store merchandising, programming and greater levels of advertising and consumer marketing.","We now expect gross margin expansion of around 20 basis points for the year. We expect higher input costs and a less favorable sales mix versus 2013, offset by supply chain productivity and improved fixed cost absorption. We have good visibility into our input costs, with the exception of dairy costs which we are unable to hedge.","As we look at timing and year ago comps, we expect second quarter gross margin to be similar to what we had in Q1. Advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, slightly below our previous estimate. This change does not impact advertising spending on core brands, but instead reflects decisions on return on investment analysis on non-scale brands, and reductions in non-media consumer spending.","SG&A expenses are expected to increase at a more modest level than previous years, as we start to achieve SG&A leverage. This increase will build on the investments and go-to-market capabilities, as well as consumer knowledge based projects related to our insights driven performance initiatives. As a result, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase within our long term targeted growth rate of 9% to 11%. Note that this outlook excludes estimated operating results related to Shanghai Golden Monkey. Upon approval of the agreement, expected in the second quarter of 2014, and excluding acquisition and transaction costs, the company expects the acquisition to be slightly accretive on an adjusted basis in 2014.","Thank you for your time this morning. JP, Mark and I will now take any questions you may have.","Mark Pogharian","Thank you JP and Dave for your remarks. For everybody on the line and the web cast, we again apologize for the technical difficulty this morning. But, out of the respect to a lot of you, couple of other peers that are reporting this morning and holding conference calls, just so we can facilitate time here, we would ask that you please limit yourselves to one question. Thank you, and operator, we will now open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Mark Pogharian","Good morning. Rob? Operator, we are not hearing any question.","Operator","His line is open sir.","Mark Pogharian","Okay. Why don't we go to the next question?","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Hello?","Mark Pogharian","Yes.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","I am sorry. This is Rob. I guess my question is to do with the decision to cut advertising. I wanted to know why make that decision to lower the advertising growth so early in the year, its only first quarter. It seems to be related to the gross margin cut as well. Thank you.","John Bilbrey","I think Rob, the way to think about it is that, we have really taken a look at some of the secondary brands that we have been supporting, and we have limited some of our advertising there. On our core brands, there really isn't any reduction, and in fact, advertising GRPs would be increased on a couple of levels. One, the dollar spend against core, because of moving some of that mix around. And then the other thing is, is in GRP efficiency. So as we become a more scaled purchaser, one of the things that's happening is that, we also are more efficient. So if you really look at GRPs against those core brands, and against the new item initiatives that we have, we really feel as though we are executing against the strong plan, and what we need. And of course, we will continue to assess that as we go forward. But that's how I think you might want to think about that, and then the other thing with innovation, you also have then stronger consumer events there as well, which we need to support. So we really feel as though, we have got a solid plan.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","But John, it seems like your competition is increasing advertising right now. Are you concerned that you're kind of scaling back, when they are scaling up?","John Bilbrey","No I think -- well first of all, your assessment is absolutely right, and in fact, in the first quarter, we saw with new item introduction, as well as some other strong support from competitors. The absolute advertising level in the category was significantly higher than it has been. So our advertising was higher as well, but not as high as some of the competitive initiatives. So I think, as others move into higher advertising spends, that's something that we have to be cognizant of. I think a lot of that however was really in support of what was happening with new item introductions, and then of course, with Easter being later, some of that advertising also -- for us, also falls into April as well. But your point is noted.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","John Bilbrey","Good morning Bryan.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. So I guess the one question I wanted to ask was just based or relative to gross margin outlook and the potential of the raised prices. I guess, last couple of years -- or the last five years I guess, whatever; there has been some meaningful change in raw material costs, you have been able to price it through. So I guess, is that in the realm of expectations or possibilities looking forward if we are going to see elevated input costs going forward, is there a chance that may be there would be ability to price that through, or at this point do you think that the elasticities just don't work in your favor in that regard? Thanks.","John Bilbrey","Dave and I will take that, it\u2019s a two-part; and the first part is we don't talk about or speculate around what we think pricing will be in the category. But what I would say is, as you have heard us say before, we will continue to be a gross margin focused organization, it would be tough to necessarily have the levels of gross margin expansion we had in 2013, but we continue to be very gross margin focused, and then from a commodity perspective, I will let Dave make any comment he feels appropriate.","David Tacka","As we said, we are seeing slightly higher commodity costs, particularly dairy as we look at 2014. But we do have good visibility on our cost basket other than dairy for 2014, and we will be addressing 2015 later in the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning everyone. Just continuing on the ad spending, what changed with the analysis of the ad spend; because you guys do typically have pretty good analytics. So I am not sure exactly what changed, as you were looking through it. Then just to follow-up on that is, how much leeway do you have for the cut, just say the sales or your numbers don't come within -- the top line doesn't come within your expectations again, at least there is another leeway for you to reduce that excitement a little bit more?","John Bilbrey","Well I think first of all, philosophically, we want to make sure that we are fully supporting our brands against the strategies that we have articulated. There are brands, which we have chosen to not support, that we have been supporting, or reduce some support. So again, I think that, that's a decision driven by analytics, and its a good decision. And then, we really feel as though, based on the ROIs and what we know at this point in time, that we are fully supporting those brands, and then our innovation in the second half.","If there were to be a material change in the category, we are very committed to being brand builders, then we would assess that as we would believe appropriate.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","John Bilbrey","Good morning Eric.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","I am a bit confused on some of the international stuff between local currency and dollar results. I think JP you said that, and this was kind of split up, but I think you said China was up mid-teens, but then Dave said it was up high teens. I think you mentioned something about being up 50% and two times the category --?","John Bilbrey","Eric, to just put clarification around that. So one is a sales number, and the others were off-take numbers, during that period of time. So those would be what the difference is, but those are -- and remember with Chinese New Year and so forth, you get -- some of that shipment is actually, would have been in the fourth quarter of last year, and then the off-take really is happening in the quarter. So that's why you would see differences in that, and Mark can help you with greater detail around that.","And then, if you look at the other markets, in local currency, we made good progress in Brazil, but the real, hurt us on FX. You had some of that in Mexico and Canada as well. So on a local currency basis, in both Brazil and Canada, we felt good about our progress, but FX hurt us a little bit more there.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Thanks, and just as a --","David Tacka","Eric, the profile for international will probably be very similar to last year, where you get much greater part of the growth in the second half.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","So the international dollar sales are down 2.4 in the quarter. You're saying that for the year, international sales will be up 15% in dollars, or is that local currency?","John Bilbrey","Its in dollars.","David Tacka","That would be dollars including FX impact.","John Bilbrey","Including FX impact.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","But ex-M&A. Okay, I will pass it on. Thank you.","John Bilbrey","Thanks Eric.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","John Bilbrey","Hi Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Hi, good morning everybody. Just want to pick up on the pricing theme as well. And again, not whether you will or won't take it of course, but I remember the last time you took a price increase. It was the first time in quite some time that promotive price points went up as ell. And I think, because you were bumping up against some key retail, sort of price thresholds. I think the promotive price points went up like 20% or so, and you ended up managing it very well in hindsight, [indiscernible] and all of that. So I guess what I am trying to get a sense of is, is there any way to may be hard to do the -- kind of characterize where you are today and the next time you take pricing, whenever that may be, if it\u2019s a year, if its three years. But are you bumping up against any key retail sort of promotive price point thresholds, or is there some room to kind of work with them there?","John Bilbrey","I think, the way that I would think about it is, if you look over an extended period of time, the category has been pretty unelastic, and so its 50% volume and 50% price realization historically in the category. As we have crossed price thresholds, which we always watch very-very closely. Our experience has been pretty positive, that the category digests that pricing. So the category in general, I think, has demonstrated its ability to again be pretty accessible and affordable, and that really has sort of won the day. And then there is a couple of things to think about, in terms of how companies may think about pricing, is obviously there is a commodities element, and then there is an element of how you invest in the business, and I don't think its exclusively one or the other, but we look at both of those. And I think both of those things are intrical to how you would think about that particular topic, and that's probably -- Andrew, I don't know if that satisfies you, but that's probably about as far as I can go on that.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","That's helpful. I appreciate your perspective. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","John Bilbrey","Hi Dave.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","Hi guys. Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to go back to advertising for a minute; just to be clear, at least as much as we can. So add spending in the quarter down 3%, full year at mid single digit increase. So clearly its going up, you're supporting your products, not as much as before, but you're supporting it. I think what this suggests, is that the change was almost entirely in the first quarter, and as I look at Qs two, three and four, you're going to have fairly substantial increases in two, three and four. So first off, is that right, and is that pretty much consistent with the plans? I think it kind of helps people to understand that may be the big change was Q1, and its not something that's massively different in the next bunch of quarters. Can we just start there?","John Bilbrey","Yeah, I think that's a very good assessment.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","Okay. Then on the increases that you have coming in Qs two, three and four, where are they going to be deployed? Because I think what everybody is just going to want to understand as best they can, is your expectation that sales growth will accelerate, and I think its going to be directly related to where all this additional ad spending goes. So can you talk about how you deploy it?","John Bilbrey","Well if you think about the innovation we have this year, its actually spread across our different segments of the business, and so, you will see the appropriate amount of advertising supporting a broad piece of the portfolio, but appropriately, you will see it supporting the new initiatives. Then you have Lancaster and spreads, which really just started in February and we are building distribution there. So you will see strong support for those, as we go throughout the year, we feel very good about our distribution progress. We have had a coupon drop, and we should continue to build on our merchandising and then advertising support for both of those as well. So those will be brands that are supported.","And just to be clear, coming back, the support on our core brands continues to grow. So a lot of that growth again is out of GRP purchase efficiency, and it is not making a choice, not to advertise on some secondary brands. And if you recall historically, we have talked about how we like to rotate across those brands, so that's also money that comes back against the core.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","Really appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan.","John Bilbrey","Good morning Ken.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan","Hey everybody, thanks for the questions. My guess is, you're cutting ad spending on may be some brands like, I don't know, Bliss, Simple Pleasures. At least in Nielsen data, they're lagging a bit. So first of all, is that correct?","John Bilbrey","That's correct.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan","That's right. So AIR DELIGHTS too I would imagine. Can you talk a little bit about the future of those brands? How should we think about them? I guess I am asking, is there a risk they get delisted, is there some [indiscernible] coming because -- often when step one is cutting advertising, step two can be the brand loses whatever, I don't want to say shaky, but whatever legs it had?","John Bilbrey","I think the way to think about it is, it doesn't mean that we would not be supporting those brands. I think in a couple of instances, those -- there may be some other brands that you talked about, that have ended up playing more of a niche role, than maybe we would have hoped at one point in time. Then, in the case of bliss, it\u2019s a meaningful brand, and within a position, but that whole trade-up space has sort of evolved over time. And so it doesn't mean that we wouldn't support a brand like Bliss, but we are in an environment where we believe making choices is important and these brands will evolve and consumers will ultimately decide, how they do.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan","Great, thanks JP.","John Bilbrey","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning guys.","John Bilbrey","Good morning.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Typically, Hershey starts the year rather quickly, and this year, obviously its not the case but some of that seems to be your timing of new product news. But some of it seems to be, from what we are hearing Mars, which has been rather aggressive on promotion, and that's a big contract for the last couple of years, could you comment on that? And then specifically related to the seasonal share, which I guess was down significantly, if I look at the numbers in your release. We hear there may have been something of a co-packer issue, where orders weren't filled right away for Hershey, one of your co-packers, was that a factor at all in the quarter?","John Bilbrey","No, let me talk about kind of -- le make a broad statement here about the quarter. So first all, you have the timing of Easter being three weeks later. So there is just a lot of noise in the data. Yet, strong competitive program, it included new items, and also increased advertising. Our plan, as you point out, is much more back-half loaded than it was before. So even though we had introductions with -- kick out many, as you have spreads, you have Lancaster, all of those are currently building. And then you have anomalies in the consumer purchasing pattern. So all of those things clearly had an influence, I wouldn't focus on one much more than the other. As we look at weekly data, and as I've said to you guys many times, I don't get overly enamored by weekly data.","But I guess in this case, what I would tell you is, I continue to be encouraged that our hypothesis around the quarter and the things that we are describing to you, I feel good about, because as we look at the weekly data, it continues to strengthen and in fact, in the latest weekly data on year-to-date basis, our total CMG share has turned positive, which again, gives me confidence that as I talk to retailers, consumers seem to be back in stores, I can't comment on for anybody, what their spending is. But it appears to feel as though, some of the trips issues, some of the basket mix etcetera, I am more comfortable calling it an anomaly. I do believe going forward, there is some degree of bifurcation in the total consumer environment, but we will sort that out for all CPG, as we go forward. But I am just feeling a lot better, as I see some of this weekly data come in that we have called this about right.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","John Bilbrey","Good morning.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning everyone. I just wanted to focus on the factors underlying the lower gross margin outlook. I know there are some specific external things like higher dairy and Q1 traffic that have had an incremental impact. But looking beyond the lower, sort of Q1 fixed cost allocations and what already know about dairy prices, to what extent does that lower gross margin outlook also reflect of you that the competitive and the promotional environment could be sustainably a bit more intense than you originally envisioned?","David Tacka","Well the biggest chunk of the gross margin change is in fact the dairy outlook. There are some impacts around the sales mix, which are principally in the first quarter, and we have programming very well set for the balance of the year, and so we think that we are in the right place on that and we have a good view of the commodity cost, with the exception of dairy.","Mark Pogharian","And I would say too Matt, even if you continue to look your IRI and Nielsen data, you just don't see a lot of positive or negative price in that category, which would help answer your question as well of what's really going on. I mean, as JP alluded to, there is just a lot of activity in the first quarter, which is what we expected in news, coming into this year.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John Bilbrey","Good morning.","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo","Good morning JP. Just in terms of the elasticity in Brazil. Did the magnitude of that surprise you at all? And then maybe related, if you look around some of these snacking categories in developing markets, biscuits, gum, one can may be argue here that they category level growth hasn't really snapped back from the recession. Is that your sense that these categories are kind of prone for more tempered growth going forward? Just your thoughts there?","John Bilbrey","You know, I actually would tell you that I continue to be very positive on the category, especially on the chocolate segment across just about all of these markets, and I think that, we are going to have some of these different dynamics, the real got awfully strong, unusually strong from my historical experience, and now its moving the other direction. So I think as we look at, what do we believe are the right plans within a given market? Do we feel on a local currency basis, we are managing our business correctly for the long term? And then, we have a relatively modest sized business in a country like Brazil, and with that being the case, sometimes when you have negatives from a translation standpoint, the impact is accentuated. So we sometimes probably have that as a bit of a greater influence, on how those numbers come out. But I continue to feel good about the progress, the distribution we are building across the country and our brand portfolio there. I think for our company, part of what you see there may be less macro and a little bit more unique to us, given the size of our business there.","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo","Great. Thanks JP.","John Bilbrey","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","John Bilbrey","Good morning Alexia.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. Just wanted to pick up on your comments about the lower consumer trip in the instant consumable channel and the irregular approach in patterns and traditional mass. Could you just give us a little bit of a handle on what that was, and I know it's settled down now, but what caused it to settle down? Thank you.","John Bilbrey","If you looked at just trips in general and you went back to about June-July 2013, you could start to see a change in the frequency of trips and then the distances people drove from their home to do their primary shopping, and so that was one of the reasons the food channel is an example, continue to do a little bit better, as people got a higher percentage of their primary trip there, and so, that was one of the influences. It continued through the fall and into the first quarter, and what we observed, as we look at total store data and household panel data etcetera, is that the mix in the basket changed.","So you got a little bit greater focus on staples versus instant consumables. If you think about people who may have been impacted by the weather, and then when we saw differences across the country, if weather wasn't an issue versus whether being an issue. And then you also have changes in some of the government programs that people had to adjust to and figure out what that meant for them. And so I think this concept of bifurcation also is an issue in terms of how people build their basket. And so, there was just a lot of moving parts in what we believe we are seeing is a bit of an emergence from that, where things, both in terms of traffic, primary shopping, outlets, as well as mix of the basket, is returning to what we might call a more historical norm. I think the trips data of course will continue to follow and see if you know that changes and it comes back. But those are really some of the influences that were in that comment.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Mark Pogharian","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question is from Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research.","John Bilbrey","Good morning.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research","Hello. So just a question on balance sheet and cash flow. I understand Q1 is a little bit more pressured than expected. Part of it is coming out of international advertising's pullback. We have seen share loss in the U.S., coming from lower end, but we are also seeing it from Russell and some of the higher end guys. There has also been some discussion though on the M&A front for some smaller players, one of the company executives is getting very old, to be frank, and in another company there has been rumors, that the brothers might be looking to sell. I am just curious, if you were to come under pressure, you are now running at a net debt level, its about a 15 year low. I understand all the near term pressures in the business, but could you may be just kind of discuss a bit what your theory is around capital allocation outside of Golden Monkey over the next two years, haven't seen any shares purchased really, or repurchased to effect EPS over the past two years, for the most part. I don't really feel like I thought you were talking about the balance sheet, thanks.","David Tacka","Okay. Well I guess, we feel very good about the balance sheet. We have a very strong balance sheet, and as we look at -- and we had about $1 billion in cash at the end of the quarter. As we look at both our cash and our debt capacity, our priority first continues to be to grow, and so we are continuing to look at M&A opportunities, and we are also investing in capital to support our business growth. We have got new plant under construction in Malaysia, and we will have some additional need for additional volume as our business grows. So our number one priority for cash and debt continues to be growth, and we expect that to be M&A and also to be the capital investments.","Our second priority is dividends. We have a policy of about 50% dividend pay out of our earnings, and so that's where we would go. And then third, we would go to share buyback. We buy back what is exercised in options, and as I reported, we bought back a bit over $200 million in the first quarter for replenishing option exercises and we also have $125 million on an old authorization, and an additional $250 million on a new authorization that we did earlier in the year, and we expect to be making progress against those, as we go through the year. But that's kind of our priorities, first is growth, second is dividend and then we will buy back shares after that.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Pogharian","Thank you very much for joining us for today's conference call. Again, we apologize for the technical difficulties, and Sergio Flores and I will be available to take any follow-up calls that you may have. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

We appreciate you joining us for The Hershey Company's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call and webcast. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, followed by a Q&A session.","Before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Federal Securities Laws. These statements are based on our current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events and those described in these forward-looking statements contained in our 2017 10-K filed with the SEC and today's press release.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors.

As I reflect on the progress that we've made against our strategic plans and the initiatives we have underway for 2019 and beyond, I'm confident and excited about the future of this company.","Before I get into the details of our results, I would like to take a moment to reflect on your 125th anniversary that we are celebrating this year. It's an incredible privilege to lead a company that remains as relevant with consumers today as we were more than a century ago. Everyone here at Hershey has tremendous pride in our incredible portfolio of brands. And it's the care and attention that we put into each of our brands that resonates with our consumers. Our job is to deliver on our consumer's expectations each and every day. We are also entrusted to make the strategic decisions to ensure that Hershey is well-positioned long-term. I would like to thank my Hershey colleagues for their consistent passion and commitment.","Now turning to the businesses at hand [ph], we are fortunate to participate in growing categories with amazing brands that consumers love. We have advantage margin, a healthy balance sheet, and differentiated capability. In a dynamic and highly-competitive operating environment, in 2018, we grew our business and delivered on our financial commitment, while strategically investing for the future.","In our U.S. core confection business, we invested in new brand positioning and launched new campaigns for our two largest brands, Reese's and Hershey's. We shifted investment to new marketing capabilities that enable us to support more confection brands within our portfolio. By leveraging consumer insights and new capacity, our team drove strong growth and share gains during the Halloween and holiday sales period, while improving our sell-through and reducing markdowns. At the same time, our SKU rationalization program and pricing action are enabling progress on improving our margins.","We also expanded our portfolio to capture incremental consumer occasions with complementary acquisitions of Amplify and Pirate's brands. These two high-growth, high-margin, better-for-use snacking asset are a great fit with our Hershey portfolio. They're performing well in the marketplace and they're on track to deliver against our goals.","We made tremendous progress with our international business transformation plans, delivering a record year of profit as well as solid growth. This growth was balanced with organic constant currency sales and operating income gains in each of our key markets. Importantly, our teams diligently continue to reduce our foundational cost structure to enable investment in growth-generating assets and capabilities.","Our ERP initiative is on track and modules are coming online according to plan. In the second-half of 2018, we launched two commercial focus modules: trade promotion and marketing expenses, and we are pleased with the early results. This ERP initiative is a key enabler to our broader digital transformation efforts. We also will continue to invest in core capacity as we did with our new Reese's and Kit Kat lines in 2018 as well as incremental capacity on ICE BREAKERS Gum and in our broader distribution network. While our gross margin was below expectation for the year, we made progress and improved performance as we progressed through the year.","We believe the SKU rationalization program and previously announced price increase position us well to make additional progress in 2019. Now let's turn specifically to progress made in the fourth quarter. We delivered sales and EPS in line with our expectation. Constant currency net sales increased 3.1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestures of approximately 3 points.","Foreign currency exchange was a 0.6 point headwind. Adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.26 increased 23.5% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Our strong holiday program resulted in both sales growth and seasonal market share gains as well as improved sell-through at retail. Hot Cocoa Kisses was the number one new holiday item in the category and helped drive merchandizing support and growth for the entire Kisses franchise. This holiday strength resulted in measured channels Hershey's CMG takeaway increasing 1% in the 12 weeks ended December 30th. This was in line with our expectations.","As a reminder, takeaway was greater than fourth quarter net sales growth due to the inventory reductions that we anticipated and discussed on our last quarter's call. For the fourth quarter, Hershey CMG market share declined slightly, approximately 20 basis points as competitive activity remained robust.","Hershey chocolate takeaway was up 1.9% in the quarter, driven by strength in our Reese's brand which grew 4%. Our new NotSorry campaign and strong seasonal execution enabled by the capacity expansion we implemented in the first quarter of last were key contributors of this growth. We activated additional chocolate brands within the portfolio in 2018. And we are pleased with the results.","Combined retail takeaway for York, Almond Joy, Mounds, and Payday was up 2% in the fourth quarter. A seven point improvement versus the 2017 trend. And it was driven by velocity. We leveraged new more efficient marketing model to support these brands. And believe there is additional opportunity to bring more of our smaller but highly differentiated products to light in 2019 with this approach.","Our ICE BREAKER business continued to perform very well with retail takeaway growth of more than 9% during Q4. This was driven by distribution and velocity gains on our gum business, resulting in growth of over 18% during the quarter. Our investments in digital commerce are resulting in consistent solid net sales growth of approximately 40%. We expect to see similar momentum in 2019 as we continue partnering with our retailers on differentiated offerings that meet our customer's needs.","These gains were partially offset by continued softness in our non-chocolate portfolio and sales declines from items impacted by our SKU rationalization program. We expect these headwinds to persist in 2019 as we focused on initiatives to drive growth within our chocolate portfolio and continue to reduce complexity to improve margins. As we look more broadly across the portfolio, total Hershey retail takeaway in the fourth quarter was slightly higher at 1.2% driven by SkinnyPop and Pirates Booty.","SkinnyPop retail takeaway remained strong with growth of 9% in the 12 weeks ending December 30th. The core ready-to-eat popcorn portfolio grew 6.5% led by continued household penetration gains. This resulted in a category share gain of 28 basis points in the quarter. Pirates Booty grew approximately 5% in the quarter outpacing the category. Similar to SkinnyPop, these gains were driven by increases in household penetration.","For 2019, we have a balanced plan to build on our second-half 2018 momentum. We expect annual net sales growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of 5% to 7%. We believe this growth will be driven by improving organic sales growth and profitability within North America. Let me provide you with some details around our plans.","For our U.S. confection business, we anticipate growth from seasonal strength, pricing, core distribution gains, innovation, and new brands positioning, a very balanced set of growth levers. Our seasonal growth will benefit from a late Easter, adding approximately three weeks of additional selling days for the season. While there will be some offset in our everyday sales, we do expect a net positive impact to the business based on historical patterns.","Merchandizing is already off to a strong start on consumer's Easter favorite: Reese's and Cadbury eggs. Additionally, we expect our strong Halloween and holiday performance from 2018 to result in increased orders for the upcoming season. Our previously announced price increase of approximately 2.5% is on track. As a reminder, we expect the P&L impact to build over the course of the year.","Similar to past price increases we anticipate some volume impact on items experiencing higher retail shelf prices. As we rationalize less productive SKUs in the portfolio, we continue to make progress in securing distribution on higher velocity items to maintain and optimize our shelf space and improve productivity for both Hershey and our retailer partners. We are also focused on securing incremental space for the entire category. We are consistently collaborating with our retailers on ways to adapt to this rapidly changing environment and optimize space to drive sales and margin. We recently partnered on and implemented a new front-end planogram at a key customer to increase space for snacking and is showing promising results so far.","Hershey performance in stores that implemented this change are currently pacing 500 basis points ahead of stores with the old planogram, strong retail partnerships are always a key priority for us and has helped to fuel our success. We are excited about our core marketing and innovation plans for 2019. As we discussed last year, we have both packaging and product innovation that we believe will drive consumer engagement and increase sales.","The transformation of our packaged candy portfolio is on track and starting to hit shelves after Easter. This will benefit many of our chocolate brands with better shelf impact and improved velocity. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our in-house creative studio and new media model to support the breath of our portfolio in 2019. Investing in our portfolio has always been and will remain a critical part of our business model.","We constantly look for ways to engage with our consumers in new, different, and more efficient ways. Our Reese's Spreads launch will be in this new improved packaging. And it's on track to hit shelves after Easter. This great tasting product gives consumers another way to enjoy their favorite combination of chocolate and peanut butter. And it will be available in both milk and dark chocolate varieties.","Reese consumers are passionate about their cups. And we will leverage TV media, in-store merchandizing and social to engage with them and drive excitement and ultimately incremental purchase. And we will continue to have a lineup of new such our Hershey with Reese's Pieces launch to drive relevancy and merchandizing. While our overall innovation lineup is comparable to 2018, the contribution will be slightly SKUed to the second-half.","Also as a reminder, the late Easter will drive slower retail performance in February and March, and then rebound in April. We expect the category to accelerate slightly in 2019 driven by the longer Easter, and we expect our performance to be in line with the category. We feel confident about the actions we are taking both to compete today and to build for the future. But as you all know, the competitive environment is intense, and it is taking more to win. We are committed to investing in our business to maintain our leadership position while also delivering our financial commitments.","Now for an update on our 2019 plans for our recently acquired snacking assets, Amplify remains on track and is expected to grow mid-single digits in 2019. SkinnyPop is projected to grow share in the ready-to-eat popcorn category behind additional distribution gains and a new marketing campaign. As we shared last year, some of our confection capabilities can be applied to broader snacking, this has been a priority area for us and we are seeing some great progress. The Pirate's Booty integration is proceeding nicely and the Amplify team in Austin is preparing to take over selling responsibilities.","As with SkinnyPop, Pirate's Booty has a focus set of four SKUs with high velocities that weren't greater shelf presence and we plan to leverage our category management capabilities to drive distribution in 2019. I want to thank all the teams working hard to integrate and drive sustainable growth on the important brands.","I'd also like to take a few minutes to recognize our international team who have done an amazing job executing our transformation plan. We expect to make continued progress internationally in 2019, how bad at a slower pace given the significant gains we drove in 2008. We will continue to leverage our strengths and focus on our Hershey's first strategy, which has resulted in solid Hershey brand share gains in our focus market.","In Mexico, the Hershey brand has grown share of the chocolate category for 17 straight clods. In Brazil, the Hershey brand is growing share of the bar category in a highly competitive environment. And in India, we are gaining share in syrup spreads and drinks. The Kisses launch in India is on track and we are excited by the opportunity here. We have also launched gifting items under the Kisses brand in Mexico, which we believe will enable us to capture an incremental premium occasion to drive growth. While we are confident in the plans we are executing, we remain cognizant of potential geopolitical risk that could impact international performance in 2019. We are focused on driving actions within our control and managing risks as effectively as possible.","In summary, in 2018, we delivered our financial commitments, and we continue to invest in our future growth. Our core confection sales and margin trends are improving and we believe we can further build on this momentum with a balanced 2019 plan. Our recently acquired snacking brands continue to see strong growth and deliver against our financial objectives and our international business remains on track. We remain focused on driving long-term shareholder value by delivering balanced top and bottom-line growth in 2019 while investing in differentiating capabilities to expand our competitive advantage in the future.","I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details of our financial results.","Patricia Little","Thank you, Michele. Good morning everyone. As anticipated, fourth quarter net sales of $1.99 billion increased 2.5% versus the same period last year. Constant currency net sales increased 3.1% with foreign currency exchange, a 60 basis points headwind. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a three-point benefit to net sales growth. Volume was a 90 basis point benefit, which was partially offset by anticipated negative net price realization of 80 basis points.","For the full-year 2018, net sales increased 3.7%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 3.6 point benefit. Organic constant currency net sales growth of 0.3% was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 0.2 points. Adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.26 in the fourth quarter represented an increase of 23.5% versus the same period last year. This was driven by more favorable tax rate as M&A declined acquisition and volume growth.","For the full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share diluted of $5.36 was an increase of 14.3% versus the full-year 2017. This was driven by favorable tax as M&A and acquisitions partially offset by gross margin declines. By segment in the fourth quarter North American net sales increased 4.3% versus the same period last year. The Amplify and Pirate brands acquisitions added 4.8 points and organic volume gains contributed 80 basis points. Net price realization and foreign currency exchange rates were 110 and 20 basis points headwinds respectively. These results were in line with expectations. North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend declined 13.3% in the quarter, this was in line with expectations consistent with what we shared throughout 2018, these declines were driven by optimization of emerging brand spend, as well as media efficiency gains as we leverage new models and channels to reach consumers.","Despite the spend declines for the full-year, our consumer impressions were up on our chocolate brands. In 2019, we expect the year-over-year changes in advertising and related consumer marketing spend to be more comparable to our historical patterns and grow relatively in line with sales.","Now for an update on Amplify and Pirate brands, accounting for the materials divestiture the Amplify business came in according to plan on both the top and bottom-line. The acquisition was approximately $0.08 EPS accretive consistent with our previous guidance. The Pirates brands contributed slightly to our overall sales performance and had a negligible impact on our earnings in 2018.","Fourth quarter total international and other segment net sales decreased 8.9% including an 8.4-point impact from divestitures and a 3.1-point headwind from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Volume and net price realization were 190 and a 70 basis points benefit respectively. Organic constant currency net sales in our focus market Mexico, Brazil, India, and China grew 7%. International and other advertising and related consumer marketing declined 13%. In line with our expectations as we right size our investments to drive more profitable growth.","Now turning to gross margin, adjusted gross profit of $844 million increased 1.9% resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 42.5%, a decline of 20 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year. This was a meaningful improvement versus our first task in third quarter trends although slightly below our estimate for the quarter. The lightness was driven by the disposition of underutilized packaging assets related to the upcoming migration of our package can utilize in the second quarter of 2019. Excluding this impact, our gross margin was slightly up versus prior year in line with our expectations. We believe we will continue to make progress in 2019 and expect modest gross margin expansion for the year.","Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit of $369 million increased 13.1% versus the fourth quarter of 2017. This resulted in an adjusted operating profit margin of 18.6%, an increase of 180 basis points driven by lower selling marketing and administrative expenses. As we look forward to 2019. We expect operating profit margin to expand slightly above our recent historic average. This is driven by pricing and productivity initiatives in both cost of goods sold as well as SM&A. As a reminder, we over delivered our margin for growth program expectations in 2018 with savings of approximately $90 million partially driven by the acceleration of some savings originally stated for 2019. Additionally, we expect some of the remaining savings to flow through into 2020 due to the phasing of our ERP implementation. We continue to expect our overall margin for growth program savings to be towards the high-end of our $150 million to $175 million range.","Moving down to P&L, interest expense of $38 million increased $12 million versus Q4 of last year driven by the Amplify and Pirate brands acquisitions. Full-year 2018 interest expense of $139 million was in line with our previous guidance.","In 2019, interest expense is expected to be approximately $150 million to $160 million, a slight increase versus 2018 due to acquisitions. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 9.5% versus 15.1% in the year ago period. This resulted in a full-year 2018 adjusted tax rate of 19.2% versus 26.6% in the year ago period in line with our expectations both the fourth quarter and full-year tax favorability was driven primarily by U.S. tax reforms.","In 2019, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 17%. In the fourth quarter, other expense was $38 million, an additional expense of $10 million versus the year ago period. This year-over-year decline is driven by timings related to our investment tax credit strategy as well as favorable non-service related pension expense.","Full-year 2018 expense of $69 million was in line with our expectations. In 2019, we expect other expense to be approximately $105 million to $115 million. This reflects a higher investment and tax credits as well as additional expense associated with our pension assets, due to the year and negative stock market performance. For the fourth quarter of 2018, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 211.","In November, the company purchased $48 million of common stock from the Hershey Trust in connection with the exercise of stock options. The company did not repurchase common shares in the fourth quarter against the October 2017 or the July 2018 share repurchase authorization.","The total combined outstanding authorization is $560 million. Total capital additions including software was $87 million in the fourth quarter. For the full-year 2018 capital additions were approximately $329 million. This was slightly below our estimates driven primarily by lower capital spending required to support the Amplify integration. For the full-year 2019, we estimate that CapEx will be in the $330 million to $350 million range.","As a percent of net sales, this remains slightly higher than our long-term targets as we continue to advance our ERP transformation and invest in core capacity. We continue to return cash to our shareholders with fourth quarter dividends of $147 million. This was our 356th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock. We expect full-year 2019 net sales to increase 1% to 3% including approximately half-a-point net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures. We are claiming a negligible FX impact for the year. However, the environment is very volatile. We anticipate FX will be a slight headwind in the first-half and a slight tailwind in the second-half.","As a reminder, the SKU rationalization program we announced last spring will continue to impact net sales for the first-half of this year. This, in addition, to the timing of divestitures key marketing activities around innovation and packaging, and FX impacts are expected to result in stronger net sales growth in the second-half of the year. Full-year adjusted earnings per share diluted are estimated to grow 5% to 7% driven by operating profit margin gains as well as a more favorable tax rate.","Due to the timing of investments throughout the year as well as the gating of the sales growth, we expect EPS growth to be stronger in the second-half of the year. We take a balanced and disciplined approach to building our brand and evolving our business model for the future. We have strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet that gives us flexibility to make the necessary investments to drive long-term shareholder value.","That concludes my financial discussion, thank you for your time this morning, and I'll now turn it back over to Michele for some closing remarks.","Michele Buck","Thanks, Patricia. I remain confident in our strategies and I am excited about what we here at Hershey have ahead of us in 2019 as we look to drive a year of balanced growth. As we talked about, the marketplace continues to advance at an accelerated pace. I am optimistic that this change creates opportunities for us to engage with our consumers in new and innovative ways to unlock growth. As I mentioned at the top of our call, 2019 is our 125th anniversary, and it's an incredible time to be here at the company.","Our remarkable employees are dedicated to delivering the best quality and the best experience for our consumers each and every day. That hasn't changed over the past century, and it will continue into the next.","Patricia, Melissa, and I are now available to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning.","Michele Buck","Good morning.","Patricia Little","Good morning.","Ken Goldman","I just wanted to poke around a little bit on the de-load [ph], can you frame for us - I don't think you quantified the impact of it, so if you did, forgive me, but I'm just trying to get a little bit of a sense of the number there. And then I also want to get a sense for you know, where retail inventories currently sit as far as you can tell, you know, are they still up year-on-year after the de-load - I really just want to get an idea of further risk as we look ahead, because I know you guys talked about how the de-load was in line with your expectations, but I don't think most people on the street were quite prepared for it as perhaps you guys were?","Michele Buck","So let me just start, Ken, and then I'll turn it over to Patricia for more details. The year did close in line with our expectations, and we know that as more data and analytics are available retailers are constantly looking in how they can optimize inventory levels as we all are, and we do expect that to continue into 2019, and those assumptions are built into our guidance, but I'll let Patricia give a little bit more detail around that.","Patricia Little","Yes, as we talked about on the third quarter, we have good insight, especially on some of our bigger customers in terms of their inventory. And we knew that there would be some de-load in the fourth quarter, and you saw that play through in the difference between the sales and the retail takeaway. That was absolutely in line with our expectations. We don't have as good an analytic on all of the, you know, many, many customers, but we know that overall we believe that inventory came down through this system. We expect that to continue into 2019 as Michele said, again, really related to broad secular trends in the industry.","On any given quarter, that will have a lot of movement based on season, based on timing of pricing, which we think was an impact this year looking at when promo activity is innovation timing. So quarters can be very - have a lot of movement, but this was exactly what we - we ended the year exactly as we expected.","Ken Goldman","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Brian Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone.","Michele Buck","Good morning.","Patricia Little","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Spillane","Hey, just one clarification and one quick question just on the clarification, Patricia, you talked a little bit about share repurchases, and it just wasn't - I want to make sure clear, the EPS guidance range for this year does not assume a reduction in the share count?","Patricia Little","You know, we have a long-term historic average of doing share repurchase on a discretionary basis every year, and we always put that into our plans, because otherwise it would just show us - especially, in the absence of acquisitions, which are hard to - which we don't put in plan which show us building cash. So there is a modest amount of our normal run rate sharing purchase included in the plan.","Brian Spillane","Okay, but nothing unusual relative to history?","Patricia Little","Correct, nothing unusual.","Brian Spillane","Okay, all right. And then, Michele, you talked a little bit about the, I guess, the gap between - in North America, the takeaway in chocolate versus non-chocolate, you know, so the non-chocolate being a drag, and I guess, that didn't SKUed [ph], can you just give us a little bit more color what the magnitude of that is, and then I know - I guess, it's still going to be a drag in '19, but is it less of a drag in '19 than it was in 2018?","Michele Buck","Yes, so the SKU rationalization is probably the bigger impact on the business and that's about a point in 2019 and that's about the same that it was in 2018.","Brian Spillane","Okay.","Michele Buck","And then relative to the non-chocolate portfolio, I would say the impact will be similar in '19 versus '18 as you know the large proportion of our business is chocolate. So from a magnitude perspective, I think, that can give you a little bit of a feel of the size of that.","Brian Spillane","Okay, great, thank you.","Michele Buck","Sure.","Operator","We will take our next question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Patricia Little","Good morning.","Michele Buck","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Okay. I know heading into this year, Hershey obviously had worked through a decent chunk of some SKU rationalization as you've talked about, some trade inventory reductions you made capacity investments and divested some businesses that have been a drag. This year you've got, obviously, the benefit of a longer Easter, getting some pricing in place. And then you've still got incremental cost saves as well. So, I guess my question is, maybe why wouldn't we see maybe more of an - like on algorithm type of year with respect to the top and bottom line. Maybe in other words, would you characterize '19 as still a year of incremental investment or perhaps you're being a little bit more cautions on things like volume elasticity in relation to the pricing and things of that nature. Thanks very much.","Michele Buck","Well, Andrew, yes, we feel really good about the plans and the activations we have this year. And I think what we feel great about is how balanced - how many different growth levers we think we're really pulling. So, as you know, as we mentioned, we expected to accelerate performance in our important North America market. However, that SKU rationalization is still impacting us at about that point, as I mentioned. And if you add that back in to where growth is, that really puts us smack dab in terms of where the long-term guidance is. So, the price increase, which will have a little bit of an impact. We feel good about the price increase, but we do anticipate a little bit of volume conversion, which as you know, based on history, you get a bigger volume impact, and then it works its way back up throughout the year. And we'll continue to see that little bit of softness as retailers continue to optimize inventory. And we feel great about the plans and the acceleration, but that SKU rat is really the biggest - kind of the biggest offset.","Andrew Lazar","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow","When I try to add up the big building blocks for 2019, it does shape up to be a very different year in terms of what's driving the profit growth. In 2018, as far as I can tell, International segment profits grew a lot. And I think that was largely due to overhead reductions. You had a big advertising cut, like an 11% cut. And then when you think about 2019, those kinds of benefits kind of go away. And what's driving '19, it looks like, is more gross margin expansion, which is fueled a little bit by the pricing, and maybe some other factors. And then maybe the tax rate is a benefit too, although I'm a little unclear. So, is that a more difficult task in '19 given the competitive intensity that you brought up, and also the pressure from retailers that's pushing inventory down? Thanks.","Michele Buck","Now, I feel confident that we've done a very solid job building this plan, and that we have all the right building blocks to deliver that growth and profit algorithm in the way that we've laid out. So I wouldn't say that it is a - I wouldn't say it's a more difficult task. I think we're excited about what we have to deliver that. I think our pricing is on track, so some of the levers that are going to deliver that are already in place. The Easter season which benefits us, pricing, we feel really good about the innovation that we have. So, we feel great about it.","Patricia Little","And just to comment on the taxes, that will be a benefit, the slightly lower tax rate, but that will be basically offset by the fact that, as I mentioned, our non-service related pension costs will be higher in 2019 due to just outset performance at the end of the year. So, that's not a big net overall change to our EPS.","Michele Buck","Yes, Rob, what I would say is I just think we've taken into account a lot of the varying factors going on in the marketplace in a better way than we ever have in the past, and have a strong plan.","Robert Moskow","I appreciate that. But can you comment on the pricing in North America in fourth quarter, it was more negative than I thought it would be. Did some of your price increase get implemented in fourth quarter or did any of it get implemented?","Michele Buck","As we've seen over history, it really takes a period of time for our pricing to hit the marketplace because of the seasons which are sold in so far in advance, and then protecting promotional programs which are usually also about six months out commitments. So, that really would not normally hit till '19, that's when we're anticipating to hit. We've seen a little tiny bit of it show up already, but it'll build as we go throughout the year. So it's totally in line with expectations.","Robert Moskow","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you, and good morning.","Michele Buck","Hi, David.","David Driscoll","I wanted to ask about your price-volume elasticity expectations. You made a couple of references, Michele, but specifically would volumes be negative in North America in 2019? You've got the longer Easter, but it is a price increase, and so just curious if you actually would guide negative volume growth in North America for 2019?","Michele Buck","I would say closer to flattish on volume.","David Driscoll","Okay.","Michele Buck","Given that we've seen historically and what our elasticity data would show.","David Driscoll","And Patricia, you mentioned, and I think you reiterated in your script, the margin for growth the total program achieving $175 million. You've been at this level for a little while. It sounds like the program is going very well. Is there a possibility of upside to this program? And just give us some cadence here as to how you guys are thinking about that. It's been a while since this program is out, just curious about your revision process. And then specifically, what is the savings expected in 2019? And then I just would love an update on your CFO search, Michele, just to see how that's going? I don't think you mentioned that, but curious how that's going as well. Thank you.","Patricia Little","So, I'll start on the Margin for Growth program, we've been really pleased with how it's done. In really two senses, I just want to say clearly in one sense, and we've talked probably a lot about this, is in terms of the savings that we've had in a lot of function. And I just want to thank all my colleagues on work on, I think, a very effective program. But I also want to say I just never want to forget this, we also use this as an opportunity to invest in more of our commercial capabilities, so is really a change in that, and that's gone very well also. So, we pulled ahead a fair amount into 2018, as I mentioned, that primarily comes out of 2019. There's a small piece that, given just some of the timings as we get into the details of the program, got pushed into 2020, and that relates around some of the - honestly a lot of it is in the finance function gated by our ERP transformation. That'll leave us, I think, pretty much where we expected to be earlier in the year, which is the high end of the program, closer to the $175 million range. And I would expect, if you sort of do that math that puts us in the $30 million to $40 million range for 2019.","Michele Buck","And then, David, to follow-up on the second part of your question regarding the CFO search, it's on track. I have nothing to report at this time, but well, we'll know as soon as we make our announcement.","David Driscoll","Thank you so much.","Michele Buck","Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks very much.","Michele Buck","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Feeney","Hi. I wanted to dig into the gross profit a little bit. And forgive me if this isn't - just tell me what you feel like you can. But I'm trying to understand this, and I know there's some moving parts, but what an organic rate of gross profit looked like for the fourth quarter broadly. Was that particularly in line with your expectations, because it was a little bit behind mine? And maybe what role costs played, where they a headwind, is there a tailwind there, and what does that mean on the cost piece for 2019? I believe you already commented on gross profit for - gross margin for 2019. Thanks so much.","Patricia Little","So, as I mentioned, we had the - we did have a small write-off in the fourth quarter related to some - we disposed of some underutilized assets. Absent that, we would have been closer to a positive 20 basis points for the quarter. In terms of the underlying cost structure, I would say that what we've really seen, clearly, we as well as everybody else have been hit by inflationary pressures as well as some of the negative price realization. And what you see is that stabilizing in the fourth quarter, especially things like freight, logistics, costs like that they remain high but stable. Going into 2019, we don't see a real reduction in those. We think we're doing a good job of optimizing freight and logistics, but there's still a base level of inflation in that, as well as packaging.","We're also starting to see some of the wage inflation related to some of the high employment rates that you especially in some of - like our distribution centers, so that's also a bit of a pressure on us. Opposite that, so we will have some good news in our commodities based on where some of the commodities pricing or hedging program puts us. So, all of those puts and takes puts us at a modest improvement for 2019 growth margin.","Jonathan Feeney","That's really helpful, Patricia. But I guess and again if you don't want to comment fine but I was just thinking you brought private brands to gross profit and you've got a certain amount of the amplify gross profit and I know that some of that got divested but net of that it looks like that seems to be a bigger number than the $15 million in adjusted gross profit year-over-year and I know you have a divestiture, I mean you've got rid of the divestiture that you just talked about, when you net all of that stuff out, I'm trying to understand what the trend is in your organic greater gross profit, so when all this stuff goes comparable, we kind of understand what's going on, is that clear?","Patricia Little","Yes, it is. I would have to think it through that way and I think what we're saying though is those were to get impact what we said all along, we didn't get negative growth margin and we see that goes up to base up the fourth quarter building play there is reaction from amplify is really hardly anything in the fourth quarter. I mean we have to take a little bit further detail offline.","Jonathan Feeney","Yes, we can take it further offline later, thanks so much, appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question is from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer","Thanks, good morning. Question on your U.S. organic growth as we head into 2019, it feels like it's one way to organize the outlook is to think about the big three things going on you have the confectionery innovation that you're doing, you have that SKU rationalization and then you have the build out broader snacking in the distributions you might get there, Could you touch on the big buckets that as you see them and perhaps compare that to 2018 and help us understand where you see an acceleration in organic growth coming from? Thanks.","Patricia Little","Yes, absolutely, so I think at the kind of highest level there will be an acceleration in North American growth driven by price, there will be acceleration driven by season both Easter as well as Halloween and holiday and certainly there will be a contribution from snacking that will be incremental as well and I think I mean I think those are the real biggest buckets to focus on as the biggest change from a year-on-year perspective.","David Palmer","I guess just a follow up, if I were to concentrate on the core confectionery side of things, I guess one thing I wonder about is you've had a few different new products, some of them are combinations of research pieces in your core trademarks, you've kind of gotten two and half years it feels like into some of these call mega extensions and I wonder about the incrementality of the new stuff you're doing versus perhaps the fate of some of the 2017, and 2018 vintages of these extensions, is that something you're managing and do you think you can still manage that on a net positive basis? Thanks.","Patricia Little","Yes, so as you think about 2019, what I'm really excited about in our innovation plan is that our two big innovation are the chocolate packaged candy packaging reinvention which is really a better package but the same product with drive Shelton packed in usability et cetera and then re-spent and we've got a great track record of innovations on this and also any time we innovate close to the core. So I think the innovations we have in 2019 have a lot of the levers to that are tend to be correlated with some of our bigger successes and then I think you're right as we look at SKU rationalization, we include in that some of the past innovation that has had a couple good years of growth but maybe has dwindled down a bit to the point where we have more productive uses of the shelf space and so that's kind of included in that.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English","Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for spotting me in. I was hoping you could comment on the amount of pricing that you expect to be realized in the P&L this year, I heard you say you're on track for the 250 bps contribution but it sounds like the timing of the new bags is going to happen a bit later than we expected and obviously what we're entering the year with what looks to be a fair amount of year-on-year increase in trade spend at least, so we're closing last year which is clearly net price drag, as we contemplate the puts and takes of all that, what do you expecting the growth of the P&L?","Patricia Little","Approximately about 1.5 for the year, as we talked on the last call, it does build throughout the course of the years of the full 3.5 doesn't get realized in the overall P&L, you have built up to that 2.5 by the time you get to the third quarter, so all in that's about all about 0.5 for the year.","Jason English","Okay. Thanks and sorry if you guys had previously given that clarity and then I want to come back on this derationalization drag, I think hearing to your prepared remarks, I mentioned this derationalisations is affording the ability to swap out on productive SKUs with more production SKUs, if that's the case shouldn't this be an acceleration and you're putting higher productive SKUs on shelves, shouldn't be adding to growth net, net and if I know I know you're sitting the drag, what am I missing there?","Patricia Little","Well, there are inventories that get pulled back associated with some of those SKUs, and that's what drives part of that drag, so there's a transition timing, there's the inventory piece and that really creates that.","Jason English","Got it and last question, just these are sort of rapid fire ones, I know in the last call you flagged retail takeaway was tracking about 2.5% you are gaining share, your takeaway has slowed your shares kind of slipped negative despite the strength in Halloween, can you give us some context in color of what drove that sequential consumption deceleration?","Patricia Little","I think I believe we stated we expected our retail takeaway to be about 1% in the fourth quarter and that's exactly where we came in and the key drivers were as we expected, we had some really strong seasonal strength that was the biggest driver.","And our share decline decelerated as well, which was expected.","Jason English","Okay, all right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Alexia Howard","Good morning everyone.","Patricia Little","Good morning.","Alexia Howard","Hi, I'm trying to have a little poke into the drivers of gross margin, I know there's been a couple of questions on this, but I'm thinking particularly around the outlook for 2019 over the last 18 months, I think you had some headwinds from packaging things like the shelf ready packaging being along with gross margin products maybe some extra packaging costs because of online different format and maybe having to go out to per manufacturers a bit more often to get those different pack types, if that is still a headwind or is it becoming a bit easy and what do you think on the ingredients side of the outlook for 2019? Thank you and I will pass it on.","Patricia Little","Alexia, this is Patricia. Clearly we do expect gross margin expansion, pricing will be a piece of this although I do want do remind everyone that a part of it relates to our new packaging that we're bringing on shelves after Easter and that has a cost implication too, so that pricing is really designed to cover the costs of that.","So that doesn't - that's not a net drop down to gross margin. In terms of ingredients, we do expect commodity cost to benefit us this year because when we look at the price of the underlying commodities and then the timing that we get from hedging, so that should be a help to us but we do continue to expect inflation on things like packaging which is both core inflation just pure inflation on packaging which we definitely see as well as continuing to build out things like our retail ready packaging in some of those programs, freight is well it's stabilized, if it's not stabilized at a better number stabilized at where it is and then as I mentioned I think earlier today we are starting to see some wage inflation related to low unemployment rates. So you can really tell from that that there are a number of puts and takes but overall we definitely expect modest gross margin improvement.","Alexia Howard","Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","We will take our next question from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","John Baumgartner","Good morning, thanks for the question. Patricia, I wanted to come back to your thoughts on reinvestment, it sounds as though there won't be any real robust uptick in advertising spending in 2019, we haven't really seen trade spending increase for about four or five years now, and I can't recall the last time you heard of any real material uptick in feet on the street sales force presence. So as you think about you know the CMG category sticking below the long-term growth rate. The competition from adjacent categories ratcheting up, how do you think about those buckets of investment, I mean is there any area where you're seeing incremental needs being larger or how do you think about the ROI on those buckets devolving just any clarity there will be helpful?","Michele Buck","Hey, John, it's Michele. So I'm going to kick off with some thoughts and Patricia will probably jump in as well. I think. Let me start with advertising. As you think about advertising, while we definitely look at a rate of spend as a percent of net sales, we are also very focused on our delivery of media impressions to the consumer. So if we look at the past year, our consumer impressions or media impressions on our chocolate brands were actually up over 3% for the full-year. So what we're constantly trying to do is optimize how we approach each of these line items to get even more efficient, sometimes we will increase the spending to get impact and other times we will go for efficiency.","So, some of the ways we were able to do that we've continued to advance our media capabilities and gotten smarter about how we are targeting some of that media that's driven some of that we've increased the earned impression using that as a lever, which has helped us optimize the portfolio spend. And then also, we created this in-house content studio, which really let us take production costs down, which enables us to put more of that spend into media. So I would say for media, if you think about that, that's a good analogy to how we think about every item every one of our line items.","As we look at trade promotion, we mentioned previously that one of our ERP application is a new trade promotion module that we think gives us better insight. Frankly, industry leading insight and that will enable us to get more both more effectiveness, more impact, but also hopefully more efficiency that helps to drive net price realization as well. And so, we are constantly looking at how we build those differentiated capabilities, e-commerce, and other place that we're looking to build those that. As the world has evolved, even though we value very much our retail force in bricks-and-mortar, and we constantly upgrade the skills there. We look at e-commerce as a new channel. And we've certainly invested a lot to build capability in that area, invested in new distribution capacity that we think we're bet we're investing in a balanced way while also trying to optimize within.","John Baumgartner","Yes, and I don't - that sounds great. I agree with everything you said.","Michele Buck","Great. Thanks for your time.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Steve Strycula with UBS. Your line is open.","Steve Strycula","Hi, good morning. So just to circle back - circle back on a question that you had touched on a little bit earlier. So I apologize, if there's any redundancy here. But on the SKU rationalization Michele, can you just help us understand and unpack that was the key catalyst when you kind of embarked on this mission, maybe last year, was it more just better intelligence as you kind of looked across the portfolio or maybe you weren't optimizing certain space or is it more focused on some of the smaller brands such as Crave and why not, so that will be the first part my question then I have a follow-up?","Michele Buck","Okay. Sure. So the real impetus was complexity that we were starting to see the complexity creating some challenges in gross margin, frankly. And so, it was really about simplification to drive that productivity through reducing merchants - merge units, assortments, some of our innovation et cetera.","Steve Strycula","Okay. And then, question for your full-year guidance. Just wanted to understand a little bit more, so we think about the benefit of the longer Easter season being about half of a point for your old sales growth over the full-year, is that pretty fair and then on the input costs assumptions the way you build out your gross margin expectations, have you factor that in based off kind of the current spot rates or you build in a little anticipated inflation just so we can kind of gauge the conservatism? Thank you.","Michele Buck","So relative to Easter, yes, about a half a point is how you should think about it. And Patricia, do you want to handle the\u2026","Patricia Little","Yes, on our key commodities because we hedge one of the things that gives us is a lot of good cost visibility. So definitely include in our plan, we have those pretty, since we hedged three - 24 months out, we have good visibility into that. We also, stay in very close touch with the market on things like packaging, freight, wages that allow us to, I think do very good at estimating the impact of those.","Steve Strycula","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rob Dickerson","Great. Thank you so much. So Michele I just have a broader question with respect to the - I guess the 22% to 23% margin, operating margin targets you put out two years ago. So I think you know I hear you for 19 gross margin to be up modestly or its sadly some of that's more commodity driven honestly off of restructuring spend or ERP efficiency et cetera. And you said also that on the operating margin side that that sounds like that would be up a little bit more than what we've seen historically but frankly over the past call it three years we haven't seen that much.","So I'm just wondering like if we think about what this implied margin, expectation with a need to be for 2020, is that still rational, given what I'm hearing is the increased efficiency, increased velocity probability, a few rationalizations and more targeted spend. But I'm also hearing that maybe there's some need given the competitive environment that if you're more efficient, you might need to reinvest more, which therefore could, maybe increase the probability of accelerated top line growth but not as much margin expansion at the company which might not be a bad thing. So I'm just curious to updated thoughts around kind of the top line growth relative for profitability expression platform. Thanks.","Michele Buck","So our target when we set the target it was really set to ensure that we will be in the top core tile amongst our sector and that's really the goal and the intent of that EBIT margin target. We will always take a balanced approach to expanding margins and growing the top line, and we know that sometimes we will shift in one direction versus the other. But we think that balanced approach is critically important. 2018 overall was a pretty tough year for the industry from a margin perspective. But we're confident in our plans to make that progress in 2019 that you referenced both in terms of on the gross margin line and a little bit below. So we think there's always opportunity there and we need to continue to evolve and attack each line item in the P&L to go after margin improvement and will continue to do that going forward.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes our Q&A session.

My name is Phyllis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company's Second Quarter 2014 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you, Phyllis. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Hershey Company's Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Dave Tacka, Senior Vice President and CFO; and I will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We also welcome those of you listening via the webcast. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2013 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss 2014 second quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $2 million or $0.01 per share diluted related to net acquisition and transaction cost primarily associated with Shanghai Golden Monkey, Project Next Century charges, as well as non-service-related pension income. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","John P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. Net sales sequentially improved versus the first quarter, and we continue to make progress against the initiatives that will drive improved performance over the remainder of the year. In the second half of the year, seasonal growth will be solid. New products will launch, and we'll have new initiatives that should enable us to deliver on our objectives.","Driven by a late and solid Easter season, second quarter CMG category growth was 6.8%. Hershey marketplace results were also strong with Q2 retail takeaway of 7.5%, resulting in a 0.2 point market share gain, offsetting the decline we experienced in the first quarter. Our Easter sell-through was very good, and we gained 1.1 market share points in this important season.","On a quarterly and year-to-date basis, chocolate is driving category growth, and as we stated earlier this year, we expect our net sales and marketplace performance to be driven by strong second half activity that we have planned. But our first half results have been below our expectations. In-store activity and trends were difficult to interpret over the first few months of the year, given abnormal shopping patterns, a late Easter and a continued challenging macro-environment, especially related to the consumer who has not participated in the economic recovery. However, we've now been able to discern that across the broader snacking continuum, especially as it relates to the instant consumable pack type, we're encountering greater levels of competitive in-store merchandising and programming.","As a result over the remainder of the year, in addition to solid seasonal growth and previously mentioned new product launches, we have a few more initiatives than we initially planned. A couple examples of those include a King of Summer program, which is a major effort within the C-store channel to increase king-sized displays; a new limited-edition instant consumable product to drive excitement, variety, news and more importantly merchandising and programming; a new Brookside product launch in December, in addition to the Brookside Crunchy Clusters; and incremental shelf space gains in the C-store channel as a result of favorable shelf sets.","We feel good about the plans that we have in place, our business model and the opportunities that lie ahead. We continue to believe that over the long-term, the candy and mint category grows in the 3% to 4% range. Although given year-to-date results and the aforementioned challenges, category growth will most likely be around 3% in 2014.","Before we get into the details of the second quarter, I'd like to spend a moment on the pricing action announced on July 15. As you're all aware, commodity prices have been volatile. Prices for many of the primary and secondary commodities that we use in our products have increased year-over-year. Given category dynamics related to pricing, flow-through and the view of our future cost profile, a price increase was necessary to protect our margins. This action was effective immediately on July 15. However, during the 4-week period, ending August 12, existing customers can, based on their historic order patterns, order up to 8 weeks of inventory at the previous price if delivery occurs by September 7.","On everyday items, consumers will start to see higher prices primarily on instant consumables and on in-aisle non-merchandise take-home items. As such, we expect initial price elasticity impact to result in lower volume over the remainder of the year, primarily in the fourth quarter and into 2015.","We do not expect this action to materially impact our financial results this year. While it is a bit early to measure consumer reaction in response to pricing, we feel that our brand support, innovation, consumer spending and investment in go-to-market capabilities should enable us to deliver on our long-term target.","Now for some marketplace performance. Nielsen's second quarter measures do not encompass the entire Easter season in both the year ago and current periods. Therefore, the majority of my remarks today will refer to year-to-date marketplace performance for the 24 weeks ended June 14, 2014. Year-to-date CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, category growth in the xAOC+C channels was up 2.1%. However, gum continues to be a drag on total CMG performance, and if you exclude it, the category was up 3%. Total Hershey CMG retail takeaway for the year-to-date period through June 14, 2014, in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business was up 2.2%, in line with overall category growth with market share of 31.1% flat versus the previous period.","As a reminder, this represents xAOC+C store data consisting of food, drug, MassX and C-store channels plus the inclusion of Walmart and partial Dollar, Club and Military channels. Year-to-date, xAOC+C chocolate category growth was plus 3.5%, and in the range we expected given the level of activity in the category.","Hershey's xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway was 2%, resulting in a loss of 0.7 chocolate market share points. We expect our performance in the back half of the year to be better given the launch of York Minis and Brookside Crunchy Clusters. Retail takeaway for Reese's, Kit Kat and Brookside was solid, resulting in market share gains for all 3 brands. Year-to-date, non-chocolate candy or NCC, xAOC+C category growth was plus 1.6%. It has lagged chocolate category growth given the industry's focus on chocolate. In xAOC+C channels, Hershey's non-chocolate candy retail sales declined 1%, resulting in a market share loss of minus 0.4 points.","However, post-Easter, our NCC trends improved, and we've outpaced the category driven by the Lancaster brand. Lancaster continues to show very positive results. Trial and repeat is in line with expectations, and it's revitalizing the caramel category. Distribution is in our targeted range, with plans in place to increase distribution in the back half of the year. While not as large as chocolate in NCC, we continue to do well within the gum and mint categories. Specifically, our year-to-date gum and mint retail takeaway was in the xAOC+C universe was up 29% and 7%, respectively. As a result, our gum market share increased 1.2 points, and we now have a 4.9% share of the market. Our mint market share increased 0.7 points, expanding our segment-leading position to 39.8%. In the C-store class-of-trade, Easter impacts are minimal. Here, for the 12 weeks ended June 14, the CMG category was up 1.9%. Excluding gum and despite trips being down again in this channel, C-store candy and mint 12-week category growth was up a combined 3.1%. Hershey's Q2 C-store performance was less than our expectations. Our total C-store retail takeaway increased 1.3% driven by our mint business with posted growth of 7.2%. However, we underperformed in chocolate, resulting in Q2 C-store CMG market share loss of 0.2 points.","Overall, C-store trends were mixed. In Q1, C-store chocolate category growth was about 6% due to introductory price points of new competitive products. With the inclusion of this promotion, Q2 C-store chocolate category growth slowed to about 3%. Hershey's Q2 C-store chocolate retail takeaway was up only 1.1%. Our C-store performance was soft in the first half of the year, given that more of our innovation was in take-home versus instant consumable pack types. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing more in-store activity across the broader snack categories. Combined with lower trips and economically challenged consumers, our merchandising and programming was not as effective. From my earlier comments, we're making changes and updates to our merchandising, programming, innovation and consumer investment over the remainder of the year and into 2015 to improve our performance.","I'd also like to provide you with an update on our grocery segment, whose marketplace performance is excluded from the CMG Nielsen database. The Hershey spreads launch has gotten off to a good start. We're on track with our plans related to the jar and the instant consumable pack types. Given the mid-May launch of the IC items and repeat jar purchases, the contribution of Hershey spreads net sales will be greater in the second half of the year versus the first half. Our ACV target for the spreads jar was reached in the Q2, and instant consumable ACV is off to a good start and will build over the remainder of the year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we'll launch Reese's spreads, a peanut butter chocolate spread, and my personal favorite, which has tested very positively. Additionally, we partnered with Pizza Hut on desserts portfolio, featuring Hershey's chocolate chips. We believe this will have a halo effect on our baking chips business just in time for the upcoming holiday baking season.","Moving now to international. Net sales were in line with the outlook we provided last quarter. We anticipated a profile similar to last year despite slightly greater foreign currency headwinds. International net sales were in line with expectations, up 7%. China continues to do very well. Our sales increased double digits, and Hershey continues to be one of the fastest growing international chocolate companies in China.","For the 3 months ended June 14, chocolate category growth was around 7.7%, less than last quarter and typical of the trend post the Chinese new year. But our chocolate retail takeaway of about 30% was almost 4x the category growth rate, and we're poised to have another solid year. We're on track to achieve distribution gains in the second half of the year, and begin a phased launch of Reese's in the fourth quarter. In Mexico, and overall economic environment remains sluggish. As expected, our business sequentially improved in the first quarter, with net sales flat on a local currency basis versus last year. Modern trade chocolate category growth resumed in Q2 and was up about 4%.","Hershey retail takeaway of 11% resulted in a market share gain of 0.8 points. Given the economic challenge it's facing, traditional trade consumers in Q2, our non-chocolate business underperformed the category. We expect a tough operating environment in Mexico over the remainder of the year with a sales profile similar to the second quarter. After being down in the first quarter, Brazil Q2 net results increased double digits versus last year, reflecting April shipments related to a late Easter. Importantly, chocolate category growth resumed in the second quarter, albeit helped by a late Easter. On a year-to-date basis, the Brazil chocolate category is up about 2.3% while Hershey has increased about 2.9%. We now have a 4.8% share in this important market. Given the challenging macroeconomic environment, we would expect category and Hershey growth to be slightly below last year. We're focused on the long-term and not concerned about the impact the foreign currency exchange rates or near-term challenges facing consumers. We remain very optimistic about our businesses in these key international markets, and expect international net sales growth of around 15% in 2014.","Dave will provide you with additional financial details of our Q2 results and our full year outlook, so let me now provide you with some closing thoughts. Over the remainder of the year, we'll have greater levels of merchandising, programming and innovation in the marketplace. Advertising GRPs or impressions will be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis for the full year versus 2013. Advertising GRPs are able to increase greater than advertising dollars this year due to a new global media planning and buying process that is leveraging our scale. Halloween orders are on track, and we have the right mix of seasonal specific advertising, coupons and programming support that sets the stage for another winning season. So we have a lot of activity over the remainder of the year that should help us drive sales growth. Additionally, we continue to feel good about the outlook for candy and mint category growth. Overall, the category continues to perform well with year-to-date gains within the category's historical growth rate. Investments in the category in the form of advertising and innovation are present for most major manufacturers. Given high household penetration and the impulsive nature of the category, as well as affordable price points, we believe retailers and consumers will continue to value the confectionery category. As a result, we would expect the category to continue to consistently secure key merchandising and programming space even as price points may rise. Thank you for your time, and let me now turn it over to Dave.","David W. Tacka","Thank you, J.P., and good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.58 billion increased 4.6% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.76, an increase of 5.6% from last year. We expected second quarter sales to improve sequentially versus the first quarter, and they did. However, sales growth was below our expectations, given the U.S. mix headwinds and the increased levels of in-store activity across the broader snack continuum that J.P. discussed.","Organic net sales growth of 5.3% was driven by volume. As expected, new product launches are on track from net sales and a marketplace perspective, and we're about 60% of our total volume growth. Core-branded contribution was about 40%. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates was 0.7 points, and in line with our expectations. North America's sales increased 4.5% with balanced growth in the U.S. and Canada. International net sales increased 7%, relatively in line with our expectations.","Turning to margins. Adjusted gross margin declined by 230 basis points in the quarter as higher input costs, primarily commodities and unfavorable sales mix, more than offset supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives. Dairy costs in the quarter were higher than our expectations. As many of you know, there's not a developed futures market for dairy, which significantly limits opportunities to hedge our requirements. While spot prices have declined slightly from year-to-date high, U.S. market costs remained at elevated levels. As a result of the higher prices, we have increased our dairy cost forecast for the remainder of the year. This increase, as well as higher trade spending, primarily for greater merchandising activities, will adversely impact gross margin, particularly in the third quarter. Adjusted earnings, before interest and taxes in the second quarter, increased 1.6% versus last year, generating EBIT margin of 17.7%, a 60-basis-point decline versus last year. The decrease was due to the lower gross margin, partially offset by slightly lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses.","During the quarter, advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined about 5% versus the prior period. GRPs increased in the quarter as we continued to fully execute our on-air advertising programs for our major brands and new products. The reduced expense was primarily the result of decisions to delay new production costs, and shift some funding to coupons and trade merchandising to better reflect today's consumer environment. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, was about the same level as the prior year, as higher selling and employee-related costs were offset by a $5.6 million foreign currency exchange gain related to the manufacturing facility under construction in Johor, Malaysia.","Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. Similar to last year, we believe 2014 international sales growth will be back-half weighted given the timing of distribution gains, new product launches and seasonal growth. Second quarter international net sales increased by 7%. On a constant currency basis, they were up 10.4%. In our focused markets, China net sales increased low double digits, and we continue to grow market share. We are on track to achieve further distribution gains in the second half of the year, including the phased launch of Reese's in the fourth quarter.","In Mexico, second quarter net sales declined about 5% versus last year due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, sales were about flat, an improvement versus the first quarter. We expect the operating environment in Mexico to remain sluggish over the remainder of the year, resulting in a sales profile similar to the second quarter. In Brazil, second quarter sales increased double digits due to the timing of Easter shipments that occurred in April. Over the remainder of the year, we expect the chocolate category in Brazil to be pressured by a soft economy and volume elasticity related to pricing. Therefore, we expect total international net sales growth for the year of around 15%. Note that this excludes the Shanghai Golden Monkey business, which we estimate will close before the end of the year.","Moving down the P&L. Second quarter interest expense of $21 million was about the same as last year. For the full year, we expect interest expense to be around $85 million. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 34.3%, in line with our estimate. For the full year, we continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be around 34.5%.","For the second quarter of 2014, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 225 million shares, leading to an adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.76, an increase of 5.6% versus year ago.","Now let me provide a quick recap of year-to-date adjusted results. Net sales increased 3.4% in the first half. Adjusted EBIT increased 2.8%, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin of 20.2%. Year-to-date gross -- adjusted gross margin was 46.0% versus 47.1% last year or 110 basis points lower due to higher commodity costs. Adjusted earnings per share diluted in the first half increased 5% to $1.90 per share.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's second quarter by $82 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $57 million, primarily because of sales timing and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $76 million and accounts payable increased by $52 million. Capital additions, including software, were $70 million in the second quarter. For the year, we now expect total capital expenditures to be about $380 million to $390 million, including the capital related to the Johor, Malaysia, project. This is an increase from previous guidance, primarily as a result of including capital in the China manufacturing JV that we've now taken control of.","Depreciation and amortization was $51 million in the second quarter, in line with our estimates. During the second quarter, the company repurchased the $125 million of outstanding shares, completing the $250 million repurchase authorization that was approved in April 2011. Additionally, we repurchased $40 million of our common shares to replace shares issued in connection with exercises of stock options. All $165 million of the acquired shares were repurchased in the open market. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow and has a strong balance sheet. As was mentioned in this morning's press release, we have increased our quarterly dividend by 10% so that we remain in line with our targeted 50% payout ratio. This action reflects our confidence in the long-term growth potential of our business. Additionally, we have authorization to make additional repurchases of up to $250 million based upon cash availability within our cash use priorities. Cash at end of the second quarter of $563 million was relatively in line with the year ago period. The company is well-positioned to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and the Golden Monkey acquisition.","Let me close by providing some context on our 2014 outlook. As J.P. outlined, we have initiatives in place that we believe will drive net sales growth across our businesses over the remainder of the year. We believe these actions will result in 2014 net sales growth around the low end of our 5% to 7% long-term target, including the impact of the price increase and foreign currency exchange rates. Due primarily to higher dairy costs, greater merchandising and unfavorable mix, we now expect gross margin to be slightly down versus 2013. Based on the timing of new product launches in both North America and international markets, advertising and related consumer marketing expense in the second half of the year is expected to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, with the biggest increase expected in the third quarter. This will result in full year expense being up low-single digits.","As J.P. mentioned, the increase in GRPs will be greater than dollars this year. We continue to expect SM&A expense, excluding advertising, to increase this year at a rate less than sales, as we leverage the investments we've made over the last few years. As a result, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share diluted to be around the low end of our long-term growth rate of 9% to 11%.","We continue to expect that the fourth quarter will drive second half and full year EPS growth as we begin to lap the higher commodities and SM&A cost levels. Additionally, note that this outlook excludes operating results related to Shanghai Golden Monkey, which we now expect will close by year end. We continue to expect Golden Monkey results, excluding acquisition and transaction costs to be accretive in our first year of ownership. The impact in 2014 is now expected to be minimal, given the later-than-expected closing date. Thank you for your time this morning. J.P., Mark and I will now take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I just have a couple -- a couple of questions, if I could, please. The first would be, I guess, maybe to Dave, in terms of the gross margin being down slightly for the year, is it the pricing you're relying on in terms of the improvement sequentially in gross margin? I know you lapped some of the input cost inflation, started late last year. And then I guess rated to that, is the -- in terms of the cost savings coming through in terms of Project Next Century and that kind of thing, do those pick up in the second half of the year?","David W. Tacka","So the Project Next Century savings are pretty well completed. We've completed that project, and the savings were pretty much all flowing through. In the back half of the year, the gross margin is impacted by the higher commodity costs versus last year, but with respect to the fourth quarter, we really just begin to lap where we started having the higher cost last year.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could ask another question for J.P. And just in relation to, I guess, as you see your investments behind the business from an advertising and promotional standpoint, advertising is up less than you said as of last quarter, but it sounds like you're getting more promotional as well. So as you look at kind of the pressure against the consumer, is that the same as what you thought before, or just more money moving into promotional spending?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. I think there's a combination of things, and let me point a couple of things out about the cost. There's the GRP efficiency, which we've gained, which is a piece of it because of a change we made there in the process. And then one of the things that you don't see is the nonworking piece or the production cost piece, which is a meaningful number for us this year as well. So in terms of absolute GRPs, I think that we're good there as we look at our current plan. I think the way to think about the merchandising is, is as we look at the total snacking continuum, we've seen a significant increase in overall quality merchandising, especially in some specific channels like C-store. It's not that merchandising is necessarily at a deep discount versus where you might think it has been historically. It's really more of a competitive environment and the range of choice that the consumer has. So some of that snacking is being where -- I think, if you look over the last couple of years, a lot of that growth has been led by CMG. I think what you're seeing in the current environment is that there's more on the floor, and it's more competitive across total snacking. So the choice the consumer has is broader versus absolute price being a driver.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So any limitation to Hershey getting their fair share of space or more space, especially in the C-store? Is that the intention of these new programs?","John P. Bilbrey","No, I don't -- no, I don't think so. I mean, as you know, we've got great coverage in C-store. For us, I think it was really about programming and what we saw with competitive programming, particularly in the first quarter and in continuing into the second quarter. I know there's some of the things that I talked about that we're going to be responding to, and then, of course, our innovation is much more significant in the second half. So we feel good about our stance, but it's a competitive environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Actually, just to follow-up on Chris's question. If you look at the, I guess, the non-seasonal business and the instant consumable business, the non -- the snacking, the broader snacking competitors have -- there's been a lot of product -- new product innovation. Doritos has definitely -- or Frito has definitely stepped up its activity on new products. You've seen it in Nabisco. So I guess, my question is just how do you feel about your innovation pipeline, not so much for this year, but even kind of into '15? If we assume that there's going to be a lot more of this sort of stepped-up product innovation in that snacking continuum, do you feel comfortable that you've got the new product pipeline to compete and what is -- could be a more competitive landscape?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. Let me answer it in 2 different pieces. First of all, on the innovation front for our brands, we've got what we believe is a very strong innovation pipeline in the second half. We've talked about some of that, and then, of course, we've added some incremental things. So we think we're going to be competitive there. If you really dig into the data of what's going on, part of what we've seen, which is different than what we've seen in the past is that our everyday business didn't do as well as we would have hoped it would have in this particular timeframe. I think the forces and factors are some of the things that we talked about. The independent C-store in CMG did not do as well, and I think you have a consumer who's more challenged than in maybe the more modern C-store channel, where gas is a part of the overall mix. And then one of the unique things, as we look at our data, is remember, last year, Hostess, Twinkie, some of the bakery segment was not participating in the category. This year, they are. And while they haven't participated at a significant price discount, the percent of merchandising over the quarter that they had their products merchandised was very high. So you saw meat snacks did very well. Salty snacks did well. Bakery did well, and so the growth was really led there across the snacking continuum more so than it was with CMG, and those are some things that we have to respond to as we go forward.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So as you go forward into '15, will you change anything about your -- the types of new products you want to roll out or make some of the -- some adjustments to your pipeline? I mean, it's -- I guess to kind of put it succinctly, it's just you had a new product innovation pipeline, and I guess some of it's going to be back-half-loaded, but it may not be matching up as well against some of the other sort of non-chocolate and non-candy competitors. So is there something you have to do to tweak your innovation or...","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think -- yes, I think you can say that, in the first quarter, as we kind of go back and keep score there. But as we look at our overall growth algorithm of getting a minimum of 1 point of our growth from innovation, and as you know, we've been more in the 2-point range, what we'll do is we feel very good about our pipeline. We'll be pulling some things forward in that pipeline, as it relates to the U.S. business so we don't feel as though we don't have initiatives that can bring a lot of value to us, and then that pipeline will also have a focus on the core. And if you look -- again, just recall from my remarks, if you look at the first and second quarter, we did well on Kit Kat. We did well on Reese's. We did well on Brookside, and so we just need to make sure that we've got the right timing and phasing of that innovation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question on the balance sheet and M&A. You were mentioned in press reports as a potential suitor for Russell Stover, which obviously ended up going elsewhere, I was just wondering if there was anything you could say anecdotally about how you evaluated that opportunity and why, given the strength of your balance sheet, you didn't pursue it more aggressively? And then just on a broader level, can you remind us whether you have any specific valuation or return on capital criteria that come into play with when you're evaluating acquisitions? Or is it really only about strategic fit and accretion over sort of a 1- to 2-year period?","David W. Tacka","Well, I mean, I think in terms of how we look at the business, so I think the #1 thing we will look at is our strategic fit. And so, again, when we look at acquisitions, we're trying to find things that will be both in our focus markets, and that will add to our ability to grow or ability -- or our capabilities. Those capabilities could be portfolio. They could be distribution or route to market. Those are really our key factors. Economically, we use a discounted cash flow model and clearly look at the return, and we use that to make sure we're disciplined in terms of the pricing. With respect to the Russell Stover, I really don't care to comment any further on that one.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, understood. I mean, just a quick sort of broader question on category trends. Obviously, there's a number competitive and macro factors, and you've highlighted those. But just wondering based on your segmentation work and your observations on the category, is there any evidence that broader health and wellness trends concerns are having, at this point, a measurable impact on the category even though that historically hasn't been the case?","John P. Bilbrey","We don't think so. I think that there's broadly consumers you can see over time have changing a relationships with food. If you look at total snacking, snacking continues to grow as a total category. And then one of the things that we've talked about is if you look at the core confectionary category, people come to the category as a reward-me category. They know it's indulgent. It's not a food group. They tend to -- it tends to represent about 2% of total caloric intake. So it's self-regulating in many respects. So as we think about the future, we're thinking about the total snacking continuum. That can be everything from indulgent to more functional, but remember, the chocolate segment in the category really continues to do well. It's just simply in the last quarter that wasn't led as largely by us as it has been in the previous time frames.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Quick question on elasticity. I guess, I'm curious what you are sort of modeling for elasticity to the price increase. And I guess, more importantly, if it's different from kind of what you built in the last time around when I think elasticity was -- frankly, it ended up being a lot more modest than you expected, and certainly less than kind of a one-to-one relationship. And then as part of that, J.P., you'd mentioned in your prepared remarks that given the price increase, you'd expect volume to be lower in the second half of the year. I didn't know if that meant lower year-over-year or just lower than you previously would have been, had you not taken pricing?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. So to answer the second part, it's really versus a planning stance without pricing, is what I would say there. Andrew, we always model a one-to-one ratio on all of our pricing. You're correct in that, the last couple of pricing moves we've seen with a significant increase in advertising spend in the category, which reminded consumers why they participated in the category, we experienced something more like 0.6, 0.7 conversion rate. And so the things that we're talking about would have the modeling of one-to-one. Obviously, I'd like to see us do better than that, and we'll keep you posted on what that looks like. So we would hope to see conversion with shorter timelines and faster conversion rates, but the modeling is one-to-one.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, that's very helpful. And then just the last one, typically, you've taken pricing with an intention to protect your gross margin percentage as opposed to just gross margin dollars. I assume that's sort of the intent as you think out to '15 and beyond, but I just wanted to run that by you.","David W. Tacka","You have it correct. Our model is to protect our margin and invest in our brands.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess first is a more detailed question. In the press release, you said that the FX was -- headwind was greater than you expected? And Dave, you said it was in line? So we want to clarify which is correct?","David W. Tacka","Sure. I think where we wind up there is that, as it affects the international business, that was a bit greater than what we expected. And as it related to North America, Canada was a little bit more favorable than we expected.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you mean Canada was more favorable?","David W. Tacka","Canada was a little bit more favorable. International was a little bit more unfavorable. So on balance, we were pretty close to what we expected.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess this is kind of like what did you know and when did you know it? But when you last gave guidance, you had -- you expected sales to still be in line with your target, and gross margins you had moderated, but you still expected them to be, I guess, kind of flattish. And now in your guidance, you've included the price increase. So obviously, the price increase could be material to top line, as well as your gross margin calculation. So kind of what -- I guess, what -- were you anticipating a price increase, but didn't tell us last quarter when you gave guidance versus today?","David W. Tacka","No. I mean, our guidance as of the last quarter was basically what we expected at that time, and not anticipating the price increase. As we've said, we really don't expect the price increase to have a significant impact in 2014. I mean, in the fourth quarter, we'll see some instant consumable pricing, and some of that will be offset by volume, but again, given the elasticities, we don't see much impact. The change in the gross margin versus the last guidance is really about the continued high pricing in dairy costs and also the mix that we saw in the second quarter.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, I'll pass it on. Can you remind me, is gross margin a part of your compensation package because, obviously, that piece is coming in well below your expectation this year? And so my question is really geared towards your comp accrual and would have kind of a setback to normal in 2015, be a headwind we should kind of consider? I mean, I realize the year's only half over, but gross margins are obviously below plan.","David W. Tacka","I guess kind of 2 points. With respect to your first one, and we do disclose our metrics in the proxy. Gross margin, actually, gross margin level is not a part of our comp program, but it's a key part of how we get to our earnings, and so that's how I would address that. The second part of your question, as you're looking at 2015, we're not really ready to give 2015 guidance. But what I would say to you is that as we've taken the price increase, we've looked at our gross margin as part of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to know if Mars' price increase that they just announced, it's 7%. Yours was 8%. Is there any -- have you done any math to determine whether their pricing will be a little bit below yours when it's all said and done? And then secondly, I wanted to know if I could kind of think again about the international growth algorithm. You're probably still mid-teens this year, but if Brazil is -- the category seems to be growing at a very low rate. Mexico has stagnated. China is doing, obviously, very well, but that -- China seems to be the only real driver of growth. So excluding the acquisition for a second, what are your thinking -- what is your thinking about 2015? Does the macro have to get better in Mexico and Brazil for that algorithm to work?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think there's one component that you didn't talk about, and we have a meaningful export business as a part of that international business. So it's not all about just the focus markets, but we also have a very good structured export business that continues to do very well, and that's also a really profitable business. I think it's important to keep in perspective in Brazil that it's a relative -- we have a relatively modest size business there, and we continue to build distribution and presence on shelves. So a lot of our potential there is really around increasing the portfolio size, and it's really increasing brand presence. So those are fundamentals that we believe that as we continue to execute against that, we'll continue to grow there. So I think while a lot of those macro things are important, we also have another lever that works well for us. In terms of the Mexican business, we've continued to grow our chocolate share there. There's some macro-economic issues that seem to be impacting the consumer there. So I can't really predict, going forward, what I see there in terms of pace of recovery in terms of the total market. But I think those markets will get better versus worse, and then I think we will continue to do well in China, and as well as these other markets. Just remember, within our strategies, as we talk about being focused on specific geographies, it's also about expanding the portfolio. In a lot of these markets, we have a very modest portfolio still at this point in time. So again, I think the fundamentals of how we grow are very much in our favor, and I think that's why more broadly we could feel optimistic about the continued growth process in international businesses.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And the Mars question?","John P. Bilbrey","You've seen what I've seen in the general marketplace. So I can't really comment or provide any analysis on what they may or may not have done, but I'm sure that will reveal itself as time passes.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up. Can you say how much your exports are up this year, and whether that's higher or lower than historical?","John P. Bilbrey","What I can do is I don't have the number right in front of me. But if you want to call Mark, we're more than happy to provide you specifically that information. I just don't have the number at the -- on the top of my mind. I apologize for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","As we think about your price increase and the window you've given customers to perhaps buy in a little more than they usually would over the next few weeks, how should we think about the cadence of your shipments the next 2 quarters? I assume it's reasonable to model some 3Q sell and a reversal in 4Q. Is that accurate? And can you help us on the magnitude of that perhaps?","David W. Tacka","Well, I think given the timing of the price increase and how it executes, I wouldn't expect to see a big swing between the third and fourth quarter because the buy-in period here would run into August and would ship pretty well clean out in September.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then question for J.P. on advertising. You and your predecessor, Dave West, had a really strong commitment to advertising. For a long time, it's worked, and I guess that's what make this year's lower ad spending as a percent of sales, in terms of growth, a bit confusing. And I guess my question is this, if you believe strongly in brand building, and it's been effective in the past, why not just say, \"Okay, this won't be the best year in our history. Maybe we grow earnings below our long-term range. A lot of companies are experiencing that. But we're not going to back off our principles of innovation and marketing just to, perhaps, at least from the outside, it looks like making our numbers.\" So why not take that hit this year, keep brand-building high, especially in this competitive environment and really stick to your long-term philosophy?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I do believe we're sticking to our long-term philosophy. I think part of what is going to happening is, is you're going to continue to see the balance over the first and second half as we support innovation. We've also gotten a number of our brands more towards the top of the curve of our advertising efficiency. So it doesn't require necessarily the same levels of increase. It's really much more around the mix of where you apply some of that advertising. So if you were to really look at where we've rebalanced some of that advertising, you would see some brand, individual brands, that have gotten some pretty significant increases in advertising. Maybe some others that have been deemphasized, the frequency has changed, but I don't think our philosophy has changed, and we'll continue to reassess over time if we believe we're doing the right thing or not. And the fact that we want to be a knowledge-based brand building company is at the core of everything we think about and how we want to act. So I may come to a different conclusion in the way that you're describing it, but the philosophy hasn't changed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","J.P., just wanted to ask a little bit about the second half sales growth. You made some comments here, but I want to go over this because I think this is a fairly critical issue. Second half sales growth must accelerate to reach the full year growth of about 5%. Given first half performance at 3.4%, really, I want to just understand what gives you confidence in this acceleration? And frankly, is this just a high bar kind of given after first quarter in a reduction in guidance here. I think you might understand that confidence on the outside is going to be a little bit low so your answer here, I think, is reasonably critical.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. Well, so there's a couple of things. Remember that in the second half of the year, 68% of our seasonal growth occurs then. We have visibility to what those numbers are, and that seasonal growth is ahead of what the average company growth would be. So we know that we have very strong seasonal business booked for the second half of the year. We believe that the innovation that we have is both meaningful, and should be effective for us. So those are big contributors as well. And we continue to have, we think, in our international business, where we're rolling out Reese's, that that's going to continue to work hard for us. And then the incremental advertising that we've added with the king-size event I mentioned earlier, we have a great cross promotion program with Coke and Reese's, and a couple of things that we haven't talked about yet. So I think, David, we're really lining up to take the things we learned in the first half. The take to make is over 6%, and we know that, but we feel good about the actions that we're taking in terms of the competitiveness and understanding of some of the things that went on in the first and second quarter. So I have confidence that we're going to get there.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two follow ups. On international, I believe, last quarter, your guidance for international on a full year basis was 15%, and you've reiterated that today. But apologies, but it sounded like in your description of international, things were weaker. So I'm just trying to reconcile kind of the tone of your international comments in Mexico and Brazil versus the fact that the international guidance is unchanged.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think -- Dave and I can both respond to this. I think what we're saying about Mexico and Brazil is pretty consistent with what we've said last quarter, and we continue to experience good growth in China. And then the exports piece of our business, as I mentioned to you, continues to do well also. So to reiterate, I don't think there's change there. Certainly, I was very transparent in terms of some of the challenges in terms of FX, and then the consumer challenges in Mexico. But from a programming standpoint and a takeaway standpoint, I think the results are pretty good.","David W. Tacka","Yes. I mean, in the first quarter, I mean, I think we laid out the challenge in Mexico and also the challenge in Brazil, and we said we would see some sequential improvement as we go through the year, and we definitely saw that in the second quarter. So our results there were pretty much in line with what we we're expecting.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I could sneak just a final one in, the innovation on Ice Breakers and Brookside, am I correct that you have shifted this from the third quarter into the fourth quarter? And if that's true, can you explain why you did that?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, the only thing that has had a shift on timing is Cool Blast. It really had a couple of factors. We continue to be finalizing, perfecting the start-up and formula, and then the other part of it is the capacity issue, where we just want to make sure we had the right capacity in place. It's not going to affect anything else, and we feel good about going ahead there. But those are some normal kinds of start-up things, nothing remarkable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I've got 2 here. I'll just rattle them off at the same time. First, if there's some concern in immediate consumption channels that consumers are swamping into other categories where promotional activity is elevated, as you raised prices, how do you make sure that, that shift doesn't accelerate? And then the second question, lower advertising, more trade promo, bringing back limited editions, just feels very d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu mid-2000s, which obviously didn't end very well. So can you maybe draw some parallels or contrast of why -- what's similar, what's different and why this doesn't end as poorly as that one did?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. Well, let me -- let's try to do everything we can to not compare the fact that we're doing a limited edition to the fact that we did a lot of limited editions back in 2005. So in 2005, as we've discussed quite openly many times, those limited-editions really became our innovation, and that's really not what we do at this point in this era. And so -- but if you have a limited edition, and it's limited, the news is not a bad thing. It's a merchandising event. So that's how, I think, you ought to probably think about characterizing that. We know that the category has been pretty inelastic over time. We've been able to successfully convert price. The consumers' been able to convert it again. I think what we have to observe over time is what's happening with the frequency in some of those areas or channels, where the consumer may not be participating in the recovery as those at the top end of the economic pyramid. So I think that it will be as we've done in the past. We expect conversion to be good, and the phenomena that I talked about in the independent C-store probably is not going to be that connected to what's happening in terms of the price, and the pricing most likely would affect the entire category and not individual brands. So I don't think to the consumer it's going to look that different.","David W. Tacka","What I would add is in the things that we've gone through and we've talked about in responding to the situation from the first part of the year is that there's activities that we're putting right around our base products. And so that -- the limited editions have a very limited focused role, and that's just to obtaining some level of merchandising and news. And as J.P. said, the big difference is that we really are focused. The innovation now is really focused on more meaningful and sustainable activities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC","I wanted to dig in, get another go with this price increase margin elasticity question going into next year. When you took your price increase in 2011, I mean, as bad as things are today, I mean, the unemployment rate was higher then. It was just wasn't a great macro environment in general in 2011. If I remember correctly, gas prices were going up at that time. So I guess -- you've talked a lot about the macro environment, but I guess, what gives you -- what makes you think that the elasticity reaction consumers will have in this really tough macro-environment would be any different than what they had back in 2011, particularly given that your -- it seems your leading competitor is sort of following suit here?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, I don't think that it will have big differences than what we've seen. As I've said before, the planning that we've always done around these is the one-to-one ratio. I think your point is a good one in terms of how we should expect the category to behave this time versus other times. And the history of the category over many, many decades is it is a pretty inelastic category, and it cycles pricing really effectively, and that's exactly what I would hope this time. I don't want to -- the thing that I want you to take away from this call is, is that we think about their business. There have been a number of different things over the last 6 to 9 months, whether it's been trips, weather, all of these other things. Largely, we don't know if those are one-offs. If there's some weather effect, they were real. But what we know is that we have fundamental execution opportunities, planning opportunities around how we schedule the promotion and merchandising activities we have, and so we really want to kind of put a number of these things aside. We do know in certain parts of classes of trade, there's a consumer that continues to be challenged. But we're also seeing in the snacking categories some items with some pretty significant pricing. They've been doing very, very well. So I think in the end, while there may be some people, unfortunately, who are really impacted, I think the real drivers will be around the things we know how to do best, and that's execution.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Janney Montgomery.","Eric Larson","One quick follow-up question. In your price increase that you have, going forward here, and in your allowed buy-in to your customers, are you protecting the margins on your fourth quarter seasonal sales for your customers?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, so the answer would be yes. And if you just think about how it works, so the instant consumables tend -- those prices tend to go up almost immediately on the shelf. Merchandising that's been schedule tends to also -- you'd agree, tends to be protected, and then the seasons are protected all the way out to what will be Halloween of next year. So the answer to your question is yes.","Mark K.

My name is Bonnie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter 2013 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Pogharian. You may begin, sir.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you, Bonnie. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Hershey Company's fourth quarter 2013 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Dave Tacka, Senior Vice President and CFO; and I, will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We welcome those of you who's listening via the webcast. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2012 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted or pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss 2013 fourth quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $10.9 million or $0.04 per share diluted, related to costs associated with the project Next Century, non-service-related pension expense, and acquisition and integration costs.","Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let me now turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","John P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. I'm very pleased with Hershey's fourth quarter and full year financial and marketplace results, which represent a solid end to another good year.","Net sales for the full year increased 7.6%. This was our fourth consecutive year of at least 7% sales growth, which has been driven by a combination of net price realization, core brand volume, growth in U.S. and international markets and innovation. In the fourth quarter, net sales increased 11.7%, slightly better than our expectations, driven primarily by volume. And this is translated into solid gross margin, EBIT margin and EPS growth. In 2013, adjusted EPS diluted growth was 14.8%, our fifth consecutive year of double-digit percentage increases. The category is performing well and our business model is working. However, we're not content. Using history as a guide, we recognized that consumer needs and behavior continuously evolve. We've been building on our proprietary IDP platform and look to leverage the vast amounts of available data related to consumer patterns around everyday events and how they tie into shopping, purchasing decisions, consumption, et cetera. This initial work has resulted in accelerated profitable organic sales growth and enabled Hershey to reclaim its CMG category leadership position in the U.S., with a 31.1% share of the market.","We're also pleased with the continued progression of our international businesses outside of the U.S. and Canada. For the full year, our international net sales increased about 16%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and we're on track to achieve close to $1 billion of net sales in these markets by the end of 2014.","And I'm excited about our recently announced agreement with Shanghai Golden monkey. The strength of Shanghai Golden Monkey's confectionery portfolio, manufacturing expertise and overall distribution capabilities, especially within the traditional trade, is an opportunity for us to leverage scale to make the iconic brands of both our companies even more powerful.","We believe the investments we're making across our businesses position us for future growth. Furthermore, the dynamics of the confectionery category, impulsivity conversion rate at checkouts, seasons, multiple pack types and so on, are an advantage for all category participants.","As has been the case for the last few years, we continue to expect solid brand building investments in the form of innovation and advertising by many category participants. As a result, in 2014, we anticipate candy and mint category growth to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. Although note that you'll see some lumpiness in category and Hershey performance in the March and April timeframes, given the timing impact of Easter this year versus the previous year.","Now for an overview of the U.S. candy, mint and gum category. For the full year in the xAOC+C-store channel, and as a reminder, this data consists of the food, drug, MassX and C-store channels plus the inclusion of Walmart, partial dollar, club and military channels; growth was solid in the chocolate, non-chocolate and mint categories, which increased the combined plus 3.9%, well within the 3% to 4% historical growth rate.","The increase in candy and mint outpaced other snack alternatives such as salty snacks, snack nuts, cookies and crackers. As has been the case for the last few years, the gum category has been challenged and weighed on overall CMG that's candy, mint and gum, results. Therefore, including the full year decline of 5.6% for the gum category, CMG growth was 2.5%. CMG fourth quarter category growth in the xAOC+C channels was up 2.5%. As I mentioned earlier, gum continues to be a drag. And excluding it, the chocolate, non-chocolate and mint categories increased a combined 3.5%. Before I get into our segment, marketplace discussion, let me summarize our successful Q4 seasonal performance.","For the combined Halloween and holiday seasons, Hershey retail takeaway was up 4.2%. Importantly, our seasonal sell-through was on target, and we gained 0.6 share points in Halloween and 1.4 points in the holiday season. This was our third and fourth consecutive years of Halloween and holiday market share growth. Our key categories did well and Hershey outperformed.","Specifically, Hershey CMG retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending December 28, 2013, in the xAOC+C channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business, was up 5.2%, resulting in a 0.8 point market share gain. For the full year, Hershey U.S. retail takeaway and market share was up 6.3% and 1.1 points, respectively.","We're proud of our U.S. marketplace performance, as we've gained the market share in every channel that we compete for the third consecutive year. Fourth quarter chocolate candy xAOC+C category growth was up plus 4.3%. Hershey Q4 chocolate retail takeaway was 5.3%, resulting in a gain of 0.4 points of chocolate market share. Core brands such as Reese's, Kit Kat and ROLO, as well as Brookside, all gained share. For the full year, our chocolate retail takeaway and market share was up 6.6% and 0.9 points, respectively. Fourth quarter and full year non-chocolate candy xAOC+C category growth was plus 1.2% and 2.6% versus the year ago period.","In 2013, our innovation was primarily focused on chocolate. Additionally, throughout the year, we were lacking very successful year-ago non-chocolate candy innovation and in-store programming. As a result, in 2013, we lost 0.2 points of NCC market share. We're making solid investments here in 2014 with some innovative new products that we believe will result in non-chocolate candy gains. More on this later.","While not as large as chocolate and NCC, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the success of our gum and mint business. In 2013, our gum and mint retail takeaway was up 27% and 11%, respectively. As a result, our gum market share increased 1 full point, and we now have a 4% share of the market. Our mint market share increased 1.2 points, and our segment-leading market share is 38.9%. Looking at key channels, I'm very pleased with our business in the traditional FDMx channels, where our performance has been solid. For the 12 and 52 weeks ended December 28, our CMG retail takeaway was up 3.4% and 4.4%. We gained 0.8 share points here for the full year, driven by the food and drug classes of trade.","In the C-store channel, CMG fourth quarter and full year category growth in both periods was up 3.3%, and impacted by a mid-single-digit percentage decline in the gum category. Excluding gum for the fourth quarter and full year, C-store combined candy and mint retail growth was 5.8% and 5.9%. Total Hershey's C-store performance was solid with Q4 and 2013 retail takeaway, up 5.5% and 7.5%, resulting in market share gains of 0.7 points and 1.3 points.","As we look to 2014, we have many exciting products, promotions, programs and merchandising in place across all channels, including our annual Reese's NCAA basketball and football programs, in-store merchandising and programming of Hershey's Smores and the launch of many new products, such as Hershey's Spreads in the 13-ounce jar, as well as an on-the-go pack type with graham crackers sticks, Lancaster Soft Cr\u00e8mes Caramels, York Minis, the continued rollout of 3-ounce Brookside instant consumable pack type, the Q4 launch of Brookside crunchy clusters, Jolly Rancher and Twizzlers Bites in standup, take-home pouches and our innovative instant consumable flex pack that fits in a cup holder, and a yet to be announced new product that we're very excited about.","We're proud of the gains that we've made in the U.S., so now I'll provide some color on the solid progress we've made in other markets starting with Canada.","Looking north, our business in Canada had a good year on all metrics. Net sales increased 5% versus the prior year, resulting in solid gross margin and operating income improvement. A portion of these gains were in advertising and consumer promotion that drove mid-single-digit growth in retail takeaway. Our combined candy and mint market share was up 0.3 points for the year, enabling us to become the market leader in Canada with a 16.6% share of the market. Growth was fueled by Hershey's, Brookside and Ice Breakers. As expected, outside the U.S. and Canada, net sales accelerated in the fourth quarter, up 27%, slightly greater than our expectations. For the full year, international sales of $807 million increased 16%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","In China, Brazil and Mexico, we made solid progress in 2013, with net sales up a combined 25% in these markets. In our key markets, our brands are gaining distribution, trial, and more importantly, repeat purchases. On-shelf velocity of Kisses and Hershey's-branded products is increasing and will build on our momentum in 2014. Additionally, we'll look to accelerate the testing and launch of our other global brands, Reese's, Ice Breakers and Jolly Ranchers in key markets. Therefore, in 2014, based on current exchange rates, we expect net sales outside the U.S. and Canada to increase towards the top end of our 15% to 20% target, which would put us close to our $1 billion goal.","By country, our business in China had a solid quarter and ended the year strong. Chocolate category growth in Q4 was up low double digits, and for the year, increased about 14%. In 2013, Hershey was the fastest-growing chocolate company in China, as consumers responded to Hershey's advertising and innovation such as Hershey's Drops and Kisses Deluxe. As a result, China was our best-performing international market, with full year retail takeaway up about 45%. Importantly, in November, we crossed a major milestone and reached the 10.2% share of the China chocolate market. Our momentum gives us confidence that the investments we've made and will continue to make in consumer insight and route to market will benefit our business in the near and the long term. In Mexico, our chocolate business, driven primarily by the Hershey's, Hershey's Bites and Kisses, had a solid year. In 2013, our modern trade chocolate retail takeaway was about double the category growth rate, resulting in a market share gain of 2 points.","Our overall chocolate market share in the modern trade is about 21%, and we expect to build on our momentum in 2014 with an expansion of the Reese's test market that's been underway for the last 6 months, primarily in the C-store channel. Our Mexico NCC business lost 0.2 points this year. However, it sequentially improved versus last quarter, driven by the launch of Jolly-Rancher-filled lollipops and take-home pack types of Pelon and Peloneta items. In Brazil, our chocolate business grew about double the category.","Market share was up 0.2 points, driven by Hershey's Bars and Hershey's Mice, which has quickly established an 8 share of the subsegment of chocolate-covered wafer products. Reese's was introduced to the major customer earlier this year and has gained traction, becoming a top 5 SKU at this retailer. In 2014, we'll continue with the Reese's expansion and the testing of other global brands.","Now to wrap up. I'm pleased with the way the confectionery category and Hershey continue to perform. We have a solid position in the marketplace and we're responding to retail customers needs to drive overall category growth. We have consumer-driven plans in 2014 and expect to drive top line volume growth by a combination of core brand growth and innovation. Dave Tacka will provide further details, but expected gross margin gains in 2014 should give us the financial flexibility to make SM&A investments, including advertising and related consumer marketing, which we estimate will increase mid-to-high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. As a result, we expect full year 2014 net sales and adjusted earnings per share diluted growth to be within the company's long-term 5% to 7% and 9% to 11% objectives. I'll now turn it over to Dave, who will provide some additional detail on our financial results.","David W. Tacka","Thank you, J.P., and good morning, everyone. Hershey posted another quarter of solid results with consolidated net sales of $1.96 billion, up 11.7% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.86 per share, up 16.2% versus last year. The sales increase was slightly greater than our expectations due to a solid U.S. holiday season and stronger-than-anticipated international growth. Nonetheless, the profile of organic net sales growth was relatively on target with North America contributing about 2\/3 or 8.7 points of the growth, and international about 1\/3 or 3.5 points. The impact from foreign currency exchange rates was 0.5 points unfavorable. The Brookside business continued to do well, contributing 1.2 points to overall Q4 net sales growth. For the full year, Brookside net sales increased 74%, in line with our target.","In 2014, we would expect Brookside net sales growth to increase greater than the company's long-term target, although not at the level achieved in 2013. Turning to margins. In the fourth quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 80 basis points. This improvement was lower than our estimate, primarily because greater-than-expected Q4 volume required purchases of certain raw materials at higher prices, and year-end LIFO and related inventory calculations resulted in slightly higher costs than our forecasts.","For the full year, adjusted gross margin expanded 220 basis points, a truly excellent performance. Input cost deflation of approximately $122 million provided about 160 basis points of the improvement. The remaining 60 basis points resulted from supply chain productivity, sales mix improvements and fixed cost absorption driven by the strong sales volume gains.","In 2014, we expect a gross margin improvement around 80 or -- I'm sorry, around 50 basis points, driven by supply chain productivity, sales mix and fixed cost absorption. Despite volatility in the commodity markets, we have good visibility into our 2014 input costs, with the exception of dairy, as there is not a developed future market. We do not expect commodity cost deflation in 2014. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter increased 15.3% versus last year, generating adjusted EBIT margin of 16.3%, a 50 basis point improvement. The increase was driven by the adjusted gross margin improvement. Adjusted SM&A expenses increased 12.8% versus last year, driven by increased advertising and SG&A spending. Advertising expense in the fourth quarter and full year increased 20% and 21%, respectively, versus the year ago periods. We continue to believe that on-air and digital advertising activities are a key factor contributing to our U.S. sales growth and our momentum in key international markets. We believe that we are now approaching continuity of advertising support levels in North America.","In 2014, we expect advertising and related consumer marketing to increase mid-to-high single digits on a percentage basis versus the prior year. In the fourth quarter, adjusted SG&A, excluding advertising, increased 10.1% versus last year, in line with our estimate. This increase reflects continued investments in knowledge-based consumer insights, nonadvertising brand building and route-to-market capabilities in both the U.S. and international markets, which will benefit the company in the near and long term. In 2014, we will continue to invest in our knowledge and capabilities. However, given our strong sales growth, we expect that we'll begin to see some leverage on this line item.","Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. As expected, net sales outside the U.S. and Canada accelerated in the fourth quarter, increasing by 27.1%, driven by gains in China, Brazil and our export businesses. International net sales trends sequentially improved every quarter throughout the year, and we expect to carry our momentum into 2014.","Total international gross margin improved 200 basis points for the year, although operating income declined versus last year given our investments in route to market, brand building initiatives and full year ownership of our India business. We remain committed to these markets and will continue to make the necessary investments to build brand equity, drive trial and repeat purchases. As J.P. stated, we expect solid international sales growth in 2014, which will put us close to our goal of $1 billion in net sales outside the U.S. and Canada. This estimate excludes the Shanghai Golden Monkey business, which we are hopeful will close by the end of the second quarter.","Moving down to P&L. Fourth quarter interest expense of $21.9 million declined $0.8 million versus $22.7 million last year. For the full year, interest expense was $88.4 million, slightly less than our estimate.","In 2014, we expect interest expense to be in the $80 million to $85 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34.2%, greater than the year ago period, resulting in a full year tax rate of 34.3%, which was relatively in line with our estimate.","In 2014, we expect the adjusted tax rate again to be about 34.5%. But note that in the first quarter, we expect the tax rate to be closer to 35%.","For the fourth quarter of 2013, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 227 million shares, leading to adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.86, an increase of 16.2% versus year ago.","Our full year results were very strong. Full year net sales increased 7.6%. Adjusted EBIT increased 11.8%, resulting in adjusted EBIT margin of 19.2%, up 70 basis points versus last year. Advertising increased 21% for the year, relatively in line with our estimate. Gross margin was 46% versus 43.8% last year, a 220 basis point gain. And adjusted earnings per share diluted increased 14.8% to $3.72.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. Year-end net trading capital increased by $23 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $17 million as a result of increased sales and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $26 million, primarily in finished goods, and accounts payable increased by $20 million. In terms of other specific cash flow items, total capital additions, including software, were $123 million in the fourth quarter and $351 million for the full year. This spending is about $30 million higher than our previous estimate, primarily because of acceleration of spending on certain projects. Construction has begun on the manufacturing facility we're building in Johor, Malaysia, and timing is on track. In 2014, we expect total capital expenditures to be about $355 million to $375 million, including capital related to the Johor project of $120 million to $130 million. The total capital project is about a $240 million investment.","Depreciation and amortization was $50 million in the fourth quarter and $201 million for the full year of 2013, in line with our estimates. Dividends paid during the quarter were $106 million and $394 million for the full year. Cash on hand at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion. We did not acquire any stock in the fourth quarter.","Let me close by providing some context on our 2014 outlook. As J.P. outlined, we have initiatives in place that we believe will continue to drive net sales growth across our business. We're confident in our plans, and we expect 2014 net sales growth of about 5% to 7%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We expect our net sales gains to be driven by core brand volume growth and innovation in the U.S. and international markets, complemented by in-store merchandising, programming and advertising. We expect first quarter net sales growth rates to be tempered for -- versus the strong distribution gains of Brookside in the first quarter of last year. We also expect foreign currency headwinds given recent volatility, particularly for Canada and Brazil.","We have good visibility into our full year cost structure with the exception of dairy costs. We expect our gross margin to improve around 50 basis points, driven by productivity and the final project, Next Century, cost savings. We also expect a favorable sales mix.","We do not expect input cost deflation in 2014. Advertising and related-consumer marketing is expected to increase mid-to-high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. SG&A expenses, excluding advertising, are expected to increase at a more modest level in 2014, as we build on the investments and go-to-market capabilities established over the last few years, as well as consumer knowledge-based projects related to our insights-driven performance work.","In the first quarter, we expect SG&A cost increases of low double digits versus last year, reflecting the new hires and initiatives brought on in the second half of 2013. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase within our long-term growth rate of 9% to 11%. Note that this outlook excludes operating results related to Shanghai Golden Monkey.","Excluding acquisition and transaction costs, we expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive on an adjusted basis in 2014.","I'll now turn it back to Mark to go to Q&A.","Mark K. Pogharian","Okay. Before we go to Q&A, J.P, Dave and I will answer your business questions. Note that Bert Alfonso, President International, is also with us, and will answer any questions you may have related to Shanghai Golden Monkey. Given that we are in regulatory review, commentary here will be limited. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can you please set up the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Dave, can you talk about what you're seeing in the cocoa market? The near-term contract's been spiking again. When you and I last spoke, you weren't overly concerned by fundamentals. I was just hoping for an update of your thoughts.","David W. Tacka","Well, I guess -- I'm not going to comment on our views and coverage with respect to specific markets beyond what I've said about that we have good visibility into our cost structure except for dairy. And so I'm not going to comment beyond that.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But can you maybe add some comment on what you're seeing on the fundamentals, right? Do you think there's enough supply out there, given demand?","David W. Tacka","Well, the cocoa market has been volatile and -- but arrivals at the port -- we're a little past mid-way in the harvest. And arrivals at this point at the port have been very, very strong. And so the estimates of supply and demand have been growing more balanced as that's arrived. So I think that's the things that you're seeing that the analysts are doing. We have -- we're very confident that we will have solid supplies, and that there's enough supply to meet manufacturing needs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just want to ask you, what do you -- your decision to launch a new brand? Well, a lot of companies trying new -- launching of new brands, they don't tend to I mean, successful there is lot of costs associated. If anybody can do it, let me tell you, it\u2019s definitely Hershey. But I guess, my question is what weighed into the decision of trying to launch a new brand in the U.S.? What are the costs associated with it? And how do you measure the success?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think that -- you probably heard us talk a lot about it. We are doing fewer what we call, \"fewer, bigger, better,\" and we believe, we are far more consumer centric than we have been as we look at our demand landscapes and where there's opportunity. So while, obviously, a market, the size in U.S. has different cost implications as some market, it also has the magic elixir of volume as well. So when we look at something like our spreads launch, which is currently underway, what we saw is that this a $3.4 billion category in spreads and so spreads includes peanut butter, marmalades and other kinds of things and then the fastest-growing subsegment of that are really chocolate spreads. So we look for unmet needs, and one of the unmet needs not only in the fast growing category was is -- there was a primarily a breakfast occasion, and as we've believe, we can bring great chocolate credentials to that space, we're also looking at variety and day parts that are different than what was happening. So these can be used on apples, bananas, I mean, it's almost endless strawberry, it can be on traditional bread at breakfast occasions, but it makes for a great tasting and a way to get also healthy snacking throughout the day. So all of those kinds of things go in to that decision and what's great for us is, this is really incremental. It's not cannibalistic to what we do already. So that's an example -- I want to just give you a hard example of how we might look at the demand landscape and then try to understand, if we should participate there or not. This is one that we are quite enthusiastic about. The other example that's worked terrific for us is really Brookside. Brookside is a dark chocolate, it satisfies a need that really wasn't there, it has a package that lends itself to portion control, as well as on the go and hand-to-mouth. So we look at all of those different things. And if you look at our results this year, our innovation has just been terrific over the last -- in fact, really over the last several years. So we talked about wanting 1 point of our growth coming in from innovation, but we've done significantly better than that. So it's really not the frequency of innovation, it's really, the quality of the innovation.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The same logic goes for Lancaster?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Janney.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So I wanted to understand, the Chinese market a little bit better. You mentioned that you reached about a 10 share. Maybe if you can give us a sense of like what the structure of that market looks like competitively? How that looks post the closing of Golden monkey? And what are some -- if you have them, your realistic goals for 5 or 10 years for the Hershey Company in China? To the extent, you can provide detail around that, I'd appreciate it.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. Well, first of all, our business in China today is largely a modern trade business. It's focused across major metropolitan areas, we're in the 130, 150 cities in total, but the way we think about it, is really how can, we execute our business models, so how do we build our brand product portfolio, how do we build consumer awareness around that. So if you think about concentric circles and economic density, we really want to build those out. China is such a vast place that -- really talking about being national, may be the wrong way could think about it, so we're quite patient, what we really want to do is make sure our businesses are solid and that they're funded well and then we can build out our portfolio. And our portfolio with China today is still young, and so we have a lot of opportunity there. And then as you'll probably hear from Bert at some point, the acquisition that we made gives us the ability to have broader reach in Tier 2 and 3 type cities with a portfolio that's broad and is also different than the portfolio we have there today. So those are all things that we look at. And one other exciting thing about China is, you see the convenience channel developing there and it's the consumer being -- it\u2019s the consumable being one of our real core competencies, we see that as a tremendous opportunity as well.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And J.P., just a clarification. The modern -- you said a modern trade, can you give us a sense over that candy, mint and gum market in China, what piece would you estimate that the modern trade comprises presently? Like 1\/2 of it? 20% of it? A ballpark would be fine.","Humberto P. Alfonso","This is Bert. It's quite different, chocolate versus non-chocolate. And so it's a large portion, we don't have the exact number, I would say more than 50% in the modern trade, very paced Tier 1 city-oriented and estimate to retail level to be at about $1.5 billion. The non-chocolate, which is much less concentrated in the modern trade, would be about $5 billion to $6 billion. And again, it moves further down the chain in terms of, as J.P. already mentioned, it is in Tier 1 cities, but also you find a lot more in Tier 2 and Tier 3.","John P. Bilbrey","The one other thing that I would just add to that is that we believe about 300 to 400 million people participate in the chocolate category today with some frequency, so that also begins to be another dimension of how to think about the size and scale versus the potential.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, my question has to do with a little bit with the fourth quarter. I think, you said the U.S. business, including the holidays, shipments were up 8% or 9%, or so? But I think, you said your off-take was up 5% or 6%? What accounts for the difference?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, there's a couple of things, Eric, that we believe is going on there as you look at the data. So we had a very good holiday execution. We felt good about that. But the quad ending 12\/28 is missing a full week of data. And one of the things that we see happening is especially, around some of its seasonal events, is a higher percentage of volume that's going into those last couple of weeks. So that's part of it and then if you look at the Wall Street data, while I haven't been through the detail, I think, what you see is that you have, I think, we're about 8% or so with that data, which goes through, I think, the first 2 or 3 weeks of January. So really, shows that it starts to pick up some of that. And then, the other thing that was happening that's in that -- that's in there number is that we have gotten to very low inventories. We had a significant growth rate in the first half. Some of our brands were growing double the rate of the category, especially in the chocolate segment. So if you're look at the chocolate segment in particular, which this continue to remain really strong, we saw some inventory rebuilding throughout the fourth quarter, and so there could be a couple of points as you got into December that came back in terms of inventory rebuild to more normal levels. They're still low, but they're closer to the normal range of what we saw. So I think, those are the 2 biggest components. The thing that was encouraging to me as I looked at that data really was the fact that it looks as though things are coming back nicely, so whether that's an anomaly or not, I don't know, but we continue to feel pretty good about what we think, the category growth rates going to be in '14.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then if I can, just a quick one for David. Is there any reason, why free cash flow shouldn't be growing basically, in line with earnings this year? I guess, CapEx is up a little bit, but maybe you can get a little working capital improvement towards the year-end?","David W. Tacka","Yes, I mean, I think, what I would say is that if you look at operating cash flow it should be growing in line with earnings and we kind of gave you some outlines around the CapEx and dividends.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Follow-up question on fourth quarter. The gross margin was a little below expectations and I guess, the advertising spend was a little below expectations also. And regarding, the gross margin, is -- were you forced to buy materials on the spot markets? And is that why your costs ended up a little higher than you thought? And then also, if this a LIFO kind of issue, does that mean that you have LIFO layers that are -- that you can dip into in 2014, that have maybe lower ingredient cost than what we see in the spot market? I'm really testing my accounting knowledge here, so I'm hoping you bail me out.","David W. Tacka","Well, first of all, you're right. The reason that we -- that the gross margin was lower than what we forecasted in the fourth quarter was that -- we did have some higher commodity costs associated with the higher sales that we had in the fourth quarter and so we wound up picking up some materials at spot prices. And in the year end accounting, there's a number of calculations, including LIFO and things and that, it also includes things like how fixed cost go into inventory and that sort of thing, and those things just came in with a little bit more expense than we had forecast. I think, the important thing on the gross margin is that the full year gross margin improvement of 220 basis points was very strong and it included solid productivity gains and sales mix improvements, which are really the things that will continue to drive our gross margin improvement as we go forward.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And the advertising?","David W. Tacka","The advertising was basically, it was -- the spending was a little bit lower than we have forecast, but there was nothing significant that we did that caused that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on the international business. And I guess, if we look at it, there was -- profit dollars were up about $150 million for 2013. And I guess in the commentary, you said it about 1\/3 of your volume growth for the year came from the international operation. So just -- can you give us some idea about, if we look just the profit dollar contribution, not margins, but just how much of the profit dollar growth came from international, is it more than 1\/3 of revenues? Is it less? Just trying to get a sense for how much, now that has becoming such a big slug of revenues, just how it's contributing to the profit growth. And maybe again not even if it's not specific, but just try to give us some sense for as we model 2014, what your expectations are in terms of, how the international revenues will contribute to profit growth?","David W. Tacka","Essentially, what we talked about is that in the international business, we had strong gross margin improvement, and beyond that, we continue to invest in the business. And so I guess, what I would say at this point, is that we continue to be on our targets as we're growing to building the models out in the international business. But we are continuing to invest in the advertising and there's parts in the international business.","Mark K. Pogharian","Yes, Bryan, it's Mark. Just to clarify, the 3.5 points in the fourth quarter contribution from international, they had a very strong second half of the year as we expected, and it will probably be a similar type of profile even in 2014, where international second half is bigger than the first half.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I guess, what I was trying to get out is just are we are a point, where you get leverage really on the SG&A spending, where it's not just that it's -- actually, you're making, obviously, having a real good contribution to the revenue growth. But at what point -- where are we, I guess, in terms of that evolution, where the international growth also -- you get the leverage on the operating profit line, which will give you the operating profit growth?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, I think, Bryan, we're still early in the curve of our evolution there. So what we want to make sure that the SG&A investments that we are making continue to drive top line growth. Even in markets like China, our portfolio is quite limited today. If you look around some of these key markets, that would continue to be true as well. So we're going to follow our business model of brand building because we have good healthy growth -- gross margins. It does give us the chance to moderate that if we chose to do it. But right now, we continue to believe that we're building consumer awareness, we're establishing brands and so I think we're going to continue to be in an investment mode for a while. But obviously we look at SG&A leverage in a number of different ways and we want to be mindful that we grow into any investments that we've made if for some reason we were out over our skis.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question, just I want to focus on the U.S, just a little bit, Brookside. I think, by the numbers you gave, I would calculate that Brookside is now kind of total size of something like $200 million. Where do you think that this can go? And then when you talk about new product contribution of a point, I would assume that because Brookside has such strong momentum going into 2014, new products and I'm hoping, I can count this as one of them, it will be more than a point of contribution in 2014. So all things Brookside.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. Well, I think, first of all, your estimate around where Brookside is currently at is certainly a good one, and then to just give you a little bit of dimension on the full year. So, when we talk about 5 to 7 on the low side, that innovation would be about a point in the algorithm and then on the topside, obviously, it would be closer to a couple of points. If you look at 2013, most of our volume, I mean, literally all of the volume was volume growth, but the beauty of it was on those core brands, it was up about 3.8, volume on new product was up above 2. And then Brookside was not considered a new product in 2013, and so it also had a significant contribution of about 1.3 points of that growth. So if you take those numbers, you get a little bit above the 7.6% growth rate, but then, you take the FX out and that's how you land back at 7.6%. So we've been very fortunate that these new brands that we've introduced has been quite accretive to the portfolio, and then, we've been able to have quality innovation. And nobody is going to ever have a perfect record on innovation, but we've been very fortunate that we've had quite solid innovation that's helped. And these brands are sticky. They're contributing as they go forward. And then, the potential of Brookside, I don't have any problem in thinking about it as a $500 million brand. I don't have a date on that. And then, none of us know going well forward into the future, but I see, this is a brand that has global relevance and we just have to do a good job and make the most of it, but I think, this is the terrific brand that will establish itself truly as a big brand.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That was really helpful, J.P. If I could just do one follow-up on the U.S. business. I believe, that one of your competitors is going to launch a Super Bowl commercial on Butterfingers and maybe trying to grab a slice of the Reese's pie. Do you see a lot of interaction between those brands? And do have to do something special to defend yourself there?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, we have very solid programming on our Reese's brand. This is a very, very big brand and so we take all of these things seriously. I think, anything that brings people to the category is great. Reese's defines largely the sweet and salty segment. Usually, when you have a variant of a parent brand, it never becomes as large as the parent. And so while, I'm sure that it's a great product and they'll do well, we'll make sure that we're fighting for our space, as you get into March and March Madness and college football with NCAA programs and things, we got terrific programming on Reese's. We will defend it at home and we're looking to grow it globally. So we are up for any fight that come our way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","With the category expected to grow as you said at the outset 3.5% to 4.5% this year, some of it from new products, you're putting out international contribution. Certainly seems like there is obviously, the high level of confidence and visibility in the 5% to 7% sales growth forecast for this year. I guess, partly where you fall in that range or even if you ultimately get above it, but it depends on the ability to also continue to sort of take market share, as you been doing pretty consistently? So I was just wondering can you give us sense that to the combination of the marketing spending and innovation that you've got, give you enough comfort on additional market share gains, even in the light of maybe more category activity?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, well, I think that category activity would be good for the category in total. It\u2019s an expandable consumption category, so I think, we welcome those things and I'm sure retailers do as well. And then, we continue to feel really good about the execution, we have against our brand. So our goals are obviously to continue to execute well. And I think, we've got a pattern and a model that has demonstrated our ability to grow share and so I think, a healthy category is really fundamental to that. But I think, what you'll see is quality, rational behavior in the category and that's good for everybody.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Then on the new product you talked about, when is that expected to hit the shelves this year? And can you even comment on whether it's sort of in the core confectionery sort of wheelhouse? Or is it something more on the fringe like a spreads-type thing, I thought, I'd give it a try?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, well, we'll probably not -- we're probably not going to talk about that quite yet but because we want do a really good job with the release and announcement of that. So obviously, you get a chance to see that it's later in the year. But the things that we're currently doing, we continue to feel really good about getting off to a great start and advertising on spreads is starting -- I think, it's about February, when we begin to see some other incremental advertising on some of the other things we're doing. It's a consumable spreads product start to shipping in November, but it's really building, its presence now and on the front end and so on. But we've got plenty of things to keep us busy and we'll make sure that when we get ready with our new item later in the year that you won't miss it. I'm certain of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer of RBC.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question on advertising. Hershey has, obviously, over the many years, you have been getting more consumer focused and centric in your approach. You have been going from the low-end of peers to the high-end on ad spending. While you're continuing to ramp that, at least as high as sales, perhaps the massive increase is over and with that in mind, are you seeing less obvious ROI on incremental ad spending in certain areas, perhaps in the U.S. market, perhaps with the new age media that's -- and the less live TV watching so to speak that's going on out there, are you finding efficiencies in certain areas, while expecting to ramp up and others? Just any sort of color about ad spending because one question that will come up is with less advertising ramp, does that mean less core growth? And what would you say to that concern?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, we look at ROI on our advertising very carefully. We, of course, the mix moves around, so it's not always on the same things. But when you get a brand towards sort of the top of the curve and it\u2019s at a sustaining level, it doesn't mean, you get to a sustaining levels on things begin to decline. So you look at those things all the time, so we're very rigorous with our models on how we advertise -- or how we analyze ROI. So I feel very comfortable with that. I think an important thing that you mentioned is how does media evolve and are we participating in ways where we think, we have our most effective media. So one of the things that we do is, where we believe we aren't getting the ROI that would like to get, we look at, how do we use alternative media types, how do you add digital to that, we're continuously learning on our brands on a big brand like Reese's, 10% of its budget is in digital. And we continue to learn there. I wouldn't tell you that many people and I wouldn't claim that we've mastered all of the evolution of digital, but we look at the ROIs on that as fast as we can. We feel that we're doing the right thing there as well, so I think that with -- you can't make assumptions that just because you get to the sustaining levels means all of a sudden that mean the brands going to decline, but it also means that you can look at that and plus and minus, how you're doing. It's all driven by a combination of ROI and marketplace need.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. First, J.P., you gave us an outlook for the category next year. I think it was 3.5%, 4%, 4.5% type growth. As we think about this category growth, are you expecting pricing to be a component of it? Or is that all volume-driven?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, we don't -- when we gave our guidance, we don't include anything that would be M&A or pricing-oriented, it includes what we believe FX impact will be, so that's not in those numbers.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm not referring to your guidance, I'm referring to your outlook for the category.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, in the outlook for the category would not have pricing as a component.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And now, I'm going to turn to international. With it becoming such an important piece of the story here, particularly from a growth perspective, I was hoping you can give us a little bit more detail on it? And specifically, can you give us a sense of this 16% growth? This 25% in China, Brazil and Mexico, and 45% in China. How much of that is distribution related versus just the core? And also, can you give us a sense of the magnitude or scale of these 3 markets relative to the $807 million figure you gave overall?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, I'll tell you what was -- let's take advantage of Bert being here and he can chat about that, and I'll fill in, if it is appropriate.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, I would tell you that if you look at Mexico and Brazil with respect to distribution versus new and versus just core growth, non-distribution, it's largely all volume and not a lot on the distribution piece. China is quite different, where we're still expanding into more cities and so of the China growth, about 1\/3 of that would be additional distribution, with the rest being velocity increases driven by advertising and some new brand activity, J.P. already mentioned. We launched Hershey's Drops, we launched a test market for Reese's as well as for IP mints [ph] and towards the end of the year, Kisses Deluxe.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Any color on the size of the market?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, we are not a segment reporter, although I am sure, we'll get there in due course, but the only thing that we would continue to say is that we're shooting very close to that $1 billion mark, which we've been targeting for 2014. Among those, I would say that China and Mexico are the bigger countries with Mexico still being our biggest outside of the U.S. and Canada, although, that probable change as we get into that. And we'll give you a lot more color when we get to CAGNY, I think, with respect to the different countries. And while Brazil grew very quickly last year, despite the FX impact, it's the smaller of the three.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a follow-up on international. You talked about accelerating growth in your key emerging markets through the year and sustaining some of that momentum into 2014, which obviously, runs a little bit counter to what we are hearing from other consumer companies or specific categories. Does your outlook for close to 20% sales growth, reflect the view that the categories aren't showing any -- that your categories aren't showing any evidence of slowing? Or does it reflect an expectation maybe of even more robust or accelerated share growth over the next year?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes I think, what you're hearing about emerging markets could be different based on the categories across different CPG companies and what their maturity and development is, so our category and this is one of the things that I think, makes it an advantaged category at this point in time in history. Is the category still relatively modest in a number of these markets? Consumers are participating in the category with greater frequency and we continue to expand portfolio offerings as we go. So again, I think, they're very constructive markets in that's, it's not a battle for market share in a stagnant or challenge environment. It's really about building brands, it's building the category, it's being rational and consumers come to the category. So I think that's why, when you hear, the players in the category talk about it, you'll probably here some things that may seem to be a bit disconnected from the total and I'm not to say that we're immune from all things, but I just think, the category dynamics are quite different than a number of other categories and that's really why you hear some of these different commentaries.","Humberto P. Alfonso","And I think, the other thing, when we talk about the 15% to 20%, that does include FX. I mean, we continue to see very good growth in local currencies.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Apologies, if I missed it, but can you give us a sense of what you are expecting in terms of FX headwind to sales for next year?","David W. Tacka","We didn't say that but at current exchange rates that would be 0.5 point, but it will be heavier in the first half for the year and a little bit less in the second half.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So close to 5% impact on international then?","John P. Bilbrey","0.5% on consolidated.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Consolidated company.","John P. Bilbrey","Total.","Mark K. Pogharian","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford C. Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","While we've got both on the line, can I ask one more question related to the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition? Specifically, how it affects the margins trajectory in China? I think, before the acquisition was announced, it was going to be a few years before breakeven was achieved in the country. Presumably the acquisition puts you on a different trajectory here, maybe you could comment on that?","David W. Tacka","Yes, I think you got it right. We are obviously in a much more of an investment mode in the chocolate side of the business, which is our current business. And we already mentioned Shanghai Golden Monkey would be slightly accretive, if you exclude any of the onetime charges for integration post approve and post-closing. So it will help that along at a little bit quicker pace than we would have had without the acquisition.","Mark K. Pogharian","Okay. Thank you very much for participating in today's conference call.

My name is Keith and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call maybe recorded. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the program over to Mr. Mark Pogharian. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Pogharian","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company\u2019s second quarter 2016 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session.","Let me remind everyone listening that today\u2019s conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on our current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning\u2019s press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and the summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance within GAAP. Within the notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss second quarter results excluding net pre-tax charges of $13.9 million or $0.17 per share diluted which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these items.","With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","J.P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. Second quarter sales and earnings performance was slightly better than our expectations primarily due to timing in the U.S. International and Other segment operating and marketplace performance was a bit greater than our expectations, and we\u2019re making progress against our strategic initiatives. The integration related to the barkTHINS acquisition is well under way, and we\u2019re excited about the opportunity here and how it fits into our broader Snackfection strategy.","Work continues on the snacking insights and consumer market segmentation that I mentioned last quarter. We are making progress and I look forward to sharing what we have learned in the near future as it will be a catalyst of our go-to-market confectionery and Snackfection strategy over the upcoming strategic planning cycle. The feedback we have received from consumers to date is that sweet snacking, think chocolate and textural ingredients, as well as other food value inclusions, such as nuts, seeds, cookie pieces, berries, etcetera, are high value components that are a gateway to permissible indulgence and sweet snacking throughout the day. In fact, some of the initial work done here has resulted in an exciting Snackfection item that we will be launching late in the fourth quarter.","Looking at U.S. marketplace performance, total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending July 9, 2016 within the xAOC+C channels increased 0.5%, with market share off 0.1 points. This represents all Hershey manufactured products sold at retail, such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave, chocolate syrup and snack bars. For the year-to-date period ending July 9, 2016, candy, mint and gum, or CMG, category growth was 0.8% and was impacted by a shorter Easter season. Non-seasonal CMG category growth progressed in the second quarter. However, it was less than estimated as we anticipated better results given both competitive and Hershey activity in the marketplace. For the 12 weeks ending July 9, 2016, CMG category growth was plus 1.2%. Hershey\u2019s U.S. CMG market share in the second quarter was 30.8%, off 0.7 points versus the same period last year.","We believe the initiatives that we are executing against in the second half of the year and into 2017 will result in improved marketplace performance. Our number one priority is to restore Hershey\u2019s marketplace momentum within the very profitable U.S. market, where we have combined solid execution that leverages our scale with strong innovation and investment, our business is responding, more on this in a bit.","Our response in go-to-market strategy to fast changing retail and consumer trends over the last year or so has not been sufficient to deliver consistent top line growth that we expect from our business. To overcome the current low growth environment that\u2019s impacting much of the center of the store, we\u2019re focusing on 3 important areas of our business model. That\u2019s innovation, our marketing mix modeling and our cost structure.","Innovation is a big opportunity for us. Over the last 4 to 5 years, we had good confectionery success. Some products over-delivered versus our expectations and are still doing well today. And some of the new items from last year have under-delivered with lower volumes than we modeled. While innovation is hard work, our best innovation has been tied to consumer insights coming from our demand landscape work and leveraged across big brands and platforms and driven by our go-to-market capability. Combining this work under the leadership of Michele Buck as COO will add both focus and speed to the process.","As consumers\u2019 relationship with food and shopping habits, have evolved we have tested different concepts of our marketing mix modeling. There continues to be a lot to learn with regard to efficiency and effectiveness as we balance our efforts across levers like direct trade, advertising, digital communications and consumer promotion. Technology will also play a role as we leverage predictive analytics and new tools that indicate the optimal ratio related to promotional spending and long-term brand-building initiatives.","As I have said many times, we are a consumer-centric, brand-building company and we will invest in our brands and people. To do this and deliver on our financial commitments, we continue to examine our cost structure. We will deliver approximately $135 million in cost savings this year and at least $100 million per year from 2017 through 2019. Furthermore, we have intensified our focus on analysis of our global cost structure and business model to determine additional cost savings opportunities that we believe exist. While early, the initial work under way indicates that there are bigger opportunities to unlock these cost savings. Our overall goal in all of this is to create a streamlined structure that enables us to invest for growth and serve our retail customers and consumers in the most efficient and effective way possible while increasing our margins and profitability.","Looking at some of our 2016 innovation and advertising successes, I am pleased with the early results related to the launch of Kit Kat Big Kat, Reese\u2019s Snack Mix and Hershey\u2019s Snack Bites as new products. Performance of our Reese\u2019s Snack Mix and Hershey\u2019s Snack Bites products has been strong and recent data indicates an acceleration behind TV activation. Additional gains are expected in the third quarter as canister merchandising constraints were lifted and we have more capacity that\u2019s come online to meet demand.","The Kit Kat Big Kat is an example of an instant consumable-focused launch combined with new core branch advertising, which is driving growth of the entire franchise. Big Kat is the number one new item at some of our largest customers and in the C-store channel it\u2019s exceeding our expectations. And we are also excited about the Reese\u2019s Pieces Cup, which will only be available as an instant consumable item. Demand from retailers has been double our planning. Product began shipping earlier this month and is available in stores now.","As it relates to the second half of the year, we believe we will see a sequential improvement in our marketplace results over the remainder of the year, driven by new advertising copy, innovation and higher levels of in-store merchandising and display, starting in July with the Summer Olympics in Rio. Our company, for the first time ever, is an official sponsor of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams. Packaging that proudly displays patriotic coloring such as red, white and blue lettering on our iconic Hershey\u2019s Milk Chocolate bar began in the second quarter.","And our namesake brand, Hershey\u2019s, recently launched its first ever team USA named advertising campaign, Hello From Home, which is an extension of our Hello Happy Hershey mega brand campaign that we discussed last quarter. For this campaign, we have a trio of team USA athletes that includes gymnast Simone Biles; gold-medal wrestler, Jordan Burroughs; and 2012 U.S. Paralympic gold medalist, Mallory Weggemann. Reese\u2019s is also participating in the Olympics with a new ad campaign featuring Winter Olympics gold medalist, Lindsey Vaughn, trying out various summer sports. To do summer like a winter Olympian added a lighthearted humorous campaign that shows Miss Vaughn attempting event including archery, dressage, fencing and rhythmic gymnastics, with just a bit of humor and spoof.","Some of the other Olympic related activity that we are excited about includes our Krave Meat Snack adding swimmer, Michael Phelps and soccer player, Carli Lloyd, to its promotional team. Sponsorship of the U.S. Women\u2019s National Field Hockey team in his bid to compete in Rio and to celebrate the success of team USA, we are providing fans with once-in-a-lifetime experience to congratulate the athletes upon their return from Rio during the special visit to the U.S. Olympic Training Center. This is a just a brief summary of some of the activity we have planned in North America that we believe will result in improved retail takeaway trends over the remainder of the year.","Now for an update on our international business, where second quarter net sales growth was slightly better than planned and up about 14% versus last year. Excluding China, whose gains were driven by lower levels of direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances as well as the discontinued India oil business, constant currency net sales increased about 2%. I was particularly pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where combined constant currency second quarter net sales increased about 13%. And in both markets, year-to-date chocolate category growth is solid, up mid single-digits. In Mexico, our market share is off versus last year as we look to optimize product mix with a focus on global chocolate brands that will deliver sales, better profitability and market share growth over the long-term. In Brazil, market share was up slightly for the year driven by our focus on the Hershey mega brand and our differentiated portfolio that includes milk chocolate, Cookies \u2018n\u2019 Creme as a consumable and tablet bars and Hershey\u2019s Mais wafer products.","Net sales in India declined versus a year ago product due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media invested brands Jolly Rancher, SOFIT and Hershey\u2019s syrup, where we are focusing our efforts and investments, were up and continue to do well in the marketplace. In China, gross sales declined in line with our estimate. The summer months are typically the low season for chocolate consumption. China chocolate category performance in the second quarter sequentially improved versus the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In fact, the category was fractionally higher in June and we are cautiously optimistic that it gets better from here. We are executing against our plans to bring variety, news and excitement to the Hershey\u2019s Milk Chocolates, Hershey\u2019s Kisses and Golden Monkey and Munching Monkey candy and snacks brands as we expect will drive solid growth and net sales growth in the second half of the year. Over the long-term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve and that the investments in our international business will continue about and contribute 1 point of our overall long-term sales algorithm.","Now to wrap up, we are a consumer centric, brand building company focused on innovation and growth in every category where we participate to satisfy the needs of our retail customers and consumers. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to analyze our cost structure as we look for additional margin enhancing opportunities that give us the flexibility to offset higher input costs and invest in our brand. We take a long-term focus and believe that investing in our business will benefit the company this year and well into the future.","Now I will turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results.","Patricia Little","Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.64 billion increased 3.7% versus last year, slightly greater than our estimate due to timing in the U.S. and better international performance. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $0.85, an increase of about 9% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to the timing of investment tax credits, more on this in a bit, sales that were slightly great than forecast and lower advertising expense versus our previous estimate.","Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 80 basis points, net sales increased 4.5%. Net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates and a 90 basis point benefit. Lower International and Other segment direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances, as we lap year ago challenges in China, more than offset higher North America direct trade supporting in-store merchandising and display and related promotional price points. Volume was a 3.1 point contribution in net sales growth driven by North American performance. Acquisitions were worth 50 basis points due primarily to barkTHINS.","By segment, second quarter North America net sales increased 3.2%. Excluding the 30 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 3.5% versus the year ago period. Volume was a 4.5 point contribution to sales growth and slightly benefited from the timing of select merchandising program net sales that occurred in the second quarter that were expected to ship in the third quarter. Increased levels of direct trade supporting greater levels of in-store merchandising and display resulted in net price realization headwind of 1.6 points. Acquisitions were 60 basis point benefit.","Total International and Other segment net sales for the second quarter increased 7.6% versus last year and were better than our estimate. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 5.5 points. International and Other segment volume was off 7.2 points due primarily to lower sales in China and the discontinuance of the edible oil business in India. Net price realization was a 20.3 point benefit as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were meaningfully lower as we lap the year ago challenges.","Turning now to margins, adjusted gross margin declined by 120 basis points in the second quarter as productivity and cost savings were offset by higher commodity costs, including a favorable purchase price variance versus standard in the year ago period, unfavorable sales mix and higher supply chain cost related to the startup of the Malaysia manufacturing facility. For the full year, we continue to expect the gross margin will be slightly down versus a year ago. We remain focused on our cost structure. The productivity initiatives we have discussed over the last year are on track and delivering the targeted savings. Our efforts here are yielding further opportunities, as evidenced by our full year savings of about $135 million, which is now more than our previous estimate. Adjusted operating profit in the second quarter increased 2.1%, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 18.1% versus 18.3%. The decline in adjusted operating profit margin was driven by our lower gross margins.","Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 5%, less than our previous estimate as we continue to analyze the components of our marketing mix modeling to determine the right level of direct trade, TV advertising, digital marketing and consumer promotion. North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense was up meaningfully in the second quarter and is at healthy levels in the second half of the year to drive net sales and retail takeaway growth.","SM&A, excluding advertising and the barkTHINS acquisition, declined 2.6%, while unallocated corporate expense was lower by $200,000 versus last year. Savings from the business productivity programs and the focus on efficiency and cost savings initiatives that we outlined last quarter drove the declines although this was partially offset by the timing of employee-related costs and unexpected corporate fees that were about a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter.","Now, let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I am pleased that our total international business delivered on their Q2 plans. Adding to J.P.\u2019s commentary on China, chocolate category performance in Q2 was in line with our forecast. We remain optimistic about the long-term outlook in China and for our brands. However, consumer spending still appears to be mixed. Therefore, our full year sales outlook in China is slightly lower than our previous estimate. Specifically, China gross sales are forecasted to decline in 2016. However, net sales are expected to increase 10% to 20% as we don\u2019t anticipate the same level of direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances as last year. Constant currency net sales growth of core brands in Mexico and Brazil increased nicely. Excluding China, International and Other segment operating profit increased about 5%.","Moving down the P&L, second quarter interest expense of $21 million increased $2.4 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 31.4%, relatively in line with our estimate and lower than the prior period \u2013 year ago period of 35.3%, largely as a result of investment tax credits. However, due to timing differences, the corresponding book expense for a portion of the credit investments, which is recorded in the other income and expense line, will not be recognized until the second half of the year. We estimate this was about a $0.03 benefit in Q2, but this is just timing. And for the full year, we expect to purchase about $50 million of investment tax credits, which should result in an adjusted tax rate that\u2019s slightly lower than 2015.","In the second half of the year, we expect the tax rate to be about 32% and other income and expense of about $35 million related to the corresponding book expense for the purchase of tax credits. For the second quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 214.5 million shares, down 5.1 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.85 or an increase of about 9.1% versus a year ago.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow, at the end of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year\u2019s second quarter by $5 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $40 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $3 million and accounts payable increased by $32 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $62.7 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be in the $265 million to $275 million range, about $20 million less than our previous estimate. During the second quarter, depreciation and amortization was $97 million and dividends paid were $121 million.","In the second quarter, the company repurchased $117 million of common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In addition, the company repurchased $32 million of common shares in the second quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $250 million, slightly lower than the year ago.","As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of innovation, variety, news and in-store merchandising and programming in the marketplace. And we continue to refine our marketing mix modeling to ensure we have the optimal level of direct trade, advertising and consumer promotion supporting our brands. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense is lower versus our previous estimate. We feel good about our marketing mix modeling investments in 2016 and believe we have the right balance of spend in second half of the year that will result in a sequential improvement in marketplace performance.","The company estimates that full year 2016 net sales will increase around 1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of about 50 basis points and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 1 point. Constant currency net sales growth of around 2% is less than the previous estimate of about 2.5%, primarily due to our expectation of lower U.S. CMG category growth over the remainder of the year and macroeconomic challenges in China impacting purchasing behavior.","The business productivity initiative announced last year in June and the incremental cost savings we discussed in April and today are on track. As a result, we continue to expect that adjusted earnings per share diluted will increase 3% to 4%, including dilution from acquisitions of $0.05 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.24 to $4.28 range. Thank you for your time this morning. And I will now turn it over to Mark.","Mark Pogharian","Thank you, Patricia. Before we get into the Q&A, I want to remind everyone that we are here to discuss our financial and operational results for the second quarter and our outlook going forward. We know there has been a lot of market chatter surrounding Mondelez\u2019s preliminary nonbinding indication of interest. As we stated on June 30, our Board of Directors unanimously rejected the indication of interest. We are not going to comment further on this matter. We appreciate you keeping your questions focused on our operations and our financial results. J.P., Patricia, Michele Buck and myself, are now ready to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. We will take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","J.P. Bilbrey","Good morning.","Andrew Lazar","J.P., can you talk a little bit about just where inventory levels might be, just given I think you had received a benefit in shipment timing versus consumption both in the first quarter and then also in the second quarter as you have talked about? And then what\u2019s driving the expectation of incrementally lower CMG category growth at this point? I know you were more cautious coming into the quarter already. And I guess what are you seeing now that has you more concerned?","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes, Andrew. Michele and I will take a whack at that. Michele, you want to talk first about the category?","Michele Buck","Sure, absolutely. Andrew, as you know, as we look at the total box, both the total box and center of store were really soft as we got into the year and certainly in Q2 as well. We are encouraged that snack wheel continues to grow ahead of the total box and certainly that\u2019s really \u2013 the marketplace in which we compete is that broad snack wheel. So you really need to look at our \u2013 kind of look at year-to-date snack wheel performance as the opportunity for us. We know that the shorter Easter-impacted the category this year. That\u2019s really a \u2013 more of a one-time or every couple year impact. We have seen some more activity in some of the indulgent categories in the second quarter. And frankly, there was a little bit greater interaction with some of those categories than we had anticipated. And we do believe we have some opportunities to further optimize our marketing mix modeling, as J.P. discussed. But over the long-term, I guess as we look at the category, clearly over the past several years, the category has been running at about that 2.5% growth rate and we continue to believe that, that will be the outlook going forward.","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes. Andrew, if you look at inventories, we align, obviously, with our customers on where inventory should be. There is nothing different about that. And if you look at the first half in terms of takeaway as well as net sales, I mean, it\u2019s largely in line. So, we don\u2019t think there is anything there that would be different than what we would expect or what we planned for.","Andrew Lazar","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Driscoll","Great, thank you and good morning.","J.P. Bilbrey","Good morning, David.","David Driscoll","So, Mark, sorry, I got two things I wanted to ask. The second one is super short I promise. The big picture question, J.P., is given that you have a formal bid can you provide some commentary on the margin potential of the business? So, it\u2019s not a big question, but it does relate to these kinds of things. The question here is kind of what\u2019s the upside to operating margins over time? And this really aids investors at moments like this in understanding what do they actually own and how to frame any and all offers when you are kind of \u2013 investors are put into that situation? That\u2019s the big question. And then just a little one on the International segment, can you give us some thoughts on how profits flow going forward on International? Thank you.","J.P. Bilbrey","So, I will take the first part of that and Patricia and I can talk about your short one, but Andrew [ph], we are just not going to speculate around things that we would have to do with hypotheticals there. So I mean over time, we can talk about how we continue to be margin focused. You have heard us talk about our focus against the cost of our operations coming up. We talked about the $135 million we want to deliver this year. So I would just come back and say, as you know, we are a margin focused company. We want to make sure that our opportunities and our costs are well aligned and we want to continue to be able to invest in our brands and our people as we go forward. But as it might relate to something hypothetical, I just can\u2019t comment on something like that.","Patricia Little","On the international piece, first I really want to call out that, as I said at the beginning, a piece of our over-performance on EPS was driven by great results internationally. We are very focused especially on China right now as they continue to sequentially improve their business. They also have a lot of focus on making sure that we have the right cost structure aligned to the opportunities in that market and they are doing a lot of work on that. So we continue to expect improved results internationally over time.","J.P. Bilbrey","Hey David, I am sorry that I said Andrew. They have told me here, so I apologize for that. Trust me I had your face in my mind perfectly.","David Driscoll","Not a worry at all. Thanks so much for the thoughts. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning.","J.P. Bilbrey","Hi David.","David Palmer","You released \u2013 you had mentioned marketing to authenticity and simplicity of ingredients, are consumers telling you that this is a friction point for your brands and for the category, are you solving that perception issue and do you intend to do a renovation of any of your products associated with this message?","Patricia Little","So for certain consumers in the marketplace, certainty authenticity and simple ingredients is clearly something that they are looking for And so our approach is really to think about our \u2013 the holistic portfolio that we have and make sure that we have choices for everyone along the spectrum, so certainly barkTHINS, clean label, simple ingredients and that appeals to that consumer. And as I believe you are aware, we evolved our Hershey product, which was very close to simple ingredients, took it all the way there and we are actually going to begin advertising on that in the third quarter. So we believe that certain products of ours, certainly like a Jolly Rancher, are never going to be simple ingredients. So we will have a full portfolio that gives consumers meaningful other choices.","David Palmer","And just a follow-up, is the Snackfection innovation that you are talking about for later in the year, is that an extension of the confectionery brand into healthier snacking and if so, do you feel like indulgent brands can move into better for you?","Patricia Little","So I would say that it is \u2013 the innovation that\u2019s coming up is really what I would call Snackfection in terms of blurring \u2013 the blurring that\u2019s occurring between various snack categories. Think salty snacks and confection or other categories, cookies and confection, etcetera. So it\u2019s really leveraging the fact that consumers are looking for more of those complex eats and opportunities to play at the seams between categories. I think there \u2013 that largely our confection or hardcore mainstream confection brands will continue to offer primarily indulgent benefits. But there are some places where I think there is a little bit of crossover. For example, Snack Mix certainly has nuts, pretzels, etcetera and consumers are seeing that a little closer to having some food value than a straight chocolate.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hi, good morning everyone. I guess the question I mean just following-up on Andrew Lazar\u2019s question, Michele can you just tease out for us how much of the category weakness or the category being sort of softer than it had been historically is coming from immediate consumption versus at-home consumption, I mean I guess the idea being it just seems like there is a vast amount of choice as a consumer goes to the front end with a lot of products that are near or somewhat close to what your base products are, so just trying to get a sense for how much of the work you need to do is really in getting immediate consumption changed or is it really equal, both at-home and immediate consumption? Thanks.","Michele Buck","Yes. I mean I don\u2019t think that we are seeing a strong skew to one type of consumption versus the other. So as we look at our instant consumable business, it\u2019s relatively flat. So a lot of that can be skewed by the support that goes behind the business relative to merchandising. And certainly, the clean floor policies have probably impacted the take-home side of the business a bit more. So we continue to focus on big scale events, focus on our core brands and core pack types, both in terms of take-home as well as instant consumables, but we aren\u2019t really seeing a dramatic trend one way or the other on that front.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard","Good morning everyone. Can I ask about the recent CVS announcement that they are going to be putting quite a lot more better-for-you snacking in the front area of the store, I think they talked about replacing about 25% of the area that was previously targeted at candy, I guess what \u2013 how do you react to an announcement like that, is there a risk that those kinds of moves might spread elsewhere in the industry? Thank you very much.","Michele Buck","So first of all, we partner with our retail customers very closely, so announcements like that aren\u2019t surprises to us. They actually look to us to help them to optimize their total box and their total sales across snacking. If you look at that CVS example, that \u2013 you might be surprised to learn that, on that one, for example, we are netting out in a neutral position from an SKU perspective. So as we have broadened our portfolio to have offerings like barkTHINS, Krave meat bars, think about refreshment portfolio, those are actually allowing us to remain neutral on an SKU basis and really just offering consumers broader choice, both for across the CVS portfolio, but also the Hershey portfolio. So certainly, it\u2019s something that we are focused on. I wouldn\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s not something that we are \u2013 that we have an eye on. But we are really thinking about the fact that, that is out there and making sure that we have the right plans in place to continue to drive our confectionery and broader snacking portfolio.","Alexia Howard","Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","Our next question is from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John Baumgartner","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe to ask the U.S. consumption question a different way, just going back to your consumer analytics around segmenting out into various buckets, the loyalists, occasionalists and so on, of the categories\u2019 deceleration, can you pinpoint where on that spectrum the pressure has really emerged, maybe as the first pass. And then as a follow-up, in terms of the course correction from here, how should we think about the need to maybe spend more back against the brands, either promo or advertising, given the substitute pressure coming into your \u2013 the snacking categories?","Michele Buck","Yes. So I would say I mean relative to the marketing mix, as J.P. mentioned I think we are really still working through with evolving consumer choices and the evolving retailer landscape, just really optimizing that mix. So I would tell you that we continue to learn every quarter. We have gotten more sophisticated models in place to help us to better understand the interaction between all of that. But that\u2019s an area we will continue to work on and I think make some continuous improvement going forward.","J.P. Bilbrey","So one thing that I would add to that is that as we have seen innovation across the snack wheel, so remember what we said earlier is the box is up about 1.8%. Snack wheel is actually running ahead of that. And then there is parts of the snack wheel that are obviously outperforming others. And what you could link that to in almost every instance is the quality of the innovation. So I would actually say that has been a more critical element in a more competitive and space constrained world that that\u2019s giving certain brands and categories an opportunity to be available and consumers are responding to that. But for me, the really good news is that the snack wheel continues to do well. We just have to make sure that we are working hard and winning our part of it.","John Baumgartner","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","J.P. Bilbrey","Good morning Mario.","Mario Contreras","Good morning. So I wanted to ask, with respect to China, can you give us an update on how you stand with your current distributors, are you satisfied with the setup that you have, are they meeting expectations. And then beyond that, given the recent Mondelez announcement about their entry into that market, do you anticipate any changes to your strategy or to overall category dynamics in the upcoming quarters?","J.P. Bilbrey","Well, first of all, in terms of any entrants into the category, the China market is still a young market relative to consumption per capita. So really, as long as we are all working hard on category development, that\u2019s probably a good thing. So frankly, that\u2019s how we think about it. In terms of our acquisition and integration work there, I would tell you that we are making really good progress against the integration. Some of that work is still continuing obviously, but we have really gone through and done the sales organization work and combined those. That\u2019s gone well. We have taken what was the Hershey piece and the Golden Monkey piece and really tried to consolidate those distributors. So, it\u2019s a bit blended from where we started with Golden Monkey and Hershey, but we really feel as though our go-to-market position is in the best shape that it\u2019s been. We are selling things. So, as I like to think about it kind of in a simple way, are we making stuff, shipping it, selling it and collecting money? And all of those things are working for us. So, I think that the market in China, as you have heard from a lot of companies, is pressured. I think we would align with that. The consumer obviously has to show up, but we feel good about where we are at. And we will continue though I would say to as I have said before, make sure we are rightsizing all of our businesses to the opportunities. And certainly, we will continue to focus against that. And then as you think about the overall P&L, the impact of China restructure on our P&L this year is really relatively limited. So, we think that will continue to also help us as we go forward.","Mario Contreras","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney","Thanks very much. J.P., I wanted to circle back for a second on your answer to Andrew Lazar\u2019s question on inventory, even though I am picturing David Driscoll in my mind. The \u2013 like you, I just \u2013 like you, J.P., I just can\u2019t stop picturing him, but the \u2013 what kind of \u2013 when we look at like both the category and your takeaway, what sort of consumer takeaway in North America for the third quarter, fourth quarter, maybe into next year, do you have in mind when you think about the kind of \u2013 this kind of shipment growth going in? I am just trying to get \u2013 and what does that mean for kind of market share and what would be sort of good success metrics for you going forward for the next 6, 12 months there?","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes. If you think about the second half of the year and first of all, the inventory perspective I gave you, I am not sure I can add a lot to that. That\u2019s certainly how it is. If you think about the second half of the year, with Halloween and seasons, we have very good visibility to that. We know what that\u2019s going to look like. Same thing would be with holiday. And then also remember, as we have talked about a significant innovation in Q4, we benefit from the volume of that as we begin to build distribution and of course, the merchandising activity is after that. So, as we move through the year, you have the benefit of that volume that won\u2019t necessarily be a piece of the takeaway, so you might have a bit of a disconnect there in the second half. It shouldn\u2019t be significant. But as we have talked about our expectations in terms of the balance of the year, it does take into consideration the first half of the year and where we have seen the category growth be and that\u2019s probably where you also have seen some of the moderation on the outlook and expectation there. I don\u2019t know if anyone else wants to add something to that.","Michele Buck","Yes. I mean, I would just say we expect to continue to see kind of a slow sequential build in takeaway as we move further into the year.","Mark Pogharian","Yes. I think the fourth quarter will be better than the third obviously just because of our strength in seasons. And then to J.P.\u2019s point, net sales, intuitively, should be a little bit better than takeaway because of the big launch that we have late in the year that we are getting to later.","Jonathan Feeney","Great. Well, thanks very much everybody.","J.P. Bilbrey","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the questions. J.P. and Michele, you talked about the pipeline of innovation that you have coming up in chocolate and snacking in the second half. And when we look at the CMG trends at a subcategory level, we are actually seeing some of the strongest growth in non-chocolate and your own sales there have been dramatically weaker. And I know you have been in a position of needing to be selective about where you are focusing your investments. But can you just speak to your approach toward how you are thinking about non-chocolate at the moment? Any concerns that you are starving that side of the business and losing too much market share in the short-term? Thanks.","Michele Buck","Yes. So, I would say yes to that question. As we made prioritization choices across the portfolio, we made a decision to pull back a bit in non-chocolate and I think we are reevaluating that choice certainly as we speak. I think we pulled back at a time that some others in the marketplace actually accelerated. So as we look to next year, we are certainly adjusting our approach. We think that variety and news are absolutely key and that\u2019s really where our focus will be to dial up efforts in combination with the strong innovation that we feel really good about on chocolate, around things like core news, like Big Kat, Reese\u2019s Pieces Cup and then big sustainable scale innovation on chocolate, like the big one that we have coming towards the end of the year. But you will see us dial up the focus on non-chocolate next year.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. And just I am not sure if it\u2019s possible to talk more about timing there. I mean, how quickly can you replenish the innovation pipeline? Is that something that takes a few quarters or is it possible that it might \u2013 given where your efforts have been that it might take longer?","Michele Buck","Yes. On non-chocolate, I would tell you I wouldn\u2019t expect to see activity this year. It will be into next year. I would rather not go into the specific timing just for competitive reasons, but definitely it would be a couple of quarters. We have a pipeline in place and so it\u2019s really a matter of dialing that up and getting it into the marketplace.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, understood. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","J.P. Bilbrey","Good morning, Jason.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, J.P. Thank you guys for the question. So, a couple of questions. Let me start one sort of higher level. A lot of talk on the call and I have clearly seen the data of sort of shifting growth within \u2013 I think you called it a snacking wheel. I guess I have a question on pricing within confection. Is there any concern that price gaps between alternative snacking solutions may be an issue? And any implications in terms of pricing power going forward as we certainly see a number of your key inputs, moving higher recently?","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes. So, let me talk about the pricing piece a little bit and then we can touch again on sort of the snack wheel stuff. But I think what we have seen is that if you recall on the last call we talked about the number of new entrants that\u2019s happened, especially in snack bars relative to the whole snacking space. And some of those entrants, I think have gotten trial not only because they are new, but I think there has also been a different pricing delta that the obstacle to trial has been lowered. And so I think the level of activity probably speaks more to what the net value to the consumer could have been across all of the different options and opportunities available to them. So I think going forward, while we are looking a lot at our whole revenue management approach and making sure that we really got that right, we\u2019re thinking a lot about this particular question. And I do think there\u2019s some influence there as there\u2019s been trial in the category. And I would just come back to my other comment around innovation, is it\u2019s is very clear that those brands and companies who have done well in innovation have gotten a disproportionate share of the consumers\u2019 attention. And those \u2013 that\u2019s the real quality driver, in my mind. So if you come back to what I said earlier, we are really, really focused against three things in our business model. And it\u2019s the innovation. We are really looking at our marketing mix model, because based on the previous question, you are right, allocation and resources across different pieces of the business I think there are some things we learned there. And then of course we want to run a frugal business and invest in our brands and our people. And those are the three things I think you should take away from what we are really talking about today.","Jason English","That\u2019s helpful. One more then I will pass it on. On the innovation front, it\u2019s been a long time since we have seen a successful new candy bar launch sustain the market, so can you talk a little about what\u2019s differentiated about this Cookie Layer Crunch product that leads you to believe that it can really be a sustainable success?","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes. Listen, why don\u2019t I ask Michele to talk about that, but I think if you go back to how she talked about it within the seams of a pure confection and as you might think about other snacking opportunities, that that\u2019s what we think is really unique about how this is positioned. We would like to see it source volume from maybe some new places that stretches us a bit from just the core, but I will let Michele speak to that.","Michele Buck","Yes. So our most successful innovations are clearly grounded in deep consumer insights, and we have certainly gone \u2013 leveraged a lot of insights and research as we have developed this proposition and feel quite good about it. As J.P. said, it really does play between those themes in Snackfection of marrying cookie and chocolate obviously. And also it really plays on some deep insights around palate. If you think about the kind of the creamy crunchy palate, sweet and salty we see in the marketplace has demonstrated a lot of growth. And we are seeing with younger consumers in particular, there is strong interest in complex eats that this really delivers upon that will provide incremental usage versus our portfolio, which tends to be more of a \u2013 kind of a straight, creamy palate. So if you think about the textural experiences consumers are looking for and the new users that we are able to bring in, we are feeling really good about it.","Jason English","I look forward to trying it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next, we will go to Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","J.P. Bilbrey","Good morning.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning. I just had two questions if I could or just really follow-ups. I guess I want to be clear, back to an earlier question, if you quantify the effect on U.S. sales in the second quarter and like what could come out of the third quarter as you pull forward those sales. And maybe if I could add just a follow-up question to an earlier question, as you think about all these cost savings, is there a level of marketing you are trying to achieve or how should we frame at least the potential to reinvest some of these savings back into the business? Thank you.","Patricia Little","Yes. So let me start by \u2013 we are not going to quantify the sales impact, but I think you might be thinking it might be larger than - by the nature of your question, it sounds like you might be thinking it\u2019s a little larger than it is. On the cost savings piece, we really want to look at all the levers of our costs. I think we have done a historically good job of looking at our COG savings. We continue to focus on that and that will actually be the biggest driver. We need to extend that into other areas, including our SM&A that excludes our marketing part of our business. And then on marketing, it\u2019s going to be a combination of continuing to want to invest as a brand building company, but doing that in an ever smarter way and making sure that every one of those dollars works for us. The world is changing pretty quickly and we are just going to need to continuously reevaluate the roles of each of our \u2013 each lever that we have in marketing.","Chris Growe","Okay. And then just Patricia, one quick follow-up then, I think in the U.S., you had 3.5% growth and I look at your takeaway in the quarter, it\u2019s around 0.5%, so I am trying to put those numbers together, am I looking at it the wrong way or...?","Patricia Little","Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 because of timing of some of the things, it\u2019s probably easier to look at it on a year-to-date basis. And when you look at it on a year-to-date basis, there is actually virtually no gap between our \u2013 there is a very small gap between our takeaway and our sales.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thank you. What can we expect to hear from you folks on your Analyst Day coming up, assuming you are still going to have it, do you think you will give us a little more clarity on the cost structure reductions that you are planning and maybe even some more details on all this marketing mix modeling and I think people are going to care Michele, if this is a message that advertising and promotion or really just advertising kind of comes down a little bit, I think we all remember 2005 and 2006 when it went down too far, so will you give us more clarity in that regard also?","Mark Pogharian","Hey Rob, I mean it\u2019s Mark and I will let Michele and J.P. talk to those \u2013 to the business \u2013 some of the business drivers and investments that you referenced. As it relates to the Analyst Day, you are right there hasn\u2019t been a date put out there. I mean there is obviously a lot of moving parts. And you know that we are absolutely focused on the business and doing all the right things for the near and long-term, as we continued to do. But as soon as we have a date, we will communicate it.","J.P. Bilbrey","Yes. I would just very quickly talk about on the cost side, we have talked about very clearly what we expect in 2016. It\u2019s a bit early to get into some of the specifics of the additional work that we are doing, but we are \u2013 we have a process in place and we are looking at all the costs and opportunities we have literally across the entire business, line by line. And we want to ultimately make sure that we can make up the investments in our brands, aligned with the opportunities that are in front of us. I think you will continue to hear us be very consumer and brand focused and yet at the same time, we will always be very margin focused. But we have to be able to afford those investments. But as we think it\u2019s appropriate to build brands, I think you would see us want to be able to invest at within the kinds of ratios that we have talked about in the past. And as I always say to the team here, volume is the magic elixir. It\u2019s a great category and we get really good returns on the investments we make versus our brands. But clearly, we have got to be driving volume to make that story look optimal.","Michele Buck","I would say our focus is really optimization. How do we optimize and continue to be consumer centric and brand building, so not really a big change in that piece of the business model.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thank you.","J.P. Bilbrey","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And we can take that question from Erin Lash with Morningstar. Please go ahead, Erin.","J.P. Bilbrey","Good morning Erin.","Erin Lash","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up. There has been a lot of discussion about innovation on the call and obviously, you have expressed a commitment to bringing new products to market to drive category growth. But I was wondering if you could speak to the pace of innovation in terms of the timing and the ability to get an idea or a product from development to shelf, it sounds like some of your competitors and some of the more, I guess smaller niche operators have been bringing new products to market in a quicker fashion and I wonder the extent to which you have thought about, is your pace of innovation timely enough to respond to consumer trends? Thank you.","J.P. Bilbrey","Sure, thank you for the question. I think it\u2019s more about the productivity of innovation than it is the pace of innovation. And so when you look at things like hand-to-mouth that we were very successful with and it continues to be productive for us, it\u2019s what I always call sticky innovation. It\u2019s innovation that lasts. It\u2019s many times a platform and it allows you then to expand even across brands because you have identified a need state that\u2019s really important. If you look at how we classify innovation, actually our numbers versus our innovation targets are actually pretty good this year. I mean it\u2019s not that they are wildly different, but what you have to really achieve is that stickiness and then the thing that it gets you to the platform innovation. So we have a really good pipeline of things in front of us. And so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about all of a sudden having to start focusing against innovation. It\u2019s really making sure that we are bringing the right innovation to the market with the right investment and productivity. So that\u2019s really how I think about it. And Michele may have something she wants to add, but that\u2019s how I think about your question.","Michele Buck","No, I agree.

[Operator Instructions]","This call is scheduled to end at about 09:30 AM. So please limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many of you as possible. Please note that this call may be recorded. Thank you.","It would now like to turn the call over to Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Poole you may begin your conference.","Melissa Poole","Thank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for The Hershey Company's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call and webcast. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, followed by a Q&A session.","Before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Federal Securities Laws. These statements are based on our current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events and those described in these forward-looking statements contained in our 2018 10-K filed with the SEC and today's press release.","Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors.

Our year has gotten off to a strong start as we remain on track to deliver our financial commitments for the year.","I'd like to thank my colleagues across the Hershey business for their focus and hard work. Many of them listen to this call and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished and the progress we are making.","Now on to the results. Net sales increased 2.3% in the first quarter in-line with expectations. The net benefit of acquisitions and divestitures was 90 basis points and foreign currency exchange was a 50 basis points headwind. Organic, constant currency net sales growth of approximately 2% was driven by a longer Easter season and international growth, which was partially offset by our SKU rationalization program.","We continue to make good progress against our margin improvement plans, which contributed to gross margin expansion of 80 basis points in the quarter versus the same period in 2018. This was slightly ahead of our expectations, driven by incremental efficiencies from our text complexity reduction efforts. These gross margin gains along our solid sales performance drove quality EPS growth of plus 12.8% in the first quarter. This was above expectation driven by the stronger than anticipated gross margin as well as the timing of investments.","Our key initiatives for this year are progressing well and we remain confident that our balanced plans will enable us to accelerate our U.S. CMG performance, deliver our acquisition models for amplifying pirate brands and maintain our international business momentum.","Net price realization was up slightly in the quarter, in line with expectations. Consistent with previous guidance we anticipate the net benefit of pricing to build over the course of the year, and current retail pricing trends are reflecting this acceleration.","Recall our Easter season, which had a meaningful impact on sales in the first quarter, was not priced. Additionally, promotional timing events related to Amplify, Pirate Brands and international resulted in a modest first quarter headwinds.","Our U.S. business excluding recent acquisitions delivered net price realization of 50 basis points in the quarter. As we shared earlier this year the later Easter is impacting recent retail performance. Per IRI year-to-date Hershey candy, mint and gum\u2019s retail sales decreased 6% versus overall category declines of 5.4% through April 14. This resulted in a share loss of approximately 20 basis points in-line with our expectations.","We expect our retail sales and share performance to improve in the coming weeks as the full Easter season is reported. As is typically the case with a late Easter we do anticipate some softness in May retail sales as consumers enjoy their Easter candy and make slightly fewer everyday purchases. This is accounted for in our guidance as part of the net increments impact from the long season.","Preliminary results indicate these strong Easter season for both the category and Hershey. Hershey retail takeaway grew about 15% to 20% resulting in an anticipated seasonal share gain of approximately 150 basis points. This was driven by a strong focus on our core brands, purposeful innovation and exceptional retail execution.","Reese and Cadbury are the top two brands in the category during the Easter season with a combined market share of over 25%. This share is greater than the next six brands combined and we had one of the top selling new items of the season with our Cadbury shimmer egg innovation, which contributed even stronger growth and consumer engagement this year.","A special thank you to all our employees who helped contribute to the success of this seasons. Another key initiative for us this year is the renovation of our chocolate package candy bags, which has just begun to execute at select retailers. This transformation not only increases branding and competitiveness but also enables us to secure incremental shelf space in store. Early results are encouraging and we will remain focused on this transition in the coming months.","Our Reese's Thins innovation is off to a solid start and is generating strong consumer engagement. We are supporting this launch with both paid and earned media as well as merchandising both in-store and online. Current distribution is building and we expect sales to continue to accelerate in the coming weeks.","We are also excited about our summer Reese's lovers promotion which shifts primarily in the second quarter. Our activation of this plan in and out instant consumable promotion in late March generated the largest amount of earned impressions ever for one of our announcements.","Our nearly $4 billion earned impressions were three times the amount our competition achieved during the same period. This is a tremendous advantage for us that speaks to the power of this brand and our ability to leverage multiple models to effectively and efficiently drive consumer engagement and grow sales. ","And this week, after much media speculation, we confirmed that Kit Kat is launching a new product nationwide in December of 2019. Kit Kat Duos Mint + Dark Chocolate is the first permanent Kit Kat flavor in the U.S. in almost a decade. This item will feature a mash-up of two iconic flavors, with mint cream on top and dark chocolate on the bottom surrounding the light and crispy wafer. More to come on this later in the year.","And as I've shared before, we're leveraging new media capabilities and models to support our portfolio in more efficient ways. Earned impressions are a key piece of this, along with targeted media and more efficient content production. This is enabling us to support our brands in a more cost-effective manner. In the first quarter of 2019, 12 of our U.S. confection brands that represent approximately 90% of our sales had media support. ","Our paid consumer impressions for these brands increased double digits, with only a slight increase in spend. We will continue to leverage this model and support the breadth of the portfolio throughout the remainder of the year. We expect dollar investment to accelerate as we move through the year due to the timing of innovations, the lapping of our media efficiency gains from last year as well as incremental investments supported by our gross margin expansion.","Our e-commerce business continues to show strong growth. In the first quarter, our e-commerce net sales grew almost 50%, and our online chocolate share grew 120 basis points at our key customers. We remain focused on winning search and having the right content and portfolio for this channel.","Now for an update on our Amplify and Pirate Brands acquisitions. Both are delivering solid growth and are on track to achieve our financial targets. Per IRI, Skinny Pop ready-to-eat popcorn is growing over 11% year-to-date through April 14, resulting in a share gain of over 100 basis points.","Our focus on improving distribution and shelf placement is resulting in consistent gains in household penetration. We have a new marketing campaign launching in Q2 to help continue this strong momentum. We successfully transitioned selling responsibilities for Pirate Brands to our Amplify team in the first quarter. We remain focused on leveraging the same capabilities we use for Skinny Pop to optimize distribution and shelf placement to drive growth.","Recent retail sales growth has slowed slightly due to distribution losses associated with the transition, but we are confident these trends will improve as we assume whole selling responsibilities.","Now for an update on our international business. Constant currency organic sales grew 3.5% in the first quarter. And we continued to demonstrate disciplined investment, resulting in segment operating income growth of 14.5% versus prior year.","In India, our Kisses launch is off to a good start and pacing ahead of all key metrics. Both consumer and customer acceptance have been strong, and we remain optimistic that this platform can be expanded to additional regions in the future.","Our Kisses brand is also seeing strength in Mexico behind our Seleccion Especial gifting platform. Digital advertising, in-store exhibitions and sampling all helped to recruit new consumers to the brand and drive growth at two times the category level. This is a great example of a differentiated product proposition. This is driving not only a premium price point but at accretive margins.","So we have good momentum across all of our key strategies, with strong financial results in the first quarter. We remain committed to delivering balanced growth today while making key investments in our brands and capabilities to take the business to the next level. The organizational changes we announced last week will enable us to continue this good progress.","I'm excited that Steve Voskuil will be joining Hershey as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer next month. Steve is a seasoned executive with a wide variety of experiences, working in CPG both in the U.S. and international markets. And he brings a broad financial management leadership with the right blend of strategic, operational and transformative expertise that will help accelerate Hershey's growth agenda. Rohit Grover has been promoted to President, International. With more than 20 years of experience working in nearly all of Hershey's international markets, Rohit has a proven track record of transforming businesses and cultures to drive growth and profitability.","Most recently, he designed and led the turnarounds of Hershey's China business including restructuring the portfolio and operating model which has been the largest contributor to our recent international profitability improvements. Jason Reiman has been promoted to Senior Vice President, Chief Supply Chain Officer. Also a veteran of Hershey for more than 25 years, Jason has operated in senior executive roles leading all aspects of the supply chain including manufacturing, engineering, supply chain planning and logistics in the U.S. and international while delivering superior quality, customer service, margin expansion and growth for the business.","And finally, given the increasing importance of our digital transformation to our future growth aspirations, Terry O\u2019Day will transition to full-time leadership of our information technology initiatives. He will continue to lead our ERP transformation, which remains on track. These changes are a testament to Hershey's talent development and succession planning and a great balance of exceptional internal and external seasoned leaders that I am confident will help take our business to the next level. Thank you to Steven Schiller and Patricia for all their contributions to our success over the past several years.","And now I'll turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results.","Patricia Little","Thank you, Michele. Good morning, everyone. First quarter net sales of $2.02 billion increased 2.3% versus the same period last year, including a 90 basis point benefit from acquisitions, partially offset by a 50 basis point headwind from foreign currency translation. Volume and net price realization increased by 1.7 points and 0.2 points, respectively. These results are in line with our expectations.","Adjusted earnings per share-diluted were $1.59, an increase of 12.8% versus the same period last year. This was driven by volume growth, gross margin expansion as well as marketing and administrative expense efficiencies and shifts. By segment, North America net sales increased 3.2% versus the same period last year. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 1.6 point benefit. This includes one additional month of Amplify versus the prior year period, four months of Pirate Brands sales as we transition financial reporting into Hershey\u2019s system and to fewer months of Tyrrells sales versus the prior year.","Volume was a 1.4 point benefit, driven primarily by a longer Easter season. Net price realization was a 0.4 point benefit and foreign currency exchange was a 20 basis point headwind. All of these results were consistent with expectations. North America gross margins expanded 60 basis points driven by favorable commodities, volume and insourcing of key Easter items, which was a discrete benefit of approximately 20 basis points only in the first quarter. Additionally, we benefited from cost savings from our complexity reduction efforts which were slightly ahead of expectations.","We continue to expect gross margin expansion to build as we progress through the year as net price realization increases. North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased 1.1% in the quarter. Media and production efficiency gains enabled by new capabilities drove double-digit consumer impression growth with only modest dollar spend increases. We expect dollar investment to accelerate as we move through the year due to the timing of innovation as well as the lapping of last year's media efficiency gains.","First quarter total International and Other segment net sales decreased 4.9% including headwinds of 4.6 and 3.5 points from divestitures and foreign currency exchange, respectively. Organic constant currency net sales increased 3.5%. Volume increased 4.3 points, offset partially by net negative price realization of 0.8 points. Organic constant currency net sales in our focus markets, Mexico, Brazil, India and China, grew 3% versus the first quarter of 2018.","This growth was slightly below 2018 levels driven primarily by inventory volatility in the first quarter of 2018. We expect that year to go organic growth will be comparable to full year 2018 levels. International and Other advertising and related consumer marketing declined 14%, in line with our expectations as we continue to right-size our investments to drive more profitable growth.","Total Hershey adjusted gross profit increased 4%, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 45.7%, an increase of 80 basis points versus the first quarter last year. These gains were driven by favorable commodities, volume, efficiencies from our complexity reduction initiatives as well as margin for growth savings from our international markets. First quarter adjusted operating profit of $171 million resulted in operating profit margin of 23.3%, an increase of 160 basis points versus the first quarter of 2018.","Gross margin gains and continued SG&A discipline drove favorable operating profit results. Moving down to P&L. Interest expense of $37 million increased $8 million versus Q1 last year, driven by incremental debt associated with recent acquisitions. Full year 2019 interest expense is expected to be in the $150 million to $160 million range, in line with our previously stated guidance.","The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 22% versus 24.9% in the year-ago period. These gains were driven by tax reform regulation releases, benefits of employee share-based payments and continued use of investment tax credits versus the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be approximately 17%.","First quarter other expense was $6 million, an increase of $4 million. There is no change to our full year 2019 estimate of approximately $105 million to $115 million. This reflects a higher investment in tax credit as well as additional expense associated with our pension assets due to December's 2018 stock market performance relative to our long-term asset return assumptions.","For the first quarter of 2019, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately $210 million. The company repurchased $150 million of common shares in the first quarter. This completes the October 2017 $100 million authorization while $410 million remain on the July 2018 $500 million authorization. We also repurchased $49 million of common shares in connection with the exercise of stock options. Total capital additions including software were $93 million in the first quarter.","For the full year 2019, we continue to estimate that CapEx will be in the $330 million to $350 million range. As a percent of net sales, this remains slightly higher than our long-term target as we continue to implement our new ERP system and to invest in core capacity. We continue to return cash to our shareholders, the first quarter dividends of $146 million. This was our 357th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock.","To summarize for the full year, there's no change to our full year reported net sales outlook. We continue to expect net sales to increase 1% to 3%, including approximately 0.5 point net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures. We expect full year FX impact to be negligible based on current exchange rates. Reported net sales growth is expected to be slightly higher in the second half due to the negative impact of divestitures and FX in the first half.","Organic net sales growth is anticipated to be slightly higher in the first half due to the impact of Easter. Full year reported earnings per share diluted are expected to be in the $5.50 to $5.60 range. There's no change to our full year adjusted earnings per share diluted range of $5.63 to $5.74, an increase of 5% to 7% last year. Due to the gaining of sales growth, gross margin gains and the timing of promotions and investments, we anticipate strongest EPS growth in Q1 and Q4.","We continue to take a balanced and disciplined approach to building our brands and evolving our business model for the future. We have strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet that give us flexibility to make the necessary investments to drive long-term shareholder value. That concludes my financial discussion, but before I turn it over to Michele, I just want to say that working with Michele and all of our Hershey colleagues has been an absolute joy.","One of the reasons I feel so upbeat at the end of my Hershey time is the confidence I have in this business and in the team to take the company to the next level. I know Steve will be a great partner to Michele and the rest of the team in delivering against our aspirations and making an already great P&L even stronger.","Michele Buck","Thanks, Patricia. I am pleased with our strong start to the year. The actions we are taking to drive core confection momentum, to capture growth via incremental portfolios and regions and to invest in our brands and capabilities will continue to drive this business forward. I believe this dynamic environment and accelerated pace of change creates tremendous opportunities for us to engage with our consumers in new and innovative ways to grow today and into the future.","We remain focused on achieving balanced sales and earnings growth to continue delivering peer-leading shareholder returns. We have a portfolio of beloved brands and an amazing team of individuals that are excited and proud to come to work every day.","We are pleased with the progress we are making but we also have a healthy degree of dissatisfaction that drives us to continue pushing to elevate the business to the next level. And we are committed to doing this in a way that is consistent with our values and purpose. Patricia, Melissa and I are now available to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go ahead and take our first question from Ken Goldman [JPMorgan]. Your line is now open.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning.","Michele Buck","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Goldman","Good morning. Thanks for everything, Patricia and best of luck in your next endeavors.","Patricia Little","Thank you.","Ken Goldman","Two for me. Michele, I think your previous guidance suggested that Easter would benefit annual sales by about 50 basis points, which implies about 200 for the first quarter. I didn't hear a number in your prepared remarks. Maybe I just missed it. But is it reasonable for us to think that Easter helped the first quarter by around 200 basis points on the top line?","Michele Buck","Yes. That is reasonable. The growth in the first quarter, definitely driven by Easter and our international business.","Ken Goldman","Okay. Thank you for that. And then I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but you did just give some cadence. So I wanted to ask a follow-up to that. I guess, I'll just ask the question directly. The Street in the \u2013 for the second quarter is looking for a bit under $1.8 billion in sales, around $350 million in EBIT or operating income, are these numbers really unreasonable to you given the Easter timing headwind? I just wanted to get a sense of whether the Street is, at least modeling this within sort of the range of what you're thinking.","Michele Buck","Patricia, do you want to?","Patricia Little","Ken, again we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, so I would absolutely not comment on specific numbers that the Street does have in their model. We were just trying to give you some help because with Easter, FX and divestitures, we just really want to help you understand the cadence of our sales kind of that is impacting first half, second half and then a little bit about just the rhythm of EPS that we expect. And we don't have anything further to say and certainly no comments on specific numbers that the Street is modeling.","Ken Goldman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Bryan Spillane [Bank of America]. Your line is now open.","Bryan Spillane","Good morning, everyone.","Michele Buck","Good morning.","Bryan Spillane","Just wanted to ask \u2013 tie together, I guess, a couple of comments around gross profits and gross margins. And you talked about it maybe building more later in the year, but \u2013 and you also pulled in a little bit of the benefit from insourcing some of the Easter product. So can you give us a sense of, I guess, is like a 60 basis point gross margin expansion as a basis point year-over-year sort of what you would see maybe for the balance of the year or for the full year? Or is this quarter maybe the strongest in terms of gross margin performance? Just trying to get a sense of where gross margins land for the year.","Michele Buck","So this is Michele. We feel good about the progress we're making on gross margin and we expect that our full year gross margin expansion will be at or slightly above what we delivered in the first quarter. So as you mentioned, there was the discrete benefit of about 20 basis points, so I think thinking about 60 as kind of the run \u2013 the base run rate is a good way to think about it. Recall that we will get more price realization in the second quarter with our new packaged candy bags. There's also some packaging costs which are limiting the amount of that gross margin, but as we go through the year, we anticipate that, that gross margin will ramp up a bit off of the run rate that you mentioned. Is that helpful?","Bryan Spillane","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Robert Moskow [Credit Suisse]. Your line is now open.","Robert Moskow","That Bryan Spillane is a smart guy. He took my question, but let me try a different one. Can you talk about the market share losses in the first quarter, which was just 20 basis points? And I guess I thought I heard you say that you picked it up in the early phases of Easter, I guess, related to your Easter seasonal activity. Can you talk a little bit more broadly about just candy, mint and gum in general; your innovation plans? Is that enough to get you back into a pattern of share gains overall for the year or for next year? I think most people's perceptions of the innovation pipeline is it's okay, not super; and a lot of concerns about competitive incursion from Mars and Ferrero. Thanks.","Michele Buck","Sure. So Rob, our year-to-date share is in line with our expectations. We expected a little bit of a slower start on share due to the timing of some of our innovation and our promotions, but we continue, as you look at the trend that you're seeing in share, with a continuous kind of improvement in trend as we go through the first quarter here. You're going to see that continue. As we get through Easter, we think that you'll see the retail takeaway. The share and the sales kind of true up and line up together.","And then obviously, following that, we have some of our biggest programs for the year, including the chocolate-packaged candy reinvention as well as Reese's Thins and the Reese's lovers activations. So we've got a pretty balanced plan with a lot of activation, but from a retail takeaway perspective, more of that begins to hit Q2 and beyond for the year. And we're continuing to drive a balanced approach to driving our business.","We feel great about the innovation we have this year with the chocolate-packaged candy packaging effort, which is about $0.5 billion in the portfolio; Reese's Thins and Reese's lovers promotion, our largest brands by far; and then obviously just announcing a new item within Kit Kat, one of our other core brands.","So we believe we do best when we have a really balanced approach where we are winning on multiple levers which include seasons, pricing, innovation, good marketing on the core. And we're going to continue to drive that. And we anticipate that, as much as there is a lot of competitive innovation, we think that overall it'll be in line in total with prior years.","Robert Moskow","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jonathan Feeney [Consumer Edge]. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you so much and good morning. Two questions from me. The Easter share you quoted earlier, I think, was 150 basis points. Is that Easter share on a through April 14 basis? Or is that what you know about the totality of Easter this year versus the totality of Easter last year, about how you're comparing with some non-Easter weeks in that number, that share number, first of all? And second of all, yes, I know that there's been a lot going on from a takeaway standpoint. What \u2013 I mean what level \u2013 you gave us a year-to-date takeaway number, and clearly, you're way outperforming that.","In the six days approaching through that, it's not in that takeaway number. What's a good U.S. CMG takeaway number mid-May that would give us the sense that you are on track towards your plan? Like what is that number so I understand that you guys are on track to \u2013 for the next months? Thank you very much.","Michele Buck","So let me start with your question around Easter. The share gain that I quoted is what we anticipate for the full season based on what we know year-to-date and across the business. And that is really looking full Easter this year versus full Easter last year. Relative to takeaway, somewhere in that 1.5% to 2% range on a year-to-date basis, I'd say, will be a good benchmark.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from Steven Strycula [UBS]. Your line is now open.","Steven Strycula","Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. ","Michele Buck","Thank you.","Steven Strycula","So this Easter shift is really breaking my calculator here. I'm trying to figure a few things out, but Patricia, I was hoping you'd help me out here a little bit as I think about the organic [Audio Dip] think about how that flows through the year directionally is the first part of my question.","Patricia Little","Steve, you broke up a little bit. I'm sorry. You were just asking about what the organic sales were at Easter in the quarter.","Steven Strycula","Yes, just what the cadence we should think about throughout the balance of the year. I think it's a little bit noisy because of Easter. And a lot of investors have been asking me this morning just how to think about front half versus back half in 2Q. And then I've got a follow up.","Patricia Little","Yes. So as we said, we expect that, because of that Easter, we will \u2013 we would expect that on an organic basis it will be higher in the first half than into the second half, just because of the long Easter. Is that what you were getting at? I mean there were again\u2026","Steven Strycula","Thank you for that.","Patricia Little","Okay. Yes. Think about it as the organic growth was about 2% in the quarter. I mean we had\u2026","Steven Strycula","Sure, yes. I think there's some background noise, but so the other fundamental question I had was \u2013 to piggyback off of Rob Moskow's question, is to think about the incrementality of innovation this year relative to prior cycles that you guys have had. How do you think about what you're bringing to market; and how that compares against Cookie Layer Crunch, Hershey's Gold? And what's so different about the packaging this year that it should drive better conversion at retail relative to the past? Thank you.","Michele Buck","Yes. So I feel really good about our innovation this year. And I will say, if I look historically, I think frequently the best and more sustainable innovation we've had is when we are really focused on either improving our core or staying close to the core with a key, purposeful benefit. So when I think about the chocolate-packaged candy, it gives us a notable improvement in shelf awareness in a category that is a very challenged category to shop.","So I think the first benefit starts with that, and then second in terms of the usability of the package at home. So it's really a lift across a very big piece of business that is a very closed-end product improvement benefit. And I think that tends to \u2013 those types of things tend to perform very well for us. Reese's Thins, likewise, it is a variation of a Reese's cup with a new shape.","And as we think about our portfolio, one of the interesting things about Reese's is we have all different kinds of cups and different shapes and different ratios of chocolate to peanut butter, and everybody has their favorite. And thins offers a benefit of permissibility and a totally different eating experience on our biggest core brand. So that proximity to the core tends to lead to a more sustainable approach. So where we find some of those innovations, I feel \u2013 I tend to feel the best about those. So I'm pretty bullish on what we have for this year.","Steven Strycula","Okay thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from David Driscoll. Your line is now open.","David Driscoll","Great, thank you and good morning everybody.","Michele Buck","Good morning, David.","David Driscoll","Patricia, I just wanted to say thank you so much. It's been a pleasure to work with you, and we wish you all the best. On to the \u2013 I want to follow up on some of the questions related to the top line. So just to be super clear: With CMG takeaway down 6% in the Q1, shipment is up 1.6%, excluding M&A. Volume is a big driver there at 1.4 points.","Is there any implication to the second quarter? Is there any shipment pull forward into Q1 that would affect Q2 because of those numbers?","Michele Buck","David, there's not. If you think about the way Easter and the seasons work, especially given the timing this year, you're shipping to season in the quarter before a lot of the takeaway occurs. So there's a little bit of a \u2013 the disconnect between the shipments and the takeaway, but there is no pull forward. It's just the natural flow of how that business works that you're shipping. And then some of the biggest takeaway for the season comes in the couple weeks, those two weeks right before the day of the holiday.","And so that's really the dynamic. And if you look at past years, you'll see that \u2013 every year, that's the way it works.","Patricia Little","So again, David, you can just expect that, by the end of April, the share, the takeaway and the sales will all be trued up together.","David Driscoll","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. My last question is just on pricing. You have expectations that pricing is going to increase as the quarters go forward. Has retail acceptance of your pricing plans been \u2013 if it did happen to the fullest extent? Do you have any concerns about the implementation on pricing, whether it's the list price increase or whether it's getting your new packaging on shelf? Because everything on the pricing plan kind of full steam ahead.","Michele Buck","Yes, everything relative to the pricing is working and coming in exactly as we expected. The retail price points that we're seeing, in terms of the phasing for the year \u2013 remember Easter wasn't priced. So that's a big piece that, as we get later through the year, is really where the pricing impact kicks in. We've looked at price points, retail price points; where we are in our elasticity and conversion model. And that's in line with what we expected as well, so all looking good.","DavidDriscoll","Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it along.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Baumgartner. Your line is now open.","John Baumgartner","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele, it sounds as though the momentum around the media impressions is fairly solid, but I guess my question is really more about the conversion on those because, I mean, you've been working through the efficiencies for a while, but the share in chocolate is still down pretty consistently. And I know your brands are always very responsive to traditional media, but maybe digital is showing as less impactful. So I mean, are you seeing any data points that would suggest otherwise? I mean I'm just trying to square the media shift with the market share we see in the Nielsen data.","Michele Buck","We continue to optimize the right balance across earned and paid impressions; and also, within the paid, what is the optimal level of TV versus digital and getting tighter and tighter on the digital relative to addressable and programmable media that allows us to reach the exact right person. So I feel good about the progress we're making there. We continue to optimize and implement as we learn and go along the way, but we feel good that we are continuing to see strong ROIs on the spends that we have and continuing to optimize based on those.","John Baumgartner","And do you have a sense kind of where digital is right now as a percent of the total bucket and where, I guess, the long-term target is?","Michele Buck","So I want to say digital is about 40% of our total media investment. And in terms of the long-term target, I would say we continue to learn as we go, but at this point in time we believe that mainstream media, given our very broad household penetration, will continue to be an important part of our mix given it's pretty efficient media. And within digital and some of the capabilities of old in terms of more capability about \u2013 around programmable, we'll continue to adjust to that, but there's a lot of blurring of the lines in terms of playing across the entire ","John Baumgartner","Okay, thanks Michele.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Rob Dickerson. Your line is now open.","Rob Dickerson","Great, thank you. Two quick questions. First question was just on kind of organic sales cadence again for the year. I think you just said in the remarks that you\u2019d expect basically organic sales to be a little bit faster in growth terms in the first half versus second half. It sounds like second half rate would get more of the pricing but less than a mix effect from the new innovation or at least the stand-up bags and the thins, so I\u2019m just curious. If there is to be more pricing in the back half of the year, our organic sales will be slower, I\u2019m assuming, kind of back of Easter. I \u2013 are \u2013 does that imply that your models are baking in some material volume elasticity in Q3 and Q4? Or is it more just an Easter effect in Q1 versus what you expect in the back half?","Michele Buck","No. Our models do bake in that elasticity in the second half. When we take a price increase, that\u2019s historically how it works. And the data we have based on history is exactly what we are banking on. It\u2019s also what we\u2019re seeing year-to-date where prices have hit, but you\u2019re absolutely right. In the year we take pricing, you see a big increase in the amount of our revenue that comes from pricing and you take a hit on volume as the conversion of that builds.","Rob Dickerson","Okay. Great. And then just in terms of margin, I think you said you\u2019d expect gross margin to build just given partially the pricing benefit as you move through the year. Operating margin was up almost 150 basis points in Q1. Should we also expect the operating margin to build throughout the year? Or I\u2019m assuming, given higher SM&A and brand investment, that operating margin would likely be expanding but at a slower rate relative to gross margin for the remainder of the year. That\u2019s all.","Michele Buck","Yes. I would say no. That should not be your expectations. There can be a lot of noise on a quarterly basis. And no. Well, there should be a build in gross margin. Do not think about operating margin that way.","Rob Dickerson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ken Zaslow. Your line is now open.","Ken Zaslow","Hi, good morning everyone. Just have a question on clarity. I think I\u2019m just confused. I think you said in the quarter that your expectation's where you thought it was on both sales and EPS. And then in the last quarter, you said that your sales accelerate through the second half. Now I think you \u2013 and your sales growth obviously was 2.3%. Your guidance is 1% to 3%. But now you are saying that the first and fourth quarter are going to be the highest. What changed? Did nothing changed? And I just don't understand. I'm sorry.","Michele Buck","So relative to sales, we said our sales was in line with our expectations ","Ken Zaslow","It was fourth quarter. It's supposed to build through the year, right?","Patricia Little","So it might be the confusion between our reported net sales growth, where it's going to be higher in the second half due to divestitures which we talked about. And then the organic piece is higher in the first half due to Easter. And on the EPS side, we did say that \u2013 all right. And then on the EPS, it was higher than we expected, as we said on this call.","Michele Buck","Q1 was higher than expected.","Ken Zaslow","And my real question is can you talk about your e-commerce progress? What share do you want to get to? Where are you? How far are you away from what share you're looking to get and get to? And then what is the difference between your digital spending three, four years ago and now? And where do you expect that to get? And I'll leave it there.","Michele Buck","So, I think we want to continue to drive share and gain share in e-commerce. I think the benchmark that we would look at is we would want to be at least comparable to our bricks-and-mortar business, but I would say that I also think there's an opportunity with our capabilities for us to have higher share than bricks and mortars. So that's certainly what we are shooting for. And we're pleased that, in each of the past several years, we've continued to gain over 100 basis points of share on our chocolate business in e- commerce. So we want to capture as much share as we can.","Ken Zaslow","And in your spending. What percentage of your spending is on digital? And where do you expect that to go? And I'll leave it there. ","Michele Buck","Well, for total digital advertising, from a media perspective, it's about 40%, if we just look at media. Obviously, there are a lot of other investments in terms of resources, people, all of that.","Ken Zaslow","Thank you.","Operator","There are questions at this time. I will turn the call back to our speakers for any additional remarks. ","Melissa Poole","Thank you for joining us this morning. We'll be available throughout the day for any additional questions you may have.","Operator","This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time."],"10674":["The Hershey (NYSE:HSY) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 31, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Mark K. Pogharian - Director of Investor Relations","John P.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you, Phyllis. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Bert Alfonso, Senior Vice President and CFO; and I will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We also welcome those of you listening in on the webcast.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements, which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2011 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP, rather the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss 2012 fourth quarter results excluding net pretax charges of $24.3 million or $0.08 per share diluted, primarily related to costs associated with the Project Next Century, non-service-related pension expense and integration costs for the Brookside Foods acquisition. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","John P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. I'm pleased with Hershey's fourth quarter and full year financial and marketplace results, which represent a solid end to another good year. We accomplished our 2012 objectives while growing adjusted EPS 14.5%, our fourth consecutive year of double-digit percentage increases. We continue to build and execute our consumer-centric business model and are creating a virtuous cycle that is delivering predictable, profitable and sustainable results. We've accelerated profitable organic sales growth, increased our leadership position in the U.S. marketplace, boosted margins and returns and delivered record profitability. Outside of the U.S. and Canada our businesses continue to grow and, barring any dramatic changes related to foreign currency, we're on a path to achieve net sales of $1 billion in these markets by the end of 2014. We're operating from a position of strength. We believe there are far more opportunities ahead than successes behind us because at The Hershey Company, the future is not where we're headed but what we're creating.","Now for an overview of the U.S. candy, mint and gum category. Growth was solid in 2012 and within the 3% to 4% historical growth rate. As has been the case for the last few years, the gum category has been challenged. Excluding a decline of minus 5.5% for the gum category this year, chocolate, sweets and refreshment grew a combined 5.2% in 2012. This increase outpaced other snack alternatives such as salty snacks, cookies and crackers.","The chocolates, sweets and refreshment categories continue to grow driven by investments in the form of both innovation and advertising. The category is performing well with good brand-building efforts across many brands, creating excitement, trial and emotional connectivity between brands and consumers in our category. As a result, looking forward in 2013, we would expect the CMG category growth to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% range.","For the full year 2012, Hershey's net sales increased 9.3% and were relatively balanced between net price realization and volume, including the Brookside acquisition. In the fourth quarter, net sales, excluding Brookside and FX, increased 9.3%, slightly better than our expectation, driven by volume growth of 7%. As expected with last year's pricing action essentially behind us, core brand volume growth was more than double the contribution from new products.","From a profitability perspective, overall earnings were in line with our expectations, although SG&A spending was a bit higher as our financial flexibility enabled us to make some investments to ensure we ended the year strong and enter 2013 with momentum. This is reflected in our fourth quarter marketplace performance as we gained market share in every segment, that's chocolate, sweets and refreshments, and gum.","In terms of Hershey's marketplace performance, let me start with Halloween. Halloween results were in line with expectations. The late October storm that affected the East Coast did not have a material impact on our overall Halloween results. Retail sell-through was solid, and we gained 0.8 share points in this important season.","Now for some details on overall fourth quarter marketplace performance. Hershey CMG retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending December 29, 2012, in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business was up 7%. This resulted in a 1.2 point market share again. As a reminder, this is xAOC+C-store data consisting of the food, drug, mass x and C-store channels, plus the inclusion of Walmart, partial Dollar, club and the military channels. For the full year, Hershey U.S. retail takeaway and market share was up 5.7% or 0.6 points, respectively.","CMG fourth quarter category growth in the xAOC+C channels was up 2.6%. As I mentioned earlier, gum continues to be a drag; and excluding it, the chocolate, sweets and refreshment categories are up a combined 4.1%. Importantly, CMG category growth sequentially improved in the traditional FDMx channels from flattish in Q3 to plus 1.4% in Q4. As has been the case all year long, Hershey has outperformed the CMG category in the FDMx channels with retail takeaway of plus 4.8%, resulting in a gain of one full market share point in 2012.","Fourth quarter xAOC+C-store chocolate category growth was up plus 4.5%. Hershey's xAOC+C-store chocolate retail takeaway was up plus 5.8% resulting in a gain of 0.5 points of chocolate market share. Core brands such as Reese's, Kit Kat, Kisses and ROLO all gained share.","Fourth quarter xAOC+C-store non-chocolate category growth was up plus 2.5%. Hershey's non-chocolate xAOC+C-store retail takeaway was up 12.6%, resulting in a market share gain of 1.2 points. Our performance here continues to be driven by Jolly Rancher innovation and Twizzlers. In the C-store channel, CMG fourth quarter category growth was plus 2.7% and was impacted by the double-digit percentage decline in the gum category.","Total Hershey C-store performance was strong with takeaway of 9.8%, resulting in a share gain of 2.1 points. Our C-store performance was driven by chocolate and mint retail takeaway of 11.2% and 15.2%.","As we look to 2013, we have many exciting products, promotions, programs and merchandising in place across all channels, including our annual Reese's NCAA basketball program; a Twizzler tie-in with the upcoming Superman movie; various promotions with the pop band, Gym Class Heroes, that will focus on the Jolly Rancher and Twizzlers brands; increased distribution in in-store merchandising and programming of Hershey's S'mores; and the launch of many new products to include Kit Kat Minis, Twizzlers Bites, Jolly Rancher Bites and yet to be announced new products that we are very excited about. We continue to feel very good about the direction of our core U.S. business as we are bringing innovative news, variety and excitement to the category. We'll support our core business in the aforementioned initiatives with coordinated in-store programming, merchandising and advertising that will drive trial, repeat and increased velocity.","I'm also excited about the broader launch of Brookside products into the FDMx channels. Brookside has increased sales at a compound annual growth rate of about 20% over the last several years. With our additional manufacturing capacity now online, Brookside 2013 net sales growth will exceed this historical CAGR. Three SKUs in a standup, 7-ounce, resealable pouch will begin shipping to retailers -- began shipping to retailers a few weeks ago.","Our research indicates strong appeal among many of the consumers identified within our confectionery demand landscape. Therefore, we believe Brookside will attract new consumers to the confectionery category by focusing on unmet consumer needs. Once targeted ACV is achieved, year-round TV advertising will begin. We expect this to be sometime in late February, as well as high-value FSI coupons, sampling at key customers and significant in-store merchandising and programming. Note that we'll also increase Brookside advertising in Canada, where a national TV campaign will begin in July.","Our solid position in the U.S. marketplace continues to give us the financial flexibility to invest in key international markets. In China, Brazil and Mexico, we made solid progress in 2012. Net sales in these markets were all above plan with local currency sales up double digits on a percentage basis versus last year. However, as I stated the last couple of quarters, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in 2012, foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind. Therefore, full year 2012 sales growth outside the U.S. and Canada, including the impact of FX was 12%, below our 15% to 20% target. In 2013, based on current exchange rates, net sales outside the U.S. and Canada will increase to 15% to 20%, keeping us on a path to reach $1 billion in net sales by the end of 2014.","Our brands are gaining distribution, trial and more importantly, repeat purchases. On-shelf velocity is increasing and will build on our momentum in 2013, and accelerate brand building investments across the board. Think about this as market research, sampling, innovation, advertising, in-store selling capabilities and so on.","In China, Hershey's Kisses and Hershey's solid chocolate globe product in the instant consumable tin are doing very well. In 2013, we'll extend the portfolio and introduce a premium Kisses Deluxe product and Hershey's Drops, and build on our fourth quarter expansion of the traditional Hershey's Milk Chocolate bar. These initiatives will be supported with sampling and advertising in the cities where we have a solid presence and distribution.","In Mexico, our chocolate business had a solid year driven by Hershey's and Kisses. Additionally, in the Mexican food channel, which includes Walmart, we became the #2 player behind Ferrero. In 2013, we'll look to build on our chocolate momentum and expand our portfolio. Pelon Pelo Rico is also doing very well, with franchise growth of nearly 25% in 2012. Pelon is primarily sold in the traditional trade where we have national distribution, but the total points are below the industry average; hence, in 2013, we're targeting to increase our reach.","In Brazil, our chocolate business grew at a pace more than double the category growth. Market share was up 0.4 points, driven by Hershey's tablet bar and the Big Kiss. In 2013, we'll broadly launch Hershey's  Mais, a chocolate-covered wafer product, into national accounts, and we'll support it as well as the base business with significantly higher media and brand-building initiatives.","We spend much of our time talking about Mexico, Brazil and China, but there are a lot of great things going on in many other geographies as well. In our export markets, velocity at retail is up and we continue to increase distribution. And in Canada, the Reese brand more than solidified itself as the #1 chocolate brand in the country, driven by the continued growth of Reese Minis, while the sweets and refreshment portfolio gained 1.4 market share points driven by solid gains for Twizzlers, Jolly Rancher and Ice Breakers.","Given the exciting activity across the company in 2013, as well as our commitment to building international capabilities, advertising and SM&A are expected to increase at a rate greater than net sales. These disciplined investments will benefit the company over the near and long term.","Now to wrap up. I'm very pleased with our 2012 performance. In the U.S, volume trends continue to progress, and we expect that will also be the case in 2013 given our planned investments in advertising, consumer promotions and innovation. Bert will provide further details, but gross margin gains in 2013 will give us the financial flexibility to make the accelerated SM&A investments I discussed earlier. Therefore, we expect 2013 net sales growth of 5% to 7%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and we anticipate adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of 10% to 12% within the $3.56 to $3.63 range.","I'll now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some additional detail on our financial results.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Thanks, J.P., and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter consolidated net sales of $1.75 billion increased 11.7% versus the prior year, slightly greater than our expectation. Our strong top line results allowed us to be flexible in our approach to category and brand-building investments throughout 2012, especially in the fourth quarter. As expected, organic core brand volume trends sequentially improved and were the primary driver of our fourth quarter net sales growth. Volume, excluding the Brookside acquisition, was a 7-point benefit in the quarter. In addition, net price realization and foreign currency exchange rates were a 2.3 and 0.3-point benefit, respectively.","Profitability improved as fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.74 increased 5.7% versus last year. Price realization and supply chain productivity was partially offset by increased investments and go-to-market capabilities and marketing related investments.","For the full year, net sales increased 9.3%, or 9.8% on a constant currency basis, led by net price realization of 5.7 points resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $3.24, an increase of 14.5% versus last year.","J.P. provided details on our marketplace performance, so I'll focus on a review of the P&L and balance sheet starting with gross margin. During the fourth quarter, adjusted gross margin was 43.1% on -- a 140-point increase over the prior year. This margin improvement was driven by net price realization, supply chain productivity and cost saving initiatives. Gross margin gains were partially offset by higher input costs of about $35 million. For the full year 2012, adjusted gross margin was 43.8% versus 42.4% in 2011, also an increase of 140 basis points. Higher net price realization and productivity gains were partially offset by higher input costs.","Fourth quarter adjusted EBIT increased 7.4% resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin of 15.8%, a 60-point decline versus last year. The decline was primarily due to the timing of SM&A investments. Advertising spending increased 27% in the fourth quarter, slightly greater than our expectation of a 20% increase as we took advantage of media-buying opportunities to support our core brands. As a result, full year 2012 advertising increased 15.9%, greater than our outlook of 13% to 15%.","Fourth quarter SM&A expenses, excluding advertising, increased 18.8% as we stepped up our investment in selling, marketing and IDP-related capabilities in both the U.S. and key international markets. This was a considerable increase from the September year-to-date level of about 9% and slightly above what we had outlined during the last conference call.","For the full year 2012, SM&A advertising increased 11.9%, about in line with our double-digit expectation. Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 12.7%, with adjusted EBIT margin up 60 basis points to 18.5% from 17.9%. The increase was driven by solid net sales growth partially offset by higher input and supply chain costs and investments in SM&A.","Now let me provide a brief update on our international businesses. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, fourth quarter international reported net sales were up 20% driven by solid double-digit percentage increases in China, Mexico and our key export markets. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter China net sales increased more than 50% driven by base business gains and the introduction of advertising behind Hershey's solid chocolate products.","In Mexico and Brazil, fourth quarter sales were up, driven by strong investments in brand building and distribution gains. As J.P. mentioned, given the strong U.S. dollar in 2012, full year reported net sales in our businesses outside of the U.S. and Canada increased 12%, less than our 15% to 20% target. In 2013, based on current exchange rates, net sales outside the U.S. and Canada are expected to increase 15% to 20% putting us on a path to reach $1 billion in net sales by the end of 2014.","Moving down the P&L. Fourth quarter interest expense was about $23 million versus $21 million in the prior period. For the year, interest expense was in line with expectations totaling $96 million versus $92 million a year ago. In 2013, we expect interest expense to be in the $85 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 33.5%, up 130 basis points versus a year ago due to the timing of certain tax events. For the full year, the tax rate was 34.7%, down 10 basis points. In 2013, we expect the tax rate to be about the same as the full year 2012 rate although quarterly rates should be less volatile than they were last year and closer to the full year rate.","In the fourth quarter of 2012, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 227 million versus 229 million in 2011, leading to adjusted EPS per share diluted of $0.74, an increase of 5.7% versus year ago. For the full year, outstanding shares were approximately 228 million versus approximately 230 million in 2011. Adjusted EPS diluted for the full year was $3.24, an increase of 14.5%.","Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the year, net trading capital increased $24 million versus last year. This is primarily due to accounts receivable increase of $62 million resulting from higher year-over-year December sales. Our accounts receivable remained very current. In addition, inventories decreased $16 million and accounts payable increased about $22 million.","In terms of other specific cash flow items. Total company capital additions, including software, were $64 million in Q4 and $278 million for the full year. These amounts included Project Next Century capital expenditures of $7 million in the fourth quarter and $75 million in the full year. In 2013, we expect total CapEx to be about $300 million, including capital related to Project Next Century of about $15 million to $20 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $47 million in the fourth quarter, all of which was operating depreciation as there was no accelerated depreciation in the quarter. For the full year 2012, depreciation and amortization expenses were $210 million, including accelerated depreciation and amortization of $15 million. In 2013, we are forecasting total depreciation and amortization of about $200 million to $210 million.","Dividends paid during the quarter were $91 million, bringing the full year to $341 million. Also note that earlier today, we announced a regular dividend on our common stock of $0.42, our 333rd consecutive declaration. During the fourth quarter, approximately $13 million of our common shares were repurchased to replace shares issued in connection with stock option exercises. Cash on hand at the end of the year was $728 million, up $35 million versus year ago.","Now let me close by providing some context on our 2013 outlook. As J.P. outlined, we have initiatives in place that we believe will drive net sales growth across our businesses in 2013. We're confident of our plans, and we expect 2013 net sales growth of 5% to 7%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We expect our net sales gains to be driven by core brand volume growth in the U.S. and international markets, the launch of the Brookside brand in FDMx channels, innovations such as Kit Kat Minis, Twizzlers Bites, Jolly Rancher's Bites, Kisses Deluxe, Hershey's Mais and other yet to be announced products.","We have good visibility into our full year cost structure. As stated in October, gross margin will increase in 2013 driven by productivity, cost-saving initiatives and the expectation overall input cost deflation. Therefore, we expect 2013 adjusted gross margin expansion of 180 to 200 basis points. Given this financial flexibility in 2013, we will invest behind business building initiatives.","Total advertising is expected to increase approximately 20%. In the U.S., core brand advertising is expected to be about the same as last year or around 2x net sales growth. Incremental advertising in 2013 will support the Brookside launch, base business and innovation in the U.S. and key international markets. This includes a broader advertising campaign of the Hershey's brand and other core brand launches in China and Hershey's Mais in Brazil. SM&A expenses, excluding advertising, are expected to increase 9% to 11% versus last year. These investments will build on our go-to-market capabilities established over the last few years, as well as consumer insights work underway in key international markets for the 5 global brands.","Additionally, the company will continue to expand its IDP initiative, invest in international selling and marketing capabilities, and support new products, with increased levels of consumer promotion and sampling to drive trial and repeat. As a result, we have increased our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook and now expect it to increase 10% to 12% in 2013, which is greater than the previous estimate of 8% to 10%.","And before we open up for Q&A, please note the following. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, the first quarter of 2013 net sales will be impacted by a shorter Easter season in the U.S., although we will benefit from continued improvements in U.S. core brand volume trends, the launch of Brookside into FDMx channels and the international innovation that I already mentioned. As a result, we expect first quarter 2013 net sales to be within our 5% to 7% long-term target. We expect solid gross margin expansion throughout the year to drive EBIT dollar and adjusted EPS diluted growth across all quarters in 2013. However, recall the SG&A, x advertising, was about flat in the first quarter of 2012. We don't expect that to be the case in 2013, as we'll make investments in go-to-market capabilities and costs incurred related to Brookside and the international new product launches that occur early in the year.","Therefore, given all of the moving parts between last year and this year, our expectation is that first half EBIT margin will be pressured and adjusted EPS diluted growth will be greater in the second half of the year.","John P. Bilbrey","All right. Thank you, Bert. Operator, before we open the lines for Q&A, note that it's a busy day for earnings announcements. Therefore, out of respect for those companies, as well as everyone in the investment community, please limit yourself to one question as we are going to attempt to end the conference call at around 9:30 a.m.","Mark K. Pogharian","Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just one question. Brookside Farms, could you give us more detail in terms of -- of your current footprint, where you're selling any confectionery product today in North America, what percent of ACV is Brookside in already and how big do you think -- what percent of ACV do you think Brookside -- just in terms of channel. I mean, who knows what -- the consumer is obviously more difficult question. But in terms of channel, what percent of ACV is Brookside a relevant product to stock in, would you say?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, so let me just build the base real quickly. Recall that in the U.S. it was primarily in Costco when we made the acquisition and then it was available broadly across Canada, but it wasn't advertised across Canada. So as we've continued to build out the distribution in Canada, we'll be advertising it this year. And the trade reaction to the product as we've been expanding it in the U.S. has been extremely positive. We would expect it to really be in all the channels where our products are today with the exception, early on, of convenience where we haven't yet built out the packaging that we think will be appropriate for convenience, although we certainly plan to do that because we think it's a great on-the-go product. So you would expect it to look very similar to the balance of our line in 2013. And then beyond, we believe that we'll continue to build region penetration with the product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just wanted to ask about what innings you're in, in terms of the category captaincy role that I think you're now playing at maybe Walmart and some of the drug stores. As I remember it, that initiative started a few years ago. I think you got into Walmart or a large mass merchant about 2 years ago. Is there still more benefit to come from that initiative? Or are you basically sort of at the point that you want to be in terms of those -- that sales advice in those stores?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, I think that it's continuing to evolve, and we feel quite good about the progress that we've made. Just for a bit of historical perspective, we've always played an important role in terms of category captain across a meaningful percentage of our customers. With IDP specifically, which you're referencing, we continue to expand that across the largest customers, where they also have the capabilities in place for us to be able to work well together on joint business planning and research projects. So we believe this is an important cornerstone of how we go to market. We continue to learn and grow here, and we do that with our retailers at the same time. So we're quite optimistic. It's important, and we believe we'll continue to make solid gains because of those joint planning relationships.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That fourth quarter, it did look like a quarter of abnormally high shipments and marketing spending, and that happens from time to time just because of timing. Is there going to be -- is it likely that there will be a little bit of a moderation in the shipments into the first half? Or do you feel like you're in a good balance right now?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, as we look at our planning stance in 2013, and as you know, we've given guidance of 5% to 7% net sales growth, we believe that it will look pretty balanced across the quarters. We don't specifically guide to the quarters, but we think the year looks pretty balanced. We felt good about the fourth quarter, in particular, that while seasons is important to us, in the fourth quarter -- we always talk about the business in sort of thirds, and seasons being one of those. In the fourth quarter, seasons is probably about 20%. We had what we would describe as low retail inventories going into the fourth quarter. So a lot of the volume that we saw in the fourth quarter was really around our core brands and base business. Price was important to us in the fourth quarter. So as we had talked about sequential improvement across '12, we really saw that happen. And the quality of our sales in the fourth quarter, I think, was really high. So we felt good about it, and we're saying that we think the category will be between 3.5% and 4% growth in 2013. And as -- we'd like to see ourselves growing share in that environment.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And as you're building up Brookside, are you thinking -- oftentimes, these new smaller brands, it's better to let them be discovered by the type of consumers that you want for them. Are you thinking of marketing that brand differently as you expand that?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, yes, I think, David, because of the nature of the brand, you'll probably see different media types as we talk about the brand, but we expect to have a strong marketing program behind Brookside. As you know, we've got the capacity to allow the brand to grow, so we're in a good place there. And so we continue to be really excited about it, and the consumer response that we've had has been really positive as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In the -- thinking about your outlook for adjusted gross margin growth in 2013, can you speak a bit to the drivers of productivity there? Is the private being  [indiscernible] in the joint warehousing alliance? And then maybe just thinking about that going forward, can you identify any opportunities to expand that alliance outside North America?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, talking about the expansion, we gave -- obviously, gave some guidance, which we feel good about and so we're saying 180 to 200 basis points pivoting off of where we ended up the year at 43.8%. I would tell you that our productivity programs continue to be quite strong, and 2013 continues to be a strong incremental year for Project Next Century even though the investment behind it is largely complete. We said that by 2014, you'll start to get to the full year rates. So last year in 2012, we had productivity in and around that $80 million range. And while we might expect it to be slightly below that this year, our emphasis on our ability to have savings of around 3% on our non-commodity cost of goods remains on track. To your specific reference around the Ferrero initiative, where we're -- have a logistics arrangement, where we both ship product together, that is making progress in 2013, but part of that is the construction of a Canadian facility. And so you won't see the full benefit of that until '14, although it will increase from 2012. So productivity remains extremely strong and a good part of our program. Clearly, the commodity decline, if you will, year-on-year as we've seen moderation and some of our key commodities is also expected to really benefit it next year. So that does play an important part. But from our perspective, we're planning to invest behind the business and -- as well as grow our earnings and what we think is a good return from those gross margin gains.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's earlier in the year than usual for you guys to raise guidance, so your confidence seems high. And I imagine, given your historically conservative nature, I guess you're leaving some room for further upside. So as you look down the P&L, could you maybe shed some light on which line items you think there's the most upside? I'm curious, for example, if you're leaving some leeway in the gross margin line in case some of the costs move around on the dairy side or maybe you're estimating a slower build in Brookside than what you actually think will happen. I'm just curious if you can kind of lay out the -- some of those answers if you could.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, Ken, I would say that we've given what we think is our best view of gross margin expansion and, obviously, there's a range there for things like what you're mentioning, which is -- dairy is one of those that can be more volatile while at the same time, there's less inability to develop hedge strategies around that. Clearly, what we're seeing is a year that we're expecting will be driven by volume. And so that's an area that we're keeping track. And we're encouraged by where we're starting the year, as well as where we ended the year. I'd say new products and Brookside, it's a little early to tell, but we do have probably more new product activity in the pipeline this year across the globe than we've had in a number of other years. So to your point, we think we're giving the right guidance around gross margin. Below that, we do have a significant amount of spend and we always have flexibility around that spend. We're going to be aggressive because we think we're getting the right top line growth that meets our strategic needs. But I'd say that, that's where you might have flexibility if we decide that, that's the appropriate thing to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess my question revolves -- did you say actually what level of deflation you expect in 2013 on the inputs? And then kind of on the back of that, we've -- I don't ever recall seeing, for example, gum lowering prices. Obviously, that part of the category is suffering. And chocolate, as you mentioned, J.P., are gaining share. So why wouldn't your competitors, who are likely also getting the benefit of deflation -- why shouldn't we see more promotion thrown back into the business, especially as you guys continue to roll out these hand-held product that kind of goes right up against M&M, Mars's core?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Let me take the first part of that. No, we have not given any specifics around deflation and really, we're not planning to.","John P. Bilbrey","Erik, I continue to believe that as the category has made progress against pricing -- and let's put gum aside for a second. I think that if you look at this category relative to a number of other categories across the store, we've done well. We believe this will be a year that volume drives the growth in the category. And assuming that story comes true, there shouldn't be a great temptation for us to think any differently about how we market our products. I think that we're bringing good news to the consumer. I think the products are positioned in a way that they provide good value. And then from a retailers' perspective, they're also looking for friends in these categories that are producing good profit and are growing at the same time. It's a highly merchandised category. You find it in a number of places across the store, seasons, of course, plays a role. So I'm not so sure that, that's the lever that maybe once the category had relied more on. We're seeing a higher percentage of sales at full revenue kind of year-over-year and where -- if I went back 5 years ago, you would have seen, call it, 52%, 54% of sales in the category maybe on promotion. And you might see it almost flipped from that today. And those aren't hard and fast numbers but directionally, that's probably fairly correct. So that's my view and that's how I would respond to that question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Back to Brookside for a minute. If we think about the 20% planned increase in advertising for '13 and with a similar level behind your core brands at this point certainly implies a large portion going behind, obviously, the expansion of Brookside. And no matter how you slice that number, it would put the advertising as a percent of sales ratio on that brand, obviously, at a pretty massive level, obviously, ahead of what kind of growth you ultimately expect. So it's certainly a big bet, and suggests maybe you see the brand ultimately at multiples of where it is today in terms of sales. But I'm trying to get a sense, have you put this much behind a new brand before? And I guess, what is it about the brand's performance, whether it's in Canada or what you've seen so far here, albeit it's early days, that kind of gives you that level of confidence that this level of spend ultimately pays off?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, first of all, we have in place a business model now that when we're introducing brands, we want to make sure that we fully support them on a sustainable basis as we roll them out into the market, and we're going to certainly do that with Brookside. We're very optimistic about the brand, and we do believe that while we're in the first round of expansion, that this is a brand that probably has relevance more broadly than the markets that we're currently talking about. It's also important to remember that we're expanding advertising across a number of our markets in China and Brazil and Mexico. And so as you look at the comments we made about the U.S. advertising spend and then take Brookside, which is incremental, and then think about what we're doing broadly, it all doesn't come down to being spent on Brookside. With that said, we're going to have a very aggressive position around building the Brookside brand as we expand it, creating awareness, introducing it to consumers, creating trial and so on. So again, we're going -- we're very serious about building brands and we see Brookside as an important one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question about the investment in the international markets. I guess, just doing a back-of-the-envelope calculation, the upside or the flexibility that you've got to increase spending this year is something north of $50 million. So I guess, could you talk a little bit about first, how much of the capital -- how much of your $300 million in capital spending is also going to the international markets? And then also, just how that organic spending -- kind of more greenfield as opposed to acquisitions? Are you having more effect, I guess, on sort of building as opposed to buying as you build out those markets?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, Bryan, with respect to the capital, you're correct, a greater percentage of that capital is non-U.S. in 2013. And we talked about last June, if you recall, having the need to expand for volume growth in Asia specifically. And so while we've not commented on exact location, you're quite right, your observation is a good one in terms of more capital being deployed outside of the U.S. And while we still have some against Project Next Century, I mentioned it was at quite a low number, in the 15% to 20% range. We're always going to have some amount of our capital, which is either maintenance driven or driven in things like IT technology and the like. But a lot of our capital is margin enhancing and business building, if you want to call it that. So more of it is deployed outside of the U.S. in 2013, and you might see that starting to be more common in -- as we go forward, given that we feel pretty good about our footprint in the U.S., while still growing volume. We think we have the right number of facilities, if you will.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I guess, my question was more you're going to spend more P&L dollars, you're increasing your P&L spending as well there. And has that organic investment been better than what you were thinking a year ago? More kind of implying you can build it as opposed to making acquisition, or are acquisitions still part of the international expansion?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, I think, we look first at our organic business. Obviously, that's our priority. And the reflection of spend really is a reflection on new product introductions. I think J.P. mentioned, we have a number of them in China. We're planning to launch additional new products in Brazil. And so these markets, where we've invested in infrastructure and are at a point where we feel that we've done the right market research to be able to put -- expand those 5 brands in particular, those 5 global brands. M&A is quite different. It's still a priority for us, where we can expand the business inorganically. Clearly, we have the right capability from a balance sheet perspective to do it. And it is a key priority, but we don't put it in our model because it's hard to predict. And we're going to do our best to find good value return opportunities in M&A, but our main focus is our organic business.","John P. Bilbrey","One comment I would just add to what Bert has said, we've talked about expanding geographies, expanding our portfolio. If you think about our core portfolio, and we talk about 5 global brands with Hershey's, Kisses, Reese's, Jolly Rancher and Ice Breakers, our opportunity to grow those brands within the footprint that we've been articulating is really significant, both that we don't have the penetration we want yet and those categories are also growing rapidly. So as we continue to invest and prepare ourselves to be able to do that, we think it's a great spend. And the one example I would give you that you may not have heard us talk about before is if we look at the Kisses brand, which is the one brand that we have led with around the world, with our Kisses brand, 32% of the sales on Kisses happen outside the U.S. So as we continue to expand our other brands, we would hope to be able to begin to see an evolution towards that same-type profile. So that gives us a lot of encouragement, and we need to get the other brands within the same framework that we have Kisses, and that's a significant opportunity of growth for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Congratulations on your momentum, particularly in some of your emerging markets. Mexico, China, Brazil, you've mentioned them numerous times throughout the call here. Can you help us just sort of contextualize how large they are right now as a percentage of the overall sales?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, we've talked a little bit about this in the past, and within our -- within the context of that $1 billion that we're shooting for non-U.S., Canada. And so when you think about our brands outside of the U.S. and Canada, we're at about $700 million, and about 2\/3 of that are those key geographies. We haven't specifically talked about market sizes and they're growing at different rates. We mentioned China, 50%. The others are somewhat below that, although still growing very nicely. And then the other third is our -- is an export business, which is quite profitable for us, where we have either distribution arrangements in those countries. And in that side of the business, obviously, there's significantly less marketing spend than in our key markets. So think of it as about a $700 million business growing to $1 billion by the end of 2014.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. One quick follow-up. China, great growth this quarter. Curious if you saw any impact on gift-giving demand, whether it's stronger, weaker overall, and also timing because of the new year, whether or not any of that shifted into the first quarter.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think the overall comment is that we continued to see really good trends in China. Obviously, as the seasons there move around, you see some of the volume move around. But as you had a lot of discussion around China and heavy industry and other things, and there were some gloomy reports here in 2012, we just never really saw it in our types of products. So if you think about basic products, where the consumer is entering into the economy, we continue to feel awfully good and see very positive trends in our China business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I want to just talk a little bit more about the marketing and advertising. You've answered a little bit of this kind of throughout a number of questions, J.P. But 27% increase in the fourth quarter and then a massive 20% increase in advertising in 2013, and I believe somebody else, I think, said $50 million, but I think it's like a $100 million increase. Please correct me if I'm off on that. We just don't see numbers this large for a large cap food companies, almost ever. Can you just spend just a little bit more time on this -- the dollar magnitude of that increase? And then maybe one specific point is that with that large of a budget, you didn't really change your sales growth outlook for 2013. And maybe I'm just a little curious as to what the effect of the advertising really ought to be on your '13 growth, and then if you think maybe is it delayed or how long does it take before that type of an advertising number starts to show up in results. So take it away please.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, let me take a whack at all of that. And Bert can jump in here when he thinks it's appropriate, as well. Let me talk a little bit about it philosophically versus the magnitude of the numbers. But if you think about your advertising spend at a couple of times net sales growth, if you think about our North American businesses and mature businesses, that's sort of where we're at. So a lot of the increases that you're seeing is because Brookside is a big brand and it's now going to be advertised. You have the same thing happening in some of the other markets. Now the spend in the other markets, it's going to over-index certainly from an ROI standpoint in the early days of brand building. But we feel very fortunate that our company's performance right now enables us to be very focused across a few markets that we believe are the most attractive markets, and we're getting very encouraging growth where we're executing against a really complete business approach. It's around brand building. So I think what you'll see is some of those numbers will look larger to us in the early days, but this is -- we think we'll find leverage around both the organization investments and brand-building investments, and the accelerator effect behind a growing category, and a brand whose awareness is growing is really the leverage that we're betting on is really going to be worth it for us. And I think the early evidence is that, that's the case. So for me, it's really around the philosophies and then the dollars sort of follow how much activity do you believe that you can execute really well against.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, David, the only other thing that I would add to that is that if you compare it certainly to last year, a lot of our innovation happens earlier in the year and, by nature, we tend to start our advertising when we hit certain levels of distribution, and that advertising starts sooner. So you are getting more of a full year of advertising or more of the year of advertising versus what you might have saw last year just given the timing of our innovation, and that will be true across markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The outlook for the commodity prices obviously came in lower than probably your initial thoughts were. What were the incremental projects that you priced ending this commodity, I wouldn't say windfall, but lower commodity prices towards -- can you get a little bit more specific of like what incremental projects you're taking on earlier than expected?","Humberto P. Alfonso","You're talking about, again, going back to the SM&A discussion?","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","No, just in general. Look my sense is -- I mean, maybe I'm wrong, is that your commodity outlook was better than you would have thought for 2013. And I am assuming that you're not dropping all of it to the bottom line, that there might be some incremental projects that you might be taking on earlier even if it's not -- obviously, your advertising went up a little bit more, but there might be some certain targeted brands or targeted projects that maybe you may have thought about doing in 2014 and you might be doing in 2013?","John P. Bilbrey","Let me respond quickly, and then Bert can comment as well. I don't think of it so much as we're taking new things on as we're able to continue executing against the strategies that we have at a level that we would like to be able to do that. That's really, I come back to my comment I made earlier, that our solid financial performance has enabled us to continue to grow in these new markets and invest in growing our brands in the U.S. And if we continue to say we believe the North American market, the U.S, in particular, is a growth market, we continue to see strong category growth levels. We want to participate and drive that, and grow share going forward. So we're going to continue to invest in our brands. As you know, we went for a number of years where we didn't do that, and it didn't work so well for us. And the business model that we're executing against now, we know does work, but we can only do it in so many markets at any given time. But in this particular environment, it enables us to really execute against those focus markets we've talked about and expand these 5 global brands and be serious about really being a brand-building company.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies & Company.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on aerated chocolate or Air Delight and Simple Pleasures. Those products have been in the market for a while now. What's your assessment of them?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, we feel very good about Simple Pleasures. It meets the need of an indulgent chocolate with a consumer who's looking for what we call control, more of a moderator of their consumption. So it's built good distribution. We've got good advertising that we think is working behind that brand. It's gotten the right level of distribution and trial. So we feel really good about that. Air Delight, as I talked on the last call, we've adjusted our advertising approach there. We think it was probably a little bit harder to compete with indulgent 100% milk chocolate with the Aerated product, and so we weren't really talking enough about the indulgence of the experience and so we've adjusted for that. And as I said, I think, because we're introducing the consumer in the U.S. to a different type of experience, obviously, these products were available outside the U.S. It takes a little bit more work to do that, but we continue to feel really good about the product. It continues to make progress. So that would be a couple of thoughts I would have on those 2 brands.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on that, will the innovation in chocolates continue to be mainly minis and bites and pieces, that kind of thing? Or will we see more  true -- I don't want to call it brand innovation, but true new chocolate innovation going forward, as well?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think, you may see a mix of format innovation as well. But whether the innovation comes from package, usage, occasion, et cetera, as long as it's driving growth that's meeting the needs of consumers or else it wouldn't be working. So we feel pretty good about what we've been able to do in hand to mouth. We've expanded that across multiple brands, and we talked earlier about Kit Kat Minis and ROLO, et cetera, and we'll continue to do some of those. But we're always looking at different format opportunities, adjacencies and so on. And with the Air Delight, it's the same kind of thing. It's -- you're building a new concept and so that could be hard work. But as I said, we'd like to see that brand succeed.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you for joining us on today's conference call.

These capabilities in addition to our brand investments in innovation, advertising, seasons and distribution are driving balanced, sustainable growth in the marketplace.","As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we are excited to keep the momentum going with some great activation. Our ICE BREAKER brand is partnering with Disney to bring character packaging and high impact merchandising to stores for the highly anticipated release of Frozen 2 next month. This is a great opportunity to capitalize on the cultural momentum of the movie and secure incremental merchandising opportunities in store.","Four, our holiday program this year, we will build on last year\u2019s success by continuing to drive our core and leverage a hero innovation item to secure incremental merchandising and engage with our consumers.","This year's item is Reese's Mystery Shapes, which combines the anticipation and surprise of the holidays with the perfect ratio of peanut butter and chocolate that our consumers craves during the season. It is the first new Reese holiday shape in 20 years, and it will be available nationwide for a limited time only.","And as we announced earlier this year, we will be launching Kit Kat Duos in December. Our supply chain investments and incremental capacity and new production capabilities allows us to bring consumers to crispy light wafer they love surrounded by dark chocolate on the bottom and mint cream on the top. The launch will be supported with merchandising, national TV and digital media.","Now for an update on our recent acquisitions. SkinnyPop continues to perform very well in the marketplace, with retail sales up over 10% in the latest 12 weeks, this growth has significantly outpaced competition, resulting in a share gain of a 170 basis points in the ready-to-eat popcorn category.","Both household penetration and frequency has consistently grown this year, a testament to the underlying strength of this brand. We will leverage this strength to continue optimizing placements and facings on shelves, as well as secure incremental space for new pack types that meet different consumer occasions.","Pirate\u2019s Booty performance is improving versus the first half of the year in-line with our expectations. In the latest 12 weeks, the business has begun to stabilize and trends are strong where distribution has been maintained. Well, performance is not yet where we want it to be, we remain confident in the strength of the brand and our visibility into recapturing lost distribution as planograms reset.","Now for a few more details on our most recent acquisitions and venture investments. Last month, we closed our acquisition of One Brand, and I'm excited to welcome the team to the Hershey family. One is a portfolio of low sugar, high protein nutrition bars with net sales of approximately $100 million. As many of you know, the nutrition bar category is approximately $3 billion and its growing mid to high single-digits.","The One portfolio is growing 40% to 50% and has a strong presence outside of measured channels, including a robust ecommerce business. We expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to earnings in year one, and highly incremental to our existing portfolio.","We also announced two minority investments in emerging snacking businesses Fulfill Holdings and Blue Stripes in August. Fulfill was one of the leading makers of great tasting vitamin fortified, high protein nutrition bars in the UK and Ireland. And Blue Stripes the town shop offers experiential retail that combines the goodness of coco with a unique customer experience.","This sensor model provides the Company with new avenues for growth through the deployment of small capital investments in disruptive or emerging platforms focused on new occasions, new technologies and new go to market opportunities.","Now for an update on our international markets. Constant currency organic sales grew 3.7% in the third quarter, and we continue to see strong segment operating income growth of almost 27% as we focus on increasing gross margins and right sizing our brand an SG&A investment.","Our business in Mexico continues to show strong high single-digit growth behind increased distribution and innovation of our Hershey\u2019s and Pelo Rico brands. In India, we continue to see robust growth of over 16% behind distribution gains and our and launch of Hershey Kisses. The Kisses launch remains on-track and we plan to expand to additional cities in 2020.","And our China business is also growing high single-digits on an organic constant currency basis, driven by improved velocity on our Hershey bars, and reason specific flavor innovation, which is driving incremental growth.","In Brazil, our performance has been challenged by difficult macroeconomic environment and increased competition. While we have invested additional trades to remain competitive, we are also being disciplined about the returns on our investment as we look to balance both the top and bottom line.","In summary, we continue to feel good about the momentum we have a property strategies and the business results we are delivering. We will continue to invest in our brands and capabilities to take the business to the next level and drive sustainable top and bottom line growth.","I will turn it over to Steve, who will provide you with details on our financial results.","Steve Voskuil","Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter net sales of $2.1 billion increase 2.6% versus the same period last year. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 120 basis points benefits and foreign currency translation was a 20 basis points headwinds.","Organic constant currency net sale growth of 1.6% was driven by pricing, which contributed 1.1 points of growth, while volume contributed 50 basis points of growth.","Our 2018 price increase remains on-track and as anticipated, the impact increased in the third quarter versus the first half. This was offset by our pricing transition period related to our July 2019 price increase, which executed in-line with expectations. We continue to expect minimal full-year sales and earnings impacts from our most recent pricing action.","Adjusted earnings per shares diluted were $1.61 an increase of 3.9% versus the same period last year. This was driven by continued gross margin gains, partially offset by increased brand investments, and higher incentive compensation versus prior year.","By segment, North American net sales increased 2.7% versus the same period last year. Price realization was a 150 basis point benefit and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was also a 150 basis points benefit. Volume was a 20 basis point headwind and foreign currency exchange was a 10 basis point headwind.","North America gross margins expanded 80 basis points in the quarter as favorable commodities and net price realization, offset incremental logistics costs. This was slightly higher than our expectations. Recall in the second quarter, we experienced the gross margin benefit related to external inventory mix and fixed cost absorption, both related to our July price increase.","While we expected most of this benefits to reverse in the third quarter, as inventory levels normalize, we now expect the majority of the impact to occur in the fourth quarter. Given this timing shift, and the more difficult lag from the year ago period, we expect Q4 gross margin expansion to be less than the third quarter. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum in our margin expansion initiatives and the business reinvestment it is enabling.","North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased 14.4% in the quarter, driven primarily by advertising. This increase is in-line with expectations as we prioritize reinvesting gross margin expansion gain back into our brands to drive growth.","As we have shared previously, the dollar spend increase is more meaningful in the second half of 2019 versus the first half. As we are lapping significant media efficiency gains in the year ago period. Third quarter total international and others segment net sales increased 1.8%, volume was a 5.3 point benefit driven by organic growth in our key focus markets.","Net price realization was a 160 basis points headwinds as we invested more in response to increase competitive activity. Foreign currency exchange was a 100 basis points headwind and divestitures were a 90 basis point headwind.","Combined organic constant currency net sales in Mexico, Brazil, India and China grew 7.4% versus the third quarter of 2018. International and other advertising and related consumer marketing decreased 14% versus prior year as we continue to right size investment and increase ROI in China in our regional markets.","Total Hershey adjusted gross profit increased 4.4%, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 44.8% an increase of 80 basis points versus the third quarter of 2018. This was driven by favorable commodities and net price realization.","Third quarter adjusted operating profit of $477 million resulting in operating profit margin of 22.3% a decrease of 30 basis points versus the third quarter of 2018, as gross margin gains were offset by incremental brand investments and higher incentive compensation.","Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $35 million decreased $1.5 million versus Q3 last year due to lower short-term interest rates. We expect full-year interest expense of approximately $145 million, the high end of our previous range due to our recent acquisition of ONE Brand.","The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 20.1% versus 22.9% in the year ago period. These gains were driven primarily by excess tax benefits from stock based compensation, along with higher tax investment credits.","For the full-year, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 18.5%. Third quarter other expense was $18 million an increase of $5.5 million versus prior year driven primarily by unfavorable pension expense.","For the full-year, we expect other expense of approximately $70 million to $75 million. This is below our previous estimates, as we plan to exercise fewer tax investment credits and is offset by a slightly higher tax rate for the whole year. Then net impact of these two changes is negligible versus our previous estimates.","For the third quarter of 2019, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 211 million, reflecting a slight increase versus the second quarter due to a increased number of stock option exercises in the quarter.","The Company repurchased $191 million of common shares in the third quarter in connection with the exercise of stock options. The Company did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter against our July 2018 $500 million authorization and $410 million remaining.","Total capital additions, including software were $60 million in the third quarter. For the full-year 2019, we continue to estimate CapEx of around $350 million. We continue to return cash to our shareholders with third quarter dividends of $168 million. This was our 359th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock, a testament to our strong balance sheet and strong cash flow generation.","Before I close, let me provide some additional information on our recent acquisition of ONE Brands. As Michelle mentioned, net sales are approximately $100 million. Given our mid September close, we expect approximately $25 million of sales in the fourth quarter for this acquisition. The margin profile on this portfolio is attractive, and we expect it to be slightly accretive to earnings in year one.","Given acquisition related costs, we expect it to be slightly dilutive to recorded earnings in the fourth quarter and have a negligible impact to adjusted earnings in Q4. Our focus will be on maintaining the brand's current momentum, [indiscernible] links have to built brand equity and secure incremental distribution and capturing supply chain and procurement synergies.","To summarize for the full-year, we expect full-year recorded net sales to increase to around 2.5%, an increase versus the previous guidance driven by the acquisition of One Brands. The net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures increases to approximately one point.","Full-year FX impact is anticipated to be slightly negative based on current exchange rates. Full-year reported earnings per share diluted are expected to be around $5.58 relatively flat the prior year. Full-year adjusted earnings per share diluted are expected to grow 6% to 7% consistent with our previous outlook as the impact of One Brands acquisition has a negligible impact on earnings in 2019.","That concludes my financial discussions, and I will turn it back to Michelle.","Michele Buck","Thanks, Steve. We remain confident in our strategies and in our ability to deliver our financial commitments for the year. We are pleased with the progress we have made over the past two years. But we continue to operate with a healthy dissatisfaction that drives us to push and elevate the business even further.","I continue to be energized by the opportunities presented by this rapidly changing environment and the power of our amazing brands and remarkable people to capitalize on this change to unlock new opportunities for the future.","We will continue to focus on delivering today and building for the future in a way that is consistent with our values and purpose. Steve, Melissa and I are now available to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Michele Buck","Good morning, Andrew.","Steve Voskuil","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hi there. So I guess in thinking ahead a little bit, Hershey\u2019s already discussed some incremental pricing for 2020 roughly 2% on average. In terms of volume, the SKU rationalization drag I think is behind you at this point. The volume elasticity from the previous pricing, I think is largely behind you. And as Hershey's you have talked about a stepped up brand investment quite a bit. I do recognize there will be some volume elasticity on the new pricing increase, could be a partial offset a little bit on volume going forward. So, I was just hoping you could just comment maybe even more broadly on how sort of all of these factors are expected to come together in terms of how we think about volume moving forward. At a high level do it seem like volume could at least be maybe flattish or given the puts and takes if not a bit better, or the discrete maybe other volumes headwinds we should be aware of maybe it's Easter timing or things along those lines? Thanks so much.","Michele Buck","Yes, I think if we think about our retail takeaway trends and revenue going forward, I think that there is no reason to expect that to - the trends wouldn't be similar with what we have been seeing and are seeing here in the back half of this year.","As you think about going from 2019 into 2020, clearly, we will gain a little bit from SKU wrap being behind us. We lose a little bit in terms of Easter and going through a shorter Easter. But net, net, I think those are two of the single biggest changes you are right, that pricing kind of continues at a pretty steady pace.","So I think it's fair to assume that the trends would be roughly similar to what we have been seeing during the back half of the year.","Andrew Lazar","Got it. And those trends in the back half have been around consumption. I think it's been, I guess what you say today around 2ish or a little above 2ish more or less? Is that fair?","Michele Buck","Yes, exactly. That is fair. I think we have always said 1.5 to two of growth we would get from North America and yes, retail takeaway trend is around 2%.","Andrew Lazar","Great. Thank you so much.","Michele Buck","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi. Thank you and Michelle, congrats on the added title and responsibilities.","Michele Buck","Thank you.","Ken Goldman","I wanted to ask two questions. One, sort of the mechanics of the gross margin impact on a benefit that you got into 2Q was originally expected to reverberate and hit 3Q, now you're mentioning 4Q as a bigger impact. Can you walk through the mechanics of that, because to me, it was more of a fixed cost absorption benefit, and I just don't understand how the timing is delayed by a few months so that would be helpful? and then I have a follow-up.","Steve Voskuil","Sure, yes, happy to take that one. As we talked about the second quarter, and as you said Ken really two pieces there, one mix driven, we were selling a richer mix for us of instant consumable that was a benefit for us and then the inventory build both our inventory build in the second quarter and third-party inventories.","We expected to see more of that inventory come down in the third quarter and we got a little bit of that benefit back probably about a third of what we expected. We expect more inventory reduction in the fourth quarter and that is really the reason for the delay. With more inventories we got into the third quarter, both in third-party and ours, it took longer to bleed it out.","Ken Goldman","Okay, thank you for that. And then my follow-up, Steve, is on the always exciting topic of working capital, but if you look at working capital forget inventory for a second, because I know there is timing issue there. But I look at your payables on a last 12 months basis and a percentage of COGS they have been decreasing for lowest they have been in a few years. Your last 12 months receivables as a percentage of sales is at a highest they have been in over decades. So can you just walk us through what is going on with these items that is running a little bit less favorably for you at least as I look at it and maybe what the opportunity is to turn them around?","Steve Voskuil","Yes, it's a great question. If you look at say the phase for the balance sheet and cash flow today, I think networking capital year-over-year through nine-months is about $10 million drag across all three of those components.","And if you stick strap one there, so one sort of clouds up the numbers a little bit. It's just a slight positive cash generator year-over-year, but inside that you're exactly right we have opportunities to be more efficient on working capital. I think inventory in particular is one within our cross years and think about the future.","But we do feel they need to be efficient in working capital as one of the sources of funding that helps funding investments and the other thing we want to do with the business. So you can expect we will try to talk more about that as we think about 2020 plans and beyond.","Ken Goldman","Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Hey good morning folks and thanks for sliding me in, I appreciate it. I wanted to I guess come back to the direction of the question that Mr. Lazar was asking in terms of price contribution as we look into next year, but first kind of close out this year. Do you still expect to see roughly 250 bps of price contributions in North America for this fiscal year?","Michele Buck","No, in the fourth quarter, yes, not for - the full-year was always around more 1.5%, because of the time it takes for pricing to build. So we took 2.5% as we mentioned till that hits fully through the year because of price protection timing we expected more like 1.5 on the annual basis to even out the year.","Jason English","And that price protection timing. How much longer does it run for, is it not behind us now?","Steve Voskuil","Largely behind us as we exit the third quarter, but there is still inventory that will be getting run down into fourth quarter, some of which was still price protected, I would say largely behind us.","Jason English","Right. So I guess that is the component what I'm just having a hard time bridging because we have got the bracket changes of 50 bps, the gum, et cetera and sugar confection, we have got to weighed out benefit. And we should start to see what price protection behind us albeit volumes muted, because the inventory reduction, I would expect to see some of that single serve pricing come through. If you add all that up and it's a much bigger chunk than say 250 bps in the fourth quarter. What am I missing in the math, and maybe what I'm missing is just sort of reinvestment, or reinvest in SG&A, maybe there is reinvestment in above the line type investment as well. If you could help me understand that I would really appreciate it.","Steve Voskuil","I will take the bigger - the total P&L side and then we can talk about - if Melissa wants to add on the growth line. When you look at the fourth quarter P&L in total, you have got a couple of headwinds. One is the incentives that we mentioned on the call, that was an impact in the third quarter, will also be a drag in the fourth quarter. We have got a tax drag in the fourth quarter, this year we had a lot of our tax planning benefit across the first three quarters. Last year, the fourth quarter was a big tax planning quarter. And so that by itself is order of magnitude an $0.08 drag.","So you have those two pieces working against, we will have some more DME investments in the fourth quarter, similar to what we saw here. And then that gross margin, roughly reversal from the second quarter. That Ken talked about just a few minutes ago. So from a total P&L standpoint below sales, those are some of the big drivers driving the I would say deceleration in the fourth quarter P&L.","Melissa, you want to add anything on the top-line specifically?","Melissa Poole","Yes, just from the pricing piece. You're right in how you're thinking about the builds of last year's than this year's kind of compounding it. I guess the two pieces I would point you to is we did have most of our Halloween Business shifts in the third quarter. So that the jolt we get from that is mostly behind us. So we don't have Halloween pricing in the fourth quarter just because we don't really ship too much in the fourth quarter.","And then the last piece on price protection, there is still a little bit of price protection for some of the promotional activities of our most recent price increase. So we kind of give in the third quarter would have been more around kind of base volume, time to transition to the new prices that everybody gets on everything. In the fourth quarter, there is a little bit of promotional activity that we will also deal back.","So absolutely right that it should be higher than what it was so far a year-to-date and in the third quarter. But I don't know that it's enough to kind of trip you into a pretty significant pop in earning given all of the points that Steve had walked you through.","Jason English","That is helpful and the elevated trade in the fourth quarter, would we expect that to persist into next year?","Melissa Poole","No.","Jason English","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","We will now go to Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard","Good morning everyone.","Michele Buck","Hi, Alexia.","Steve Voskuil","Good morning.","Alexia Howard","Hi there. This is probably quite linked I guess to Jason\u2019s question, but again focusing on pricing in North America, but the measured channel pricing was up pretty sharply sort of mid single-digit numbers on the whole portfolio and particularly on chocolate this time around that is obviously meaningfully higher than the 1.5 the price growth that you reported this morning.","Is that just a timing effect, because of the timing of shipments or all the retailers temporarily increasing the markups on the product because of the upcoming pricing increases. And similarly the volumes were down only 2.2% in the numbers you reported this morning and that is a lot better than the mid single-digit declines that we are seeing in measured channels. So I'm just trying to figure out whether there is something going on a non-measured channels that were backed out or whether the inventory, some inventory shifts are recycling that if you could maybe speak to that? Thank you very much.","Michele Buck","Sure. So it is not a measured channel non-measured channel. There are a couple different factors going on. So first of all you right, retail takeaways is trending a little bit ahead of shipments in North America and we expected some of this and part of that is tied to the inventory contraction that is associated with our SKU rationalization program. So we knew that shipments will have a little bit of a drag there were shipments would be lighter and takeaway.","We also know that as we take price, there is some retailer margin expansion from our price increase, so you do see retail prices go up slightly higher than the Hershey prices. And then some of that is just tied to the timing of that new price increase, because as you know we have got kind of the two price increases, the one from last year that hit, and then the new one, where again retail prices will go up before we see that in our data because of how we manage those price increases and allow a buy-in period.","Steve Voskuil","Yes. And I would say - all I would add is by the end of the year we expect those two to tighten up between shipments and take away.","Alexia Howard","Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","We will now go to Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe","Hi good morning.","Michele Buck","Hi, Chris.","Steve Voskuil","Good morning.","Chris Growe","Hi. And so actually a follow-on to Alexia's question there, because related to the - what we are seeing in measured channels the increased level of price realization, we are seeing an equally or weakening volume and performance as well. So I just want to understand how that - maybe from a higher level how elasticity is playing off for you right now and then how we should read again what we are seeing in the measured channel data, which is obviously a increasing in pricing, but a much weaker volume performance overall?","Michele Buck","Yes, so what we are seeing at retail is very consistent with what our model would indicate. We normally see a conversion timeframe, when we take retail prices up, we see volume goes down, obviously we do a lot of work with one of our programming to mitigate some of that volume declines during that conversion timeframe to bring back the volume even more quickly, but typically in periods of price increase, we do see those volume declines and they are pretty much in-line with all of our elasticity models.","Melissa Poole","And just to build on that Chris and we can talk with this a little bit more offline, because there is some extra noise in the third quarter, but if you kind of break them into pieces, and think about last year's price increase, the price of that retailer are to Michele\u2019s point pretty much in-line with expectations. So they are a little bit ahead of us as retailers are expanding margins, but nothing out of bound by any stretch.","I think a lot of the noise in this quarter there is some timing of promotional activity where there were some losses and some higher prices on promotion that you're seeing place through for why those retail prices are a little bit more elevated in the in the quarter, year-to-date they are pretty much in-line with what we are seeing on the P&L, but a little bit of noise in the quarter.","And then especially this most recent price increase to the timing of the protection causes a pretty big disconnect as they start rising prices and we don't see that in our P&L right away. So overall feeling really good they are where we expected, it is just there is a little bit more noise in this quarter.","Chris Growe","Okay. And then just a quick follow-on in terms of how that relates to the gross margin, as I think about the fourth quarter, you have a bit of an easy comparison on the gross margin, have you given indication in terms of your pricing in relation to cost inflation, kind of how that stands today, you talk about input cost being down and then what that would mean for a full-year gross margin and we can kind of imply what it could mean for the fourth quarter.","Steve Voskuil","Yes. I mean our full-year gross margin guidance isn't unchanging. We kind of said in the order of 100 basis points year-over-year, and we are just sort of tracking to that. I'd say there is nothing new relative to commodities versus price, we are playing out the way we expected, again because we have got the hedging program against some of the commodities that smooths out and give some forward visibility, so not a lot of change there. I don't know if that answers your question.","Chris Growe","Yes, it does. Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Thank you. And I will second your remarks Michelle, on Take5.","Michele Buck","Thanks.","Robert Moskow","Yes. And, in my channel checks, what I keep hearing is that actual physical shopping trips to stores are on the rise, which is not what you would expect with the growth of e-commerce and I think that is a positive for your business, more impulse purchases. And then secondly, I saw on the data that it looks like your points of distribution are rising. You didn't really talk about those in your prepared remarks. Can you comment on those two things and would you confirm or not?","Michele Buck","Yes, I think as you look at the IRI data it can be - there is a little bit of noise in that this year, because of the standup packaging bag transition where we had an overlap of inventories transitioning from the old lay down bags to the stand up bags. So we are always pushing to drive against distribution, getting additional points of distribution and actually additional disruptive placements in-store primarily.","So we did have a program at one of our big retailers where we got significantly expanded distribution points around the front end, but it\u2019s a little bit of both, we are expanding some distribution with some customer specific programs, but there is also - it probably looks a little higher in the numbers in the IRI data than actually is just because of that conversion on stand up bags.","Robert Moskow","Thanks, try to see you up. So net-net it is a little higher, but it might be temporary or it's a -.","Michele Buck","No, I would kind of say it's higher, but not as high as the numbers would show. So there is growth, but it's just not as high as the total IRI looks.","Robert Moskow","Okay, and physical shopping fixed stores, I think IRI also indicates that people are going to stores more frequently.","Michele Buck","Yes, we are seeing some good signs there, relatives consumers and I think as consumers are shopping on omni-channel basis we see them in-stores, also looking at the retailers websites, while they are in-store, so we are seeing a lot more of that versus a net shift.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Alright. Very good. Thank you.","Michele Buck","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with RBC. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, good morning, everyone. Michelle maybe you can just give us some perspective on some channel dynamics, maybe just talk about what you're seeing in big box and the convenience per channel. And then maybe Steve, if you could just address, no one recently talk about inflation and a sided sugar and milk prices. So I just wanted to get your thoughts around that kind of what you guys are seeing and if you are hedged for 2020. Thank you.","Steve Voskuil","Sure.","Michele Buck","Yes, so if we look from a channel perspective, we are really seeing growth across most all classes of trade, with the exception of drug which tends to be a little bit soft, particularly given some of the strategies and actions taken focus in that class of trade. I would say particular strength in big box, for sure. In club stores and in the dollar class of trade, but pretty much growth across everything except for drug.","Steve Voskuil","And Nick on the commodity side. Obviously we are watching commodity prices very closely as we put together our plans for 2020. Hedging gives us some visibility. I think probably the biggest takeaway across that group is that as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we have got a tailwind this year on Coco.","But if you look at the Coco prices today versus the last 12 to 24 months they are higher and so at minimum, we are not likely to have a tailwind in 2020 that we have been able to enjoy this year on Coco. Hedging will help to smooth out that transition and we will get more guidance on commodities in general as we get closer to 2020.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Baumgartner","Good morning thank for the question.","Michele Buck","Good morning.","John Baumgartner","Why don\u2019t dig into the ONE Brands acquisition a bit, because that nutrition bar space is increasingly crowded. Can you speak a bit to the diligence that went into that and how you're thinking about the competitive tension there, how you think one stands out and maybe how you're envisioning growing that business, whether it's in distribution channels or different product formats?","Michele Buck","Absolutely. So we continue to be excited with the growth that we are seeing in that snack bar segment and particularly if you look across total snack bars, and you really dissect that market, you see that the real sweet spot where that has the strongest growth is that high protein, and particularly high protein with low sugar.","So I think my first direction would be to kind of dissect within that category to say where is the sweet spot where we think that there really is growth and we certainly think that there is room to have a couple brands that play in that space in the marketplace consistent with other categories.","What we really liked about it is, it's very consistent and fits right into our stated desire for scale to growing assets in attractive categories that give us access to incremental snacking occasions. High protein, low sugar it provides on the go convenience, it also gives us a play in the morning snacking occasion where we are underdeveloped.","We like a lot that that business has a strong presence and growth in e-commerce and non-traditional channels, which again provides some incrementalality for us and we certainly like the growth rates that we are seeing on this business. We think it fits in a nice sweet spot for us in terms of where we can add value, because there is still a distribution opportunity.","So I'd say job one, as we look at growing the business is securing that incremental measured distribution expansion, continuing to build on the brands equity, we like the fact that this asset has good margins that are in-line with Hershey margins and that is one thing that has always been important to us to the kind of businesses that we run best, and then of course we will capture any opportunities for supply chain and procurement synergy.","So we see it as a platform that has - our primary focus for growth will be around to close in - at least for the next several years the close in driving against the core. So unlike perhaps some of the other assets in that space where maybe some of their focus is expanding to a lot of other categories. I think there is a lot of upside expanding within snack bars. But then later some opportunity to take that one trademark more broadly in terms of the platform it stands for.","John Baumgartner","Is it fair to think just given you know how in the bar business already that this is something you could repatriate overtime internally in-house?","Michele Buck","I mean, we certainly make a lot of bars and that technology of kind of slab and slip is something certainly we do well. So we always take an approach of getting our arms around the business and then looking at how we leverage repatriating for opportunity whenever and if it is appropriate.","John Baumgartner","Okay. Thanks for your time.","Operator","We will now go to Steven Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good morning.","Michele Buck","Hi, Steve.","Steven Strycula","So I have a question, Michelle, could you walk us around the globe, some of your key markets internationally such as Brazil, China and Mexico, just give us a feel for how Hershey is performing versus the competition or whether you're seeing more competitive dynamics or macro acceleration, deceleration, multinational brands versus local, because you called out specifically Brazil, but be helpful to understand the dynamics across Brazil, China and Mexico and then I have a follow-up?","Michele Buck","Yes, I would say across all of our international markets, we are feeling good and performing well, in most of those markets we are gaining share. For some of my highlights in my opening comments, we feel particularly good about Mexico where we have strong, very strong growth with a real focus on Hershey\u2019s Pelo Rico, but we are seeing growth in India in China.","Brazil is really the market that is been challenged given that combination of macroeconomic as well as some competitive activity around deep discounting where we have just made some choices around. Investing additionally, but still being very rational about balance top and bottom line. But I feel good growth and good share progress in all the other markets.","Steven Strycula","Okay, and just to clarify, was Brazil more of a multinational or a local competition?","Michele Buck","Yes, Brazil is more multinational competition.","Steven Strycula","Okay. And then to close out a question on pricing, I know you guys have three levers you pulled for pricing this year that are kind of cascading or phasing in throughout the year and then we have another piece from the price increase announced this summer. So can help us understand as we go from fourth quarters into the first half of next year how do we stack pricing on top of pricing. So basically, when does it peek out versus when does it starts to kind of like normalize to a more moderate rate? Thank you.","Michele Buck","So we will start to see the pricing come into our P&L mostly as we get into Q1 and flow from there. So Q1 should be a little bit higher, but I would expect on an annual basis, you're going to see similar to what we saw with our last price increase of around 2%. That we will see on an annual basis next year. And it will build we won't get from the second price increase any impact this year. But as we go into next year, you will see that build in the marketplace.","Steven Strycula","Thank you very much.","Michele Buck","Does that, answer your question?","Steven Strycula","It does. Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Palmer","[Technical Difficulty] on 2019 is coming to an end here. How do you think this year will shape up versus what you think will be a typical year for your growth in terms of the complexion of the growth. On the phase of it looks like there has been some nice pricing gains relative to input inflation, you even had some pretty clever way of doing pricing with a stand up bags and that weighed out there. You are reinvesting heavily in advertising, you're getting some very nice growth out of your Reese's trademark, which is sort of the trademark of growth of your year. So in some ways it feels like an unusual period in terms of reinvestment room and reinvestment behind what might be your best trademark there and in some ways you might be thinking about a different type of growth going forward. Any thoughts there would be helpful?","Michele Buck","Yes, I guess as I think about the growth model this year and then the growth model for next year, I would say that there are some similarities and I can call of a few differences. So think in terms of similarities pricing certainly this year, pricing will play a key role next year. So I think that is kind of one platform that you can think is even though taking a little bit differently comparable on a year-to-year basis.","While we don't get into specific guidance, we are continuing to look for strategy to continue to reinvest and invest in our brands and capabilities and certainly, that will be a priority for us next year as it was this year.","We always focus on trying to achieve that balance between driving our everyday brands and really driving the core brands. So you should continue to expect to see strong support and programming around Reese when you have built a brand that is $2 billion in revenue.","There will always be a focus on that brand just because of how big a pieces it is at the portfolio but also support by some of our other big brands. We talked about Kit Kat Duos and Kit Kat will certainly be a brand that will have a lot of focus next year as well.","So I think a lot of commonality in terms of some of those elements that you called out, I think relative to growth where the biggest differences are is more around the timing of Easter, which is a little bit of a heard about half a point for next year, but then the benefit around SKU wrapped cycling which is a help. Does that provides perspective?","David Palmer","Yes. No that is. That is helpful. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator instructions] And our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery","Good morning. Thank you. Could you just touch on your thinking on the consumer marketing spending is obviously up very strongly in the quarter. But looking at the last few years it's typically been 7%, 7.5% of sales and 2018 was just a little bit of 6%. Should we expect it to get back above a 7% level or are some of the increase this year a little more one off. Can you just give us a sense of how sticky it is and where your optimal range might be. And then just related to that what were some of the things that changed last year where there were the cutbacks and what are some of the things that are coming back or maybe this year in terms of how you're deploying the spending?","Michele Buck","So our kind of stated strategy around marketing investment is to grow in-line or slightly ahead of our sales growth. So to grow the dollar investment in-line or slightly ahead. There can be some noise around that, because sometimes we are able to get efficiencies in how we are buying and so we can actually get greater impressions than the dollar budget. So it's not always perfect, but I would say that is overall how you should think about it.","When we took our spend back from 7%, 7.5% down to 6% there were two key places that the spends really came out of, one was we did start gaining some efficiencies as we started developing some of our creative in-house and also some media efficiencies from very strengthen targeting capabilities. And then we also cut back on some of the smaller emerging brands where we believe that frankly we were over investing beyond what we should.","As you look at where we are now and the reinstatement of spend, you will certainly see that in terms of strength behind the core brands, but then also really tapping into unleash some of our smaller brands like a ROLO, HEATH bands that have been around forever, brands that are very stable and with a slight amount of increase in advertising we can drive some significant growth. So that is I would say where the biggest priorities of reinvestment has been.","Michael Lavery","Just when you talk about some of the cuts on emerging brands, could you give any examples of what those might have been?","Michele Buck","Yes, I would say, let\u2019s say KRAVE would be an example, some of the emerging brands that we have in our Amplify portfolio. Some of our snack mixes that were in the warehouse isle under the Reese or Hershey trademark, things like that.","Michael Lavery","That is helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will now got to with Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zaslow","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Michele Buck","Hi Ken.","Steve Voskuil","Good morning.","Kenneth Zaslow","Just a one follow-up question here. On the thin platforms can you talk about how broad that could be to other products, how big you think that could be. It just seems like that is something very similar to the expansion of other products that you have and other real opportunity that this can actually become a bigger product offerings. Can you talk about that?","Michele Buck","Yes, absolutely. So, we feel great, first of all about Reese\u2019s performance in the marketplace, it is on-track with our expectations, we are seeing signs of sustainability and incrementality. So certainly we always look as we develop innovation to see if there is an opportunity to develop the platform and certainly this does feel like one that could cut across multiple brands and that certainly an opportunity that we are evaluating?","Kenneth Zaslow","How big do you think the platforms can be, can you put any like parameters around it about which brands it can go to? It just seems like there is a lot that can be happening with this. Can you kind of put some parameters to it and I will leave it there?","Michele Buck","Yes, I mean, I think there are multiple brands that can go to, I think what we always try and focus on with our platform is not spreading it too far. But having it focused on a couple brands where it really makes the most sense. And clearly, if you look at the history of how we have built other platforms in the past and just beside the brands, Reese given its size, will definitely be the largest of opportunities, but I do believe that there can be growth beyond that.","Kenneth Zaslow","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I would like now to turn the call back to our speakers for any additional remarks.","Melissa Poole","Hey thanks so much for joining us this morning. The team will be available today and all of next week for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks so much.","Operator","This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Phyllis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company's Second Quarter 2013 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you, Phyllis. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Dave Tacka, Senior Vice President and CFO and I will represent Hershey on this morning's call.","We also welcome those of you listening via the webcast. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2012 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section.","Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.","The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss 2013 second quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $6.6 million or $0.02 per share diluted, primarily related to the costs associated with the Project Next Century, non-service-related pension expense and acquisition and integration cost. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey.","John P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. I'm very pleased with Hershey's second quarter results. Net sales accelerated, plus 6.7%, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.72. We have momentum in the U.S. in key international markets, where our net sales growth in retail takeaway is exceeding category growth. In the U.S., with the exception of gum, the chocolate, non-chocolate and mint segments, increased at the high end of the historical category growth rate. This is driven by the rational investments we continue to see by most major manufacturers in the form of advertising, innovation and brand building initiatives. As it relates specifically to the Hershey products, Brookside and our new Kit Kat Minis are performing very well with trial and repeat ahead of our initial estimates. The U.S. is a growth market for the confectionary category, and we would expect that to be the case going forward. We believe retailers and consumers will continue to value the category, given its impulsivity and affordable price points.","Now for some details on our overall marketplace performance. In the second quarter and year-to-date period, we essentially gained market share in every channel and segment where we compete: chocolate, non-chocolate, mint and gum. Nielsen's second quarter measures do not encompass the entire Easter season in both the year ago and current periods. Therefore, the majority of my remarks today will refer to the year-to-date marketplace performance for the 24 weeks, ended June 15, 2013.","Total Hershey's CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, retail takeaway for the year-to-date period through June 15, 2013 in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business was up 6.8%, resulting in a market share gain of 1.4 points. As a reminder, this represents xAOC+C-store data consisting of the food, drug, MassX and C-store channels, plus the inclusion of Walmart and partial Dollar, Club and Military channels. Year-to-date, CMG category growth in the xAOC+C channels was up plus 2.1%. However, similar to 2012 and 2011, gum continues to be a drag on the total CMG performance and excluding it the category was up 3.7%. We're very pleased with the chocolate category performance specifically, year-to-date xAOC+C chocolate category growth was plus 4.0%. Hershey's xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway was 7.1%, resulting in a gain of 1.3 points of chocolate market share. Core brands such as Hershey's, Reese's, Kit Kat, as well as Brookside, all gained share. Year-to-date, non-chocolate candy xAOC+C category growth was plus 2.5%. Recall, NCC year ago performance was exceptionally strong due to innovation that launched in the first half of the year and a longer Easter season. Additionally, in 2013, there's more chocolate activity than there is in NCC.","Hershey's xAOC+C 2013 year-to-date non-chocolate candy retail takeaway was up plus 2.2%, essentially in line with the NCC category and our forecast. Our performance was impacted by the year-over-year timing of the significant Twizzlers promotion at a major retailer last year, as well as 2013 NCC innovation, which is only available in take-home pack types. As I'll detail in a minute, we have activity over the remainder of the year that will continue to drive strong results.","Looking at the FDMx channels, Hershey year-to-date CMG marketplace performance was solid. Our retail takeaway of market share was up within all 4 segments and all 3 channels. Specifically, our year-to-date FDMx retail takeaway increased plus 4.8%, resulting in a market share gain of 1 full point. In the C-store class-of-trade, where the Easter impacts are minimal, CMG category growth accelerated in the second quarter and was up plus 4%, driven by mid-single digit percentage increases in chocolate, non-chocolate and mint segments. Similar to the last few years, the chewing gum category continues to struggle and declined minus 6.4% in the C-store channel in Q2.","Total Hershey's C-store performance was strong with Q2 retail takeaway, up 10.6%, resulting in a market share gain of 1.9 points.","Our C-store chocolate and mint retail takeaway was particularly solid, up plus 13.6% and plus 12.3%, respectively. These gains were driven by core brands that were supported by advertising, in-store selling, merchandising and programming. In the U.S. marketplace over the remainder of the year, we have many exciting products, promotions, programs and merchandising in place across all channels.","Some of these include in-store merchandising and programming, as well as high-value coupons, promoting S'mores, Summer Fun, as well as the celebration of National S'mores day on August 10. A promotion with pop band, Gym Class Heroes, will rerecord 5 iconic summer songs, downloadable for consumers of Twizzlers and Jolly Rancher. The continued new product rollout in support of Kit Kat Minis in a stand-up pouch and king size offering. Our Reese's promotional tie-in with NCAA college football and strong plans for successful Halloween and holiday seasons. Brookside is tracking well, and there is full year launch support, including TV advertising, FSIs and sampling. Focused in-store execution by our U.S. sales force in the first half of the year enabled us to reach our distribution targets, although merchandising and programming are slightly below plan, as we manage inventory to ensure product presence in all targeted stores. Importantly, repeat purchases are tracking ahead of our plan. Brookside has been a benefit from a financial marketplace perspective. It's accretive to earnings, exceeding our acquisition model and has contributed about 1\/4 of Hershey's year-to-date CMG market share growth of 1.4 points. We continue to anticipate that Brookside will be about 1 point of total company sales growth in 2013.","Additionally, work is underway to determine opportunities outside the U.S. and Canada. Grounded in consumer insights, validation work has begun in select geographies to determine which countries offer the greatest payback and the timeline for entering these markets. Outside of the U.S., our international business was relatively in line with our forecast. China, Mexico and Brazil were standouts, with net sales up solid double digits on a percentage basis versus last year. The chocolate category in China continues to grow and is up plus 11% year-to-date. The category is developing nicely, with instant consumable and take-home pack types accelerating and outpacing gifting. Hershey retail takeaway is tracking as expected, and similar to the last couple of years, our chocolate business should grow at least 4 to 5x greater than the category growth. For Nielsen, our national share has increased and is just above 7%. We have merchandising, programming and innovation throughout the year, and believe we're well positioned to build on our momentum.","Hershey's Kisses Deluxe and Hershey's Drops are scheduled to launch in Q4 and earlier this month. We began a soft roll out of our new Lancaster brand in China. Recall, in May, we announced the launch of Lancaster-branded milk candies. The milk category is about 1\/4 of the total NCC market in China, roughly $1.2 billion. The premium segment within the milk category is growing 20% to 25%. We believe Lancaster will be successful, as it features a unique slow roasting process that requires high-quality milk and slow cooking, resulting in a distinct rich, creamy flavor. In Mexico, we continue to see strong growth in the Hershey's and Kisses franchises. In the modern trade, our year-to-date chocolate retail takeaway was almost double the category rate, resulting in a market share gain of 1.2 points.","The Hershey's brand continues to perform well and Kisses had a standout quarter, driven by solid Mother's Day gifting. Consumer testing and validation on Reese's and Jolly Rancher is progressing as planned, and should be a future enabler as we track towards our 2017 goals. In Brazil, Hershey bars and tablets are ahead of plan and Hershey's Mice is on track versus our targets. Category growth and Hershey takeaway is up low double digits year-to-date.","We have plans in place that give us confidence that our momentum will continue over the remainder of the year. And in Canada, we continue to build on our momentum as our CMG market share increased 0.4 points for the year-to-date period. Our Chocolate business gained plus 0.2 points, driven by Hershey's. Our sweet and refreshments market share increased 0.8 points, driven by Jolly Rancher. This brand has tripled the its household penetration over the past 3 years due to innovation, advertising, merchandising and programming.","Now to wrap up. We're fortunate to be stewards of iconic brands that consumers love and trust. Confectionary is an advantaged category, is highly impulsive and is a destination category, especially in the second half of the year. It's expandable and profitable for the retailer and affordable for the consumer. Our commitment to the category and our execution of both headquarters and store level has resulted in strong results, positioning us to deliver another solid year. Over the remainder of the year, we have solid merchandising and programming in place to drive core brands and new products in both U.S. and international markets. Halloween orders are on track, and we have the right mix of seasonal-specific advertising, coupons and programming support that sets the stage for another winning season. Therefore, in 2013, we expect net sales to increase about 7%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We have good visibility into our cost structure, and expect to achieve adjusted gross margin expansion of 220 to 230 basis points. This is enabling us to continue to make SM&A investments across our business in both U.S. and international markets. As a result, we anticipate 2013 adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of about 14%.","I'll now turn it over to Dave, who will provide you with the financial details.","David W. Tacka","Thank you, J.P., and good morning, everyone. Hershey posted strong results again in the second quarter. Consolidated net sales of $1.5 billion were up 6.7% versus last year. Adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.72 was up 9.1% versus 1 year ago. These results were slightly better than our expectations due primarily to strong retail takeaway and gross margin gains.","J.P. provided details related to our marketplace performance. So I'll now focus on the review of the P&L, balance sheet and cash flow. As expected, second quarter net sales were driven by volume increases, a 6.6% benefit, including 1 point from Brookside products. Foreign currency impact was relatively neutral, with a 10th of a point benefit. The U.S. and Canada businesses provided about 85% of our net sales growth in the quarter. International sales, excluding Canada, were up 8%, and not an accelerator of sales growth in the quarter, primarily as a result of the seasonality of the businesses.","Turning now to margins. In the second quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 290 basis points, driven by lower commodity costs and a more profitable sales mix, together with solid supply chain productivity and cost savings.","Volume gains were a bit higher than our estimates, resulting in improved fixed cost absorption. Input cost deflation of about $29 million was slightly greater than our earlier estimates. For the year, we now expect adjusted gross margin of 220 to 230 basis points, which is greater than our previous estimate of 190 to 210 basis point increase. The improvement compared to prior estimate is primarily the result of an improved sales mix and higher productivity. There is no significant change from input cost deflation. Adjusted EBIT increased 11.5% year-over-year and the EBIT margin of 18.3% was 80 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2012. These increases were primarily driven by the gross margin improvements.","SM&A expenses increased 14.8% versus last year as a result of increased advertising spending and higher SG&A spending. SG&A spending, which excludes advertising, increased about 12% in the quarter, relatively in line with our forecast. For the full year, we continue to expect that SG&A expenses on a percentage basis will increase at a greater rate than net sales growth. This spending, which includes staffing increases to support our global growth, as well as investments in market research, category management and selling and marketing capabilities in both the North American and International markets will benefit the company both in the near and long-term. From a timing perspective, we expect the Q3 increase over the prior year to be around 20% and the Q4 increase to be mid-single-digits, given the prior year's stepped-up spending in the fourth quarter.","Advertising expense increased about 22% in Q2, in line with our forecast. For the year, we continue to expect advertising expense to be up about 20% versus last year. This increase continues to support our core brands, as well as the Brookside rollout and innovation. Advertising expense outside of North America is expected to increase 45% to 50%, primarily targeting brand building in our focused markets.","Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. International net sales, which exclude Canada, increased about 8% in the second quarter. We continued to make progress in our focused markets, which achieved combined top line growth of around 15%. This growth was driven by strong core brand performance, primarily Hershey's and Kisses, and was in line with our expectations. We remain committed to these markets and will continue to make the necessary investments to build brand equity and drive trial and repeat purchases. We expect international sales to accelerate over the remainder of the year, given new product launches, core brand growth in focused markets and increasing velocities in the export markets that we entered last year. For the full year, based on current exchange rates, international sales are expected to increase 15% to 20% and are tracking to achieve the $1 billion in net sales target that we have for the end of 2014.","Moving down the P&L. Second quarter interest expense of $21.1 million declined slightly versus $24.3 million last year. In 2013, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million to $95 million. We continue to expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be about the same as last year. The tax rate for the second quarter was 35.7%, in line with our estimate and greater than the year-ago period of 32%, which reflected the timing and settlement of various tax matters. In the second quarter of 2013, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 227 million shares versus 229 million shares in 2012.","Let me now provide a quick recap of our year-to-date adjusted results. Net sales for the company increased 6% in the first half. Adjusted EBIT increased 10.2%, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin gain of 70 basis points. Advertising increased 22% on a year-to-date basis, relatively in line with the percentage increase forecasted for the full year. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 47.1% versus 44.5% last year, a 260 basis point gain driven by lower commodity costs, supply chain productivity, favorable sales mix and fixed cost absorption. Adjusted earnings per share diluted in the first half increased 12% to $1.81 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Net trading capital was $25 million lower than last year's second quarter, primarily because of higher accounts payable. Accounts receivable was higher by $13 million as a result of the increased sales and the aging of accounts receivable remains extremely current. Inventory balances were lower by $13 million. In terms of other specific cash flow items, total company capital additions, including software were $65 million in Q2. These amounts included Project Next Century capital expenditures of $4 million. In 2013, we expect capital additions to be approximately $320 million to $330 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $50 million in the second quarter. In 2013, we are forecasting total depreciation and amortization of about $200 million to $210 million. Dividends paid during the quarter were $91 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $102 million worth of our common shares to replace shares which were issued primarily in connection with stock option exercises. All shares were acquired in the open market. Cash on hand at the end of the second quarter was $568 million, relatively consistent with the prior year. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow and has a strong balance sheet. As stated in this morning's press release, we have increased our dividend by 15.5% to a quarterly rate of $0.485 per share. The increase will put us more in line with our targeted dividend payout rate of about 50% for the 2013 fiscal year. The action reflects our confidence in the long-term growth potential of the business.","Now let me summarize. Our U.S. marketplace performance in measured and non-measured channels is tracking a bit better-than-expected. We believe we'll maintain our momentum over the remainder of the year, driven by advertising, in-store merchandising and programming of core brands and new products in both the North American and International markets. As a result, we now expect 2013 sales growth of about 7%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We have good visibility into our full year cost structure, and there's no material change to our input cost outlook for the year.","Given our strong first half results, we are now forecasting full year adjusted gross margin expansion of 220 to 230 basis points. Advertising will be up about 20% versus last year, supporting core brands, Brookside, and innovation in both the U.S. and key International markets. For the full year, we continue to expect SM&A, excluding advertising, to increase at a rate greater than net sales as we expand global go-to-market capabilities. Therefore, we now expect full year adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of about 14%, an increase from our previous estimate of 12%.","We'll now open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Janney.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","J.P., I just have one question about the competitive landscape. There's been a number of pretty interesting new products, particularly, I'm referring to Snickers and Milky Way bite-size items, as well as other innovation in the category broadly. Could you comment on what kind of interplay you're having with the category right now, having told us that data, what effect that kind of competitions had on the category, is it growing it, is it not growing it? And then more broadly, if it is growing the category, all these new spending and innovation, where does candy stand right now relative to other sort of more ancillary competition at the front end of the stores sort of other snacking categories, what interplay is happening there?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, sure. Jonathan, I think that part of the magic of this category, of course, is the expandable consumption. So the fact that we're seeing quality innovation across the category, continued investment in advertising and promotion to support innovation, the category has cycled pricing, I think, quite well. I think all of those things are certainly good for us. As we see the categories resiliency across total snacking, we continue to feel very, very good about how the category is behaving and the quality of the activity in the category. So going forward, we're quite positive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to ask a couple of questions around the international business. So I guess, 2 things. One, if you look at the results with the focused markets up 15, but total international sales up 8, if you could just sort of bridge for us the difference between the 15 and 8. And then second, if you could just comment on in the focused markets, how much of the revenue growth is volume versus pricing? So are there any other price increases that you're taking in those markets?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, and I'll start with the second part of your question. So as most of these -- a lot of our growth there is really around expanding items. So price doesn't play the same kind of additive effect it might in another markets because you're introducing these new brands at a price point people are seeing for the first time. So it really is about gaining distribution, volume, and then of course, getting sales against those businesses. In Q2, we saw a little bit lumpier business around between our export businesses and our focus markets. And in our focus markets where we're advertising and putting a lot of effort, we felt terrific about our progress there. You heard my comment on China so you can kind of do the math on your own if the category is growing at 11% and we're growing at 4 to 5x the category. That's a pretty strong number and -- so in those markets, we continue to feel quite good about the progress.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A couple of questions on 2 different topics. Convenience stores have obviously been quite an important feature over the last several years. Could you just remind us of what the current convenience store share is in the U.S. versus the non-c-store share? And how much more room for expansion is there in that sector? And is that still significantly more profitable than the regular grocery channel?","John P. Bilbrey","So I'll start with just saying that -- because of the product mix in the C-store channel, we -- with it being into consumables, the profitability of that is very important to us. So from that standpoint, C-store is really good. On the chocolate business in C-stores, we have over a 50 share of the category. So our brands are quite strong there, and we continue to see good performance across the C-store channel. So in 2Q, where you don't have the influence of seasonality and so forth, our share was up across total CMG about 10.6%. Chocolate was up about 13.6%. So that segment for us continues to perform well. And the biggest observation, I would just tell you about the C-store, that whenever I meet with the operators, is that the total mix of their store continues to evolve as they increase the selection they have, and that's been, I think, a positive thing to keep people coming into the stores. And so in our category, we remain on the menu of people that come into the store despite the fact that they are increasing their selection. So I think, again, it just shows the resiliency of the category.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And then I have a quick follow-up. Where are you tracking at the moment in terms of new products as a percent of sales? And are you at your long-term goal at this point? Or do you expect it to go higher over time?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, Alexia, we've been very pretty fortunate here. As we said we want innovation to be about 1 point of our total growth on an ongoing basis. And as we were talking here, we think Brookside is an example, by itself, will be about 1 point. So innovation has been important to our overall growth over the last several years. And while you may see us do different things, our real focus is on trying to be very, very consumer-centric, do fewer, bigger, better innovation initiatives that will be sustainable. So again, I want to innovate -- I want to emphasize, it's not how many things we do as much as it is how successful are the things that we do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I have just 2 quick ones for you. I want to be clear on kind of the phasing of the gross margin for the year. You've had a great performance year-to-date. Your full year guidance assumes it comes down a little bit in the second half of the year, but that is the pace. I'm just curious, anything we should be thinking about in relation to that, the way the cost inflation phases or anything you could add to that?","David W. Tacka","Okay. Sure, Chris. The thing to think about there is as we said earlier, our productivity, particularly the savings around some of the last of the next century savings, was a bit phased earlier in the year. And so we had that, and we'd been expecting that it would be a little bit lower in the back half of the year, and we still expect that. The overall increase is really a function of some of the sales mix improvements that we've seen, and we are getting a bit more productivity. From an input cost standpoint, as we've said, we have good visibility of our input costs and really don't expect that to be changing from what we were expecting in the back part of the year.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I can have just one quick follow-up, and then just in relation to Brookside, as you've launched that product now across the country, is the -- I'm just curious about kind of the way that the growth is occurring, or the penetration is occurring by channel. So I'm just curious at the C-store performance versus, say, the grocery mass performance for that brand.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, during the introductory period, we haven't focused yet on C-store. You may find it in a C-store, but it hasn't been a big focus for us yet. It certainly will be, but we've seen great response to the product across channels. As you know, in the early life of that brand, it was more in club stores. It had some penetration at grocery, but our distribution capability has now made the brand broadly available. One of the things that we talked to you about earlier is, is that we doubled our capacity, but you have to remember that capacity doesn't come online on the first day. So some of the, I'll call it, pacing of depth of merchandising that we had anticipated, we've had to balance and pace a little bit differently just because the repeat has been very good. And then while we don't have a full set of data yet, given just the timeline of the product, very importantly for all the marketers is the repeat of repeaters. And I know it always sounds a little bit funny to say that, but repeat of repeaters is really exceeding our expectation and we feel quite good about that as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You talked about getting to the upper end of the 5% to 7% top line target for this year, and you've said that Brookside will continue to be at about a 1% contributor. So in terms of the base business, is it that the category overall has accelerated beyond what you had thought originally? Or is it more a matter of just the share gains you've been taking and expect to take for the balance of the year are greater than you'd forecast? And then I just have a follow-up.","John P. Bilbrey","Sure. Andrew, I think it's actually both. I think the category continues to perform well because, broadly, manufacturers are investing in the category in a very positive way. And as you said earlier, advertising, innovation, et cetera, seems to be working well for everybody. So we would continue to believe that the potential for quality results around good growth for both the retail and ourselves. We're quite optimistic for that.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then it's way early, obviously, to start talking about '14 with any kind of specificity, but just from an input cost standpoint, would it be fair to say that on certain key inputs that you do typically have the ability to have more visibility around for a longer period of time that you're starting to get a bit of visibility, at least, around where things might shake out from a cost standpoint in '14 at this stage?","David W. Tacka","Andrew, as we've said, our strategy is basically we can -- where we can, we'll take coverage anywhere from 3 to 24 months. And so certainly, we are working through our normal process. We're reviewing the markets and beginning to lay in to establish our cost visibility for 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you talk just a bit more about the scope of the opportunity for the Lancaster product in China? I know it's very early days so there's limited amount that can be said, but can you give us a sense of what level of distribution relative to the existing products that are in the market you'd expect to be reaching by year end or within sort of an 18-month time period?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. So as you know, we're continuing to grow our distribution capabilities all the time in China. We estimate today that the milk candy segment in China is about $1.2 billion. Today, we'll target largely the modern trade with the Lancaster product, but we also believe it should have legs with deeper penetration, and as an example, you might think of chocolate. So as we bring what we believe is a high-quality innovation to that milk candy segment, it should be good for us financially, as well as offer the consumer something unique versus what's available in the marketplace today. So we think that if we get the communication right, we believe we've got the taste texture profile right, and it's a bit of a soft launch. So we're expanding in a few cities first. It's a slow build. So I think what you'll see to part of your question is, really, '14 will be a much stronger push for us on that product. So it will be somewhat of a slow build early on. We hope to learn with that, but so far from what we've done, and this is a product, by the way, remember, we now have an R&D facility in China, and when the China R&D folks were here in the U.S., integrating into our R&D center here, that product was developed here, but it's really got developed by our China team. So we think this is -- this one has a lot of potential for us.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. And just very quick follow-up, with respect to the soft launch, I guess, does that imply that you're going to wait a while before doing any sort of broad-based awareness building advertising?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think once we feel is that we have the right level of distribution in those cities where we have the brand available, we would probably look at advertising.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, 2 quick ones. One, when you talk about the export markets being down, I realize it's probably pretty small, but is that a function of the India business and the anniversary of that JV not working out or...","John P. Bilbrey","No. Eric, it really has to do with what we would call unstructured versus structured markets. So exports in the structured markets is where we would be planting a flag, call it, where we would anticipate expanding a business in the future, and unstructured is really more where our brands are available because there's distributors or people who have kind of pull on that. And it really was more around those unstructured markets, where there were just some things that didn't repeat themselves that were in the base. So if you look at our total export business or if you look at that total international business, sorry, probably about 1\/3 of that is the export piece, and then that's split again one more time between structured and unstructured. And so, again, I would just come back to the way I looked at it was the real focus markets that we had, we felt very good about the results we got.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just kind of a bigger picture, longer-term question, Mondelez's CFO at our conference in June pretty much kind of like his statement, and maybe you read it in our report, was regarding emerging market investments and spending or M&A, what have you, his quote was \"The time is now and the window is closing.\" How do you -- like how do you think about that within the context of competition increasing in those markets for either local assets or share gains, and I think the company's obviously done far better than it's ever done in getting into the international marketplace. So for you, is it -- this is just absolutely critical and even if others do some irrational stuff around share, you just -- you have to answer? I mean, how do you -- how do we think about comments like that?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. Eric, I really think about the quality of the activities we have as being important. So as we look at assets, it really has to be the right assets versus just racing to have something. And we've really learned over time that if we don't execute against our basic business model that we're succeeding behind in each of these markets, we just don't do that well and you don't have a sustainable position. So I actually believe that for us, it's so important that we continue to respect the fact we've got this very, very precious North American business, which is a real engine for us. We don't want to get out of balance or ahead of ourselves in a way that we can't recover. And so just as you look at our approach in China, while I always have urgency to go faster, I don't ever go faster than I think we can execute against our model. And because for us, that's all real net growth, doing it well and having a business that when we come out of invest mode or get more into a going-type operation, we can make money. So I'm far more interested in the quality of our expansion than I am the quantity of the expansion. And I'll just take advantage of this time to remind us that there's probably some legacy businesses that we felt pretty good about not participating in around the world. So for us, I think you'll continue to see a real focus on trying to get it right. We've got a lot of work in front of us. We think we're in the right markets. And when we get those right or we think there's opportunity, we'll expand but we'll do it in a way that we can continue to deliver over time quality financial results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I want to know, on Brookside, one of the surprising things for me is that it's a product that no one else seems to be copying right now. I don't see it in any other brand names, and it's really good dark chocolate over some pretty sharp flavors of fruit. And I wanted to know, how big of a market do you think you're really targeting here in terms of consumers? Like if Hershey chocolate targets just about everyone, it seems -- this seems to be a smaller subset of that market because the flavors are pretty sharp, and to be fair, it creates some mouth fatigue, some of the flavors create some mouth fatigue because they are sharp, and I want to know, do you think of it is as a niche category or do you think of it as a really broad category in terms of when you do your consumer work?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, we actually think of it as a fairly broad, appealing brand both geographically, as well as within the demand landscape. So you have a couple of things going for this brand. You have the hand-to-mouth occasion. You have the halo effect of the anti-oxidant value of dark chocolate, and then the super fruit packed in the centers that consumers -- that resonates with consumers. So we think it's in a unique position across the landscape, and we also have a point of view that the positioning in concept could be broad. And so we always are asking ourselves, where could you go with this? Now that's definitely out in front of us. We have to succeed with the base proposition and define with the consumers what Brookside stands for, but we internally are quite encouraged by what we think is possible with this brand with all the consumer research that we've done. So that's how we think about it.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So you haven't heard any consumers coming back to you saying some of the flavors are sharp, and as a result, you can't pop into your mouth on an ongoing basis. It's not an issue for people?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, the good news is, is that, so far, it appears like people are -- to use your words, popping it in their mouth pretty broadly, and so that's what we would hope would continue to happen. As we look -- but more seriously, as we look at our likes and dislikes in consumer complaints and things like that, it's simply not something we've seen so far, but -- and hopefully, we don't, and we think, over time, there's the possibility to expand across other types of flavors and so forth. And we have a new initiative that will be coming up that you'll see in 2014 that begins to look at different types of centers and things around that same brand concept. So good heads up. We obviously have all of our antenna up -- but so far, that hasn't been an issue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wanted to ask a little bit more about the strength in the U.S. portfolio. Maybe there's kind of 2 questions wrapped up here into this question on the U.S. second quarter results. Our measured channel data was certainly indicating, I think something of a little bit stronger than what you reported. And I think this is just going to be the difference between shipments and retail sell-through, but if you could make some comments on that, that would be important. And then related to this overall strength in the U.S., frankly, we've seen something in our data that I just haven't seen in a long time with GOODBAR, HEATH, SYMPHONY and other brands that are kind of down the list of the big guys performing extremely well. Can you talk about execution and sustainability?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, so first of all, I think a couple of the comments you've made are probably directionally correct. We're seeing that our U.S. business contributed about 80% of the total net sales growth in the quarter. And what was very encouraging about that is the core brands performed very, very well in addition to what was occurring on our innovation. So really, we were hitting across all cylinders. If you recall, Dave, we had talked about how we've been rotating advertising support across some of those portfolio brands that we have that, I think, in years past, just because our overall approach, we weren't able to get much attention. And those brands, they typically have limited numbers of SKUs. They're really nice sized businesses, and they've responded very, very well to advertising. So I think our approach about rotating advertising across those brands, giving them some attention, is really what you're seeing that's causing some of that nice performance. And then again, we've continued to invest in our selling capabilities, and we've been very focused against having the common distribution, I'll call it, across more SKUs, across smaller retail outlets versus maybe sometimes seeing a mix of that distribution so -- that you'd see a more focused effort against what's in the store and then how we activate it is more broad than had been historically, and that's part of what's helping drive our business.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It sounds like top-notch execution. One final question -- go ahead, I'm sorry.","David W. Tacka","I was just going to address your question with respect to the retail movement versus our factory sales. And you're right, there's a timing difference between that, but some of the retail movement that you're seeing is also part of the -- what we're seeing that caused us to raise our sales guidance.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Very clear. Final question for me. J.P., did you say that Brookside was temporarily capacity constrained? I think you were saying that by -- the comment about the phasing of when capacity comes on and how amazing the repeat rates have been. But was the conclusion that may be for a very short period of time here, it's been a little bit capacity-constrained, but that goes away going forward?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, so far, David, we've been able to make it broadly available, but we've had to be very conscious about doing that. So we could, at this point in time, be merchandising the brand more aggressively than we currently are so that we can make the brand broadly available, and our capacity ensures that people can begin activating at a greater rate than they are today. We haven't been creating out of stocks as the brand has been available, but we've just been measured to make sure that everybody that wants it can get it, and then we do believe as we go further throughout the year, our capacity catches up. And obviously, we would love nothing more than to be creating even additional capacity if that's what's required.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on your international growth, it remains really robust. Now you've talked about M&A as an enabler of expansion in the past. Given your organic success, is it causing you to revisit the prioritization of M&A?","John P. Bilbrey","I don't think so. We really look for opportunities to build capabilities, and the capabilities would be around distribution, manufacturing, and if appropriate, certainly, brands. So it's really a parallel effort for us. And kind of to the other question around raise the assets, we think what's really important is regardless of any assets we would look at, having the ability to execute our model to build awareness and build brands is really what we believe is the right way to succeed. So I hope that we'll continue to be able to assess things we think are good for our company as we look at different opportunities, and at the same time, we're going to make the right investments around growing our business organically.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Back to the U.S. real quick. I just talked with a few people in the industry recently who've expressed some concern about the impact of front-of-pack labeling and what it may mean to the growth trajectory. What have you learned from other markets, where this has been implemented for a number of years? Have you seen an impact on growth rates? Do you think it could impact the growth rate for the category of your business as you roll this out?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. As we've looked at the data on front-of-pack labeling, there does not seem to be a negative effect because there's front-of-pack labeling. And conversely you could probably say the same thing. As a company, we're not against what I would describe a right to know what is in the food of the consumers. It's a fairly logical question. How you execute against that and how you remain contemporary with questions consumers may have is what I think will be important over time. GMA is certainly looking at this. Our specific industry is looking at this. And as you get into the smaller pack types, you really have to ask yourself how meaningful or how much clutter can be added to the front-of-the-pack versus branding. So we're a branding-driven company. We wouldn't want to see things that de-track from branding, but frankly, I don't think the initiatives that we've seen today really do that. But what we have to be careful of is, is the intent of these things really driven at creating clarity in decision-making for consumers or are there other types of things that play in and so we're supportive of the efforts that GMA has put forth so far. At the same time, it's my personal opinion that there are probably more elegant solutions of how we create, call it, a portal or a place for consumers to go to, to better understand food with facts that are supported by generally accepted science so that they get the right information and can make the best decisions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Thinking about the alliance with Ferrero here, any updates there in terms of activities or progress on that front?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, the project that we've talked about is, is that we have this joint distribution project in Canada. It's really driven by a pre-competitive type of agreement, where we can create efficiencies around the supply chain. And at this point in time, that's really what we've worked on there. And as you see around the world, there are different alliances and things that manufacturers look at that are all pre-competitive that may make sense, be it packaging, purchasing and other types of things. And so we're very open-minded to those things on a going basis.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Really quick, I know everyone wants to jump onto a different call here. You said the chocolate category in China, if I heard you correctly, is up 11% year-to-date. Is that a slowdown in any way? I thought, last year, maybe it was up closer to 15%, but I just wanted to make sure of that data.","John P. Bilbrey","Ken, I don't have the exact number there. I'm more than happy to get it to you via Mark following the call. I think that the important thing to think about with China is, is that, today, there's maybe 300 million or 400 million people that participate in the category versus the total country. And so we believe brand awareness, category building is still very, very relevant and strong in China over time. So if there was a short-term change, I wouldn't read frankly anything into it and it certainly doesn't change in any way how we think about the potential of the market.","Mark K.

All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note, this call may be recorded. Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Erica. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's third quarter 2017 conference call. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC.","If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","As a result, we will discuss third quarter 2017 results, excluding net pre-tax charges of $7.8 million, or $0.05 per share-diluted, which are primarily related to business realignment cost, derivative mark-to-market losses and non-service-related pension expense. These charges are defined in the Appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.TheHersheyCompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.","And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Michele Buck.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you on the phone and the webcast. In the third quarter, I'm pleased with our performance. We delivered growth, both in net sales and EPS, in a volatile environment. We continue to feel good about our CMG and snack strategy, as most segments within the $100 billion U.S. snack wheel remained strong and continue to outpace center of the plate trends.","As planned, constant currency net sales increased 1.1% in the third quarter. And EPS of $1.33, increased 3% versus last year. There was no change to our constant currency full year net sales outlook, and we reaffirmed full year EPS growth at the high-end of our 7% to 9% range.","As discussed previously, embedded in our outlook are important marketplace investments in the business that will benefit the company over the near and long-term, as well as some new challenges, such as higher freight and distribution, that emerged in the course of the quarter.","Patricia will have further details, but some of these, particularly the supply chain costs, pressured Q3 operating profit and are expected to continue in Q4. We believe investments in our strategic initiatives will enable the business to deliver long-term sales growth, gross margin expansion and operating profit growth, or a virtuous cycle, over our strategic planning cycle.","Advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 3.7% in Q3. Advertising expense was up 10%, partially offset by lower consumer promotions. There is no change to our full year North America advertising and related consumer marketing outlook, although International and Other segment advertising and related consumer marketing is estimated to be lower in 2017 versus 2016, resulting in total Hershey Company spend that will be about the same as last year.","Now, let me turn to our measured channel retail performance. But before I do, I want to note that this summer, we selected IRI as our preferred market insights and analytics provider. IRI has made significant investments in capabilities and technology platforms, and we believe they are a good partner for Hershey. IRI's platform will help us target the right consumers, in the right channels, at the right moment.","Total Hershey Q3 U.S. retail takeaway growth was 1%, driven by CMG growth of 1.4%. This more than offsets some softness in grocery items, such as baking chips and syrup. Looking at CMG, or candy, mint and gum, the category and Hershey continue to outpace center of the store edibles. For the 12-week and year-to-date period ending October 8, CMG category growth was plus 2.4% and plus 1.7%, respectively. Hershey Q3 and year-to-date CMG retail takeaway was plus 1.4% and plus 2%.","Our year-to-date CMG market share is up plus 0.1 points, driven by strong innovation and in-store activity in the first half of the year. Importantly, within the combined chocolate and non-chocolate candy segment, where we derive the majority of our U.S. sales, Q3 category growth is about 3.3%. Our core chocolate brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat and Kisses, continue to drive growth, and I'm particularly pleased with their marketplace performance. The combined retail takeaway on these brands in Q3 increased about 5%.","As we've discussed in prior quarters, this was partially offset by planned decline on select chocolate and non-chocolate candy brands as we focus on reducing complexity and improving overall velocity rates at retail. Therefore, the increase of Hershey's Q3 combined chocolate and non-chocolate candy retail takeaway of plus 1.1% resulted in market share being slightly off. We are working on plans to improve the performance of our non-core candy brands and look forward to sharing this with you in the near future.","Hershey's CMG and snacks innovation had another good quarter. It's my goal to ensure that on an annual basis, this strategic lever is a lever that consistently delivers meaningful, sustainable CMG and snacks growth. We continue to anticipate strong innovation as a contributor to achieve our long-term net sales growth target of 2% to 4%.","Specifically, Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, or CLC, is tracking as expected. We achieved our distribution target earlier in the year and maintain this level, given the repeat velocity at retail. CLC has been strongly supported by advertising throughout the year on TV, social and online, with continuity media planned through the rest of the year.","As we look to 2018, we'll continue to invest in this product with the launch of Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate. Shipments to select customers begin near the end of the year. Importantly, the Cookie Layer Crunch platform is Hershey's largest launch in recent history and will receive equal support in year two as it did in year one.","The transition from lay down bags to stand-up pouches on our core chocolate packaged candy products is progressing. In the fourth quarter, we'll introduce new retail-ready packaging at select retailers before a broader rollout next year. This initiative enables product to get on the shelf quicker, with less in-store labor and it improves shopability in the aisle. Both of these packaging initiatives have an impact on gross margin in Q4 and most likely in the first half of 2018, but we believe this is the right long-term investment for our brands and business, as it should result in improved shelf presence and visibility.","In Q3, we also made good progress against our snacks platform. We expanded our initial Snack Mix and Snack Bites products with the launch of Hershey's and Reese's Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels, primarily in large format take-home bags. While early, results are encouraging. Net sales growth is ahead of plan and consumer reaction is positive when our brands are merchandised in the snacks aisle.","The velocity of the Popped Snack Mix items is in line with similar competing products, while the Hershey-branded Chocolate Dipped Pretzels is outpacing competition. So we feel good about the progress we're making.","Our power chocolate brands are growing and gaining share, and we're working on plans that should enable other parts of our CMG and snacks portfolio to see gains in the near future.","As I discussed in July, e-commerce is another strategic initiative that we are focusing on. We continue to work with key brick-and-mortar retailers related to their click-and-collect and omni-channel initiatives, as well as with established e-commerce players. As a result, our year-to-date U.S. e-commerce sales are up about 40%. We have a dedicated and growing cross-functional team responsible for the strategies and execution of our e-commerce plan in developing the next generation of online impulse solutions. We're working with all the key strategic partners and will be validating and testing concepts in Q4 and 2018 that we believe will lead to a sustainable business model.","Given our strong CMG position in the U.S., we are collaboratively working with our partners to develop e-commerce-friendly portfolios, digital shelf upgrades, and alternative fulfillment solutions. And in September, we went live with a customer on the first-ever omni-channel Halloween program. Initial results are exceeding expectations, and I'm very excited about the potential for our business in this space.","Now, for an update on our International and Other segment, excluding China, our International and Other segment constant currency net sales are expected to increase this year. Net sales for the quarter were relatively in line with our estimate, and on a constant currency basis, about the same as the third quarter of 2016. We're making measured investments in our core markets of Mexico, Brazil and India, where we're seeing solid marketplace gains. Combined constant currency net sales growth in these markets was 8%, and we're improving on operating income trends at the same time.","In China, we're executing against the Margin for Growth program as we discussed on March 1. This efficiency and effectiveness initiative is progressive nicely and on track. We're optimizing our in-country supply chain and streamlining the operating model, as we strike the right balance between in-country investments and near-term market opportunities.","As expected, due to summer seasonality, the China chocolate category declined by about minus 1% and is roughly flat year-to-date. Small format stores continued to show growth, outpacing the marketplace performance in hypermarkets. Going forward, we have a measured and disciplined strategy in China that is focused on the Hershey brand's messaging, continued e-commerce penetration, and smaller store format expansion. So I'm pleased with our progress in this segment. And I expect our focus on profitable growth to result in break-even or better operating results this year.","Now to wrap up, confections is one of the largest segments within the $100 billion U.S. snack market, and we are confident that our brands and consumer-centric business model position us well to deliver sustained top and bottom-line growth over the long-term. I'm encouraged that the broader snacks category continues to grow, despite the volatile consumer and retail environment. Our strong U.S. marketplace presence and solid financial position gives us the flexibility to smartly invest in confectionery and other snacks as well as in the capabilities that give us a competitive edge at retail and with consumers.","We're committed to our marketing mix modeling, trade, TV advertising, and digital media and investments related to innovation, consumer marketing and insights. This is part of our DNA and why I remain so optimistic about Hershey and the opportunities that lie ahead of us.","As we look to 2018, it's too early to talk about details; however, we feel good about our preliminary plans. We believe we have the right level of core brand activity, innovation, and programming lined up that will continue to drive category growth, despite a shorter Easter.","Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate and upcoming Reese's innovation will bring variety and news to the category. And I'm also excited with the introduction of Hershey's Gold, Hershey's fourth flavor. Hershey's Gold features a rich cream that delivers a buttery sweet flavor and a distinctively new Hershey's experience. Its caramelize cream also includes a combination of salty crunchy bits of peanuts and pretzels that deliver a creamy, crunchy satisfaction.","The instant consumable pack type will begin to ship to only a few select customers in Q4, but you'll see it in stores more broadly in January, as merchandising and program will be tied with the Winter Olympics, which begin on February 9. We're a growth and EBIT margin-focused company with a goal of increasing margins over the long-term via both cost control and, importantly, top-line growth.","I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Thank you, Michele. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $2.033 billion increased 1.5% versus last year and includes a 0.4 point benefit from favorable foreign currency translation.","Constant currency net sales growth of 1.1% was in line with our estimate. Gains were primarily driven by the North America segment and the success of new products.","Adjusted earnings per share-diluted came in at $1.33, an increase of about 3% versus last year, driven by our higher sales and the positive impact of the Margin for Growth program savings related to International and Other operating income improvements.","Volume was a 0.7 point contribution to sales growth, and net price realization was a 0.4 point benefit. In Q2, we lapped the acquisition of barkTHINS, which is on track with our plans.","By segment, North America net sales increased 1.6% versus the same period last year, including favorable foreign currency translation of 0.3 points. Volume was a 1.6 point contribution, and net price realization, 0.3 points unfavorable.","We were pleased with North America segment sales performance, which benefited from core brand growth. Innovation, including Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, as well as the launch of Hershey's and Reese's Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels.","Total International and Other segment net sales for the third quarter increased 0.8% versus last year. Excluding the 1.3 point impact of favorable foreign currency exchange, International and Other segment net sales declined 0.5% versus the year-ago period. Volume was off 5.2 points due to planned declines in China, and net price realization was a 4.7 point benefit.","Turning to margins, adjusted gross profit increased about 1%, resulting in adjusted gross margin of 45.3%, a decline of 30 basis points versus the third quarter of last year. Lower input costs and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable sales mix and higher freight and increased levels of manufacturing and distribution costs, primarily related to the packaging initiatives that Michele mentioned and the company's focus on maintaining service targets at faster-growing retail customers.","For the full year, we expect adjusted gross margin to increase about 25 basis points versus our previous outlook of about 50 basis points. The change is primarily driven by the higher freight, new packaging and customer service costs. And given our supply chain structure and our focus on strategic customers, this could be a gross margin headwind in the first half of 2018.","Adjusted operating profit in the third quarter of $446.9 million was about the same as the year-ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 22%, a decline of 30 basis points. As expected, the increase in gross profit, as well as SG&A productivity and cost savings at the corporate level, were offset by the planned investments in the business discussed last quarter, as well as higher go-to-market expenses and employee-related costs.","And, as Michele mentioned, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 3.7% versus the third quarter of 2016, as advertising expense increased 10%, partially offset by lower consumer promotions. The third quarter 5.3% increase in North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense was in line with our forecast.","Now, let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. On a constant currency basis, net sales declined 0.5% and was relatively in line with our forecast. The China supply chain transformation is on track, with the majority of the work expected to be complete by the end of 2018. The reorganization within SG&A functions, which began last quarter, is progressing. The benefit from this work is evident in the improvement in segment operating income.","Our SKU analysis and optimization efforts are on track, and we'll look to leverage this work going forward as we focus on five strategic initiatives that should improve our top and bottom-line trends. Specifically, the team is looking to: drive Hershey brands' SKU conversion; Hershey innovation; to optimize channel growth, focusing on small formats; and focus on key strategic accounts; and our e-commerce.","We expect China chocolate category sales in brick-and-mortar to be flat to slightly up for the full year 2017, while e-commerce is forecasted to grow around 15%. As expected, given our SKU optimization, our chocolate performance has lagged in brick-and-mortar; however, our online retail takeaway is up for the year-to-date period.","Looking at our other focus markets, we continue to be please with our efforts in Mexico, Brazil and India, where combined constant currency net sales in these three countries increased 8%. Third quarter International and Other segment operating income of $16.4 million increased nicely. It was driven by the implementation of the Margin for Growth program and the timing of select investments and expenses. Therefore, we expect Q4 operating results in this segment to be similar to last year.","As we stated previously, we are driving a strong profit-focused mentality in this segment and are beginning to see the bottom-line trend improve, and we expect International and other segment operating income to be at least breakeven this year.","In Mexico, chocolate progress continues, with solid double-digit retail takeaway. For the year-to-date period, we slightly outpaced category growth and gained share. Q3 constant currency net sales in Mexico increased by about 10%, driven by a combination of volume and pricing. Sales were strong across key brands, particularly Kisses and Hershey's milk drink box. Our new Hershey's choco-yogo product continues to gain trial, with repeat in line with our expectations.","In Brazil, our team is focused on profitable growth, despite the challenging operating environment. Q3 constant currency net sales increased 3.3%. We estimate that year-to-date chocolate category growth in Brazil is about 13%. Our retail takeaway was about two times the category growth rate, fueled by both distribution gains and higher velocities, resulting in a market share gain of about 0.5 point.","Constant currency net sales in India increased 16% and slightly exceeded our plan. Growth in the brands we're investing behind continues to be solid. Our transition of the India portfolio is enabling a higher margin business, and we are on track to expand gross margins here by 1,000 basis points in 2017. This is enabling adjustments in the local marketplace that should result in a sustainable operating model.","Moving down the P&L, third quarter interest expense of $24.6 million was in line with last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $95 million to $100 million range.","The adjusted tax rate in the third quarter of 2017 was 30.4% versus 30.7% in the year-ago period. For the full year, we anticipate that the effective tax rate will be towards the high end of the 26.5% to 27% outlook we discussed last quarter.","In 2017, we expect other income and expense related to tax credits to be about $65 million versus our previous estimate of $60 million. For the third quarter of 2017, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 213.4 million shares, resulting in adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $1.33, or an increase of 3.1% versus a year ago.","Total capital additions, including software, in the third quarter and year-to-date period, were $64 million and $149 million, respectively. For the full year, we expect that CapEx will be in the $260 million to $275 million range versus the previous estimate of $270 million to $290 million. During the third quarter, adjusted depreciation and amortization was $62 million, and we paid $136 million in dividends.","On August 23, the Board of Directors approved and the company announced that it purchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock from the Hershey Trust Company for approximately $159 million, or $106 per share. The company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization.","This morning, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an additional $100 million share repurchase program that will commence after the current program is completed. This authorization is a result of the company's strong balance sheet and confidence that we'll deliver long-term earnings per share-diluted growth of 6% to 8%. Additionally, in the third quarter and year-to-date period, the company repurchased $41 million and $141 million, respectively, of common shares to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.","Now to summarize, as Michele stated, we are focused on our consumer-centric business model and on driving growth and margin expansion, with the right level of investment. And while we're excited about the launch of Hershey's Gold and Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate, the Q4 sales of these products are not expected to be as great as the Cookie Layer Crunch fourth quarter 2016 sell-in.","Consumer uncertainty persists across several geographies. We're pushing hard in export markets such as Asia and the Caribbean, where some Q4 challenges have cropped up. We believe, however, that the plans we have in place will enable us to achieve our full year constant currency sales target of around 1.25%. Exchange rates continue to fluctuate, and we now expect the impact on full year sales to be minimal versus our previous outlook of 25 basis points unfavorable.","As we have implied in prior calls, input costs are lower this year; however, the supply chain costs I discussed earlier are greater than our previous estimate. Therefore, expected full year adjusted gross margin expansion is about 25 basis points.","The Margin for Growth program is progressing, and we continue to expect 2017 savings of about $25 million. Combined with advertising and related consumer marketing, it should be about the same as last year, and a slightly higher tax rate towards the top end of the range, we continue to expect 2017 adjusted earnings per share-diluted growth to be around the high end of our 7% to 9% target.","Thank you for your time this morning. And I'll now turn it back over to Michele for some closing comments.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Thanks, Patricia. I just want to start by thanking all of our employees for those solid Q3 results that we delivered. As you've heard me say before, in an environment of accelerating change, I see opportunity. And I'm optimistic about our future. We are focused on what we need to do to succeed. Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong. Our executive management team and the Board of Directors are confident that we'll continue to build value for all Hershey shareholders.","So thank you. And now, we will open it up for any questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to the line of Ken Goldman. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Hey, Ken.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","You had talked about spending more on your customers for maintaining some of their service targets. Can you elaborate on this a bit? And the reason I'm asking is we're hearing about Walmart and Kroger meeting with U.S. food companies to really make sure that out-of-stocks are limited. So I guess I'm curious and I know you don't necessarily know what's happening with some other food companies, but from your perspective, do you think this pressure is specific to Hershey? Or do you think the pressure, if there is any pressure, really, to maintain these customer service targets, is something more broad-based around food that we should be aware of?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. So let me talk a little bit broadly, and I'll also talk about Hershey in particular. So first of all, yeah, customer service rates are critically important to our customers in the marketplace right now. And I think, certainly, as there is a pressured consumer retail environment, we all want to capture every sale that we possibly can.","So, as a result of that, we believe it was a strategically-good decision for us to really focus and up our performance on customer fill even higher, even if it meant some additional investments in moving product around a bit more. So I would say that that is an overall theme in the industry between retailers and manufacturers that we are all jointly working on together.","I'll also tell you, if I speak to Hershey specifically, there are a couple pressures that we had. So you can see the strong growth that we have in our core brands and have continued to have all year long, has actually put pressure on activity (30:14) across our system. And we have made decisions to move product around a bit more to make sure we don't lose any of those sales as we invest in manufacturing capacity to expand our capabilities on those brands.","Some of the innovation that we've had on our business as well has necessitated a few more touches and a few more additional shipments that drove some cost for us. Some of the multi-component products like Snack Mix, for example, where you're moving multiple ingredients to make the products. And then also some of our packaging initiatives that we believe are critically important in the marketplace, which, on a temporary basis, create some additional inventory across the system.","And then I think you're aware, you've probably heard others talk about that, going forward, there are some additional pressures just across freight, given tightening capacity in the short-term. There were some weather-related issues. And over the longer-term, I think there are some trucking-related, trucker availability issues and capacity that are emerging and starting to impact, as well as some new regulatory changes that we believe is going to create pressure on the availability of truckers as well.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And thank you very much for that detail. Very quick one for me, you talked about the sales mix maybe hurting your gross margin a little bit. How much of that, if at all, was related to some weak C-store trends we're seeing, not necessarily for you but across the board?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yes. I mean, certainly, we've seen that the C-store retail community has talked about some of the pressures that they felt in their stores and trips not being where they would like them to be. So we certainly sell a lot of instant consumables there. So we are always anxious to have strong trips into that environment. So certainly, that has an impact. I would say there's a few other places where we're expanding the portfolio across snacking that also have a lower margin than our core items. And certainly things like Snack Mix, which I think have very viable and successful in the marketplace, create a little pressure on mix as well.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Yes. And, Ken, just one more point to remember, we did talk about the top-line in the second quarter and would had reflected the trends we were seeing in the C-store at that time.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Rob Moskow. Please go ahead.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Rob, you there?","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Oh, sorry. Yeah, thanks. I could be modeling this a bit off, but I'm trying to figure out what your guidance implies for operating income in fourth quarter. It looks to be down double-digit, if I got the tax rate right. So did I get that right? And is there anything specific about fourth quarter on the comparisons that caused that? I know you had a tough comp to last year's Cookie Layer Crunch launch. Thanks.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, thanks. Yeah, I think that's the biggest impact you're really seeing is that tough comp to last year (33:37) impact. That's really the biggest driver that we have. We also have \u2013 fourth (33:42) quarter's our time when we typically spend a fair amount of advertising in China as well. That's always a fourth quarter drag on our performance. And we do have really strong advertising performance that we're expecting in the fourth quarter in our U.S. business related to our new product innovation.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So it's higher advertising? That's what makes this quarter different from the other quarters?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Well, and the sell-in on Cookie Layer Crunch.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","That's the implication in your model. Sales are obviously down in the fourth quarter. We planned it that way, Rob, going back to July, as we stated in the remarks, you have some of these gross margin pressures in the third quarter, certainly, you'll have for all of the fourth quarter. You'll be seeing more of the packaging that we talked to ship more in the fourth quarter than the third, as third is highly weighted, obviously, more towards Halloween.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And can I ask a follow-up about 2018? I know it's early, but we're all watching cocoa commodity costs and seeing all this deflation, hopefully, benefiting your business. It seems to me that that benefit could be quite a bit bigger than the drags you're talking about on freight and on mix. Maybe it's early to talk about those things, but could you give us a sense of, just broadly, whether you're still thinking about gross margin expansion in 2018.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Patricia, do you want to talk about that a little bit?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. We always want to expand our gross margin. In terms of commodities, in general, as we like to remind you, we hedge out 3 to 24 months. So we're not going to ever see us completely follow the market on cocoa. We're going to bleed that in over the next couple years. And, in fact, we already had said that we had lower input costs this year. So we've already captured some of that reduction in cocoa. We see other commodities that continue to actually be up, so the mix basket is certainly moderating that reduction in cocoa prices.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of David Driscoll. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, thank you and good morning.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Wanted to ask a little bit more about the retail inventory levels. I believe that on the last call, you talked about second quarter shipments coming in ahead of consumption. I think we estimated that as something like two percentage points. In the quarter, it doesn't look like there was a big difference between shipments and consumption. So I'm just wondering about the inventories at retail. Do you expect it to have a negative impact in the fourth quarter relative to your shipments? Just where do things stand?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So, David, we continue to expect that at the end of the year, our inventory and our retail takeaway will be aligned. Third quarter has been a little bit of a messy quarter relative to all those weather impacts that occurred. And actually, even being able to get the available data from a Nielsen or an IRI to really feel confident, given some of the stores that have been closed down, et cetera, and then also with seasons. So I think the best way to think about it is that we anticipate them to be fully aligned by the end of the year.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. And looking at your things to make, (37:12) David, for the fourth quarter, while it won't look like the third quarter at all on the top line, we expect takeaway to be positive in the fourth quarter.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. That's really helpful. A follow-up on the C-stores, our data actually does show that C-stores have been weakening for Hershey. And I'm just curious if you could just develop a little bit more why. I think you were talking about trips before. Is it just trip issues or is there anything specific to your products in C-stores? And then, just do you have any...?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, David. If you look at our full year plan, our plan was a bit more front-loaded. And particularly, if you looked at C-store, we are lapping an unusually strong period year ago on instant consumable innovation when we had the Kit Kat Big Kat and as well as the Reese's Pieces Cup. And so the category was looking good in third quarter. And we have a tough lap, though, particularly because of the year-ago innovation in instant consumable and that's the biggest thing impacting us.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Steve Strycula. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Quick question for gross margins, just want to clarify, against the cocoa benefit that you guys will be facing, you also commented about incremental headwinds related to supply chain persisting into next year. When we net the two together, should we still think of like a similar type of gross margins trending lower when you mention pressure for the first half of next year, or should we just expect more muted gross margin gains? Thank you.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","This is Patricia. I think that we always want to be more (39:08) gross margin, but, yeah, we do see them as being more muted based on the points that you made. We'll be giving our guidance next year with more specificity.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Steve?","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, that was it for me.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Jonathan Feeney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. Just one; Patricia, could you maybe give us some more detail on what are the mix factors, either by channel or product, that you called out in your commentary and their approximate magnitude, as far as their impact on gross margin, both this year and going forward? Thank you.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. I think we've touched a few of them already in the call. So, first of all, we are seeing some impacts from our expected and very successful Snack Mix products, or similar products like that, that are pressured gross margin. Nothing is as profitable, we always say, as our core of our core products. But we do need to expand our portfolio. And then, also, some of the things that we've already touched on around the general mix between instant consumable and other types, between seasons, instant consumable is also a little bit of a pressure on us as well.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Is it about in that order of magnitude? And are there any other channel impacts going from C-store, which is presumably underperforming, as Dave and you mentioned, versus to other channels?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","I think of it more as an instant consumable impact, frankly, than a channel-driven one.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Andrew Lazar. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning everybody.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Of some of the negative impacts to gross margin, as you talked about, that might persistent a little bit into 2018, freight, packaging, some of the service targets, mix, I was hoping maybe you could dimensionalize those a bit, if there are ones that are of larger impact versus some of the others. And maybe if there's any way you can help quantify a little bit their impact in this quarter, it can help us a little bit with the way we think about how 2018 can play out.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Yeah, Andrew, I mean, for various competitive reasons, I'm not sure we want to get into the magnitude of each one of these. We all have different levels of investments with customers and how we service them.","As you look to 2018, certainly, we started the initiative you're seeing here in the third quarter. So you will see in the first six months of 2018, a pressure on gross margin. I'm not saying gross margin's up or down in the first half for 2018. We'll give more specificity, obviously, in January. Commodities, we have deflation this year. You know there are some that are going to be up all the time, even as it relates to next year. Some that are going to be down as it relates to next year. We're a gross margin-focused company. We need that to work to keep investing in the model and get the virtuous cycle that Michele referred to. So I mean, I think, overall, we feel pretty good about our long-term outlook.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you. And then, Michele, you had mentioned some of the other non-core chocolate and candy brands are the ones that you'll be talking a little bit more about going forward. But maybe you can give us a little insight into maybe what some of the issues are with some of those brands. Was it just lack of appropriate innovation or effective innovation? Or maybe what some of the issues have been around why those have been a bit more of a drag?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","No, absolutely. So if you think about our total portfolio, if you think about the baking piece of the portfolio, chips and syrup, I think, saw some of the similar trends that we've seen with other center of store categories, so some pressure there. We spoke earlier this year relative to us having a focus to right-size our snacking portfolio and really focus more in a precision approach, so some of that right-sizing. And then, as it comes to what we call our variety chocolate brands and sweets, we've been working on optimizing our consumer communication and investments there to stabilize and get some growth out of those brands.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Jason English. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for allowing me to ask a question. I actually have two questions; first, a bit more strategic and then one a bit more tactical. Patricia, I think you referenced and, Michele, you've referenced many times, your portfolio diversification strategy. And if I go back to your Analyst Day, there was quite a bit of focus on trying to spread your wings beyond just your core CMG space. And you've done it with a little bit of innovation. Where do we sit on that now? Where do we sit in terms of the ambition, the progress? And you mentioned your clean balance sheet. Could we expect to see you utilize that to try to accelerate some of those initiatives outside of the core CMG space?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. So we remain committed to our strategy of being an innovative snacking powerhouse and really a focus on capturing more snacking occasions and appealing to new users within snacking. And, yes, I think we're continuing to execute against the strategies that we've laid out relative to innovation, leveraging our core brands in areas like Snack Mix, which we're really pleased with the results; barkTHINS, which is up, I think, 50% this year, which has also been a nice addition. And as we look at our priorities overall, we've always stated that M&A is a key piece of that. And you've seen us execute against that over the past couple years. So I would expect that that would continue to be a piece of how we look to deliver that expansion.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. So turning quickly to the second question, you mentioned some sort of top-line drag from SKU rationalization, portfolio optimization, clean-up, et cetera. We don't really see evidence in the data yet. As a matter of fact, your total distribution points are up overall. They're up in chocolate. They're up in non-chocolate candy. They're up baking, gum. So I guess the question there is one of cadence. Has this been sort of a recent thrust that maybe hasn't yet shown up in the data, and therefore, is likely going to be a drag on the go-forward?","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Yes. Jason, this is Mark. I mean, I think you heard us reference some of this in March 1 as well. I mean, I think as a matter of practice, we're always doing this and you're seeing selective SKUs come out. Not every piece of innovation that we have will be on the shelf for three, four, four or five years. So there is a cycle to offset so that when (46:51) some of this comes off, we have something there to replace it. But sometimes, the velocity of what it's replacing versus the velocity of what's coming is, isn't always, always, always equal. And you may see some of that play out over time here in the next year or two, as you look at the velocity of some of the snack stuff in CMG. When you think...","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","I was going to say, I think it might just be hard to look at total distribution points because there is so much noise in those distribution points. So we've had an active SKU rationalization program where we are eliminating merchandising SKUs, many smaller things. At the same time, we have our stand-up packaging initiative in the marketplace, which put new SKUs in place, which we think are very productive SKUs. And so there's a little bit \u2013 both of those things going on at the same time that I think is getting muted in the total numbers, too.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you, guys. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Rob Dickerson. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. This is Kiniko (48:04) on for Rob. I just had a quick question for you. We recently heard a large U.S. confection player state in their recent earnings result that there has been a retailer push ahead of Halloween. So I was just trying to get a sense of what do you make of that in terms of the overall, I guess, promotional backdrop? Was there more promotional activity? Are retailers trying to drive traffic even more so this year, particularly with branded candy? And do you expect this to persist going into Q4?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So I think that we always see retailers really try and leverage seasons as a destination to bring consumers into their store environments. And I think that this year is no different, from that perspective. I would say, I would remind you that we have continued to see over the past several years a lot of compression around the holidays. So with Halloween being on Tuesday, it's hard to get a total feel for what the season will shake out like. But I think that overall merchandising, we're seeing very strong collaboration with retailers, as we have in the past. So I can't say we've seen a really big change there. I think we see the retailer continuing to use the seasons as they have.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, great. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Alexia Howard. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Can I ask about the pricing dynamics in North America? Your pricing is down, I think, 0.3% in the region this quarter. We've been hearing about it being more challenging out there, with retailers pushing back on pricing. I imagine that that's either a mix effect or maybe tweaking promotional activity year-on-year. Could you just comment on how competitive things are out there and maybe even if you can't comment on exactly pricing strategy from here, how you expect the shape of that to develop going forward? Thank you.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","You know, we have had a continuous focus, as we've talked to you before, about building strategic revenue management capabilities. Our big focus has continuously been being even more effective and efficient with our promotional dollars.","And so, I think the movement that you would see in the marketplace, at least from us, would be around us really trying to get tighter about the best promotional programs and price points that maximize driving top-line, but at the most profitable levels, so that we're not getting ineffective deflation, but we're using price to maximize revenue.","And I think that continues to be a focus for us. Certainly, I think in a pressured environment, some elements of the market are looking at whether price can bring in more consumers. But I think that everybody's also looking at that in a very balanced way, which is unless price is really driving incrementality, then it's deflation that has no benefit. So, I think that's what we're really seeing in the marketplace. And our focus, clearly, is on making every dollar count, getting smarter about what really drives the performance.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of John Baumgartner. Please go ahead.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for the question. Good morning.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Good morning.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Michele, just curious in terms of the retail landscape, you mentioned that some of the snack section is being merchandised in the snacks aisle. So I guess first off, do you have a sense from your consumer segmentation work or from retail observations, are the salty snacks categories where share is kind of being sourced to make way for this snack section?","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So as we look at our broad snacking strategy, clearly, the goal of expanding occasions is to drive incremental purchase and to source more broadly across that snacking wheel. And, yes, I would say we do do research and analytics to try and understand how we can best develop propositions that will add incrementally to our portfolio. So that's definitely a key area of focus for us.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And can you speak to the promotion and some of the merchandising protocols in that snacking aisle? I mean, how are the interactions different with the consumers and retailers from confectionery? It seems that that salty snack space is a lot more fragmented.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","So I think where we are gaining some placement, it is an area that's more fragmented. And certainly, one approach that we're trying to do is to leverage the strengths that we've built over the years around category management to help the retailers to make that section as productive as possible to bring some of the great innovation that we've been known for in the confection category and provide news and exciting propositions in that segment to generate interest and bring new shoppers there. So our focus is really, just as it is within confection, how do we drive the category there and bring incrementality.","If I think about the competition, I think national players always tend to be pretty strong wherever they're established. And I think it sometimes more the regional players that experience pressure in those scenarios.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So are you finding the shelf space is a bit more expensive in that snacks aisle and that's part of the negative margin mix of the snacks section business?","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Patricia has always said, nothing is going to ever be as profitable as a candy bar, if you're looking at its absolute margin. So, I mean, as it relates to everything else in that aisle, I would probably say no. But as it relates to our portfolio, obviously, nothing is as profitable as a candy bar, right?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","So it's that more than the mix around shelf space. It's not a shelf space issue. It's just a fundamental value proposition all the way through our chain.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","Yes.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Ken Zaslow. Please go ahead.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Hi, Ken.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to understand the CapEx, you reduced it a little bit. Was there something to think about there? Is it just a refinement? Is it putting projects into next year? And then, can you just talk about some of the key capital projects that you have?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Yeah. This is Patricia. I'll take that one. So, as we told you, we're embarking on a multi-year replacement of our ERP system and some associated projects. As is typical in the early days of refining that, we just moved some money out on that. It really is related to making sure that we're putting the right resources against those systems and fine-tuning the best way to do that. That's really the biggest impact of the CapEx reduction.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. So there's nothing to read into it. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","Just the normal adjustments of big systems projects, I would say.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.","Okay, thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Erin Lash.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you for taking the question. I kind of want to touch on capital priorities, cash priorities, particularly in light of a major confectionery player pursuing strategic alternatives for their confectionery offerings in the U.S. and just kind get your sense. I know you won't comment specifically on that transaction, but just your sense for the overall acquisition environment, the multiples that sellers are looking for and basically your appetite to do a deal.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","I would just say we've stated before that M&A is a piece of our capital strategy. We're particularly interested in companies with accelerating revenue growth, primarily within the U.S. $100 billion snack wheel. And certainly, are interested in companies that either complement our confectionery portfolio, our snacks business or our go-to-market. Patricia, anything you want to add to that?","Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.","No. There's really been no change in our priorities from a (56:52) capital perspective in terms of investing in the business, and making sure we return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. There's really been no change in that approach.","Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.","And I think we're just always looking for propositions that are \u2013 everything we do is around creating shareholder value, whether it's on our base business or M&A. So that's always our lens.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","To the extent that you have looked at deals up till now, do you feel like the premiums being proposed by sellers are reasonable or inflated? Any sense there would be helpful.","Michele G.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Hershey Fourth Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mark Pogharian, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Mark K. Pogharian","Thank you, Laura. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter 2011 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Bert Alfonso, Executive Vice President, CFO and Chief Administrative Officer; and I, will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We welcome those of you listening via the webcast.","Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2010 filed with the SEC.","If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.","As we said within the Note, the company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.","We will discuss fourth quarter results excluding net pretax charges of $27.7 million, which are primarily related to Project Next Century. Our discussion of 2011 full-year results exclude net pretax charges of $32.1 million primarily associated with Project Next Century and a gain on sale of non-core trademark licensing rights recorded in the third quarter. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges and non-service-related pension expenses. ","With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P.","John P. Bilbrey","Thanks, Mark. I'm pleased with Hershey's fourth quarter and full-year financial and marketplace results, which represent a solid end to another good year. We accomplished our 2011 objectives while growing adjusted EPS 10.6%, our third consecutive year of a double-digit percentage increase. We achieved this in what was again a very challenging environment that included global economic uncertainty and difficult consumer conditions, commodities spot market price increases and volatility and the implementation and execution of a major price increase. The implementation of our March 30 price increase continues. We're analyzing conversion closely. And on the portion of the business where the shelf price reflects the increase were tracking as expected.","The speed of conversion varies by channel and is consistent with what we've experienced historically and versus our modeling. Net volume elasticity on these pack types is in line with our expectations and better than the historical staples group average. ","As we look to Easter, the first season where price points will be higher, as expected, retailers are working collaboratively with our headquarter and in-store sales associates. The seasons, Easter, Halloween and holiday are important to Hershey, as well as retailers, as it brings consumers into the store.","We believe we have the right mix of seasonal-specific advertising, coupons and programming lined up to help consumers adjust to the new price points. As had been the case all year in channels measured by syndicated data, the CMG category, that's candy, mint and gum, outpaced the historical 3% to 4% category growth rate, increasing 4.5%. CMG also outpaced other snack alternatives in 2011 again such as salty snacks, cookies and crackers, which all grew less than 3%. Overall, confectionery continues to grow, driven by a balance of pricing and investment in the category in the form of both innovation and advertising. As a result, in 2012, we would expect CMG category growth will be above the historical annual growth rate of 3% to 4%.","For the full-year 2011, net sales increased 7.2% and was balanced between volume and net price realization. In the fourth quarter, net sales were primarily driven by pricing. We're especially pleased that the volume sequentially improved from last quarter, slightly greater than our expectations and increased about 0.4 points. ","In terms of Hershey's marketplace performance, for the 12 and 52 weeks ending December 31, 2011, per our custom database in channels that account for over 80% of our retail business, total Hershey's CMG retail consumer takeaway was up a solid 6.5% and 7.8%. As a reminder, these channels include food, drug, mass, including Wal-Mart and convenience stores.","Within food, drug, mass and convenience or FDMxC, here, excluding Wal-Mart, the CMG category also continues to grow. For the 12 and 52 weeks ending December 31, 2011, the CMG category increased 4.4% and 4.5%. Hershey's FDMxC retail takeaway for the fourth quarter and full year was 6% and 7.5%, respectively. As a result, our market share increased by 0.4 points in the fourth quarter and 0.8 points for the full-year 2011. ","For the overall Halloween and holiday seasons, as expected in Q4, FDMx total combined seasonal category retail sales were up. Specifically, Q4 seasonal category sales increased 4.2%. Hershey Q4 seasonal retail takeaway was up 5.8%, resulting in a 0.5-point market share gain. For the full-year 2011, in the food class-of-trade, the CMG category grew 3.2%. Hershey retail takeaway for the year was up 4%, generating a share gain in this channel of 0.2 points. Fourth quarter food class-of-trade CMG category growth was 2.5%, less than the category's historical growth rate. This was primarily due to continued weakness in the gum category, which was down 5.1% in this channel. Hershey food channel CMG retail takeaway in the fourth quarter was up 3.1%, driven by solid non-chocolate candies. ","Turning now to the C-store class-of-trade, where Hershey continues to leverage its customer relationships and the only coast-to-coast in-store sales force in the category. In Q4, Hershey C-store takeaway was up again and has increased for 15 consecutive quarters. Specifically, for the 12 and 52 weeks ended December 31, Hershey retail takeaway was up 11.9% and 11.1%, respectively, resulting in a market gain of 1 full point in the quarter and 1.4 points for the full year. Similar to last quarter, these gains were driven by price realization, net volume gains due to king size growth and strong in-store merchandising.","In Q4, Hershey C-store chocolate and non-chocolate takeaway was up 12% and 15.5%, respectively. These gains were driven by pricing, core brand advertising, in-store merchandising and programming, including the Reese's NCAA Football Perfect Seat and the Ice Breakers Frost New Year's Eve in Las Vegas promotions.","In the drug class-of-trade, Hershey CMG retail takeaway was up 3.4% for the quarter, resulting in a share gain of 0.2 points. Similar to last quarter, our drug channel retail takeaway increased in every segment. Our non-chocolate candy, mint and gum performance was especially strong. The Ice Breakers mint platform, particularly Ice Breakers Frost products, continues to do well and helped drive a mint share gain within the drug class-of-trade of 2.3 points. Ice Breaker ice cubes bottle packs also had another good quarter in drugstores. As a result, we gained gum market share in the drug channel in the fourth quarter and for the full year.","As we look to 2012, we have many exciting products, promotions, programs and merchandising in place across all channels, including various NCAA basketball and football promotions, a Reese's and Coca-Cola promotion, sponsorship of the upcoming Avengers and Spiderman movies and the launch of many new products to include Hershey's Milk Chocolate with Almond Pieces, Jolly Rancher Crunch 'N Chew, Rolo Minis, Ice Breakers Duo mints in both strawberry and raspberry flavors and Hershey's Bliss produced with cocoa that is certified by the Rainforest Alliance. ","Additionally, full-year advertising expense for the total company will increase low double digits on a percentage basis versus last year, supporting these new product launches and core brands in both the U.S. and our international markets and new advertising campaigns on Jolly Rancher and the Rolo brands.","I'm also excited about our acquisition of Brookside Foods. This was an opportunistic bolt-on that allows us to expand our portfolio and capabilities into the subsegment of chocolate-covered fruit juice pieces. Specifically, Brookside pairs dark chocolate with exotic fruit juice centers, such as goji, acai, blueberry and pomegranate that deliver the benefits of flavanols and antioxidants. Brookside has increased sales at a compound annual growth rate over the last 3 years of about 20%. As a result, they're approaching the limits of our manufacturing capability. Therefore, in 2012, we'll be adding additional manufacturing capabilities that we're targeting to have up and running by the end of the year. We look forward to building the Brookside brand in the U.S. and Canada and leveraging Hershey's scale at retail.","As we entered 2012, we remain focused on our core U.S. business where we continue to bring news, variety and excitement to the category. Our U.S. new product launches will be supported with in-store promos and merchandising, as well as advertising, which will increase meaningfully year-over-year. Our solid position in the U.S. marketplace continues to give us the flexibility to invest in key international markets where we're gaining momentum. In 2011, outside of the U.S. and Canada, we invested in our go-to-market capabilities and increased advertising 20% to 25% on a percentage basis versus last year. We expect international advertising to increase about the same amount in 2012. Our businesses in the focus markets of Mexico, China, Brazil and India had a good 2011. Combined, reported sales growth in these countries was about 25% in 2011.","As we enter 2012, we have a solid plan that will enable us to maintain our momentum in China. And in China, we'll increase the launch select sugar confectionery products that will leverage our in-market capabilities, and we expect our R&D facility to be operational in Q4. In Mexico, we'll continue our approach of gaining further distribution within the traditional trade. And in Brazil, we'll benefit from expansion with our partner, Bauducco. Therefore, if our business outside the U.S. and Canada continues to grow at the current organic rates, we'll achieve our target of $1 billion in sales by the year-end 2014. This would be about a year earlier than our original 2015 objective.","We have a solid balance sheet that enables us to pursue potential acquisition targets while also investing in organic opportunities. We remain focused on all of our markets, and we'll continue to make the necessary investments to ensure that we're positioned to grow our brands and manage challenges. The power of our brands and our ability to execute in the marketplace gives us confidence that the Hershey Company will be able to deliver achievable, predictable and consistent earnings and cash flow growth. As such, I'm happy to announce that we increased our dividend 10%. As we look to the future, our financial position allows us to be flexible in our approach to creating value for all of our Hershey shareholders.","Now to wrap up. I'm pleased with the way the confectionery category, our retail partners and Hershey continue to perform. In 2012, new products, advertising and in-store merchandising and programming put us in a position to deliver another strong year of net sales and earnings growth. Therefore, excluding the Brookside acquisition, we expect volume to be up for the full-year 2012, resulting in net sales growth of about 5% to 7%. We have good visibility into our full-year cost structure. And despite higher input costs in 2012, we expect adjusted gross margin to increase about 75 basis points driven by productivity and cost savings, as well as net price realization. Therefore, we've increased our full-year adjusted earnings per share diluted outlook, and including the change in the reporting of pension costs, we expect adjusted EPS to increase 9% to 11%. ","I'll now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some additional financial detail.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Thank you, J.P., and good morning, everyone. Net sales and adjusted earnings per share diluted from operations for the full-year 2011 exceeded the initial ranges we communicated at the beginning of last year. Solid efforts by sales, marketing, operations and finance resulted in a good retail execution and another year of market share gains. Overall, we're pleased with our financial results and U.S. marketplace performance, as well as the progress we've made in key international markets.","Fourth quarter consolidated net sales of $1.57 billion increased 5.7% versus the prior year. As expected, the increase was driven primarily by net price realization benefit of 5.9%. In addition, volume sequentially improved 0.4 points from last quarter, slightly greater than our expectations. New product introductions in the U.S. and international markets, along with seasonal volume gains, were partially offset by core volume declines in line with our price elasticity models. The impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in the quarter was about 0.6 points.","Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.70 increased 15%, primarily due to price realization, supply chain productivity and lower advertising, which more than offset the impact of higher input costs and additional marketing-related investments. ","For the full year, net sales increased 7.2% or 6.9% on a constant currency basis. And we're balanced between volume and net price realization, leading to adjusted earnings per share of $2.82, an increase of 10.6% versus last year.","J.P. already provided details related to our marketplace performance. So I will focus on a review of P&L and balance sheet, starting with gross margin. During the fourth quarter, adjusted gross margin was 41.7%. While we achieved our productivity and cost savings goals in the quarter, adjusted gross margin decreased 50 basis points, as productivity and net price realization were more than offset by higher input and supply chain costs. This is a greater decline than previously expected. ","Specifically, greater-than-expected fourth quarter volume requirements resulted in higher commodity costs than we had forecasted. For the fourth quarter and full year, total input costs were unfavorable, about $45 million and $150 million. In addition, the impacts from year-end LIFO inventory and higher discounts and allowances were greater than our previous estimates. The higher discounts and allowances primarily reflected a packaging change in our full chocolate packaged candy presentation as we swapped out harvesting, packaging and substituted with additional Halloween-focused packaging, which did not resonate as well with consumers.","For the full-year 2011, adjusted gross margin was 42.4% versus 42.8% in 2010, a decline of 40 basis points. Higher net price realization and productivity gains were more than offset by higher input costs. Fourth quarter adjusted EBIT increased 8.9%, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin of 16.4%, a 50-basis-point improvement versus last year as lower advertising expense more than offset go-to-market and other employee-related costs. ","In Q4, advertising declined 13% versus last year. However, our on-air presence was strong as the fourth quarter of 2010 included a significant step-up investment. The decline was slightly greater than our earlier estimate as we shifted spending to invest in global selling capabilities and our Insights Driven Performance initiative. As a result, advertising expense for the full year increased about 6%.","Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 8.3%, with adjusted EBIT margin up 20 basis points to 17.9% from 17.7%. The increase was driven by solid net sales growth, partially offset by higher input and supply chain costs and investments in SM&A.","Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. Our international markets outside of the U.S. and Canada generated more meaningful sales growth during the quarter. Excluding Canada, international fourth quarter reported net sales increased double digits on a percentage basis versus last year, driven by our focus markets, Mexico, China, Brazil and India. On a constant currency basis, partially driven by seasonality in gifting, fourth quarter net sales in Brazil increased more than 40%, about 30% in China and 15% in Mexico. For the full-year 2011, net sales in our businesses outside of the U.S. and Canada increased close to 25%. Our commitment to investing in these markets continues to drive solid top line growth, enabling our brands to gain momentum and greater recognition among consumers.","Fourth quarter interest expense decreased, coming in at $21.3 million versus $27.6 million in the prior period, reflecting the bond tender offer costs in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the year, interest expense was in line with expectations, totaling $92.2 million versus $96.4 million a year ago. In 2012, we expect higher interest expense of approximately $95 million to $105 million, primarily due to higher interest rates in some of our international businesses and increases in the company's finance lease obligations. ","The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.2%, down 40 basis points versus year ago due to an increase in domestic production, as well as a mix of income among our various U.S. and international businesses. For the full year, the tax rate was 34.8%, down 40 basis points versus a year ago and within the range of our previous estimate.","In 2012, we expect the tax rate to be about the same as the 2011 annual rate. However, the rate will be about 36% in Q1 and 2 and about 34% in Q3 and Q4. In the fourth quarter of 2011, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 229.1 million versus 230.8 million shares in 2010, leading to adjusted EPS of $0.70 per share diluted from operations, an increase of 14.8% versus year ago. For the year, shares outstanding were 229.9 million versus approximately 230.3 million shares in 2010. Adjusted EPS diluted for the year was $2.82, an increase of 10.6%.","Before moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, I'd like to share some details regarding a change in our pension cost disclosures in 2012. Similar to a number of other S&P 500 companies, we're going to exclude non-service-related pension expenses in our defined benefit pension plans from adjusted earnings. These non-service-related expenses include the amortization of actuarial gains and losses and interest on participants' balances, which are offset by expected earnings on pension assets. Such expenses can vary significantly from year-to-year based on actuarial assumptions, asset performance and interest rates. We believe that excluding these costs and including only service-related costs better reflects the ongoing operating costs to our business, given the well-funded status of our plans that have been closed to new entrants since 2008. As a result, we'll exclude them from adjusted earnings beginning in 2012. On this basis, 2011 and 2010 full-year adjusted earnings per share would have been $0.01 and $0.02 higher, respectively.","In 2011, the actual return on pension plan assets was below our assumptions, and interest rates declined, resulting in higher non-service-related pension expenses in 2012. Therefore, our reported outlook reflects non-service-related pension expenses of $19 million or $0.05 per share diluted. This amount is excluded from our 2012 adjusted earnings outlook. For your modeling purposes, details reflecting this change from 2006 to 2011 are available on the company's website within the Investor Relations section.","Let me also note that going forward, the company will exclude the impact of M&A-related deal costs from its adjusted earnings per share diluted. We believe excluding these will provide investors a better understanding of the underlying profitability of the business. Therefore, our reported outlook of $2.79 to $2.89 per share diluted for 2012 includes nonrecurring acquisition, closing and integration costs related to the Brookside acquisition of $0.04 to $0.05 per share diluted.","Now turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. At the end of the year, net trading capital increased $115 million versus last year due to an increase in inventory of $115 million, resulting primarily from Project Next Century production transition. Accounts receivable was up $9 million and remains very current. Accounts payable also increased about $9 million. In terms of other specific cash flow items, total company capital expenditures, including software, were $82 million in Q4 and $348 million for the full year. These include Project Next Century capital expenditures of $24 million in Q4 and $179 million for the full year. In 2012, we expect ongoing CapEx to be $215 million to $225 million, excluding Project Next Century capital additions that are expected to be an additional $65 million to $70 million. Therefore, the total CapEx estimate for the company is $280 million to $295 million in 2012.","Depreciation and amortization was $58 million in the fourth quarter. This includes accelerated depreciation related to Product Next Century of approximately $12 million. Adjusted operating depreciation and amortization was $47 million in the fourth quarter. For the full-year 2011, depreciation and amortization expense was $216 million, of which accelerated depreciation and amortization was $33 million. Therefore, adjusted operating depreciation and amortization was $183 million. In 2012, we are forecasting total adjusted operating depreciation and amortization of about $195 million to $205 million.","Dividends paid during the quarter were $76 million, bringing the full-year total to $304 million. During the fourth quarter, approximately $27 million of our common shares were repurchased to replace shares issued in connection with stock option exercise. We did not acquire any stock in the fourth quarter related to the $250 million outstanding repurchase program. Cash on hand at year-end was $694 million, down $191 million versus year ago due primarily to the aforementioned inventory increase, along with higher capital expenditures and stock option repurchases. As we exit 2011, we are well-positioned to manage the capital needs of the business.","Now let me update on Project Next Century program. We are pleased with the progress we're making on the West Hershey plant expansion, which remains on track. The building is essentially complete with the majority of equipment now installed. The startup of multiple production lines began during the fourth quarter and continues to roll out and implement [indiscernible] as expected throughout 2012. The forecast for total project pretax debt charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs is $150 million to $160 million. By 2014, we expect ongoing annual savings to be approximately $65 million to $80 million. These figures are essentially the same as previously communicated. Please see the note in Appendix 1 in today's press release for further details.","Let me close by providing some context on our 2012 outlook, starting with some details on the Brookside Foods acquisition. On January 19, 2012, we successfully completed the acquisition and established a project management office to facilitate the integration of the business. If you\u2019ve tasted the Brookside products, I'm sure you'll agree they\u2019re great-tasting snacks with a strong \u2013 and a strong addition to the Hershey's portfolio. Hershey will invest to grow the brand in the U.S. and Canada, as well as international markets. In 2012, we'll focus on integration, adding additional manufacturing capacity and market research. Therefore, in 2012, we expect Brookside to generate sales of approximately $90 million at current exchange rates and be neutral to our adjusted earnings.","As J.P. outlined, we have initiatives in place that we believe will drive net sales growth across our businesses in 2012. We have planned merchandising and programming events throughout the year and plan to work closely with retail customers and monitor brand performance, given the higher price points for seasonal products. We expect 2012 advertising to increase low double digits on a percentage basis versus the prior year, supporting new product launches in core brands in both the U.S. and in international markets. We'll also invest in new advertising campaigns for the Jolly Rancher and Rolo brands. We're confident of our plans, and excluding Brookside, expect volume to be up for the year, resulting in net sales growth of 5% to 7%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We have good visibility at this time into our full cost structure, and despite higher input costs in 2012, expect adjusted gross margin to increase about 75 basis points, driven by productivity and cost savings, as well as net price realization. Therefore, we have increased our full-year adjusted earnings per share diluted outlook and including the aforementioned change in pension cost disclosure, expect it to increase 9% to 11%.","Before we open up to Q&A, as you work your models, note that due to the timing and full implementation of the price increases, we would expect volume to decline in the first quarter and then improve to be up in the second quarter and for the full year. Despite higher seasonal pricing in Q1, based on investments and merchandising plans, we expect a good start to the year. ","Thank you for your time this morning, and we will now open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions for you. First, can you update us on the progress you're making with the Ferrero partnership?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think that as we talked about earlier, we're doing the distribution center agreement with them in Canada. Progress -- that project is progressing, and so I think that we're on track. There's nothing new in terms of the context of that relationship beyond that.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One of your -- there was a press report out earlier this week with one of your sales directors quoted in it, talking about having conversations for distribution expansion in Europe. Is that something that you guys are seriously exploring right now?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. Let me add a proper context to that. So ISM was this week and one of our sales directors had talked about distributors that they were talking to really around our export business. So I think it was easy to maybe take that out of context. So in terms of our overall strategic direction, focusing on the core markets that we've talked about, nothing has changed there. So I think as you read that, it might have been misleading, and that was really nothing more than our continuing export business discussions.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One more housekeeping and then I'll pass it on. That 25% rest of the world growth, was that constant currency or with FX?","Humberto P. Alfonso","That was with FX.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Janney Capital Markets.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","When you talk about the retail takeaway, the 6.5% for the fourth quarter, can you give us a sense what kind of volume is associated with that? Because I just -- I think the biggest point of contrast with your business and some of the other businesses out there right now is the volume. And I just want to know how you -- what you can tell us about that, and what you're thinking for maybe category volume trends over the course of the year.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, first of all, if you were to -- I'll start with, if you look at the FDMxCW takeaway in Q4, it was up about 6.5%. If we were to look at our net sales in the quarter, it was just slightly below that, but really, almost the same. So from the metric of what you're selling and what's being taken away, we felt pretty good. Most of that would have been price.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","But volumes were up on a takeaway basis, you would say?","John P. Bilbrey","Seasonal volumes, which is an important part of the Q4 volume, were all up. But I think as we talk about the combination of price and volume and as we do price conversion, I think, Jonathan, what you'll remember is, is we said about 60% of that will occur in 2012. The balance is happening in 2011. The modeling shows that we're really on track. And we think that as we get to 2012, unit volume in 2012 will be back to flat...","Humberto P. Alfonso","'13.","John P. Bilbrey","Or '13, I'm sorry, when we get to 2013, we'll be flat again, and that's right on the modeling.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And just I want to -- when you think about the risks to the category, it seems like you've got a number -- you've got a top competitor who's also been very aggressive with pricing and aggressive with spending back against the category to drive value. I mean, have you seen any uptick in sort of intrusion, if you will, from other categories like salty snacks or nuts or anything else that's adjacent to candy that -- as these prices come up?","John P. Bilbrey","I don't think so. We continue to outperform, as I mentioned in my remarks, salty snacks and cookies and so forth. So the consumer continues to participate in our category. I think it's good news for us and the retailers. So we really haven't seen anything that would be different than what we've been experiencing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman from Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I got a follow-up, I guess, on Jonathan's question. So -- and I may have touched on this last time, but so international, which is mostly volume and is probably 8% of the total of the business today, maybe a little bit more since it's growing so much, was up 20% or more. Seasonal volume was up. So that has to mean that your non-seasonal everyday business, volumes were down pretty materially? Can you talk a little bit about that? And then as a follow-up or related to that, I heard that Mars was having some difficulty in terms of their seasonal shipments. So assuming that they correct that, wouldn't that mean that your volumes could actually struggle a bit?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. What I would say, Eric, is with respect to that combination of international and U.S., and we have talked about it, we have taken a little pricing in some of the international markets. But volume certainly was up, and we saw a sequential improvement. You're quite right, seasonal volume in the U.S. was up in the quarter. And from what we're seeing, we continue to see the progression of volume recovery, as the models would indicate. While we did mention that in the first quarter, given the new pricing on the Easter season, that we would expect volume to be down in first quarter '12 and then sequentially improve. And then J.P. sort of went a little beyond that and said we think we'd be back to pre-price increased volumes around end of year first quarter. But no, we've seen improvements across volume. And to get to your second part of your question, I'm not familiar with any distribution or shipping issues, but that's not something that we've seen.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then on the -- just to clarify and understand a little bit more, Mark and I talked about it offline earlier. But on this pension expense, I guess McCormick reported last week, it seems like it's the same issue, but they're including it in their GAAP or their adjusted or whatever earnings outlook with the way most analysts were kind of, I guess, taking that in and putting it into their models. So I'm not exactly sure why you're trying to exclude the volatile component. And then I'm also, given how U.S.-based the company is, why would you not move away from FASB and take an IFRS accounting approach?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. Actually, your latter point is a very good one. In fact, the methodology that we're following or that we've changed to is far closer to IFRS than GAAP reporting. And so what we've chosen to do, given the fact that we have a well-funded plan, and I'm speaking primarily U.S. plan, which is by far the largest if you read the K, we've not had any significant contributions to the plan because of its funded status, it's been closed to new entrants. And so the service cost, which is the cost or the liability of the members that are in the plan, and again, there are no new entrants into the plan, is quite consistent year-on-year. And we believe it's a better measure of the underlying operating performance of the company. The other measures are quite volatile. I mentioned that in '10, '11, they actually added to earnings. And then we've shown the reconciliation of the $0.05 impact. And so a number of companies have gone in the same direction with slightly different techniques. We think ours is pretty clean in terms of it's in the GAAP numbers, and we show exactly what it is coming out. But again, what we wanted to get away from the some years positive, some years negative aspect of it. And IFRS is part of our thinking. It is much closer to that -- those reporting requirements.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I guess we'll just see how the rest of the industry does it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. On the gross margin, it was pretty far below our expectation for fourth quarter. You mentioned some Halloween issues. And I think offline, I heard that there were some obsolescence issues also. Can you kind of break apart the gross margin miss? How material was the allowances you had to give to the retailers and the obsolescent charges compared to just higher commodity costs? And then secondly, can you give us some commodity cost guidance for 2012? Will the cost hit be higher than it was in '11?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. Let me put it in context on the gross margin. And as I mentioned, we expected sequential improvement, so the decline was higher than our expectations as you would have heard in the third quarter. There really was a multitude of factors. I mentioned the more significant one, so there wasn't 1 significant factor that really impacted the most. We did have some higher volumes particularly in the U.S. And so we procured at closer to spot prices for that volume. So that had a commodity impact. As we chewed up our LIFO calculation at year-end, that charge also impacted our costs. And the obsolescence and Halloween issue are actually the same issue. We made some changes. In prior years, we\u2019d had harvest packaging, which was included if you look at the syndicated data in the Halloween numbers. And frankly, what we found was that moving away from harvest and having more Halloween packaging was actually less -- resonated less with consumers. So as we changed out of that packaging, we did provide some cover for the retailers. So it really was a multitude of those items. There really wasn't one in particular that I would say was the predominant one. In terms of 2012, really, nothing has changed versus what we said in the past. We do expect higher commodity costs, but we haven't given specific guidance on the inflation factor. But at this stage, those commodity costs, we think, will be significantly mitigated by our productivity programs, which remain on track and including Next Century, as well as J.P. already mentioned about 60% of our price realization comes in 2012. The one bit of information that we have added that we haven't spoken to in the past was that we said we think we'd be up about 75 basis points on gross margin. If you think of all those factors, commodities offset by price realization and savings, and so that gives you some indication of where we think gross margins will be next year.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So Bert, you don't want to give us an absolute dollar number for commodity costs for '12?","Humberto P. Alfonso","No, we're not providing that at this stage.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just this might be nitpicking, but if seasonal sales were actually pretty good, I think you gained share, why was there an issue related to the packaging? Why do you think that didn't resonate well? Is it possible you just over shipped and overestimated how much they would want\u2026","John P. Bilbrey","Well, yes, first of all, we felt good about the volumes that went into Halloween. The total category was up. I mean, essentially, with a bit of humility here, we underestimated the value that the consumer had in the harvest packaging in previous years. They use it for decoration, and it actually kind of broadened the season, if you will, in terms of packs that the consumer was used to seeing. We also had fewer items in our total Halloween offering this year. We had a higher percentage of sales in the large bags, which were $20 bags, which obviously you sell fewer units when you get into those larger dollar range, et cetera. So there were a couple of things that, while the latter one was good, I think that what we would do is return to the harvest packaging in subsequent years. And I think this is one where we have some learnings. But overall, it's a very positive quarter for overall seasonal sales. And I think in Halloween, while we feel good about the total Halloween program, there are some things we're going to need to do to improve and take these learnings on board.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi Investment.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just to build on Eric Katzman's comment on the pensions. I would just kind of add to you guys that I appreciate the disclosure, but these non-service pension costs are -- I believe that they really are ultimately real financial impacts to the company. So while I understand your desire to want to exclude them from maybe a current period in time, it does appear that at some point in time, they probably should run through the P&L. And then I think that we come down to kind of imperfect plans on this, which is why they do run-through on a current basis. But I go to what Eric said. He mentioned McCormick, but I think you could go on a lot of companies. Just to put this on an apples-to-apples basis, it seems like the first call estimates have to continue to include these things unless we see broad agreement across the sector that all these things need to be excluded. Still, I think the strongest argument would be if these were not truly real costs that were never materialized. But I don't think you guys are actually making that argument right now. If you are, I'd love to hear it. So that's just maybe a personal statement there. And then getting into just kind of some key questions, what is your confidence that you have in, for 2012, that the pricing will hold, i.e., can you talk about the stickiness of pricing in comparison to the desire to want to be promotional?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, David, I think that the best barometer that I always look at is what's happening in convenience because it's the one where you see it first. And so if you look at the growth and the offtake in convenience, it would lead you to believe that it's fully cycled. The pricing at this point and king size continues to grow very nicely and contribute importantly. Obviously, that's at the upper end of the price range. So I think in that example, the pricing has been 100% sticky, right? So that's pretty encouraging. And then as we look at the channels, and there's a lot of noise in the timeframe by which these different channels convert just because of the different dynamics, but we're seeing that the conversion is right on or slightly better than how we've modeled it. And so for everything we know at this point, I think we feel good. And as you can imagine, we are all over this in terms of monitoring how it goes. Easter will be the first season where we're at the new pricing. And so far, what we're seeing is, we've got really solid programming, and volume looks very good. And so all indications are in terms of all of those things you would be executing against as we go through the year. We feel good.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When you talk about advertising, last year, at this time, you made the comments that advertising would run at a much more normalized rate of increase. But now, in your 2012 guidance, you're talking about double-digit increases. So can you discuss this a little bit? I thought kind of last year, you proved that the advertising budget was really in the right place, but now you're really kind of going a different direction and it's going to be a very big increase in 2012.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, actually, let's think about it in 2 parts. So if you look at the core brands in the advertising levels that we have planned, they would look very similar to where we're at this year. In the U.S., we're adding Jolly Rancher advertising, we're adding Rolo advertising. And so we're actually extending advertising further across the portfolio versus increasing it necessarily on existing brands. So on brands like Reese's and Hershey's, we believe we're sustaining investment levels. And so the marginal benefit of that extra dollars spend would be less on those kinds of brands. So we're really extending across the portfolio. And then importantly, in our international businesses, we continue to be investing there to build brands and grow penetration, and so some of that investment importantly is up against those businesses. If you look at it on a total basis, and part of it is remember where we're coming from, in 2008, '07 and '08, we were spending about 2.5% of net sales in advertising, which was significantly below any brand building levels. And then today, we ended up 2011 probably 6.8%, 6.9% of net sales in our advertising spend and we\u2019ll be slightly above that in sort of, call it, the 7% to 7.5% range. That would be very, very normal CPG brand-oriented company spend level. So we really feel good where we're at and that we're executing against our long-term strategy.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Very clear answer. One final question for me. Bert, Brookside, $90 million in sales. Given the low cost of funding, you say this is neutral to EPS. I'm struggling here just a little bit well on the math on this one. Are the margins on this thing really bad? Or are you guys just wanting to say that -- I mean, like I can't get to neutral unless I assume that the margins on this thing are really quite bad given the funding costs. What am I getting wrong here?","Humberto P. Alfonso","No, Dave, I wouldn't say that we're disappointed in the margins of the business. We are investing in the business in a way that will create future opportunity, particularly in the North America where it's already pretty successful and then doing research outside of that. So it really is brand investment. The business is cash flow positive. There is a certain amount of goodwill amortization that hits the P&L in the first few years as a result of the purchase, which is non-cash, as you might expect. And we're also adding some capacity to be able to expand the brand. So we're happy with the margins. Obviously, we can improve on them with some synergies in terms of our scale. But it is a sound business and one that we think is going to really pay dividends for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple questions for you. The first one, I just wanted to ask about, as of last quarter, we saw some retailers pushing through pricing at a little more aggressive rate. That didn't seem so obvious this quarter given how your sales and some of the measured channel kind of lined up pretty well. Is that just because of the heavier seasonal sales in the quarter?","John P. Bilbrey","That's absolutely correct.","Humberto P. Alfonso","That's correct.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I wanted to ask about the cost savings. I know you have some Next Century savings next year. You'll have some, I assume, some ongoing productivity savings. Anything unique or can you give kind of a rough range of the cost savings coming through in 2012, particularly in relation to the gross margin being so strong?","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. The 2012 savings program from a dollar range perspective is actually pretty close to '11. So we were expecting $80 million to $90 million of savings. There's some minor differences in terms of the contributors. We always have our normal productivity within the 4 walls of the plant. Project Next Century savings actually increases from about $15 million to the $20 million to $25 million range. And then we had an active program that we've talked about the last 3 years. That was against nonmanufacturing spend, which we've captured about $100 million. And while there is savings from that program, that program is not providing as much savings as it has incrementally in the past few years. But the total program remains in that $80 million to $90 million range. And that certainly is a big contributor to the gross margin. But, again, I\u2019d point you to the price realization based on our conversion models, where about 60% of that comes in 2012.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. And my last question is in relation to balance sheet and how we should think about it. I mean, maybe you could characterize the acquisition pipeline for the year. I would contend you could do a lot of share repurchase. So I'm just trying to understand, you've got a modest amount of share repurchase authorization available. But is there a full pipeline we should expect you to be trying to execute against, if you will?","John P. Bilbrey","When you mention pipeline, are you talking M&A?","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Acquisitions, you got it. Yes.","John P. Bilbrey","Yes, well, we're not really going to -- we're not going to comment on specific M&A. With respect to the balance sheet, yes, we continue to be a very predictable strong cash flow performer. In 2012, we had slightly less capital but still a good amount of capital, close to $300 million as we finish up Next Century. While we didn't execute against the 250 million buyback program, we did buy back 285 million of shares in the open market against the replenishment program. And then we announced a 10% dividend increase. So we continue to have a sound balance sheet. We continue to explore opportunities for M&A, and we'll be able to finance those in appropriate manner where we find value to shareholders. So all of those are important to us, and we'll continue to focus across that range.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zaslow from BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I have just 2 questions. First one, in terms of the pension costs, just to understand it, when you initially gave guidance, was that included and so it's like-for-like? Or is the increase related to the $0.05 decrease?","Humberto P. Alfonso","When we initially gave guidance, we were just really communicating within our 3 to 5, 6 to 8 long-term guidance. And so at that time, we wouldn't have given any indication around pension. We frankly hadn't finished the debate, and it's something that we talked about internally and came to what we thought was the best conclusion. Obviously, the current numbers do, and there's a reconciliation in the press release that gives you pretty good detail of what that is versus what we're currently saying, 9 to 11, which does include that adjustment on a pro forma basis.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And the second question is, it seems like, obviously, your international sales growth is actually moving at a greater pace than you anticipated going forward. Can you give some sort of at least qualitative view on how you're thinking of the margin structure of each of the business? Mexico, Brazil, China, India are progressing relative to your expectations. And do you expect a quicker return on the margin or operating profit line?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, first of all, as we\u2019ve said, our overall international businesses are profitable today. If you look at the focus markets that we have, we're in an invest mode. And so you would expect those margins to be lower, but they're certainly taken into consideration within the guidance that we're giving to you. And then the other comment I would make there is, we believe we're well-positioned for any both opportunities and challenges. At any given time, if we wanted to change our current model of investment in those markets, those markets could be profitable today. But the intent is, is that we have a commitment to grow those markets. And therefore, you would expect those key markets, which are in an invest mode, to be in a lower margin than in fact the average of the company.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. And one way to think about that is depending on where you're measuring. So obviously, at a gross margin level, they're much closer to U.S. rates than operating because of that invest-growing profile.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. And then in terms of China, specifically, there is going to be another additional sales force expansion as well there, in line with R&D. So is that a 2- to 4-year period? Is there a period of time that you actually think that you'll be established at a run rate level by 2014? Or is it going to be an investment period beyond that for China?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, Bert and I both probably will take a whack at that. On the investment in the selling capability, our business is largely along the Eastern seaboard today. We continue to move west as we think that's appropriate. And then within each of those key geographies, if you think of it as concentric circles, we increase our density there as well. So I think that we'll continue to be investing in our go-to-market capabilities in a very planful way. We don't have an idea of where we get well out over our SKUs or so far ahead of ourselves. So the great thing for our company in a country like China, and this really applies to our focus markets, is you have this dynamic market growth. But the important thing is to participate in it at attractive cost versus get out ahead of it. So it's really not about winning share at a high cost from competition as much as it is participating in the dynamic growth. And that enables you to, in a very planful way, expand the organization. So I don't think you would see us doing something that would get us out of a line with how we feel the size of the business is for us.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, I wouldn't add anything to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A couple of questions. First of all, on the revenue guidance for this year, I'm assuming that, that includes the sales from the Brookside acquisition, which I think is about 1.5%. And then given that the international business is growing so rapidly, that may be adding another couple of percentage points to the total company top line. So would I be right in thinking that the U.S. sales guidance is more in the 2% to 4% kind of range? Is that the right way to think about it?","Humberto P. Alfonso","No. Let me try to give you a few more data points. First, the 5% to 7% that we've mentioned, it would be an organic growth rate and so it would not include Brookside.","Mark K. Pogharian","Although it\u2019ll be -- Alexia, this is Mark. That 5% to 7% does include a little FX, so it's not truly organic. But...","Humberto P. Alfonso","Right, it's not constant currency, but -- and again, and we expect a little bit of a drag versus last year, particularly in the first half from currency. But it is -- think of it more as organic in terms of x Brookside and you would add Brookside to that. J.P. mentioned that the category continues to trend above historical, which we think of as 3% to 4%, and it certainly performed above that 4%. We expect a continuation of that in the U.S. market, and we expect to be able to be competitive within that range. And so I wouldn't think of the U.S. as a 2% to 3% grower, where we're saying the category grows a bit of a 4% historically and that we are very competitive within that range.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the pricing situation. Just been hearing some commentary that maybe the #3 player in the chocolate market in the U.S. is pulling back a bit on the price increases that they tried to take. Are you seeing any of that? Or at the moment, is everybody following you on your price lead?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Well, we don't think of it as following or anything like that. I would say that all of the category players have taken some pricing, but we haven't seen any of -- we haven't seen retailers shy away from those. And so we think everybody's converting at some pace, and we're pretty happy with our conversion.","Mark K. Pogharian","Yes, Alexia, this is Mark. I mean, I think if you look at the IRI\/Nielsen data that you guys continually to get on a quad basis, I think it indicates that there is pricing across all manufacturers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede from Jefferies & Company.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just 1 quick question for you. I understand that the CMG category has different dynamics than overall packaged foods. That being said, though, some of your packaged food peers have been talking lately about going to smaller pack sizes, going to lower opening price points, yet you talk about getting growth benefits from selling more king size packages. Help me understand why the king size works in CMG and chocolate but not in other packaged food categories?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, let me give you just a couple of things to think about. First of all, it's important to remember that we're not a food group. We're less than 2% of total caloric intake for Americans. And we're an accessible indulgence. So the category has some dynamics that are probably different than some of the other categories that we were talking about. So I think that's just a fundamental element here are the differences between us and some of the other snack-type items.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. The other -- the only thing I would add is, when you mentioned what we specifically call king size is in the consumable\\-pack type, you may have been thinking J.P.'s referral to larger pack sizes during some of the Halloween seasonal, which in our mind isn't what we think of as king size but larger pack size in any case.","John P. Bilbrey","And I'll just add that -- a little more specifics onto that is that the value of king size is an obvious and good value to the consumer. They can do the math easily, and then therefore, again, it's at a low price point. It's accessible. And I think, again, the reason people purchase and participate in the category may be a little bit different.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So even though your regular sizes show the regular price elasticity, the price sensitivity that the overall packaged food industry is talking about does not seem to apply to these king size products then.","John P. Bilbrey","I think that's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple questions. First, a follow-up on your answer earlier. You mentioned that seasonal mix was higher. Was there a dynamic about -- in your take home packaging where the seasonal did not have pricing but some of your other packaging, sort of the lay-down packs, did, and you saw a shift in packages, in mix that might have been a little greater than expected?","John P. Bilbrey","We wouldn't have seen a shift for that reason, but you're right that we did not take pricing on the seasons. They're still under price protection, but a lot of our everyday packaged candy would have been at higher prices, yes.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you don't look at that as a price elasticity thing, rather, just a function of the marketing and...","John P. Bilbrey","Yes. I think it's really season-specific. And so consumers buy for the season. They don't necessarily buy more seasonal packs because they're not priced up yet versus the every day. They're just -- they're different usage occasions. So they wouldn't stock up on seasonal to avoid the everyday pack price increase.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And second question on your C-store trends. I'm wondering if you can give some feeling about how you -- that channel may play out in 2012. I know you're not going give exact channel guidance, but perhaps some ways to think about it. As I'm thinking about it, you have strong momentum in the second half. And exiting the year, it looks like you had some fantastic growth in that channel. But you're going to be lapping some innovation. And then I just wonder about king size. It's been such wonderful lift for many years now, at least as I perceive it. Do you see that dynamic continuing to play out on a favorable way for that channel? Any thoughts would be helpful.","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I'll make a couple of comments. First, we've experienced very good trends in C-store. And so we're going to be lapping some pretty challenging comps. So it would be nice to assume that we'll continue to have those that look the same, but my guess is some of those are going to be pretty tough comps to lap. With that said, I think the momentum in the C-store channel is going to continue. I don't see anything that suggests their business model or traffic will change. So I'm pretty optimistic about the overall dynamics of the convenience store channel. With regard to king size, again, I think because of the accessibility of our category, it\u2019ll be far more about the category performance than it will be any individual pack size. And because these products are accessible in every measure and we continue to have about 8 points of presentation or activation in the average C-store across the country, that we feel good about our programming and I'm quite optimistic about the channel.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is that mostly the big cup -- big pack Reese's stuff in the king size? I mean, what is really -- what are your key king size drivers?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, there's really -- over the last several years, there's really been a couple of really key drivers, I think, between our -- behind our C-store success. First of all is we had,  you may remember, we used to talk about the big 33 program. So I think what happened is, is we got far better at having a very constant range across C-stores in general, and then that enabled our advertising to work harder for us. It enabled the consumer to be able to find the things that we were talking to them about. And so our distribution was really important. We also got far, far more focused around the retail programming that we had. And if you -- sometimes when we're out having visits with you guys, we'll show you some of those programming calendars. And we execute really, really well against those. And remember, we increased our selling organization coverage and size across C-store. So we're covering those with our dedicated sales force at a higher rate than we had in the past. So I think all of those things have just really helped us activate in the category, and then we have a disproportionate representation in king size. So if you were to look at the total category, our king size participation there is greater. Therefore, as this value dynamic or as the consumer looks at the category, we have gotten a disproportionate share of that growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'll just keep this quick. I just -- given Hershey's sort of desire to be more aggressive from an M&A perspective in emerging markets, and it would seem like perhaps you guys are a bit disappointed that maybe you haven't been able to do more in that arena so far. And if that's the case, I'm just trying to get a sense of maybe what it is that you're seeing there that's preventing you from doing it or not seeing there that you had hoped to see. Just to try and get a sense of how we can think about that going forward. Is it just that they're opportunistic and they haven't been there? Or are there some structural things maybe that you're seeing in some of the businesses that might be available that just aren't really doing it for you?","John P. Bilbrey","Well, I think, Andrew, first of all, if we were disappointed, it hasn't caused us to be desperate. So I think that again, without being overly specific, I think that we\u2019ve said we're actively looking at a combination of bolt-ons all the way through to larger types of events. And these things take time. You certainly want to do them well. We want to be choiceful and smart as we go. So we're actively paying attention to all the opportunities that we think could be good for our company. And as we think about making those choices, we really want to make sure that they're really good choices and that they really deliver against the company's long-term objectives.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just 2 quick points of clarification. First, on the pension expenses. Just want to be clear, on the piece that you're going to be excluding, are you going to be marking to market your pension assets on a quarterly basis and so that\u2019ll be volatile? Or are you still doing the smoothing and so people can at least allocate that $0.05 as sort of a visible cost that can be just allocated each quarter?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. It's really not a mark-to-market. Some of the companies have taken that approach. As I said, as companies have taken slightly different approaches to adjusting earnings, there are some that have done that. No, ours would be smoothing. And as I said, our point on that is that they're primarily noncash -- they're noncash charges. You could \u2013 in the K, where there is an impact, if this were to go in one direction for a long time, obviously, it may have some funding implications. But [indiscernible], we haven't seen that. And the fact that we have some years up and some years down is really what led us to pull that out in terms of what's the real operating cost to the business of the service costs within our pension plan. But it is a smoothing.","Mark K. Pogharian","It's Mark. Just to be clear, I mean, similar to other restructure charges and how we show the -- we take you that reconciliation from GAAP to adjusted, I mean, we will do the same with this as well.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. And the lines that predominantly get impacted are the ones you would think, right; gross margin because of our factory, employment and SG&A.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just 1 other point. Just in terms of the seasonal business in the quarter, did the snowstorm, the bad weather on the East Coast at all affect Halloween for you or for the industry?","John P. Bilbrey","No, absolutely not.","Humberto P. Alfonso","No, we didn't see that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson from Consumer.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Yes, just 2 quick easy questions, hopefully. So the gross margin, I know you're guiding to 75-basis-points improvement driven by increased pricing, volumes up and productivity. But I just -- I'm curious, I mean, do you think that there's obviously ","[Technical Difficulty] ","I'm just curious, I mean, do you think that there's actually a little bit more upside to that? Because, I mean, we've just seen cocoa now down 30% in June year-over-year, and the class 3 is expected to be down 7% to 8% for '12. So I'm just curious, you didn't really call out lower expected commodity costs. When you talk about high expected costs, are you speaking just higher absolute levels or what? So just a little clarification on that.","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. We think of it as more the combination or the cost basket as we call it. And while you're quite right that we've seen some declines in cocoa and a little bit on the sugar side, we typically look at it, what's the 2-year average across that commodity basket. And you'll find that, by and large, we're above those levels, cocoa being the exception at least for the moment. And still, things like peanuts and dairy, in fact, and some of the others are still quite elevated. So we've seen a little bit of tapering, and that's good for you certainly in any case. But it really is based on the basket, not any individual commodity.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay, perfect. And then secondly, I guess this is back to Chris's question originally, just on the buyback. I mean, I know you used to buy back shares. You haven't really bought back shares now in 5 years. So I guess a more direct question is just like, what would get you to buy back your shares or buy back more shares that would be accretive to earnings?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes. I mean, we did buy back some shares this year. And you're right, we haven't been as active. We certainly stayed out of the market a couple of years ago when the financial structure was a bit more up in the air. This year, we completed the '06 program that was the $100 million, and we were actually pretty active deploying cash in terms of option replenishment. As you might imagine, the shares were up nicely, and so there was more option exercising. So it's one of the elements that we look at in terms of giving back to shareholders and we discuss with our Board of Directors. So we've not done as much as you pointed out and we had in the more recent past, but it's not one that we would shy away from.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay. And then lastly, and really just to kind of sum up all the comments that you've had in Q&A. If I think about just EPS guidance that you had in Q3, more in line with long-term targets, 6% to 8%. And now, if we look at guidance now, you're guiding 9% to 11%. You just back out the $0.05, let's say, because that's probably -- everyone else was already factoring that in. You\u2019re at 7% to 9%. So if I look at the 6% to 8% relative to the 7% to 9%, what really was, kind of in a nutshell, what was that 100-basis-points improvement to 3 months ago?","Humberto P. Alfonso","Yes, again, in the third quarter, we traditionally don't give a lot of details around the guidance. And so your observation is accurate in terms of we're looking at sales guidance, which is above the range. And so that's different than what we talked about. We gave more detail on gross margin. Last time, we said we were focused on it. This time, we're actually telling you that we're expecting to be up, close to 75 basis points. And we're investing in the business both in the U.S. and outside of that at appropriate levels. We're pleased with the financial performance that we're projecting for the year. And really, that's the additional detail that we're providing today.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Mark K. Pogharian","All right. Well, if that's it, operator, we thank you, we thank everyone for joining our conference call today. And myself and Matt Miller will be available for any follow-up questions that you may have.
