Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Altria\u2019s management and a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Representatives of the investment community and the media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brendan McCormick, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.","Brendan McCormick","Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I\u2019m joined this morning by Marty Barrington, Altria\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Howard Willard, Altria\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This morning we will only be discussing Altria\u2019s 2012 business results for the first quarter and first six months and will not be discussing the status of tobacco litigation.","Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of our earnings release for the review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. For a detailed review of Altria\u2019s business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website, altria.com.","Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.","Today\u2019s call will contain various operating results on both a reported and on an adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in today\u2019s earnings press release and are available on our website. In addition, comparisons discussed in this conference call are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated.","Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Marty Barrington.","Marty Barrington","Thank you, Brendan, good morning. Altria delivered excellent financial results for the second quarter and first six month reflecting the strength of our diverse business model. Altria grew with adjusted, diluted EPS by 9.3% for the second quarter and 10.2% for the first six months of 2012, while its tobacco companies pursued initiatives to grow their premium brands for the long-term. ","These brand building activities contributed to adjusted operating companies income and margin growth in both smokeable and smokeless product segments. Exceptionally strong gains from our investment in SABMiller and our financial services business complimented these results. ","Innovation continues to contribute to the strong business results of our tobacco companies. Products introduced in recent years have enhanced their product portfolios supported adjusted operating companies income growth and contributed to retail share gains in cigarettes, cigars and smokeless tobacco for the second quarter and first half of 2012. ","Our company continued to make progress on product development in the second quarter with activities related to Marlboro EIGHTY-THREES, Copenhagen Southern Blend and Black & Mild Summer Blend. In June Altria\u2019s subsidiary Nu Mark introduced Verve discs into a lead market to begin to understand adult tobacco consumer acceptance of this product.","In the smokeable product segment strong retail share performances benefitted cigarette and cigar shipment volumes. Philip Morris USA continue to invest behind Marlboro\u2019s new brand architecture. The second quarter activities across its four brand families; red, gold, green and black. In April, our sales force began updating retail pictures to reflect the new Marlboro architecture and highlight the four brand families. ","In June, PM USA introduced Marlboro EIGHTY-THREES Box in modern updated packaging. And PM USA continue to support Marlboro green and Marlboro black with promotional offers intended to generate trial by adult competitive smokers. ","These activities contributed to Marlboro strong second quarter retail share performance. Marlboro second quarter retail hare increased three-tenth of a share point to 42.9%. Marlboro has a pipeline of brand building programs planned for the rest of 2012 and into 2013 across its brand families. ","Marlboro\u2019s retail share growth in the second quarter was complimented by gains for PM USA in the discount segment. Where L&M has regained some of the retail share lost by basic as that brand has increased its price and margins. ","Black & Mild delivered strong retail share gains in the second quarter behind the growth of untipped cigarillo introduced in 2011. The brand also benefited from a new seasonal offering, Black & Mild Summer Blend which Middleton introduced during the second quarter.","Smokeless product segment delivered strong adjusted operating companies income growth for the second quarter and first half of 2012. In the smokeless product segment USSTC aims to maximize the combined performance of Copenhagen and Skoal. These brands grew their combined retail share and volume for both periods. Copenhagen drove this growth as products introduced in recent years continue to gain share. ","In May USSTC expanded distribution of Copenhagen Southern Blend into select geographies. Copenhagen Southern Blend delivers a mellow taste in a manageable [long cut form]. Skoal retail share decreased for the second quarter and first half of 2012 primarily due to share losses from SKUs we listed in the second quarter of 2011. ","In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle continue to focus on expanding distribution of its premium wines. Wine shipment volume grew for the second quarter and for six months. Higher shipment volume, improved premium mix and higher pricing contributed to strong adjusted operating company\u2019s income growth for the second quarter and first half.","Finally, Altria\u2019s 2012 first half adjusted diluted EPS results exceeded our expectations. We are pleased with the solid first half performance of our tobacco businesses. Altria\u2019s results also benefited from higher equity earnings from its investment in SABMiller and gains from asset sales at PMCC. ","As a result of this strong first half performance, Altria revised its 2012 full-year guidance for adjusted diluted EPS from a range of $2.17 to $2.23 to a range of $2.19 to $2.23. This represents a growth rate of 7% and 9% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.05 per share in 2011. We anticipate adjusted diluted EPS growth to moderate in the second half compared to the first half of 2012 with stronger adjusted diluted EPS growth expected in the fourth quarter compared to the third. ","I\u2019ll now turn things over to Howard Willard, who will discuss Altria\u2019s business results in more detail. ","Howard Willard III","Thank you, Marty. Good morning everyone. In the smokeable product segment, second quarter and first half reported operating companies income grew by 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively, primarily due to higher list prices effective cost management and lower tobacco and health judgments. ","These factors were partially offset by higher promotional investments to support Marlboro\u2019s new brand architecture, unfavorable mix due to L&Ms volume growth and higher net restructuring charges related to our current cost production program. 2012 first half results were also negatively impacted by lower volume. ","Excluding special items identified in our earnings press release, 2012 second quarter and first half adjusted operating companies income for the smokeable product segment increased by 2.8% to $1.7 billion and 3.3% to $3.1 billion, respectively. The smokeable product segment delivered strong adjusted operating companies income margin growth for both periods. Adjusted operating companies income margin grew six-tenth of a percentage point to 41.4% for the second quarter and increased one percentage point to 41.2% for the first half. ","PM USA\u2019s reported cigarette shipments were essentially unchanged for the second quarter. The trade build more inventory during the second quarter of 2012 versus the prior year period benefiting comparisons of our reported shipment\u2019s. Following PM USA\u2019s list price increase on June 18, 2012, PM USA believes the trade depleted inventories to the end of last month and into July. ","Reported shipments declined 1.2% for the first six months of 2012 as trade inventory dynamics impacted results. In the first half of 2012, the trade build less inventory versus the prior year period which negatively impacted the comparisons of our reported shipments. When adjusted for trade inventory dynamics and other factors, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette shipment volume was down approximately 1.5% for the second quarter and 0.5% for the first half. These results outperformed the total cigarette category. ","PM USA estimates that the total cigarette categories adjusted volume declined approximately 3% for both the second quarter and first half which is consistent with historical price elasticity and the secular rate of decline. PM USA increased its retail share by eight-tenth of a hare point to 50.1% for the second quarter and by six-tenth of a share point to 49.7% for the first six months of 2012. ","Marlboro gained three-tenth of a share point to 42.9% for the second quarter and was up two-tenth of a share point to 42.6% for the first half. PM USA\u2019s discount share increased eight-tenth of a share point to 3.8% for the second quarter and grew seven-tenth of a share point to 3.7% for the first half driven by L&M.","Marlboro and L&M second quarter and first half retail share gains were partially offset by share losses on other portfolio brands. Cigar shipment volume was up six-tenth of a percent for the second quarter primarily due to volume growth as a result of retail share gains mostly offset by changes in trade inventories. For the first half cigar shipment volume increased 7.1% driven primarily by retail share gains, changes in trade inventories and one additional shipping day. ","Black & Mild\u2019s retail share increased one share point to 29.8% for the second quarter and was up 1.3 share points to 30.3% for the first half, primarily driven by the success of its classic Sweets and Wine untipped cigarillo. ","Turning to smokeless products. Reported operating companies income for this segment increased 8.1% to $240 million for the second quarter and 4.1% to 432 million for the first half of 2012. Second quarter results were driven by higher volume and pricing partially offset by unfavorable mix due to growth in products introduced in recent years at a lower popular price and higher promotional investment\u2019s. ","First half results benefited from higher pricing effective cost management and lower promotional investments partially offset by growth in products introduced in recent years at a lower popular price and higher restructuring charges related to our current cost reduction program. When adjusted for special items primarily related to restructuring charges, operating companies income increased 7.1% to $240 million for the second quarter and 7.9% to $451 million for the first half of 2012.","Reported smokeless product shipment volume increased 7.6% for the second quarter driven by Copenhagen\u2019s strong 12.6% volume growth as well as Skoal 6.6% volume gain. Shipment volume for the first half of 2012 was essentially unchanged as volume growth on Copenhagen was offset by volume declined on the balance of the portfolio. Last year\u2019s introduction of Skoal X-TRA and the de-listing of certain Skoal SKUs impacted Skoal\u2019s volume comparisons. ","When adjusted for changes in trade inventories and other factors, USSTC and PM USA estimated their combined 2012 second quarter adjusted smokeless products volume grew approximately 5%. USSTC and PM USA also estimate that the smokeless products category grew by approximately 5% over the 12 month ending June 2012.","USSTC and PM USA\u2019s retail share of the smokeless products category increased one-tenth of a share point to 55.2% for the second quarter, and six-tenth of a share point to 55.4% for the first half of 2012.","Copenhagen and Skoal delivered strong combined retail share growth of 1.4 share points for the second quarter and 1.8 share points for the first half of 2012. Copenhagen grew its retail share by 2.1 share points for the second quarter and 2.4 share points for the first half. Skoal share declined seven-tenth of a share point for the second quarter and six-tenth of a share point for the first half of 2012. ","Ste. Michelle 2012 second quarter reported and adjusted operating companies income both increased 15.8% to $22 million. For the first half of 2012, reported operating companies income grew 19.4% and adjusted operating companies income increased 8.8%, excluding acquisition related cost from last year. Ste. Michelle shipment volume increased 2.1% for the second quarter and 4.2% for the first half. ","The financial services segments reported operating companies income increased by more than 100% for both the second quarter and first half of 2012, primarily due to PMCC\u2019s leveraged lease charge of $490 million in the second quarter of last year. ","Excluding leveraged lease charges, the financial services segments operating companies income grew by 55.6% to $42 million for the second quarter and 95.8% to $94 million for the first half of 2012, driven by higher asset sales and $10 million reduction in the allowance for losses. This adjustment to the allowance for losses is largely due to the reduction in net finance receivables as a result of asset sales. ","As a result of the closing agreement with the IRS related to certain PMCC leveraged lease transactions, Altria recorded a one-time net earnings benefit of $68 million during the second quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower than estimated interest expense on tax under payments. ","In addition Altria paid $456 million in federal income tax and related estimated interest from available cash in June and expects to pay an estimated $50 million in state taxes and associated interest later this year related to the closing agreement.","Earlier this month, UST paid off $600 million in debt. These notes reached maturity and had a coupon rate of 6.625%. Our current cost management program remains on track and we have recorded net pre-tax charges of $253 million over the past three quarters. We expect to incur approximately $47 million in pre-tax restructuring charges in the balance of 2012 related to this program. These 2012 restructuring charges are reflected in our full-year diluted EPS guidance that we updated in today\u2019s press release.","Marty and I are now happy to take your questions, while the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro\u2019s price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 36% in the second quarter. Marlboro\u2019s net pack priced in the second quarter was $5.71, while the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.20. The cigarette discount category\u2019s retail share was 27.1% for the second quarter.","The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax as of July 1, 2012 was $1.41 per pack, an increase of $0.04 per pack versus the prior year. This reflects the June 24th excise tax increase of $1 per pack in Illinois and the July 1st increase of $0.04 per pack in Rhode Island. Copenhagen second quarter retail price was $4.07 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 40% in the quarter.","CapEx was $23 million for the second quarter and $39 million for the first half of 2012. We revised our 2012 full-year CapEx forecast from $150 million to a range of 100 to $125 million based on current plans. ","Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $57 million for the second quarter. We estimate that 2012 full-year ongoing depreciation and amortization will be approximately $230 million.","Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","I had a question on L&M, growing quite rapidly and you had talked about in your commentary your mix has been deteriorating. So, I guess my first question is, are you comfortable with your current mix between premium and discount brands, and then if not what strategies are you putting into place to stem this? And could talk a little bit more about some of the promotional activity behind the brand, I know that that started to step up last year and just kind of walk us through that again please?","Marty Barrington ","The answer we are comfortable with the mix. Remember Bonnie that more than 90% of PM USA shipment on premium and obviously our strategy is to focus on the premium end of the business. That said, there is a discount segment and we want to have an offering there. Our retailers in particular like for PM USA to have an offering there and there\u2019s some business there. So, that\u2019s L&M\u2019s job. L&M really grew its share basically by picking up share that basic had shed as it increased its price and its margin. So, there is no shift in strategy there. I think L&M has done a nice job, certainly helped from a volume point of view. I don\u2019t see any need to change the strategy with L&M at all. With respect to L&M\u2019s promotional activity that varies a bit over time. It is a bit different in \u201812 than it is in \u201811 but again that depends sort of on how it's performing in the marketplace and we adjust most of our promotional allowances when the moment is right to do that.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","My next question is just in terms of your innovation pipeline. Could you talk about your plans for innovation, is it going to step up in the second half and possibly next year and then can you talk little bit about your plans to pursue next generation products, especially since my understanding is you do have some of the rights to Philip Morris\u2019 technology?","Marty Barrington ","Sure, we have spoken about this previously, and I think we pointed out that innovation is one of the ways that one grows and particular we know that in the tobacco business now that there is a group of adult tobacco smokers in particular who are looking for and are open to innovative products. Innovation cuts cost several sort of axis, if you will. You saw that we rolled out Marlboro EIGHTY-THREES and we got a new Copenhagen Blend, Black & Mild rolled out another blend. So, on the conventional side, I think we got good pipeline of products. We stay close to the adult tobacco consumer. We watch what their needs are, either articulated or unarticulated; do a lot of consumer research there. We try to make sure that we are offering products that they want and that for us are premium, of course. ","We also, as you know rolled out. We have the exciting development with respect to different kind of product called Verve and Verve is a noncombustible product. It has nicotine and a flavor system and it\u2019s a chewable disk and it\u2019s really a very different kind of product. We put that product in about 60 stores in Virginia in June. This is part of our journey as we explore how adult tobacco consumers may migrate to products of that sort. That I would say is a learning experience. We want to get it in the hands of consumers. We build robust consumer research around that product. We want to learn whether they like it, they like its shape or its taste, for example, and the way to think about this Bonnie, I think is innovation is really an iterative process. It is not a great big (inaudible) one day that we find the next thing. It\u2019s about putting out experiment, putting out test, developing products, asking consumers, getting their feedback and then continuing to develop the next generation. ","With respect to your question about next-generation products, you made reference to PMI. I think it's probably worth pointing out that, as I think everyone knows, we do have an agreement with PMI as a result of the spin-off in which certain intellectual property is jointly owned and separated by market, and that we have agreements in place with respect to the commercialization of technologies that may come out of that. ","I\u2019d also point out though that in addition to PMI, PM USA has robust R&D and we were able to marry that with the really terrific R&D resources of the smokeless company we acquired. So, we are very proud of our research and development team. We believe we have got lots of opportunity to innovate there. So, innovation continues to be a focus area for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS","Just quick question on the Marlboro architecture, you talked about making further investments. Can you just kind of contextualize those investments, is it more point of sale, is it more support behind some of the SKUs that you have been launching, that's the first question. The second question is, the Marlboro share incentive program ended in the June quarter, so just curious if that has created some kind of inventory bloat at retail, as lots of retailers were probably aiming to make some of their targets, any thoughts on that would be very helpful?","Marty Barrington","Look the way to think of Marlboro architecture is obviously it\u2019s the way that we are going to continue to grow Marlboro over time as it has grown in the past. And that allows us now across these four brand families to have a variety of initiatives, product, programmatic, retail executions and you see some of that playing out obviously in the second quarter. The sales force in April as we referenced went out and reset at retail so that when the consumer comes to point-of-sale, the four brand families are reinforced for the consumer there, and it makes it easier actually from an SKU point of view to see them. You saw Marlboro EIGHTY-THREES Box being rolled out to bring news to the Red franchise. We have promotional plans in place to generate trial from adult competitive smokers on Marlboro Black. So, those are but some examples, Nik, the way I think that we think about putting the architecture together in a way that it comes alive for the Marlboro consumer and it allows it to continue to grow as it would like. With respect to the Marlboro share incentives, as you know those are retail trade programs that evolve over time. There is a share growth component there. I don't think that we have noticed anything unusual at inventory as a result of the program.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.","Vivien Azer - Citi","My first question has to do with inventory levels at wholesale. You mentioned destocking in the back-half of June and into July. Is that largely done? Are inventories kind of back to normal levels or should we expect more destocking through the quarter?","Marty Barrington","Well, I think Howard made reference to this in his remarks. Just to maybe start one level up from that. For PM USA it\u2019s true, of course, that there are changes in inventory levels quarter-to-quarter or intra-quarter even, but for PM USA that actually tends to kind of wash itself out over the course of the year. I think that what Howard pointed out in his remarks is the trade inventory increased in the second quarter of \u201812 compared to the second quarter of \u201811 which did benefit PM USA\u2019s volume performance a bit. Then you had a build in second quarter and then those inventories were reduced after PM USA\u2019s announcement of its price increase on June 18. We saw some of that reduction continue a bit into July. I think that\u2019s a fair description of the situation at wholesale right now.","Vivien Azer - Citi","In terms of the consumer, I know its early days since the pricing been pass through, but I think there\u2019s increasing concern about the health of the U.S. consumer. Have you seen anything in the trade in terms of a response to the price increases, a little bit more trade down because I was actually surprised to see over the last two quarters discount losing about 100 basis points a share.","Marty Barrington","No, we haven\u2019t seen that. Of course, the price increase just went on June 18 and then we price protected in our MLP stores through June 30, but no we haven\u2019t observed that.","Vivien Azer - Citi","And my last question has to do with Skoal, I recognize that the year-over-year compares are skewed a little bit because of the launch of X-TRA and the SKU discounting, but can you give us a sense of how the underlying business is doing?","Marty Barrington","Sure, remember the strategy is to grow Copenhagen and Skoal together. So, if you look at the numbers really since the acquisition and over time, USSTC has done a great job with that. Skoal has a tough challenge, doesn\u2019t it, because it has to compete not only with other competitive brands but also with Copenhagen and Copenhagen has really been growing. Copenhagen wants to grow a lot. They have got some of the product offerings that it needed to compete more effectively. And so the combined share growth is spot on target for our strategy, and so we are pleased with that. We have said I think previously, Vivien that those brands will move at different speeds. One will move faster at one time than another. So, as long as the combined retail share growth goes, that\u2019s our strategy because we want to grow income by growing volume in this growing category. But there is work to do on Skoal. We have got it's positioning I think better. And now, we are really seeing if we can get Skoal\u2019s growth accelerated, but together as long as they grow, we are pretty okay with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","It looks to me that the net price mix for PM USA this quarter was maybe 1% plus or minus. Do you agree with the characterization that business is going through a period of time where it's putting a greater relative emphasis on market share growth?","Marty Barrington","No. I think that the strategy remains constant. The strategy for PM USA is to maximize income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro, and I think that's exactly what you see playing out. Here is what I\u2019d say about understanding kind of the pricing environment. First of all, smokeable adjusted operating company income grew and its margin grew, so it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s gone the wrong direction. One can argue about the relative growth but it continues to grow and its margin grew. I think the other thing to point out is pricing obviously as you well know occurs in a context, in the economic context in which that business currently competes is, we are in the middle of a really anemic recovery from the greatest recession in decades, and consumers are under pressure and pricing for most consumer packaged goods in this category is no exception have been more restrained than in previous periods of economic health. ","Then the final thing I guess I might say just on PM USA is, it\u2019s time of investment in Marlboro and the reason we do that is Marlboro is the long-term engine of PM USA\u2019s premium growth and the way it grows its margin and the way it contributes to income. So, I think if you put all those factors together and remembering pricing is obviously important in the cigarettes segment, everybody recognizes that, but it\u2019s not the only way for PM USA to contribute to income growth. It can moderate its promotional plans. It can reduce its cost structure. It can become more efficient about the way it delivers products to the marketplace and they have been very attentive to all of that. ","Then of course at the Altria level, we have other income contributors. We got a growing Smokeless business and we got a great wine business and so forth. So, that\u2019s kind of how we think about it David, which is putting all of those factors together. You point out that pricing has slowed a bit on that one axis, but really overall, I think we are pretty okay with how we are doing on income.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Secondly Marty, how much of an impact do you think this growth of roll your own volumes, what was going on with retail with the small manufacturing company? How much of an impact do you think looking backwards that may have had on total cigarette category volumes, and how much of a benefit do you think from this legislation you may see going forward from that?","Marty Barrington","I think that it's hard to measure is the honest answer. You have a secular decline rate that's made up of a number of factors including people smoking fewer cigarettes per day or switching to smokeless products. Actually I think in that group are people who have gravitated to these kinds of products whether it's roll your own or pipe your own, and so it's a bit hard to measure. Obviously for PM USA\u2019s business which focuses on premium, I don\u2019t think there is I believe that it's going be a significant contributing factor. Some folks who are using those machines now will gravitate to other low cost forms of using tobacco, some of it maybe cigarettes, but some of it maybe something else. So, we will see it's a good development of course that everybody who is manufacturing cigarette is playing by the same rules. I just don\u2019t think at this moment, we see it having a significant impact on volume.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Margot Schacter - Jefferies","This is Margot Schacter in for Thilo. I just had a kind of quick question of those David\u2019s price slowing question, can we expect price to accelerate anytime soon?","Marty Barrington","Well, I guess I would just refer you back to PM USA strategy which is to maximize income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro. And we will just have to see how that plays out over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","I guess sort of following on kind of the Marlboro share and pricing dynamics. Marty, just maybe you can give us some perspective on how you get comfort around the fact that some of these price-driven investments or the investments that you are making behind Marlboro\u2019s building brand equity, particularly among kind of the legal age to under 30 smoking group and that is not coming solely because of really the price investments that you are making.","Marty Barrington","There\u2019s a number of metrics we follow around Marlboro, of course, but when you put them all together I think we feel quite confident that Marlboro\u2019s health is good and that the investments we are making are wise. It has a great brand equity. It has high share. It commands premium pricing. Its price gaps have been stable throughout this terrible economic period. In fact if you look back from the period 2007 to 2011, it both grew share and improved its margin. And we know, listen this is how Marlboro has grown, right. If you go back to Marlboro in 1954 with Red or when Menthol was launched in 60s, or Gold in 70s, we know that Marlboro has that kind of equity. It\u2019s that kind of a big brand. And when you invest in it and it's got all these benefits, we know that consumers will choose Marlboro. So we have a lot of experience about both investing in and measuring the power of those investments in Marlboro. We have every reason to think that\u2019s the case today.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then Marty or Howard. Just in terms of your guidance, so just the commentary that the second half sort of moderates from the first half, just wondering is it just really more a comparison issue, are there any other factors that we should consider just in terms of a bit of a slowdown you\u2019re expecting for the back half? And then in terms of taking the low-end of the guidance up today, I know you've had strong performance in the first half from the equity income from SABMiller and then the PMCC. So, I'm just wondering how much of that is those factors as opposed to the tobacco business?","Marty Barrington","Well, I think that you pointed out that the comparison is probably the principal reason for that. Listen, the businesses are performing extremely well. We're very pleased. The execution of our plans is going fine, but as we pointed out in the release, capital of course, adjusted OCI was up 56% for the quarter and 96% for the half. As you know, Judy, those are transactional kinds of contributions from the leasing business. But that's likely to moderate. SAB, which is doing a wonderful job, was up nearly 25%. And it does great, but it hasn't performed historically at that level. So we just think that when you do that and compare it to the first half, it's likely to moderate a bit in the second. I think that's the way to think about that.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then for the cigarette category, the industry declined 3% in the first half. Is that sort of reflective of the underlying consumption decline number and do you think that that's kind of a reasonable rate of decline to think about for the full year?","Marty Barrington","Well, as you know, over time the decline rate has been a function of both secular decline rate and then some decline when prices go up with historical elasticity of about minus 0.3. Actually that's been constant for some time. We don't see much change in that in the current environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Just back on smokeless, I'm wondering if you could give us a little more color there and I guess part of what I'm getting at is, I know there is some trade issues and comparisons that skew some of it, but it certainly looks like Skoal is accelerating and that some of the things that I think you are trying to do on that business look like they may be working. Is there a corner you might be turning there?","Marty Barrington","I think it\u2019s probably as I described it just a couple of moments ago. We focus on growing Copenhagen and Skoal together. The brand is at different places in the marketplace. They have different propositions. Copenhagen has really had very, very strong growth. Skoal has to compete with that growth as well as compete against its competitors in the marketplace. We\u2019re making progress on Skoal, I think. And as long as the retail shares are growing together and we\u2019re participating in the industry volume growth, we\u2019re able to grow our income in accordance with our plans. And we have brand managers for Copenhagen and we have brand managers for Skoal and they are both trying to outcompete the other as well as the competition and we think that's the right way to attack that category.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","That\u2019s great. And then on the cost side, obviously you have the benefit of relatively benign input cost, but has the drought this year put any pressure on leaf costs for this year or for next year?","Howard Willard","Yeah, I think, there is nothing really out of the ordinary on our cost this year. We are tracking the drought\u2019s impact on tobacco growers and there is -- I would say there is some modest impact today although they\u2019ve recently gotten some rains in some key areas. So while that\u2019s on our watch list, we don\u2019t see any unusual impact at least today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Russo with Gardner, Russo & Gardner.","Thomas Russo - Gardner, Russo & Gardner","I\u2019m curious as to whether you found any steps to take in the context of these unusually low interest rates. Either regarding your pension fund and its funding status, or what other thing you might be able to do on your capital structure?","Howard Willard","","Sure. I think we've been in low interest rate environment for some time now, although as you accurately point out they've continued to head further south. And I think we're pursuing the strategy we have over the last couple of years, both in our pension plan and with our focus on seeking to reduce our effective interest rate. And as you know, we've done that by allowing some of our high interest debt to mature and then we've been going into the market periodically and getting quite advantageous rates. And I think that the latest low rates just indicate that that opportunity is likely to be with us for some time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport.","Ann Gurkin - Davenport","I wanted to return to the smokeless tobacco segment, and I was just curious if that business, your business is more in a position to grow in line with the overall industry now. Have you gotten Copenhagen and Skoal kind of to a position where that growth rate could be more in line with the industry?","Marty Barrington","Well, I think on an adjusted basis we think that it did grow in line with the industry. Our strategy is to grow in line with the industry rate or a little bit better than that. And you're correct to point out that if you take a bigger piece of the share that does help grow your volume there, but we're, I think, well on the way to doing that and I think the numbers in the quarter reflect that.","Ann Gurkin - Davenport","That's great to see. And just returning to Marlboro in the discussion, if you back out the architecture and back out the innovation and the stepped up brand investment, like the organic growth, is that meeting your target? The underlying performance of that brand?","Marty Barrington","Well, as you know, we don't back out that way, but I guess I\u2019ll just return to what I said before which is Marlboro's health is really very good. It\u2019s up three-tenths versus a year ago, up two-tenths for the half. We have our new Marlboro architecture that\u2019s being put in place. We have some new products that are in the marketplace. I think we\u2019re really pleased with how Marlboro is performing, Ann.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","I guess a couple of quick cash questions. First, I understand you paid down debt this quarter, right? But is that why the share repurchase slowed down to, I guess, its slowest rate since you guys started buying back again maybe five quarters ago. And then on CapEx can you just give a little color on why that outlook is changing down to $100 million?","Howard Willard","Sure. Yeah, I think you are pointing out that we had $600 million in debt that matured not in the second quarter but early in July and we did pay that off. I will go into the details of how we calculate how much stock to repurchase. But I would point out that three quarters into that five-quarter share purchase program, we\u2019ve purchased $700 million about worth of stock. So we think we\u2019re on a decent run rate and expect to finish that by the end of the year. Did you have a second question?","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yes, on the CapEx.","Howard Willard","Yeah, on CapEx, I would say that there is nothing unusual going on there. We forecast our capital expenditures at the beginning of each year. But then as we put together more detailed plans we scrutinize those capital expenditures more carefully and if there is an alternative way to achieve the result or if we can drive some incremental efficiencies, we seek to do that. And so as we pointed out, we\u2019ve now taken our capital expenditure forecast for the year from $150 million down to somewhere between $100 million and $125 million and we think that that's plenty in order to maintain the infrastructure we need in each of our businesses.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Great. And then just one question on the guidance. I know you guys said that EPS growth I guess would be easier in Q4 than Q3, and consensus is kind of there but not quite. Can you just remind us of the puts and takes and why Q4 growth will be better than Q3?","Marty Barrington","I think I would just rely on the remarks we made before Chris, that it's going to moderate a bit in the back half compared to the first half for the reasons I articulated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kieley with Deutsche Bank.","Andrew Kieley - Deutsche Bank","Marty, I just wanted to go back to, in terms of your satisfaction with the promotional investments on Marlboro, particularly on special blends at Marlboro Black. Could you talk a little bit about the decision to ease back on the promotions in May or June and how that speaks to the traction you're getting on those SKUs?","Marty Barrington","Well, look the promotional levels on these SKUs obviously are very carefully monitored over time, and special blends, of course, have a different role to play than Black. So it's worth just taking a second to make sure that's clear. And special blends, obviously, their role is to offer SKUs at price points for some of the more promotion sensitive smokers that are in the franchise. I think we've spoken before about 90% of Marlboro smokers choose the brand 100% of the time. But that leaves you 10% or so liking other competitive franchises that are more promotion sensitive. Special blend is a way to keep them in the franchise. All the while we manage our margin at the Marlboro level and they\u2019ve been very effective in that regard. But, of course, you don't want to offer more promotion than is needed and so we\u2019re able to moderate those or change those as circumstances warrant.","Marlboro Black on the other hand, it's a new product offering and so what we're trying to do is to generate trial among adult competitive smokers. And given the marketing restrictions in the industry, you have to do that principally at point of sale and you do that with some promotional offers and that\u2019s been the role of promotions for Marlboro Black. And as soon as we get some trial there that meets our goals, obviously it\u2019s the same issue which is if you don\u2019t have to spend more promotional money there than needed then you are able to back it off. And I think that\u2019s been what we\u2019ve observed both with respect to special blend and Marlboro Black.","Andrew Kieley - Deutsche Bank","And then just second question. If you could just talk broadly about the promotional and pricing environment in cigarettes in terms of what you are seeing from the premium competitors and the price gaps and the discount here. You\u2019ve got a little bit of reaction announced to the pricing you took in July, just how that\u2019s sticking. And maybe if lower gas prices are helping at all in terms of trade down in the category?","Marty Barrington","Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say that the industry\u2019s been competitive. It is competitive. It is likely to be competitive. And we don\u2019t see a big significant change, one way or the other, in that and PM USA\u2019s plans take that into account.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Burritt with Bloomberg News.","Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News","I want to ask you first, did you disclose how much pricing helped revenue. Is that something that you give?","Howard Willard","Yeah, I think you can certainly calculate that from what is included in our press release.","Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News","Okay. And secondly, as you introduce new products, can you describe whether you are hitting the wall so to speak with the FDA. I gather that they think -- that the agency simply is not considering, or at least not considering promptly, request by the cigarette manufacturers for new and modified products. Could you talk about that a bit and what impact that\u2019s having on the company?","Marty Barrington","Yeah. There is a couple of things in your question maybe we should separate out just to be clear. There was a major filing of so called substantial equivalents application some time ago, which was the principal filing. And what we've observed is that FDA is pretty methodically working through those. There were a lot of them that were filed at the agency and it's worth remembering that the agency obviously is in its first kind of couple of three years of staffing up and putting processes and procedure in. It's a pretty deliberate agency anyway and so they have some work to do in that regards. So, that's actually been, I think pretty much what we expected which was they would work their way through that.","After that date of course, they introduced regulated products into the marketplace. You do have to file applications for substantial equivalents and the products can't be launched, cannot be launched, until approval. I think most majors have applications that are pending there. I think that's just more of the same. They are trying to work through their structure and process about our approval. I would distinguish that from the last part of your question which was modified risk products. For example more conventional products. There the agency is really just building out its science and policy base about how they are going to think about that. And as you know they have conducted several hearings, and if you're interested in what we have to say about that we have them on our website. But I would distinguish that situation, which is likely to take place over some period of time. They have to get the science right before they are going to permit claims and that's what they are working through right now on that.","Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News","So, on the first half of the question, you're not kind of tapping your fingers and urging the FDA to get moving on that. You seem to have some patience?","Marty Barrington","While we planned for what was coming, I think, and so everyone would like their regulator to move promptly on matters. But we have found actually FDA to be pretty okay about how it's going about its work. And I'm sure that the speed will improve as they staff up over time.","Operator","","Your next question from the Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Marty Barrington","Operator, we don\u2019t seem to have a question.","Operator","That question has been withdrawn. I will now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.","Brendan McCormick","Thanks everyone for joining our call today.

(Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Sarah Knakmus, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Sarah Knakmus","","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Altria\u2019s Q3 earnings conference call. We are here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Howard Willard, Altria\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This morning we will only be discussing Altria\u2019s business results for Q3 and first nine months of 2013 and we will not be discussing the status of tobacco litigation. Our remarks contain forward-looking cautionary statements and projections of future results. ","May I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of our earnings release for review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Time periods referencing these remarks are to the relevant 2013 period unless another year is identified. Similarly, comparisons are to the comparable year or period unless otherwise stated. For a detailed review of Altria\u2019s business results please review the earnings release that is available on our web site Altria.com. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Today\u2019s call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in today\u2019s earnings press release and are available on our web site. ","Now I will turn the call over to Marty.","Martin Barrington","","Thanks Sarah. Good morning everyone. In the first nine months of the year Altria continued to execute against our long term objectives of delivering consistent adjusted diluted EPS growth in the range of 7% to 9% and maintaining a strong and growing dividend.","Strong Q3 results driven by contributions across our businesses helped produce adjusted diluted EPS growth of 9% for the first three quarters. Also during Q3 we increased our dividend by 9.1% marking the 47th dividend increase in the 44 years. Overall our businesses are on track against their full year objectives and Altria remains focused on creating long term value for shareholders. ","During both the quarter and the first nine months our strategies and diverse business model continued to produce strong results. Our tobacco operating companies grew adjusted operating companies income behind their leading premium tobacco brands and are alcohol assets also delivered income growth.","Additionally we used our capital structure to reward shareholders through share repurchases and we expanded our buyback program.","In the smokable product segment, PM USA balanced income growth with shared gains in a competitive environment. Higher pricing helped drive income growth in both the quarter and for the first nine months. PM USA grew its total retail share in both periods and held Marlboro\u2019s retail share flat versus its strong performance in both periods a year ago. The Marlboro Black family continues to contribute to the brand success and later this month PM USA will expand distribution of Marlboro Edge nationally. Marlboro Edge offers adult smokers bold smooth flavor. ","In third quarter, Q3 PM USA benefited from stronger shipment volume as volume declines moderated versus the previous quarters of 2013. PM USA\u2019s reported cigarette shipments grew 1.2% for Q3. After adjusting for calendar differences and changes in trade inventories, PM USA estimates that its Q3 domestic cigarette shipment volume was down approximately 3%, less than the estimated 3.5% decline rate for the total cigarette category. ","Also, after adjusting for trade inventory changes PM USA estimates that both its cigarette volume and total category volume declined approximately 4% for the [technical difficulty] with a 3% to 4% category decline rate we've seen for the last couple of years.","Altria's smokeless product segment continue to perform well as higher pricing and higher volume drove strong adjusted operating Company's income growth for both the quarter and first nine months. USSTC grew, Copenhagen and Skoal\u2019s combined volume and retail share for both reporting periods.","In addition to producing strong results in our core businesses we are developing innovative tobacco products for adult tobacco consumers. In August, Nu Mark introduced MarkTen e-vapor products into a lead market in Indiana and we're pleased with the results so far. Further Nu Mark plan [technical difficulty] and our expectation for the rest of the year, we are reaffirming Altria's guidance for 2013 full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.36 to $2.41. This represents a growth rate between 7% and 9% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.21 in 2012.","I'll now turn things over to Howard, who will discuss our business results in more detail.","Howard Willard","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. In the smokeable product segment third quarter reported operating Company's income grew by 11.5%, primarily due to higher pricing from previously disclosed NPM arbitration panel decision and higher reported shipment volume. These factors were partially offset by higher promotional investments, higher resolution expense and higher selling, general and administrative cost due to the timing of spending.","For the first nine months of 2013, the smokeable product segment's reported operating Company's income grew by 16%, primarily due to PM USA's NPM adjustment settlement, the NPM arbitration panel decision and higher pricing. These factors were partially offset by lower reported shipment volume and higher resolution spends.","Excluding the special items identified in our earnings press release, adjusted operating Company's income for the smokeable product segment grew by 3.1% to approximately $1.7 billion for the third quarter, and increased by 2% to approximately $4.8 billion for the first nine months.","PM USA grew its total retail share by two-tenths of a share point to 50.7% for the third quarter and by three-tenths of a share point to 50.6% for the first nine months.","Marlboro's retail share was unchanged versus both prior year periods at 43.7% for the quarter and 43.6% for the first nine months. PM USA's discount share was 3.9% for both periods, up three-tenths of a share point for the third quarter and up five-tenths of a share point for the first nine months. L&M contributed to PM USA's discount share gains in both periods.","Cigar shipment volume increased 6% for the third quarter and decreased 6.6% for the first nine months. Black & Mild's retail share decreased 1.1 share points for the third quarter and 1.6 share points for the first nine months.","Turning to the smokeless product segment, reported operating Company's income, for the third quarter, increased 12.6%, primarily due to higher volume, higher pricing and 2012 restructuring charges related to the current cost reduction program. These factors were partially offset by higher promotional investments and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.","For the first nine months of 2013, the segment's reported operating Company's income increased 13.4% primarily due to the same factors that drove growth for the quarter, partially offset by higher promotional investments and unfavorable mix due to the growth in products introduced in recent years at a lower popular price.","When adjusted for the special items identified in our earnings press release, the smokeless product segment's operating Company's income grew 9.1% for both periods.","For the third quarter USSTC and PM USA\u2019s combined reported domestic smokeless product shipment volume increased 9.5%, primarily due to one extra shipping day and volume growth for Copenhagen and Skoal. ","For the first nine months USSTC and PM USA\u2019s combined reported domestic smokeless shipment volume increased 6% due to volume growth for Copenhagen and Skoal, partially offset by declines for the other portfolio brands. Copenhagen and Skoal\u2019s combined reported shipment volume increased 10.5% for the third quarter and 7.2% for the first nine months. ","After adjusting for an extra shipping day, trade inventory changes and other factors USSTC and PMUSA estimate that their combined domestic smokeless product shipment volume grew approximately 4% for the third quarter. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors USSTC and PM USA estimate that their combined domestic smokeless product shipment volume grew approximately 5% for the first nine months, in line with estimated volume growth for the smokeless products category over the 12 months ending September 30, 2013.","For the third quarter and the first nine months Copenhagen and Skoal\u2019s combined retail share increased 0.1 and 0.4 of a share point, respectively. USSTC and PMUSA\u2019s combined retail share for the third and the first nine months decreased 0.3 and 0.2 of a share point, respectively, as retail share losses for Skoal and other portfolio brands were mostly offset by retail share gains for Copenhagen.","Ste. Michelle grew operating company\u2019s income by 7.7% for the third quarter due to improved premium mix and higher pricing, partially offset by higher selling general and administrative expenses and lower shipment volume. For the first nine months, Ste. Michelle grew operating company\u2019s income by 15.9% due to higher shipment volume, improved premium mix and higher pricing, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. ","Ste. Michelle\u2019s shipment volume decreased 2% for the third quarter primarily due to changes in trade inventories. For the first nine months Ste. Michelle\u2019s shipment volume grew 4.7% primarily due to increased distribution of 14 hands [ph]. ","During the third quarter Altria paid $883 million in dividends and purchased shares valued at approximately $156 million. Marty and I will now take your questions.","While the calls are compiled let me cover a few housekeeping items. As a reminder the tobacco product pricing and retail share figures are from the tracking services we introduced in the first quarter of 2013. We will also provide you with restated figures from the third quarter of 2012 so you will be able to compare the periods. ","Marlboro\u2019s price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 34% in the third quarter of 2013 and 35% in the third quarter of 2012. Marlboro\u2019s net pack price in the third quarter of 2013 was $5.86 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.36. For the third quarter of 2012 Marlboro\u2019s net pack price was $5.77 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.27.","The cigarette discount category\u2019s retail share was 25.3% for third quarter of 2013, flat versus third quarter of 2012. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax as of September 30, 2013 was $1.47 per pack, an increase of $0.06 per pack versus the third quarter of 2012. This includes the $1.60 per pack increase that took effect on July 1 in Minnesota, the $1.00 per pack increase that took effect on July 31 in Massachusetts and the $0.10 increase that became effective August 1 in New Hampshire.","For the third quarter of 2013 Copenhagen\u2019s retail price was $4.06 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 36%. For the third quarter of 2012 Copenhagen\u2019s retail price was $4.02 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 36%. For the third quarter of 2012 Copenhagen's retail price was $4.02 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 37%.","CapEx was $49 million for the third quarter and $90 million for the first nine months of 2013. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $52 million for the third quarter, we estimate that 2013 full year ongoing depreciation and amortization will be approximately $215 million.","Thank you for your time this morning. Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Adelman from Morgan Stanley.","David Adelman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning, everyone.","Martin Barrington","Good morning, David.","David Adelman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Marty, I was surprised in the discreet third quarter that the smokeless division\u2019s margins were down with volume and pricing up, can you just speak to that what the factors were and there was this illusion to the timing of expenses, what exactly is going on there?","Martin Barrington","Yeah, it\u2019s just the cost coming in-and-out of the quarter at different times, David. I think the better number to look at the margin question is really the nine month period. You can see there that actually the margin for that segment is up six-tenths of a percentage point to 42.2, so that\u2019s how we look at it over time. Again, you know, for sort of a larger reference point, if you look back to the period of 2008 to 2012 as you know this segment really grew its margin quite substantially by more than seven percentage points. So, I think a quarter is really too short a period to look at this, there is nothing particularly significant except for timing.","David Adelman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then on e-cigarettes, I\u2019m curious having MarkTen in the marketplace, what do you know now about the product, about consumer\u2019s reaction to it in terms of consumer\u2019s overall view towards e-cigarette that you might not have known actually being in the marketplace.","Martin Barrington","Yeah, that\u2019s a terrific question. Thank you for asking that. We\u2019re having a very successful lead market in Indiana, it\u2019s too early, obviously, to rummage around, I think, in numbers but here\u2019s what we know. It was very enthusiastically received by the trade. We were shooting to get coverage, as you know, across where cigarette volume is, we\u2019ve got coverage in moir\u00e9 than 3,000 stores, covering about 85% of cigarette volume. We\u2019ve gotten very good consumer feedback about the product. And we had a learning plan, the particulars of which I won\u2019t go into, as you might expect, for competitive reasons, but we had several questions that we wanted to ask about our offering. And I think the lead market, Indiana, has given us excellent insight into the consumer, into the offering we have, its competitive position, how it\u2019s being received at the trade. And so, you know, as our announcement says this morning it\u2019s on to Arizona, we\u2019ve taken those learnings, we\u2019ve incorporated them into our offering that we will have in Arizona. Our aspiration there is to cover about 2,000 stores and that\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to learn our way in this emerging category. We have new consumers, new products and we think that\u2019s the right way forward. But we\u2019re really pleased with what we\u2019ve learned in Indiana.","David Adelman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you very much.","Martin Barrington","Thanks for calling in, Dave.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Thilo Wrede from Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Good morning, everybody. Marty, your competitors this week have talked about the promotional environment in cigarettes being less promotional. Is that a view that you share?","Martin Barrington","I think I would refer to what we typically said about the segment. You know, it\u2019s a competitive space. It has been competitive, it remains competitive. I think what we\u2019ve observed, obviously, as new products come in-and-out of the market and people try to get consumer awareness of those, you see promotions from time-to-time and that\u2019s what we would observe.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies & Company","So, I interpret that as that you don\u2019t see much of a change then?","Martin Barrington","I think it\u2019s about what it\u2019s been, which is to stay competitive.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay. Given that environment, is there any opportunity for you to accelerate your price increases in smokeables?","Martin Barrington","Well, that\u2019s our strategy always, is to improve our profitability in the smokeable segment. We look at that regularly. As you know, that\u2019s done through a combination of factors, including list price increases and changing our promotional levels as is appropriate. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we can do that not necessarily on a national level, but we can go into regions and states and even markets to adjust those promotional levels. So, that\u2019s certainly our strategy. We are trying to maximize income while always making sure that the Marlboro share in particular remains in good form with some moderate momentum.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Chris Growe from Stifel.","Christopher Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","","Hi, I just want to ask first of all on keeping the wide range of EPS for the year and therefore has implications for Q4 is there any unique to Q4 we should consider be it at the low end or the high end of the range and unique to the comparisons?","Martin Barrington","There is one that I would mention Chris, which is that there is one fewer shipping Monday in the smokeless business and as you know a lot of volume goes out on our Mondays and there is one fewer of those in Q4 than there was in Q3, so that is a factor. You know we are investing obviously in our E-vapor business so those are two factors I might bring to your attention.","Christopher Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, and I want to ask, with the stronger volume in performance this quarter, not only for an adjusted basis, but on a reported basis, the OTI for the smokable segment came in a little below my expectations, so I am just curious if again there was anything unique to the costs this quarter? Or maybe even the phasing of the cost savings? Any factors you can help us understand the margin performance for that division.","Martin Barrington","No, again, I think the best way to understand that Chris is that is best understood over time. We are trying to maximize income, we look at that over time, and you know if you look back at some other figures again for context, you know that they are higher, in the 2012, I think it was 4.2. We are making investments in Marlboro. We continue to roll out the Marlboro architecture. We have improved the web site. We have got digital technology for our marketing platform now, so I think that is the way to understand it. Howard you may want to say more.","Martin Willard","","Yes, I think just two comments on Q3. I mean when you look at year-over-year pricing, the price realization was affected by the comp from last year and then there were more expenses in Q3 from a year-over-year trend perspective than there were in the first half but I don\u2019t think that is a particular change in trend. It is just that they just happen to fall more heavily in Q3 and certainly part of that is related to the phasing in the cost reduction program. We got more of the cost savings earlier in that program but I still think to go back to the nine month numbers are probably more reflective of the overall trend.","Christopher Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, that is very helpful. If I could ask just one quick follow up to the question that David asked it about and your comment how you have made some changes, some learnings that are from Indiana, was there any change to the actual physical product that you are selling in Arizona?","Martin Barrington","","I am not going to get ahead of what we are going to do in Arizona but I can tell you that we are always looking at the product. I think we have talked earlier that for this product Chris it is on the earlier part of the technology curve probably than the later part of the curve, so we are consistently looking at that product to see if we can improve its acceptability to the adult tobacco consumer. As you know the way we think about going to market is through our value equation with not just product but price and promotions and packaging and the like. We are looking at all of that to make sure that our total bundle and offering to the consumer is the best we can offer. We will have more to say about that as we get closer to December.","Christopher Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay.","Martin Barrington","Thanks for calling.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Vivien Azer from Citigroup.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Citigroup","","I wanted to circle back on the timing of the investments, I heard you loud and clear, that more investment to come on the E-vapor business, should part of the investment timing that we saw drive the increase in SG&A were first out in the fourth quarter, or is there more incremental spending to come Q4?","Martin Barrington","","Well I think specifically looking at our investment in E-vapor, there has been a ramp up in the back half and I think probably a further ramp up in Q4, obviously with a new test market being opened up. I think as it relates to expenses in the rest of the business, I think that is more of a Q3 phenomenon. ","Vivien Azer \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, understood. On your smokeless business it looks like maybe Copenhagen is finding its footing from a price gap perspective and now holding steady at 36% and potentially finding an inflection point in the average price per can, can you comment on how you view Copenhagen from a price gap perspective today, and where it can go from here?","Martin Barrington","","Well, I guess I\u2019ll start, again, with the strategy, which is, you know, we\u2019re trying to make sure that Copenhagen and Skoal are growing together and you saw that in the numbers both for the quarter and the nine months, together they\u2019re growing their volume quite nicely, they\u2019re growing their retail share. Copenhagen, as you know, we\u2019ve put some SKUs there, Vivien, that really have taken off. That includes products that compete at the popular price level and it\u2019s that mix, I think, that you may be referring to. We\u2019re pretty happy, overall, with Copenhagen\u2019s performance in the marketplace, it\u2019s a very highly differentiated product and we like its performance.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Citigroup","Terrific and one last one on the smokeless business. It looks like Skoal\u2019s market share declines are accelerating and can you dive a little bit deeper into what\u2019s driving that?","Martin Barrington","Yeah, I think as we\u2019ve discussed previously, we\u2019ve been working hard at Skoal, you know, that\u2019s a brand that requires some further work on its positioning at the time that we acquired that brand. We\u2019ve been hard at work at Skoal. Obviously, we started first with Copenhagen, Copenhagen has really taken off as we\u2019ve given it its SKUs and gotten it positioned correctly in the marketplace. You know, the strategy, I think, continues to work quite effectively because of the combination, but there\u2019s no denying that we would like to see Skoal\u2019s share stabilize and we\u2019re working very hard to make sure that that happens.","Operator Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Good morning.","Martin Barrington","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hi. In terms of Edge, you mentioned you\u2019re rolling it out nationally later this month, so could you talk about this national rollout relative to your recent rollout of Marlboro NXT and what are similarities and potential differences of your rollout plans and which line do you believe has the most upside potential?","Martin Barrington","Sure. Good question. I think it\u2019s best understood in the context of expanding the Marlboro Black family. And so we know how we do this right. We look for places in the market where there may be an unmet need or there\u2019s place in our portfolio to look for attracting competitive smokers to our brand. Edge is what the latest of that. It\u2019s very similar, actually, to the approach with NXT, which is we try to put the market in front of the consumer, we try to learn, if successful, we try to expand it. We try to raise awareness through some introductory pricing and then we try to move it on to the promotional platform that\u2019s best, but I think it\u2019s best understood as part of the Marlboro architecture and in this Marlboro in particular.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. And then, Marty, I\u2019m curious how you think broadly about line extensions and maybe what the right number of line extensions there should be on any kind of \u2013 or any of your brands and if there is a point where there might too many extensions that could possibly hurt Marlboro\u2019s brand equity? I just want to understand your thinking there.","Martin Barrington","It\u2019s a good question. You always want to be thoughtful about your brand portfolio and we examine that rigorously. We never bring an SKU to market simply for the sake of bringing it to market. We have to satisfy ourselves, generally speaking, that there is a consumer need for it and that it fits in with our overall brand strategy. And in Marlboro\u2019s case, in particular, we always want to make sure that any SKU we bring to the market is going to enhance its equity and its premium that \u2013 and we don\u2019t bring anything out in the Marlboro portfolio until we\u2019ve gone through those filters and Marlboro Edge is a good example, I think, where we have satisfied ourselves. We have high expectations for Edge to add to the overall portfolio as well as to contributing to Marlboro\u2019s equity. But you are right, you have to be thoughtful about your portfolio and we try to do that particularly on Marlboro but certainly on all our brands.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. Then just my final question on MarkTen, just a bit of a follow-on question. How did it perform relative to your internal expectations and what have your repeat purchase trends been in the State? And that I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re seeing quite a bit of dual usage with cigarettes, you know, just any other consumer trends?","Martin Barrington","Again, I think it\u2019s too early to talk about the numbers, because I just don\u2019t think that they are well-developed enough to share and to be confident in them, but I can tell you that with respect to who\u2019s trying to products and e-vapor generally, we do know that there is dual use. And in particular as adult smokers try e-vapor products we know that some of them are satisfied others are not, some of them use them situational-y. We have a pretty robust, as you might expect, consumer research program into who adult vapors are, their patterns of use, how they may be segmenting, the products that we want and that\u2019s all part of our learning plan in Indiana. And, again, for proprietary reasons I\u2019m not going to discuss that at this time but I can tell you that we\u2019ve learned a lot, it\u2019s informed our judgment about moving forward in Arizona and we\u2019re very excited about being able to move this platform forward.","Operator","","Our next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Thanks, good morning.","Martin Barrington","","Good morning Judy.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","First, I just wanted to get clarification on the wholesale inventory level at the end of the third quarter, I think some of your competitors have also noticed a movement to really limit inventory loading in fourth quarter ahead of the price increase speculations, so I was just wondering if you expect a similar limitation to put on wholesalers and that potentially limits some of the volatility that we continue to see on a quarter-to-quarter basis on the inventory movement.","Martin Barrington","We have an allocation program that we have had for a long time so that is hardly anything new to us and with respect to the third quarter inventory levels, I think we referenced as a bit of a build but there is nothing really very significant in cigarette inventory levels from third quarter to third quarter a year ago in our observation.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, and then a couple of questions on the E-cigarettes, I think this is more of a broad category question, and now that you have participation in the category I am just curious to your observation about the pace of category growth that you are seeing at this point versus maybe a year ago. Sequentially it looks like the pace of that category growth is a little bit more modest, I was just curious what you think is driving that and whether we really need something, a bigger innovation, or better consumer acceptance to really accelerate a category growth and then related to that, in terms of how your dialogue with some of the regulators both at the FDA level and at the state legislators are evolving as you now have a stake in the category with your product.","Martin Barrington","Thanks, those are all excellent questions. Let\u2019s talk first of all about the category. Obviously the category has grown very quickly off a very low base. Whether it will continue to grow at that trajectory, of course, no one knows yet. We have identified, I think, the factors that are likely to be contributing to that. We have run scenarios against these. We have talked about these previously I think. You know one is the product itself. As the products get better and become more acceptable to adult smokers you would expect for perhaps greater transition to the product. ","Second is regulation. If they are regulated very heavily by the FDA in ways that don\u2019t encourage adult smokers to try them or to switch to them depending on what the FDA says about that, that certainly is going to have a big effect on the category growth and then of course we have to deal with excise taxes. We have engaged with all of the stakeholders in those questions for some time now including, I would say, even before we even entered Indiana. We have strong views on this. We think that the FDA should regulate on a scientific basis and we have been communicating with the FDA regularly both about the category and our product. ","The same has been true with respect to excise taxes. I think you know we have a robust government affairs organization and we have a lot of experience here. We are trying to help legislators think about the correct excise tax approach which in many ways is bound up in the same question as the regulatory approach. So we are fully engaged on this and I think as to how fast it grows or how slow it grows those will be the factors, in our view, that will determine that largely.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thank you.","Martin Barrington","Thanks for your call.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Filippe Goossens from Mitsubishi Securities.","Filippe Goossens \u2013 Mitsubishi Securities","","Yes good morning Marty, thanks for taking my call. I have a couple of questions on E6 if I may. One of your competitors stated yesterday they see E6 as actually a global opportunity hence their acquisition of a player in the UK markets. Is there an understanding between yourselves and PMI as to your ability to enter that space as well globally that is what you would decide to do at some point in time?","Martin Barrington","Well I think you are referred back, obviously to the spin-off of PMI and there were arrangements in place of course dealing with the existing businesses at that time which was cigarettes. Obviously cigarettes and E-vapor is a category that has emerged since that time so the answer is no.","Filippe Goossens \u2013 Mitsubishi Securities","Okay and then secondly, it is probably still too early to tell but based on your current read with regard to the potential of E6 now in the U.S., do you think that at some point in time this would start to cannibalize the smokeless category as well?","Martin Barrington","Well, we\u2019ll have to see, I guess. We haven\u2019t really been \u2013 you know, the question usually comes in the form of whether it\u2019s going to take some volume away from cigarettes and what we said there, of course, is that it\u2019s still small, it\u2019s hard to tease that out. We know that some adult smokers are certainly trying e-cigarettes and so it will have some effect on volume, but you can\u2019t tease it out. We haven\u2019t seen very much about that on smokeless, but I guess time will tell.","Operator Your next question comes from Michael Lavery or CLSA.","Michael Lavery \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc","Good morning. When you\u2019re launching Marlboro Edge, does that have any impact on the rest of \u2013 how you think about discounting and promotions on the rest of Marlboro Black and has it allowed you to dial back any of the discounting levels on other SKUs there?","Martin Barrington","Well, Marlboro Edge is a premium product and it\u2019s in the premium family of Marlboro. What we try to do there is to offer introductory pricing to try to attract competitive adult smokers to it, so that\u2019s I think the best way to understand that, which is, it\u2019s a premium offering. We do offer some promotions to try to get some awareness and certainly trial because we think if they it, they\u2019ll like it.","Michael Lavery \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc","Yeah. I guess, what I\u2019m getting at is you\u2019ve had some of these similar launches over the last couple of years now and some of these ones that are, you know, one or two or more years old. How long does introductory pricing last, I mean, is there some color you can give on what the discount levels are doing on these ones that have had introductory pricing, is that sort of passing the baton to Marlboro Edge or do some of those still have more extended periods of introductory pricing level?","Martin Barrington","Well, I think the way to think about it is, is the total competitive set. So, you want to have introductory pricing to try to make sure that the product has awareness that it\u2019s out there that it\u2019s a new product and that it\u2019s available. We also offer, as you grow brands, and as you know in this category, brands don\u2019t grow overnight and particularly when you have the big share, like we do in Marlboro, bigger than the next 10 brands combined, you know, these are trends that take place over time. And so we have promotional plans in place for them that we evolve over time, but it\u2019s always designed to how we\u2019re doing against the competitive set of adult competitive smokers. And that\u2019s how we think about it. As you\u2019ve heard us discuss many, many times, we take the long view in this business and with this segment and we\u2019re patient.","Michael Lavery \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc","Okay. Thanks. And then just looking at the other segment, you know, there was the help in the, you know, what used to be PMCC plus other line from, you know, what looks like an asset sale. Can you give any sense of how much, in fact, that might have had or what that run rate would have looked like without that there?","Howard Willard","Yes. I mean, we\u2019re not breaking out the other between the various contributors, but certainly within the third quarter you had a contribution from PMCC and then the other item in there is our investments in the e-vapor category. And so that results from the combination of the two.","Michael Lavery \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc","Alright. And then you mentioned on 4Q, is it just one less shipping day specifically for the smokeless segment or is that for everything?","Martin Barrington","Smokeless only.","Michael Lavery \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc","Okay. And just kind of following up on Judy\u2019s question on the inventory. Is there a build \u2013 it looks like you might have had a modest build into or at the end of 3Q? Is there much of an impact you would expect that to have on 4Q shipment to kind of make up for it?","Howard Willard","Yes. I don\u2019t think that \u2013 we did have a modest build in the third quarter and that compares to the prior year when there was a modest drawdown in inventory. But I wouldn\u2019t expect that it\u2019s going to have much impact on the fourth quarter but it\u2019s too soon to tell. I think we\u2019re going to have to see how things shake out in the latter part of the quarter.","Michael Lavery","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin Barrington","Thanks for your call.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Chris Evert from Bloomberg News.","Chris Evert \u2013 Bloomberg News","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Marty, I want to ask about e-cigs, kind of a broader question. You know, as they gain popularity around the country I\u2019m guessing that companies are beginning to look into whether to allow vaping in the workplace. How do you see that playing out? And what are the factors, FDA regulations and others that is going to direct or \u2013 what factors are going to guide how vaping in the workplace plays out?","Martin Barrington","","Okay thanks for your question. Our view on that is it should be guided by the science. As the science develops around vaping and in this case your question really goes to the heart of is there any risk from second-hand vaping if you will and as the FDA looks at all of these questions, I think that there you need a scientific [indiscernible] space approach to that. What we would like to see in the short term is that regulation should have a good reason for its basis and in the absence of a reason or knowledge about that we would like, obviously, to have the FDA have an opportunity to do the work that is required. So I think that it will follow from the science. It will follow from the evidence and we are engaging with the FDA and other regulators about that.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Thomas Russo from Gardner Russo & Gardner ","Thomas Russo \u2013 Gardner Russo & Gardner","","Hi, good morning.","Martin Barrington","Hi Tom.","Thomas Russo \u2013 Gardner Russo & Gardner","Hi, good morning. I have a couple of questions on excise taxes. On the increased excise tax level, any upcoming planned increases and if not what are the prospects for any federal excise tax activity? Second as for the smokeless category, where do you stand in the process of converting states from ad forum to specific and what is the general level of excises taxes looking out for the next 12 months for the smokeless?","Martin Barrington","Okay let me take those in turn. Let me start with the FET. Tom as you know there is a proposal [indiscernible] in the budget and there is some activity trying to persuade people to get behind that. We oppose that. As you know these taxes are aggressive with a huge increase in 2009. You know so far there has not been a lot of traction on that but we are monitoring that carefully with our federal government affairs team.","Thomas Russo \u2013 Gardner Russo & Gardner","Good.","Martin Barrington","The second question Tom was about smokeless and ad [indiscernible]. We continue, obviously, to advocate where it is appropriate to do so, to move the weight base, we think that it is a much fairer system. There are opportunities that present itself in the states from time to time to advance that argument and we do that forcefully when we have opportunities to do that. I would say the FET outlook generally, Howard in his remarks, I think covered what we have seen so far, both with respect, really with respect to cigarettes and we are always guarded. State budgets are better than they were but they still have gaps in them and we are watchful. You may have seen there was a media report on a proposal for an excise tax increase in the city of Chicago. So these things pop up from time to time and our approach to them is to try to get in there and advocate for why they are unfair on our adult consumers.","Thomas Russo \u2013 Gardner Russo & Gardner","Good, thank you.","Martin Barrington","Thanks for calling.","Operator","","Presenters there are no further questions in queue at this time.

Please go ahead.","Unverified Participant","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria's CEO, and Billy Gifford, Altria's CFO, to discuss Altria's 2017 second quarter and first half business results.

Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results.

Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.","Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, thanks Bill (1:56) and good morning everyone. Based on strong tobacco operating company performance, Altria delivered solid results in the second quarter and first half of 2017. The smokeable products segment generated strong income growth despite a large cigarette excise tax increase in California, and the smokeless products segment has largely rebounded from its first quarter voluntary product recall. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share 4.9% in the second quarter and 3.3% for the first half of 2017.","The smokeable products segment delivered 6.4% adjusted operating companies income growth in the second quarter as strong pricing more than offset volume declines and higher promotional investments. For the first half, smokeable products segment adjusted operating companies income grew 7.2%. As I mentioned, the smokeable segment's results were negatively impacted by California's $2 per pack cigarette excise tax increase, which went into effect on April 1.","California is a high-volume state, previously accounting for approximately 7% of total U.S. cigarette industry volume. Following the tax increase, California's volume contribution dropped to 5% which drove total U.S. industry volume down approximately 4.5% in the quarter.","In addition, Marlboro has a strong share in California of over 50%. Thus Marlboro was disproportionally impacted by the tax increase contributing to its decline of 0.3 of a national retail share point in the second quarter to 43.5%.","We expect these dynamics will continue to dampen Marlboro's share through the back half. Outside of California, Marlboro's second quarter share remains stable, sequentially. Past experience shows that tax increases of this magnitude are most disruptive immediately following implementation, after which the rate of decline moderates. We continue to anticipate an approximate 1% negative impact on industry volumes for the full year as a result of the excise tax increases in California on April 1, and Pennsylvania last August.","Looking to the back half of the year, PM USA recently announced the national expansion of Marlboro Black Menthol 72's, a product PM USA expects will further enhance Marlboro's position in the growing menthol segment and among adult smokers age 21 to 29.","Moving to the smokeless products segment. USSTC has largely rebounded from its first quarter product recall. It delivered 9.8% adjusted operating companies income growth in the second quarter. USSTC grew smokeless products volume 1.4% in the quarter and gained retail share sequentially, growing 0.6 of a share point over the first quarter.","USSTC estimates that the recall had about a half of a share point impact on its total retail share in the second quarter. And Copenhagen continued to gain ground in the second quarter growing 0.7 of a retail share point to a record share of 34.1%. That was a particularly strong performance as it lapped the Copenhagen Mint national expansion in 2016. Through the first half, Copenhagen remains both the largest and the fastest-growing smokeless tobacco product in the U.S.","On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 0.7 of a share point in the second quarter, driven by Skoal's 1.4 share point decline. For the first half, combined Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 0.6 of a share point. The smokeless products segment delivered 1.6% adjusted operating companies income growth for the first half of 2017, as higher pricing was partially offset by the first quarter recall. Now that the product recall is complete and trade inventories are substantially replenished, USSTC is well-positioned moving into the second half of the year.","Finally an update on our innovative tobacco products efforts. In e-vapor, Nu Mark's MarkTen brand continues to grow volume and retail share. It is currently the number two e-vapor brand nationally with a second quarter national retail market share of approximately 13% in mainstream channels. MarkTen is now present in stores representing nearly 65% of e-vapor volume in those channels. And among stores, with MarkTen distribution through the full second quarter, MarkTen's retail share was approximately 24%. We're pleased with MarkTen's progress and Nu Mark plans to continue growing the brand in the back half.","In heated tobacco, the FDA began its substantive review of Philip Morris International's modified risk tobacco product application for IQOS in late May. The FDA published PMI's Executive Summary and research summaries to its website for public review and comment, and the agency plans to publish additional sections of the application on a rolling basis. We continue to work closely with PMI throughout the review process.","As a reminder, PMI submitted its pre-market tobacco product application for IQOS to the FDA on March 31. Our team at PM USA continues to build its U.S. commercialization plans which we look forward to sharing with you in the future.","I'll wrap up with guidance. Obviously, our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to expect higher adjusted diluted EPS growth in the second half of the year as some first half headwinds moderate and because the fourth quarter will include equity earnings from our beer investment whereas the fourth quarter of 2016 did not. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth.","Here's Billy for more details on our performance.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks Marty and good morning everyone. I'll start with the smokeable products segment. As Marty discussed, cigarette industry volumes declined approximately 4.5% in the second quarter, impacted by the significant cigarette excise tax increase in California. The smokeable products segment's reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.9%, moderated by trade inventory movements. When adjusted for these inventory movements, PM USA's cigarette shipment volume was down an estimated 5%.","For the first half, cigarette industry volumes declined by an estimated 3.5%. The smokeable products segment's cigarette shipment volume decreased 2.8% on a reported basis. When adjusted for trade inventory movements, PM USA's cigarette shipment volume declined an estimated 4%.","The cigar business continues to perform well, delivering volume growth of 13.1% for the second quarter and 12.7% for the first half of 2017. Smokeable products segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.6 percentage points to 51.7% in the second quarter, driven by higher pricing. For the first half, adjusted OCI margins expanded 2.2 percentage points to 51.4%.","In the smokeless products segment, industry volume grew an estimated 1% in the past six months. USSTC's reported shipment volume grew 1.4% in the second quarter, but declined 1.7% in the first half due to the recall. Smokeless products segment's adjusted OCI margins increased by 0.7 of a percentage point in the quarter to 70%, driven principally by higher pricing, partially offset by higher SG&A spending and unfavorable mix.","For the first half, smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins decreased by 1.1 percentage points primarily due to the recall, partially offset by higher pricing. Looking ahead, we expect to see some impact on the smokeless category from California's excise tax increase on smokeless tobacco products, which went into effect on July 4th. California accounts for roughly 4% of U.S. smokeless industry volume and we expect the average price per can in California to increase by over $1 or approximately 25% in the third quarter.","Turning to our alcohol assets, Ste. Michelle faced headwinds in the first half, largely due to trade inventory reductions and increased competitive activity. In recent quarters, we have observed a slowdown in premium wine category growth in measured channels, and the trade ended 2016 with excess inventory of Ste. Michelle products. As the trade reduced their inventories, Ste. Michelle's shipment volume was negatively impacted, down 12.4% for the first half. Ste. Michelle is working closely with its major distributors to manage through this, and believes that volume trends will improve in the second half versus the first half.","In beer, adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev were $142 million in the second quarter, reflecting AB InBev's first quarter results, which it reported in May. This excludes a $408 million gain related to AB InBev divestitures in the quarter, which were planned as a closing condition of the SABMiller business combination.","I'll wrap up by underscoring our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. First, through the first half of 2017, we paid shareholders nearly $2.4 billion in dividends. Second, we repurchased $1.6 billion in shares, leaving approximately $335 million in the program as of June 30th. This week, our board authorized a $1 billion expansion to the share repurchase program. We expect to complete the $4 billion program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items. You will see that we've included a few additional data points on the discount cigarette category. This is in response to a few recent questions we received on the topic. With that, operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Investors, analysts, and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","So thank you so much for the additional disclosure. Maybe I can start there. While we don't have a time series, I suspect part of the 40 basis point gain that we saw for deep discount is, of course, coming from some of the disruption that we're seeing in California and Pennsylvania. But if Nielsen is any guide, and some of the other public company competitor disclosures is a guide as well that deep discount has been gaining share already prior to what's happening in California and Pennsylvania. And if that's the case then Marty, I was just hoping to get your thoughts on why you think we're seeing that dynamic. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes, we can \u2013 I'll get Billy maybe to talk about the geography in a minute. But, when we look at it, it looks like churn in the discount category to us. The gain in deep discount, so for reference for people who \u2013 we're referring to the quarterly metrics report where we put these data in that Billy referenced. And we show there that the discount category has not grown year-over-year.","In fact, it's essentially flat down a tenth. But there is some difference between the branded discount which is down five tenths and deep discount which is up 4. So it looks to us like it's basically churn there. I mean importantly for us, there does not appear to have any significant effect on Marlboro or in L&M. Indeed, if you look at the share chart in the earnings release, you can see that the discount category for us was actually up a tenth over the half. Billy can talk about the geographies, but there's no question that when you have a major excise tax increase in a state, some people do trade down. I don't know, Billy, you want to talk about discount?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes. Vivien, basically with discount, and as Marty mentioned, it's a discount phenomena, tends to be consolidated through the middle of the country and down into the Southeast, and it really is trading within that discount category. I would say L&M, our discount brand, is well represented in that category and is doing exactly what we want, which is grow share while not growing the overall discount category.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. Just as a follow up to that then, seemingly then we're talking about a distinct segment of the total smoker population. So Marty, can you offer any comments on kind of the health of the smoking population broadly from an economic standpoint? And then specifically perhaps that lower-end smoker? Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes, sure. Overall, Vivien, I would say that we continue to have a largely constructed view of the economic situation of our consumer. Unemployment's down, housing is up, wage gains are starting to come through. All the stuff that we talk about all the time, so I won't repeat that. That looks to us to be pretty stable. Gas prices are up a little bit, but not remarkably so in a way that affects our business.","I think what you may be getting at though that there is a segment of consumers in our category who will go into the store and ask the clerk for the lowest-priced brand, and they may be picking up some share there but again, it appears to be coming out of perhaps the branded discount segment without certainly no effect on our brands, so we don't see it in premium, generally. I hope that's helpful.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","Very helpful. Thank you so much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you very much. Just to follow Vivien's question, I guess, you're talking about within discount, you're seeing this churn, and I was just wondering whether you've seen deep discounts as innovation in any way, or whether your sort of major competitors have somehow deemphasized their discount brands. So that would be my first question. I do have a complete separate question on buy backs, but if you could answer that first.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. Yes, thanks for calling. We do not see that. I think it's basically a function of price, Adam.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Fine. And then on buy backs, I at least was surprised by the quantum of buy backs in this quarter. I know you've increased your guidance, but is this quarter the guidance \u2013 what you did in 2Q, does that tell me anything about the run rate we should expect for Q3 and Q4?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes. Thanks for that question, Adam. I wouldn't read anything into any particular action. We really monitor the marketplace. We have a disciplined approach to share repurchases, and it really is dependent on market conditions that we see in the marketplace on the rate that we're going to buy shares back. I think you \u2013 if you put it in context as a whole and you go back to when we began share repurchases in 2011, you can see it's been a great investment of our excess cash.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Fine. And then my final question. You've obviously left your guidance for EPS unchanged for the full year and the question is have you altered in any way your assumptions about beer and the contribution from beer? And maybe as you have perhaps increased your buy back assumptions that's been offset by slightly different assumptions for beer.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I guess the honest answer is...","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","... Baked into that EPS guidance.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes, I think I understand the question, thank you. That's why we do a range. And I think the range is sufficiently broad that, look, if you could predict your EPS with perfect prescience, you would put out a number, but you can't of course because of dynamics, again, you see it again this year as well. So we try to have the range to be broad enough to cover all that. We put our best thinking into what we can do within the range and that does include what we expect out of our beer investment. So the answer is yes, it's all in the guidance and we think the range is sufficiently broad to cover it.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","And it hasn't changed basically enough to \u2013 the assumptions for beer within the...","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","No. No, I don't think so. I think we were thoughtful about putting the guidance together at the first of the year and I think that we are comfortable with the guidance range we have at this point in time.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Michael.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","You have the share in Marlboro falling more than your discount piece of your portfolio like you pointed out, and so there's some unfavorable mix there. You also mentioned in your prepared remarks some higher promotional investments, but your smokeable price mix in total is still a strong number.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Can you just give us a sense of how you think about the promotional lever? And related to that, obviously too, there was a good margin lift in that segment. Was pricing the only or primary driver? Is there some other pieces there? How should we think about kind of the run rate and outlook there?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. Let me try to tackle those. I think that you know what the strategy is. We're trying to maximize income in the segment, and that's a balance between that and making sure we have momentum on the key brands including Marlboro. So the share on Marlboro is down primarily because of the California effect. But other metrics on Marlboro continue to be strong. Its equity is great. As you can see, we've got very good pricing through the first half, Michael. The demographics have stabilized since Marlboro architecture. We just have a massive increase in California. We over-index in California, and so I think that explains that.","The competitive environment I think we would describe as, it's always competitive. It may be useful for a couple of comments on that. One is if you think of competitive activity as occurring within say a band, it looks to us like the competitive activity remains within the band although perhaps a bit on the high side of the band. We have some promotional launches and some promotional activity from other competitors but we monitor that carefully, as you know. And what we basically do is we adjust as we need to adjust. So I think it's pretty steady as she goes and we're very happy. When you look at the income performance in the smokeable segment at more than 7% for the first half, despite the California increase, I think that they're doing a great job over there in line with their strategy.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's great. That's helpful. And then just one on IQOS. Can you give a sense of how you think about some of the contingency planning? Obviously, the FDA comment period alone runs through mid-December, so even early 2018 for a decision might be a little optimistic, but perhaps as soon as that or realistically, it could be two or even three or something years before you hear just knowing it's \u2013 how that can go. How do you think about resource allocation given some of that uncertainty? And if it is sooner than later, how quickly could you be able to activate some of your commercialization plans?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes. Well, look, we're preparing to be ready on the nominal timelines that the FDA has said with respect to approving those applications. Your question correctly implies of course that's not completely within our control and it could take longer than that. That's why we're investing in with discipline. We're trying not to over-spend on the front end but we will certainly make the appropriate investments once we know we're go. So the way we look at it is we're going to be ready at the earliest moment to proceed expeditiously. If it turns out to be longer, we have contingency plans in place to do that. It's just not within our control, so we try not to fret too much about that, we just try to be ready when we can go.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. That's helpful.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Michael. Nice to hear your voice.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hey, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I want just a bit of a follow on to an earlier question. And forgive me if you said this, but I just was trying to understand if you could frame the elasticity in California. And related to that, a couple other companies have talked recently about less c-store trips. I was just curious if you're seeing that as well, if that's been a factor at all in your business.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I'll take the second one first, and then I'll ask Billy to comment on the elasticity question, Chris. We have not observed that in our category at c-store. We've been reading carefully the reports. We've seen others comment on that, but at least with respect to our category, we have not seen that yet.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes, Chris, and in regards to elasticity, what we see in the marketplace, looking at other states that have had large increases, as you see it dip down, there is consumer reaction just following a CT increase. There's a bit of trade-down that takes place as they digest that price increase in the marketplace, and then we see it return to normal elasticity through time once they've digested it and feel comfortable with where cigarettes are priced. So through time it is the negative 0.3 elasticity that we see through time.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So your expectations for the California plus say, Pennsylvania drag, the 1 percentage point drag on volume would likely include some improvement as we go ahead in future quarters? Still obviously a negative, but some improvement in the way the consumer reacts.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes. Chris, when we look at other states, we see that improvement take place. It's just it's hard to predict exactly how long it's going to take based on the level of the increase for the consumer to get comfortable with cigarette prices again.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I had just one follow-up, if I could, on Copenhagen. Just to understand, I think you had said there was still a bit of a market share drag of like 50 basis points on that brand. Is that just trade inventories were building back to normal levels? Are you kind of at a point here where you don't see that residual effect continuing in the second half of the year on the share?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, you see that on almost all the metrics the business bounced back terrifically in the second quarter, it's just that when you're out of the market and you lose your share, it just takes longer to gain the share back. And so I think we said at the first quarter call that we expected to gain that back over the course of the year and we were trying to point out the gain that we made in the second quarter of I think 0.6 sequentially. So I think we'll get it back over the course of the year, but it doesn't bounce back immediately.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks for your time.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So first just a quick follow-up on Marlboro. Just kind of thinking about the third quarter volume because clearly in the second quarter you had the benefit of the favorable inventory movement. If I kind of extrapolate the inventory sort of getting back to normalized level and then you have a bit of unfavorable comp in terms of the third quarter, could we see volume down something like a 10% on Marlboro? I'm just kind of thinking about the magnitude of some of these inventory movements.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, I'll speak to the inventory movements. I won't speak to guidance on volume, particularly around numbers because you know we don't do that, but you're right to point out the factors. We do have some trade inventory as we point out in the metrics report that built in the second quarter. And as you know, Judy, it all kind of normalizes over the course of the year, and so in the back half, that'll pay itself back, I'm sure. I know you remember we have one fewer shipping day in the third quarter and then we have to work our way through this effect that Billy was just discussing with Chris about the volume declines that are resulting from the cigarette excise tax increase. So those are all the dynamics, but we have not put out a number about third-quarter volume.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, Marty, just kind of looking at some of the recent trends for e-vapor category, it looks like growth has reaccelerated, at least in the measured channel data. And clearly some of that is being driven by MarkTen XL. So just wanted to get a sense of kind of the broader industry momentum that you're seeing how sustainable do you think, just from a category perspective? And then to some extent, if you go back two or three years ago, there was a little bit of a shift of combustible volume into e-vapor, so is that something that you're starting to see or just kind of get a sense of the broader e-vapor category trend.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes. Let me share with you some of the macro data that we have, just to get everybody oriented. In 2016 we estimated that the spend in the category was about $2.5 billion; that was flat to 2015. But we have seen a pick-up both in volume and in dollar sales in 2017. So I don't know, maybe 8% on volume year-over-year. And then there's been some price mix as you know. A lot of that is driven by MarkTen, which has really gotten traction with the consumer and we put out some share numbers on that today. The other phenomenon that's happening in the category as I know you know, is there's poly use.","So adult tobacco consumers do shift between segments of the tobacco category, and I think that what you're seeing as vapor moves up and down, and maybe even MST, is you see people moving among and between those categories. I think those are all factors that go into the growth rate for vapor and then of course, when there's new technologies that are put in the market, we find high trial and that drives some of the growth.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And my last question just on IQOS. Can you give us some update on how much you've discussed with various jurisdictions on sort of the tax structure or any kind of regulatory structures around IQOS and what kind of feedback you've gotten so far?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. We have an engagement plan that we're talking to public policy officials, to state tax officials and others, and I am encouraged that there is, I think a more broad acknowledgement among public policy people these days that harm reduction is the way forward and that tax policy will be an important component of that. It makes good sense to try to encourage people to migrate to products that may hold out less harm.","We are particularly pitching that in the states, but as you know, state excise tax structures are highly complex and idiosyncratic by state, so the reception varies from state to state. But we are out there sharing our views about that and trying as best we can to persuade people to be thoughtful about that.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Patty Kanada - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. This is Patty Kanada on for Bonnie.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Patty. Welcome.","Patty Kanada - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. Just a question on smokeless. Could you give us a little bit more color on where you are in terms of replenishing trade inventory? It seems that there may be some residual supply constraints. And then in terms of the consumer, has there been any pantry loading going on or trade-down or brand switching? And does your guidance assume consumers entirely come back once this issue is fully resolved?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. We have noticed that some people have commented on that, so I'm glad to have a chance to talk about the replenishment. Actually, I think it's going pretty well. If we look at \u2013 I don't know, we went back and looked at some data through June and with a small exception of maybe, I don't know, call it two, three or four SKUs, all of the orders were being completely fulfilled. So that's a pretty quick snap back from a recall and a transition from a two-factory environment to a one-factory environment.","I'd like to take the occasion to congratulate the UST team on such a good job. There was a brief hiatus during the July 4 holiday. Our people have been working very hard in the factory and we gave them an appropriate July 4 holiday. And there was a short period there where a few more SKUs were not available and we had to limit some orders. But on the whole, the vast majority of the SKUs are at full fulfillment, and as you can see from the numbers in the second quarter by the smokeless team, I think they've done a very good job. So our view is that we're pretty much back in business in the smokeless business. We have not seen any pantry loading that I'm aware of.","Patty Kanada - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And just one other question on menthol.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure.","Patty Kanada - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","We have San Francisco's ban possibly going into effect next year and a few other cities looking to similar legislation. What are you seeing on the ground in those places, and where do you think this all goes?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, there's a group of people that are trying to take decisions away from other adults and we oppose that. And we thought that was very bad public policy. You know our position on menthol because we've articulated it extremely thoroughly at the FDA, and as a matter of first instance, if there's going to be anything done on menthol, it ought to be done by the agency that has the expertise to assess whether the science and the evidence supports it. In our view, and the view of many others who weighed in on the FDA, is that there is not. For San Francisco to try to create its own set of rules out there doesn't seem to be good public policy to us, but this happens. Local jurisdictions have views about tobacco issues and while we fight them, they go ahead and reimplement them. Obviously it's a tiny fraction of the volume.","Patty Kanada - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for calling in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Marty. Hi, Billy. Thanks. First question, I guess as we think about some of the comparability headwinds for the third quarter that you mentioned and how to model the back half generally, I wanted to also ask about the pricing outlook because in 2Q you had strong price mix in combustibles, but there was the benefit of earlier timing of the price increase. And you did incur some inventory buildup, which we talked about earlier, that I'm assuming will probably unwind in the second half and result in some higher promotional expense flowing through. So is it fair to directionally expect price mix to moderate a fair amount in the next quarter or in the back half relative to what we saw here in Q2?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, I don't want to talk about forward pricing as you can appreciate, and I think that the dynamics are well understood, Matt, about what we have out there. I tried to articulate them in terms of the inventory, but I'm not going to talk about forward pricing of course.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Understood. And just to follow up on Patty's question on the San Francisco menthol ban.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I know you've sort of been down this road from a legal perspective before with the flavored smokeless...","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","In New York. I mean, given how the bill is written and your experience trying to litigate these types of bans in the past, how optimistic are you that this could potentially be reversed? Or is it kind of a done deal once it's implemented at this point?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, there are other jurisdictions that have implemented it. And my guess, what I would say is that while we continue to think we have strong arguments, it's fair to observe that we have not been able to block them in other jurisdictions. It always depends a bit on state law and other factors, but we'd like to have public policy defer to the experts but they often don't and sometimes the courts are reluctant to interfere with that. So it can be uphill.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And just one last one. Can you give us an update just from a legislative perspective on some of the agricultural bill amendments related to deeming regulations and where those stand at the moment? Just your level of optimism that that could move forward.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I hope so. It's in the ag bill as you know and I thought that the \u2013 we were happy to get it past the committee and that predicate date really needs to be changed. I think there is widespread understanding that the predicate date issue should be changed. It's a very, very complex environment in Washington, to state the obvious, and so we'll have to see where it goes in the budget. But I think that there is a lot of support for that amendment and we continue to work that very, very hard.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you, Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Matt, thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jenny Kaplan with Bloomberg.","Jennifer Kaplan - Bloomberg LP","Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Jennifer Kaplan - Bloomberg LP","Good morning. I'm interested in just hearing \u2013 I know this morning that BAT CEO was talking about how they're planning to apply to the FDA for their glo product. And so I'm wondering how that impacts your plan and how you think about the competitive environment as you work with Philip Morris to introduce IQOS. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Right. Well, thanks for your question. I appreciate you calling in. As you might expect, I've been spending my time this morning thinking about this call, so I didn't have a lot of time to review the BAT material. I did see the headline statement apparently that they're going to pursue an FDA application for glo. Our plans assume the following which is, because the application is in by PMI in the United States and we're working that we expect to have first mover advantage. But our plans also assume in our category that we will have competition, so I think both scenarios are covered.","Jennifer Kaplan - Bloomberg LP","Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for your question.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi. Thanks for the follow ups.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Welcome back.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks. On IQOS and the dialog that you're engaging with at the state level, if my understanding is correct, the consumables will be subject to the MSA, subject to the FET and selectively subject to state excise taxes. Can you give us a sense of what proportion of states or U.S. volumes would, in theory, tax IQOS as a cigarette absent any change in the statute? Thanks.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Most of them.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","Got it. Thanks. And then my other question is on minimum age increases. I know California is probably a little bit hard to read because of the overlap with the state excise tax. And while Hawaii is small, it's really our only kind of clear example. And given that there looks to be some movement in New Jersey and possibly Oregon on that front, is there anything that you can offer in terms of your insights around how raising the minimum purchase age in Hawaii impacted the market? Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","It's too small, and it's so idiosyncratic because it's an island that it's just hard to extrapolate from it. I think we had said previously when we studied California that we had not seen any significant effects there and obviously we'll be monitoring New Jersey very carefully.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","Terrific.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Neese","Thank you, Jackie. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I\u2019m joined this morning by Marty Barrington, Altria\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Howard Willard, Altria\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, we\u2019ll only be discussing Altria\u2019s 2013 business results for the second quarter and first six months, and will not be discussing the status of tobacco litigation. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward looking and cautionary statements section at the end of our earnings release for the review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. For a detailed review of Altria\u2019s business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website at altria.com.","Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Today\u2019s call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in today\u2019s earnings release, and are available on our website. In addition, comparisons discussed in this conference call are to the same prior-year period, unless otherwise stated.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Barrington","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Altria delivered solid financial results for the second quarter and for six months of 2013. The Company\u2019s diverse business model delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 5.1% for the second quarter and 7.4% for the first half of the year. All three of our reportable segments delivered adjusted operating companies income and margin growth in the second quarter and first half. This growth was complemented by lower interest and other debt expense and fewer shares outstanding for both periods.","Lower earnings from Altria\u2019s equity investment and SABMiller negatively impacted Altria\u2019s second quarter adjusted diluted EPS, while on a first half basis higher earnings from the investment had a positive impact.","In the smokeable product segment, higher pricing drove adjusted operating companies income growth for both the second quarter and first half. Marlboro continue to perform well. Its retail share was unchanged for the second quarter and up one-tenth of a share point for the first half versus its strong retail share performance last year. PM USA continues to support Marlboro\u2019s brand architecture with brands building initiatives. In July, 2013 PM USA expanded distribution of Marlboro NXT to an additional 23 states, primarily in the eastern U.S.","PM USA gain retail share for the second quarter behind share gains for L&M in discount. For the first half PM USA grew retail share due to gains from both L&M and Marlboro. Comparisons of reported cigarette shipment volume for the second quarter and first half were impacted by trade inventory changes.","After adjusting for changes in trade inventories PM USA estimates that its second quarter 2013 domestic cigarette shipment volume was down approximately 3.5% and that total cigarette category volume was down approximately 4% for the same period. After adjusting for one less shipping day and trade inventory changes, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately 4% for the first half in line with the estimated decline rate for the cigarette category.","Black & Mild's retail share of machine made large cigars was down for the second quarter and first half versus the prior periods due to competitive activity. On a sequential basis though, the brands 2013 second quarter retail share was up 1.4 share points versus the first quarter of 2013.","In the smokeless segment, higher volume and higher pricing drove strong adjusted operating companies income and margin growth for the second quarter and first half. USSTC increased volume and retail share for Copenhagen and Skoal on a combined basis for both reporting periods.","In wine, Ste. Michelle delivered strong operating companies income and margin growth through higher shipment volume. Altria\u2019s companies continue to deliver growth in their core businesses, while continuing to innovate with new products for adult tobacco consumers.","As we\u2019ve announced, Nu Mark will enter the eBay for category by introducing MarkTen e-cigarettes into a lead market in Indiana next month. Nu Mark is also expanding distribution of Verve discs to approximately 1,200 stores in Virginia, in September of this year.","Richmark, a joint venture between an Altria subsidiary and Okono has introduced Tju Chewing Tobacco Gum into a test market in Denmark. We\u2019re pleased Altria\u2019s results for the first half of the year. Based on that performance and our expectations for the second half of the year, we\u2019re revising our guidance for Altria\u2019s 2013 full-year adjusted diluted EPS from a range of $2.35 to $2.41, to a range of $2.36 to $2.41. This represents a growth rate between 7% and 9% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.21 in 2012.","I\u2019ll now turn things over to Howard, who will discuss Altria\u2019s business results in more detail.","Howard A. Willard","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. In the smokeable products segment, second quarter and first half reported operating companies income grew by 5.2% and 18.4% respectively, primarily due to PM USA\u2019s settlement with certain states of the NPM Adjustment Disputes for 2003 to 2012. Higher pricing and lower selling, general and administrative expenses partially offset by lower reported shipment volume.","Excluding special items identified in our earnings press release, adjusted operating companies income for the smokeable products segment increased by 1.5% to $1.7 billion for the second quarter, an increase by 1.4% to $3.1 billion for the first half. Adjusted operating companies income margin grew 1.6 percentage points to 43.0% for the second quarter and 1.3 percentage points to 42.5% for the first half.","PM USA\u2019s reported cigarette shipments declined 6.7% for the second quarter, primarily due to the industry's rate of decline and changes in trade inventories, partially offset by retail share gains. PM USA believes that the trade built more inventory during the second quarter of 2012 which negatively impacted the comparisons of PM USA's second quarter 2013 reported domestic cigarette shipment volume.","Reported cigarette shipments declined 6% for the first six months of 2013, primarily due to the same factors that impacted the second quarter and one less shipping day. PM USA increased its retail share by three-tenths of a share point to 50.7% for the second quarter and by four-tenths of a share point to 50.6% for the first half of 2013.","Marlboro's retail share for the second quarter was unchanged at 43.7% and grew one-tenth of a share point to 43.6% for the first half. PM USA's discount share was 3.9% for both periods as share gains for L&M contributed to share gains of five-tenths of a share point for both the second quarter and the first half. These share gains were partially offset by share losses on other portfolio brands in both periods.","Cigar shipment volume decreased 8.0% for the second quarter and 12.4% for the first half, primarily due to changes in wholesale inventories and retail share losses. Black & Mild's retail share decreased five-tenths of a share point for the second quarter and 1.8 share points for the first half.","Turning to the smokeless products segment, second quarter 2013 reported and adjusted operating companies income increased 12.5% to $270 million versus the prior-year period, driven by higher volume and pricing and lower selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher promotional investments and unfavorable mix due to growth in products introduced in recent years at a lower popular price.","Reported operating companies income increased 13.9% to $492 million for the first half primarily due to the same factors I just mentioned and restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2012 related to the cost reduction program. When adjusted for special items related to restructuring charges, operating companies income increased 9.1% to $492 million for the first half of 2013.","Reported smokeless product shipment volume increased 4.6% for the second quarter and 4% for the first half. Volume growth for Copenhagen and Skoal was partially offset by volume declines for other portfolio brands. Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined shipment volume by 5.8% for the second quarter and 5.4% for the first half of 2013.","Copenhagen's volume grew 8.8% for the second quarter and the first half as the brand continued to benefit from products introduced in recent years. Skoal's volume increased 1.8% for the second quarter and 0.8% for the first half.","USSTC and PM USA estimate that the smokeless products category grew by approximately 5% over the 12 months ending June 30, 2013. Adjusted smokeless products volume is difficult to estimate on a quarterly basis. When adjusted for changes in trade inventories and year-over-year calendar differences, USSTC and PM USA estimate that their combined 2013 first half adjusted smokeless product shipment volume grew at a rate similar to the 12-month category growth rate.","Copenhagen and Skoal delivered combined retail share growth of six-tenths of a share point for the second quarter and first half of 2013. Copenhagen grew its retail share by 1.6 share points for the second quarter and 1.5 share points for the first half. Skoal's retail share declined one share point for the second quarter and nine-tenths of a share point for the first half, primarily due to competitive activity and Copenhagen's strong performance.","USSTC and PM USA's retail share of the smokeless products category was unchanged at 55% for the second quarter, as retail share gains by Copenhagen were offset by losses for Skoal and other portfolio brands. For the first half, USSTC and PM USA's retail share decreased two-tenths of a share point to 55%, as retail share losses for Skoal and other portfolio brands were mostly offset by Copenhagen gains.","Ste. Michelle's 2013 operating companies income increased 13.6% to $25 million for the second quarter and increased 21.6% to $45 million for the first half of 2013. These results were primarily driven by higher shipment volume. Ste. Michelle also expanded its operating companies income margins by 1 percentage point to 18.9% for the second quarter and by 1.9 percentage points to 17.8% for the first half.","Ste. Michelle's shipment volume increased 7.7% for the second quarter and 8.6% for the first half. In May 2013 Altria issued $1 billion of new senior unsecured notes comprised of $350 million of 2.95% notes that mature in 2023 and $650 million of 4.5% notes that mature in 2043. During the second quarter, Altria paid $833 million in dividends and purchased shares values at $135 million.","Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. As a reminder, the tobacco product pricing and retail share figures are from the tracking services we introduced in the first quarter of 2013. We'll also provide you with restated figures from the second quarter of 2012, so you'll be able to compare the periods.","Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 34% in the second quarter of 2013 and 35% in the second quarter of 2012. Marlboro's net pack price in the second quarter of 2013 was $5.78 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.30. For the second quarter of 2012, Marlboro's net pack price was $5.70 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.22.","The cigarette discount categories retail share was 25.2% for the second quarter of 2013, up one-tenth of a share point versus the second quarter of 2012. The estimated weighted averaged cigarette state excise tax as of July 1, 2013 was $1.45 per pack, an increase of $0.04 per pack versus the second quarter of 2012. This includes the $1.60 per pack tax increase that took effect on July 1st in Minnesota.","For the second quarter of 2013, Copenhagen's retail price was $4.04 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 36%. For the second quarter of 2012, Copenhagen's retail price was $4.03 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 41%.","CapEx was $26 million for the second quarter and $41 million for the first half of 2013. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $52 million for the second quarter. We estimate that 2013 full year ongoing depreciation and amortization will be approximately $215 million.","Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Investors, analysts and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi. Please go ahead.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington","Good morning.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","To start, my first question has to do with the Menthol report that the FDA said that it's the OMB this morning, I'm sure you guys haven't had a chance to go through it neither have we, but I was hoping you could just remind us from a procedural standpoint where do we go from here and what the timing of that would look like?","Martin J. Barrington","You're right, Vivien. I heard about the headline when I walked into the room and was focused on the call, so I haven't looked at any of this. So I don\u2019t want to comment on it because I haven't seen it. But you\u2019re right from a process view point what the FDA has said so far all along was that it was reviewing the science. It took the TPSAC report; it conducted its own scientific review. It's our understanding they sent that out for peer review that they got peer review back and then they've been working on the scientific assessment. So subject to what's happened this morning that\u2019s our understanding of the process. And of course FDA being an agency that\u2019s driven by science and the evidence, we would expect for the process then to discuss FDA scientific views before any policy implications or the like would be discussed. We\u2019ll have to see what issued this morning.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Fair enough. In terms of the cigarette business was there a benefit to your shipments from the extended distribution of NXT or is that going to hit in the third quarter?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, we launched NXT really in July, so it will be mostly in the third quarter I think.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Fair enough. And do you have an estimate for whether the e-cigarette category had any impact on traditional cigarette industry going this quarter and next so, by what magnitude?","Martin J. Barrington","Yeah, no I really don\u2019t \u2013 I know everyone is acutely interested in this. I continue to believe what I\u2019ve said previously on this which is, it's having some effect obviously because people who were trying eBay for products are adult smokers, so you would expect for there to be some effect. We just can\u2019t tease out what it is off of the small base, and actually I think the question to be focused on is as much, what is the size of that category today as what might it be down the road and that\u2019s obviously a part of the motivation for us to make sure that we\u2019ve got competitive products and why we\u2019re so excited about our mark and launch in Indiana.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That\u2019s fair enough. And do you have an estimate for what the size of the category might be down the road?","Martin J. Barrington","No, we worked out various scenarios. It all depends which put in your model and it depends what your assumptions are. As we\u2019ve discussed previously there is a lot that\u2019s yet to be resolved regarding e-cigarettes. We currently don\u2019t have a regulatory structure for them and depending on what that regulatory structure looks like it could have an impact on the size of the category. We don\u2019t know yet about excise taxes for example. We\u2019re probably on the early part of the technology curve with the product itself. So all of those factors Vivien I think are the way that we\u2019re looking at it and you can run various models with various assumptions, and that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re looking at it to make sure that we\u2019ve got all of them covered.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Terrific. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington","Thanks for calling in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Good morning, everyone.","Martin J. Barrington","Good morning, David.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Marty, just as a follow-up to that, if you have three buckets of uncertainty regarding the trajectory of the e-cigarette category being regulation, excise taxes, and then the capacity to improve the product to meet current smokers needs. Realistically would you agree that it's probably that third item that will have the biggest long-term impact on whether e-cigarettes are sort of a small or somewhat larger segment over time?","Martin J. Barrington","I sure think that consumer acceptance of the product is central. The other factors -- and there are other factors beyond what I mentioned, but you\u2019re right David you have to have a product that adult consumers find acceptable and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay, on a different topic, Marty given the gap between your shipments this quarter and where you think on an underlying basis both your performance in the category was the negative 3.5, negative 4. What's your confidence in that forecast, in that assessment?","Martin J. Barrington","Yeah, we\u2019re pretty confident in our assessment, I would say. When you look at the inventory changes from Q2, '12 to Q2, '13 I mean they\u2019re pretty apparent, as I know you remember the trade bill inventory in the quarter last year versus this quarter where it was built and then really shared, some of that\u2019s probably driven by the timing. You may remember the price announcements came at different times relative to those quarters. So when we do the math and we look at the inventories that we\u2019re able track we\u2019re pretty confident that it explains the difference between reported and adjusted.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay and that would be consistent with your cigarette shipments in July of this year being fairly strong, correct, because you would have entered the quarter with lower trade inventories than last year?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, as you know we don\u2019t talk about the quarter until the quarter is over, so I won't say anything about the third quarter. But I do think it's fair to point out as people are thinking about this which is, if the adjustments are as we believe them to be. Remember there\u2019s one more shipping day in the third quarter and inventories really were pretty lean at the end of the second quarter. Those were all factors I think to take into account.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then Marty, just fair to say that sort of collectively the competitive dynamic has allowed for better pricing in the cigarette category essentially because of the weaker volumes that the competitive dynamics resulted in a business algorithm that still allowed for profit growth despite the weak volumes because in affect there was a collective effort to solve for weak volumes?","Martin J. Barrington","I might describe that just a little bit differently. I think the category is competitive, it's been competitive, it\u2019s likely to be competitive. Our strategy is to maximize income as you know, and so we stay focused on that in this segment. And when we look at our revenue\/1000 for example net of FET we\u2019ve got nice numbers there. So that\u2019s how we look at it, which is we\u2019re trying to maximize income while making sure that we\u2019ve got modest share momentum on Marlboro.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington","Thanks a lot for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Martin J. Barrington","Good morning, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","I guess, I just wanted to go through the brand performance on the cigarette side, so Marlboro kind of flat year-over-year up a little bit in the six months of the year, and then you actually had a pretty good gain from L&M. So maybe just give us your perspective on the Marlboro\u2019s performance maybe not just in the quarter, but just kind of a year-to-date, how do you think the brand is performing relative to kind of your spending level? And then from an L&M perspective, can you just talk about where the share gains are coming from and as though you think about the strategy with L&M, would we continue to see a pretty strong gain from L&M going forward?","Martin J. Barrington","Sure, let me take those in turn. We\u2019re really happy with Marlboro. I think Marlboro is doing terrific. The investments that we\u2019ve made in the Marlboro architecture, the products that we\u2019ve been able to bring, our work at retail to get everything reset, the work that we\u2019ve done on marlboro.com, our interactions with our adjust consumer franchise. Remember we tend to sometimes go pass this, but it's worth everyone remembering of course Marlboro remains with more shares than the next 10 brands combined. It's got premium pricing. It's got the highest brand equity. It's the largest brand in every state and so on and so on and so Marlboro continues to perform fine. As I just discussed with David as you know, in terms of its share we try to have modest share momentum on Marlboro. That\u2019s one of the measures we use to make sure that its brand strength remains where we want it to be because it's largely the engine of our profit growth. L&M\u2019s role is different of course; it plays a role in the discount segment. The discount segment as Howard just reported to you is relatively flat, but especially for some of our trade partners who like for us to have an entry in that segment; L&M is a terrific choice. We gather share from various players that are participating in that segment, but our focus is on premium and in particular it's on Marlboro, but L&M has a role to play in the portfolio about what you\u2019ve seen for the quarter, I think it's fair to say.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Okay. And then just in terms of the competitive environment going forward, just curious with Newport Gold being launched in the back half; do you see that as a risk in terms of the competitive environment heating up, and then just in terms of thinking about broadly speaking, the new product pipeline for your products obviously and how much of that is still kind of dependent upon the FDA coming up with just potential equivalents, applications and any lessons that you\u2019ve learned on the heels of them approving a couple and then also rejecting several?","Martin J. Barrington","Okay, let me see if I can unpack that a little bit. Our planning as you might expect at PM USA and other operating companies takes into account most, all competitive scenarios including the one on Newport Gold that you\u2019ve just described. So, we have plans for that and all of that is rolled up into our guidance. So, I think that we have good plans; we have a strong franchise there. PM USA will do what it needs to do I\u2019m sure and do it well. In terms of new product pipeline, we\u2019ve discussed this previously I think with others about how we were pretty planful about having products as the new regulatory system came online and we continue to have a pretty good pipeline. We had also pointed out that we have expected FDA once it had built out its infrastructure, once it had hired its staff and once it had worked through the protocols on substantial equivalents, we had fully expected that it would start to rule on application and indeed that's what we see happening and that's a good thing, frankly. Some people were predicting that the FDA would never approve another tobacco product or certainly not in the cigarette category and we were urging people to be mindful that the statute contemplates innovation in the category, it's just a process you have to go through and FDA is a part of that process. So, I think that's on balance, a good thing that FDA now has the infrastructure up and working. They're working through applications. To be sure, there's a lot to do. I think the latest estimate I saw and you may have seen it is in terms of provisional applications those that are already in the market, there's more than 3,000 of those and then there maybe another 500, I think, FDA said with respect to new products. So they've got some work to do. For our part, we continue to work with them. We talk to them every day about substantial equivalents and other matters and we try to do that professionally and constructively and so far so good.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Okay. And then lastly, Howard, SABMiller equity income was down pretty significantly in the quarter. If there's anything you can help us just kind of think about why it was down so much? And then I guess in terms of your guidance, is it still \u2013 I guess it is a driver of how the rest of the year kind of play out. So any help on how we should think about the back half in terms of the equity income?","Howard A. Willard","Sure. Well certainly our guidance reflects what we expect to occur for all of our businesses plus our contribution from SABMiller. SABMiller's contribution to our earnings was often in the first half but you're correct that it was down in the second half on an adjusted basis. I would point out I think that there are a number of adjustments that we make to their financial results both to convert from IFRS to GAAP and some other things. So probably the best way to understand their underlying earnings is to listen in on their trading statement update which will come later this week. But I do think for the rest of the year, we expect SABMiller to be a contributor to our earnings growth.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Got it, thank you.","Martin J. Barrington","Thanks for calling, Judy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to follow-up on David's question for the volume adjustments that you laid out because of the inventory movement. If I recall correctly, I think last year same quarter you talked about a 1.5% tailwind. The adjustment you talk about today seems to be much bigger than that. Is there additional volume or inventory reductions by wholesalers on top of just offsetting what they did last year?","Martin J. Barrington","I guess I'm not sure how to explain it other than I explained it a moment ago which is it's just the comparison, I think, between the build in the second quarter last year and then the build in the share in the second quarter this year when we looked at the numbers relative to what's in wholesale and our estimate at retail which seems to us that that's the explanation.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then smokeable revenue has been down for two quarters in a row now and the comps in the second half of the year are getting a little bit more challenging, but what's the outlook for the segment? Do you expect growth for the full year?","Martin J. Barrington","Well you know our strategy which is we're trying to grow income in the smokeable segment. We do that obviously through the operating plans of PM USA and if you look at it over time, I prefer back to some of the charts we showed perhaps at the Investor's Day meeting in June that the smokeable segment has really had pretty nice growth there over time and that's how we look at it, Thilo. We look at it over time. In some quarters, it's up a bit more and others in down and in others it's someplace else. But over time that's our strategy and I must say it seems to have worked relatively well and that's the strategy that we're pursuing.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then last question I had for you. If I recall correctly I think you had described the strategy for L&M in the past as do you want to offset the share losses that you have had was basic over the last few years. When I look at the share data for your discount portfolio, it looks like those basic losses are offset by now. What's the plan going forward for L&M?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, I think the plan is what I described a moment ago which is it's got a role to play in our portfolio in the discount segment. And so you're right. We have described how it gathered up some share, the basic share as we made that brand more profitable. It's also gathered up some competitive share as you might expect for a great brand in that segment, but that's it role and our focus again remains on the premium end of the business. We're trying to make sure that Marlboro and other premium brands do great all the while making sure L&M is effectively executing the role it has in its place in the portfolio and I don't think that's going to change going forward.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington","Thanks for asking.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hi. I just wanted to ask maybe another question on L&M. Just trying to understand if you see any cannibalization between L&M or your discount portfolio and non-premium level line extensions? And then I'd also like to hear how you're balancing the growth of your discount segment with margin expansion, how will you do that going forward?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, we're mindful of executing against the entire portfolio strategy of course as we are very, very mindful of Marlboro and our other premium brands we watched to make sure that L&M is playing the appropriate role, but we're not trying to grow the discount segment. Our focus is on premium. So that's always a balance on how we manage our brands as anybody does in their portfolio and that's how we think about it. We're a premium company. We sell premium brands. We get higher margin because of doing that. That's our strategy and that's what we'll continue to do.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, that helps. And then, Marty, I would like to drill down a little further on something there, Marlboro line extensions. I'm hearing Southern Cut is performing well, so I'd like to hear more color from you on this? And then a question on Marlboro NXT expansion; as you role this out to more states, are you able to secure incremental shelf space or is this displacing existing shelf space for other Marlboro brands or possibly something else in your portfolio?","Martin J. Barrington","Okay, let me take those in turn. We're happy with Marlboro Southern Cut. It's a terrific product. It's got \u2013 and a terrific pack. It's been well received and I think it's been a great addition to the Marlboro family. The same thing with Marlboro NXT. You remember we launched that in two of our sales regions last year. It looks great. It's a terrific product. It's got a nice innovation on it with a capsule. It's been very well received. It's a nice addition to the Marlboro Black family. And this space, the share issue has always worked out by the trade programs and our trade programs take all of that into account as we work through the available space. But we haven't had, really I wouldn't think any difficulty in getting space for Marlboro NXT.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. And then just my final questions on e-cigs and MarkTen. Given that tremendous success and the continued robust growth of the e-cig category, how concerned are you that you don't have a greater presence with your MarkTen e-cig yet? I guess meaning have you missed an opportunity or do you feel you can essentially play catch-up?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, I think the answer to that is, it's early days in the eBay per category and I think that MarkTen is a terrific product, it's a great brand. We've got a crackerjack sales force that will get us distribution where we need it. We'll learn. I think when we discussed this previously, that's how we think about innovation generally in e-cigarettes in particular which is \u2013 it's very exciting when these new products come along and they get a lot of attention. Our strategy is to maximize our core business while we take appropriate steps forward with innovation and that's a balance as well, but we have a big profitable mature business that does great. We have tremendous brands and so in the eBay per category, we want to learn our way in. I have no doubt that if we can get that product in the hands of consumers and get distribution and work the brand the way we've done over decades that we'll ultimately be very successful. I think this is a long game.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Right and you can leverage your existing sales force, as you mentioned, and you're willing to role this out quickly if your tests performs well. Is that fair?","Martin J. Barrington","We'll take the appropriate steps once we learn our way in. Certainly if it's well received, we always want to expand products that are well received by the consumer. And then as we discussed a moment ago as I'm sure you heard, there's some other reasons to be in which is \u2013 there's issues to be sorted through regulation and excise taxes in the like and we want to be at the table as they\u2019re being sorted out.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks so much.","Martin J. Barrington","Thanks, Bonnie.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Hey, good morning.","Martin J. Barrington","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi. I just had a couple of follow-up questions for you please. The first must be that I know you don\u2019t like to give quarterly guidance, but would you expect the profit growth in your smokeable division to be up at a rate faster than the first half growth? I guess, what I\u2019m coming down to is, you\u2019ve had very good per pack growth in the first half. You\u2019ve had roughly soft kind of absolute dollar profit growth in the first half however.","Martin J. Barrington","Well, you\u2019re right. We don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, and we\u2019re not about to start this morning. I just had this conversation a moment ago about our strategy, which is to maximize income and we do that over time and you\u2019re point out at the comparisons for this quarter or the quarter previous were a bit lower on that metric than they have been over the last several years. I think we showed during the Investor Day, again the history over time of how the income growth has been nice in smokeable. That continues to be our strategy. We\u2019ve just given a revised guidance stock. Then all that is taken into account in our revised guidance.","Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Fair enough. Just two quick ones, and the first one with the likelihood of an FET it looks relatively small today. I guess, at least that \u2013 there will be a higher risk factor going forward given what\u2019s proposed at least, do you have any comments on an FET, the likelihood and how you see that going forward?","Martin J. Barrington","Well we\u2019re opposed to it and there has been talk about its relative movement or lack thereof. We\u2019ve spoken previously, Gee-whiz; we just took an FET increase of a 158% or something in 2009. We saw what happened to the volumes and what happened to the trade. These are programs that are supposed to be for the benefit of everyone, but they\u2019re proposed to be financed on the back of tobacco consumers and we just think that\u2019s fundamentally unfair to say nothing of how regressive these taxes are. So, we\u2019re being very mindful of that. We advocate strongly on behalf of our companies and our consumers on that. You\u2019d hope that there is not much traction on it, if it doesn\u2019t appear to be today, but we\u2019re very careful about that.","Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And my final question is, in relation to your capacity for MarkTen and for e-cigarettes. Are you in the process still of building capacity that will make that product? I\u2019m just thinking ahead to say a national launch, is there still some period of time that you need to build capacity to be able to handle a larger launch across the country?","Martin J. Barrington","Yeah. You forgive me for saying some of that\u2019s proprietary, so I\u2019m not going to talk about much of that. We certainly have capacity to execute what we intend to execute in Indiana and to do it well.","Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington","Thanks for asking.","Operator","We now welcome questions from media representatives on the call. (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Yes. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington","Good morning.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Quick question for you on the balance sheet. You mentioned tapping the debt capital markets this past quarter and you have another $1.4 billion debt maturing in November. Can you tell us if the issuance from this past quarter was the partially refinance that or should we expect to see you either back in the market or look to issue commercial paper to take out this November maturity?","Howard A. Willard","I\u2019m not going to comment on our future debt plans. But I think you did point out that, I alluded to the $1 billion issuance in the second quarter. I think that gives us a fair amount of flexibility with regard to what actions we take for the $1.5 billion due later this year and then we\u2019ve got about \u2013 we\u2019ve had about $2 billion due between now and the end of the first quarter. And I think when we determine exactly what we were going to do there; we\u2019ll announce it at the time.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. And I guess, just a follow-up question to that. You still have a fair bit of very high coupon debt related to I think the UST acquisition in 2009. Do you continue to look at that as to see if that\u2019s something you might want to address or you just planning to reduce your interest expense over time?","Howard A. Willard","Well, I think certainly our goal is to work to reduce our interest expense over time, which we\u2019ve been successful in doing. As you know we did tender for some of our high interest debt once before and I think we continue to look at all options, but we\u2019ve made a definitive decision with regard to what we\u2019re going to do going forward.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Burritt with Bloomberg News.","Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News","Okay. Good morning. Thank you for your time. Marty, I was going to ask you, if you could talk about your marketing plans for MarkTen. Can you help explain how you plan to balance selling the product with responsibilities that come with nicotine in a product that\u2019s not regulated that sort of thing, I mean, how hard will you push your new \u2013 your e-cig in this lead market and what constraints will you take?","Martin J. Barrington","Thank you. That\u2019s an excellent question. We\u2019re working through all those details now. Let me take it in two parts perhaps. The first is you\u2019re right, because for products that contain nicotine, you have to be responsible that how you do that. We thought deeply about that, including putting an appropriate warning on that product, which it will bear, despite the fact that it\u2019s not currently regulated by FDA. The marketing mix is another matter altogether our target audiences, adult smokers and adult vapors and we want to get good reach to them. We want them to know about the product. We want to have good awareness to them, But we\u2019ll also take steps to make sure that we\u2019re not having unintended reach to audiences, we\u2019re not trying to reach and that\u2019s always a balance about how you do that. We are working through those marketing details now and I think when you see the execution, you will see that we\u2019ve been quite comfortable with that.","Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News","Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington","Thank you. Good question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Milway with BlackRock.","Timothy Milway - BlackRock, Inc.","Hi. Do you have any sense when the arbitration panel might release their decision regarding diligent enforcement?","Martin J. Barrington","Any day. That\u2019s we were told.

Question on the wine business, I\u2019m wondering, just back from travels abroad and Chateau Ste. Michelle and others of your brands have been gaining a presence in Asia. And I\u2019m wondering just to what extent the division is prepared to invest behind that, what they see as a future there for the returns of the capital?","Howard A. Willard","Sure. Tom, I think your observation is accurate, which is we\u2019ve had greater volume of our key brands sold in Asia given the \u2013 given kind of the affordable premium positioning of our brands, I think they\u2019re well positioned for the Asian market and that has been an initiative that the wine company is focused on certainly over the last couple of years.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's management and question-and-answer session. Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.","William Marshall - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We're here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria's CEO; and Billy Gifford, Altria's CFO, to discuss Altria's 2018 first quarter business results. Earlier today we issued a press release providing these results which is available on our website at altria.com and through the Altria Investor app.","During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2017. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors.","Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results excludes special items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. We're off to a fast start to the strong year of EPS growth to which we've guided with adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 30.1% in the first quarter. Altria's leading tobacco businesses, diverse income streams and strong balance sheet provide us with numerous levers to deliver strong performance over the long term. For example, in the first quarter we benefited, from a lower tax rate as a result of Federal income tax reform something for which we long advocated.","We also reported higher equity earnings from our investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev and higher adjusted operating company's income in the Smokeless product segment. We paid shareholders nearly $1.3 billion in dividends in the first quarter, announced an out-of-cycle quarterly dividend increase of 6.1%, and repurchased $513 million in shares. We also continued our progress toward our aspiration of U.S. leadership in authorized, non-combustible, reduced-risk products.","As we've previously discussed we are reinvesting about a third of our tax reform benefit into strategic areas for long-term growth. These include innovative product development and launches including IQOS, regulatory science, equity enhancements to our brands, retail fixtures and future retail concepts. The timing of these investments will vary by operating segment and some may be impacted by external factors, such as the timing of an IQOS market order from the FDA. As a result, we once again encourage investors to focus on full year performance against our strategies, rather than a quarter-by-quarter segment result, which may be noisier than usual.","We also continue to invest in our employees. In the first quarter, we were pleased to share with our employees a portion of our tax reform benefit to recognize their ongoing contributions to our success. These one-time bonuses totaled about $22 million, or $3,000 per nonexecutive fulltime employee and that expense flowed through our operating company's first quarter financials.","So with that overview, let's discuss the operating segment results. In the smokeable product segment, our strategy is to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro and Black & Mild. This year we're investing behind product expansions, packaging innovations and brand equity to stabilize Marlboro's share and expand our company's overall share in the growing menthol and super-premium segments. For example, in the first quarter, PM USA expanded Marlboro Ice nationally.","Marlboro Ice offers a unique, crisp and cool-to-the-finish experience which appeals to competitive adult menthol smokers. Its innovative reseal pack is the first of its kind in the U.S. further differentiating the brand. After only eight weeks, Marlboro Ice is being sold in about 130,000 retail stores and has very high reorder rates. Marlboro Ice is supported with prominent point-of-sale materials and retail intercepts with competitive adult menthol smokers to further promote awareness and trial. We're encouraged by its performance thus far which is meeting our expectations and helping to stabilize Marlboro share.","Another equity investment is a new Marlboro rewards program in Texas called Points West. Through this program, adult smokers, 21 plus, earn points by scanning unique codes printed inside their Marlboro packs, which can then be redeemed for gear, coupons and charitable donations. After just 10 weeks in market, over 100,000 adult smokers have engaged with Points West, which is generating news and excitement for the brand among adult smokers, increasing adult smoker digital reach and engagement and growing brand loyalty. It's also worth highlighting that the engineering that enables these unique codes to be printed at PM USA scale and manufacturing speed is a major innovation. As a result of these and other efforts, Marlboro retail share grew a 0.1 share point sequentially to 43.2% versus the fourth quarter 2017 share.","In the super-premium tobacco and water segment, Nat's continues to perform very well in Colorado. Nat Sherman is building awareness and trial of Nat's among adult smokers and we're pleased with its market share performance. Nat's is sourcing competitive share in the segment and adult smokers are responding positively to the product, its advertising campaign and the packaging. Based on these strong results in June, Nat Sherman will expand Nat's into 13 additional states across the western U.S.","In the smokeless products segment, USSTC delivered strong adjusted OCI growth of 27.3% in the first quarter as it lapped the 2017 voluntary product recall and grew pricing.","Total smokeless segment retail share grew 0.1 share point, led by Copenhagen, which grew 1.1 share points in the quarter to 34.3%. USSTC also expanded Copenhagen Southern Blend into 13 states across the western U.S. in the first quarter.","Skoal retail share declined 1.2 share points in the quarter to 16.2% as USSTC focuses on growing its profitability, while investing behind blends and snus for adult smokers seeking non-combustible alternatives. The company expanded Skoal spearmint tobacco blend pouches in the first quarter and plans to update packaging on Skoal Snus in the second quarter to broaden its appeal among adult smokers and dual users.","In pursuit of Altria's innovative aspiration, we're investing behind the three most promising non-combustible product platforms with the potential to reduce harm: smokeless tobacco and oral nicotine products, e-vapor and heated tobacco. USSTC is already the largest most profitable non-combustible business in the world, and the company is pursuing FDA authorization to market products with reduced risk claims. And in March, the company took an important step in that regard by submitting a modified risk tobacco product application for Copenhagen Snuff, and we're looking forward to engaging with the FDA on our application.","In e-vapor, Nu Mark grew volume by approximately 30% in the quarter, driven by expanded distribution and benefiting from category growth. Nu Mark also expanded MarkTen Elite, a pod-based closed system product, to over 6,000 stores in the first quarter.","In heated tobacco, PM USA continues to await the completion of FDA's review of PMI's IQOS PMTA application. PM USA's initial lead market plans are ready, and we'll announce its location upon FDA authorization. At that point, PM USA will begin to build product inventory while activating its marketing plan. It will use a range of tools to build adult smoker awareness, intrigue and demand in the lead market, while also preparing for additional lead markets.","Let's touch briefly on FDA news. The first quarter was an active one for the agency, which published three advanced notices of proposed rulemaking, including one on a proposed nicotine standard for combustible cigarettes. Earlier this month the agency announced a policy change regarding its treatment of substantial equivalence applications for provisional products. And you'll recall that we've been expecting these actions since last July when the FDA announced its new regulatory framework. As we've said before, these are complex and nuanced issues and any potential product standard will undergo a rigorous, multiyear science and evidence-based process. We're preparing our submissions on each of the ANPRMNs and we'll actively engage throughout this process.","So once again, we're off to a good start. Thus, we're reaffirming our guidance to deliver full-year 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.90 to $4.03 per share from a 2017 adjusted diluted EPS base of $3.39. This range represents a growth rate of 15% to 19% from 2017.","With that, I'll turn it over to Billy to provide more detail.","William F. Gifford, Jr. - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Marty, and good morning everyone. Let's start with a deeper look at the Smokeable Products segment. Smokeable segment adjusted OCI decreased 2% in the quarter, primarily driven by cigarette volume declines, strategic business investments and higher resolution expenses, partially offset by higher pricing. Smokeable adjusted OCI margins declined 1.2 percentage points to 49.7%.","We estimate that the cigarette industry volume declined about 5.5% in the first quarter. There are a number of factors at play here, most notably the impact of the California state excise tax increase, which went into effect in April of last year. We believe the effects of the California SCT were further amplified this quarter due to pantry loading that inflated volume in the year-ago period. We also continued to see adult tobacco consumers moving between tobacco categories as evidenced by e-vapor category growth and while we continue to be net positive about the strength of the adult tobacco consumer, recent gas price increases could be impacting purchase decisions in the short term. We continue to closely monitor these and other factors and have good plans in place for all volume scenarios.","Our Smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volume declined 4.2% primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline and retail share declines partially offset by trade inventory movements. When adjusted for trade inventory movements, Smokeable segment cigarette volume declined an estimated 7%. The cigar business continues to perform well, growing reported shipment volume 3% in the quarter. In the smokeless product segment, USSTC grew adjusted OCI 27.3% in the first quarter, as it lapped the 2017 voluntary recall and grew pricing. Adjusted OCI margins expanded 7.8 percentage points to 69%. Smokeless industry volume declined an estimated 1% over the past six months, while USSTC's reported domestic shipment volume was essentially flat in the first quarter.","We urge caution when comparing year-over-year volume estimates for the smokeless segment. First quarter 2017 volume was particularly noisy. As the voluntary product recall involved removing significant volume from the marketplace and then replenishing that volume with fresh product.","Turning to our alcohol assets. After a challenging 2017, Ste. Michelle grew volume and revenue in the quarter with wine shipment volume up 6.1%. While adjusted OCI declined $4 million, substantially all of that was due to the one-time employee bonuses Marty discussed. In beer, adjusted equity earnings from our Anheuser-Busch InBev investment were $225 million in the first quarter, reflecting Altria's share of AB InBev's fourth quarter results.","And of course, we continue to reward shareholders by returning significant cash to them through dividends and share repurchases. In March, we raised our dividend 6.1% to reflect final 2017 results and we expect to maintain our dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS. We repurchased eight million shares in the first quarter at an average share price of $64.33 for a total cost of $513 million. This leaves approximately $500 million remaining in the current $1 billion repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of the year.","With that, we'll wrap up, and Marty and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.","Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Investors, analysts and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. We will take a question from the investment community first. Your first question will come from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Chris.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. So, Marty, I just wanted to ask you first off if I could, there's been some controversy around the rate of growth in vapor and e-cigarettes and the resulting weakness in the cigarette volumes. You cited this in your remarks and Billy did, I just wonder if you could give some perspective on the growth of the e-vapor category in total. There's more than just measured channels that, which is what we see. And then, how you think it may be affecting cigarette volume. I don't know if you can give a number there, but just if you can give us an idea of kind of what to expect through the year if possible.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, so the vapor category has grown. You'll remember Chris, there was a period when it grew fast, when it first came into the market, and then flattened and now it's growing again. This is consistent I think with what we've been saying all along which is as the technologies get better and particularly as adult smokers are able to learn about the products that we would expect migration over time and that's why we're, have the innovation aspiration we do. So, the numbers are hard to come by as you know. We can look at the measured channels. It looks to us like the volume was up in 2017 about 11%. And at least in measured channels is moving much faster than that this year. It's very hard to get numbers around the other channels' e-commerce and some of the vape shops.","Listen, in terms of volume, in the cigarette category I think Billy covered it pretty well, which is there are a number of factors which affect cigarette industry volume and it happens over time. Our view on this, we don't guide on volume, as you know, Chris. But we expect for that rate to moderate as we go through 2018 because we're going to lap the California SET. I'd also remind people that the rates tend to be a little bit lumpy. If I look at 2017, for example by quarter, the rates were 3%, 4.5%, 3.5%, and 4.5% and then it smoothed out to about 4%, which is in the long-term range.","I remind everybody I won't go through the mechanics because I know you all know this, but we have a very highly-developed model to monitor this which comprises both secular decline rate and price elasticity. And we look at a number of factors in the secular decline rates, including the migration of smokers to other technology. So we're keeping an eye on that. But we have good plans for 2018. We've reaffirmed, we have confidence in the plan.","As probably lastly, just worth reminding ourselves that over time there have been other predictions about trend breaks in the cigarette volume decline that have not materialized. I remember once around 2011 or 2012 about vapor, and it was going to be an immediate disruptor and it turned out not to be true. And then on the other side we remember gas prices dropped and consumers did better, and we were, some were predicting it was going to go up. So we look at it over time. We monitor it regularly, and we'll be ready for whatever comes.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, just, thank you. Good color there. I had just one follow-up question which is...","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","...in terms of your spending \u2013 we know you're spending some of this tax savings back behind the business. And we don't need to get into quarters here, but has that spending started aggressively already? And, we saw Marlboro sequentially improve a little bit. Can we attribute some of that to some of the incremental spending already? Or is that still to come?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","No. Yeah, we're spending. It's in our plans for 2018. You're right. We're not going to guide by the quarters. But, Chris, if you look at the national launch of Marlboro Ice, if you look at the expansion of MarkTen Elite, if you look at the filing of the MRTPA application for Copenhagen snuff and so forth, you can see that those investments are starting to flow through in those important long-term places. And I think we've got a year to go. But again, we're encouraged by Marlboro stabilizing sequentially from the last quarter.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. Chris, thanks for the questions.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I have a couple questions on IQOS. Could you guys give us an update on your expectations for the PMTA timing? And then I'd like to hear from you on what you think are the prospects for IQOS in the U.S. in light of the adoption curve that Philip Morris highlighted in Japan. Do you guys foresee similar limitations along the adoption curve in the U.S.? And just like to hear from you what learnings you're taking from, again, what they're seeing in Japan right now?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. So I'm afraid we don't have much to offer you on timing because it remains at the FDA. And, as you know, those timelines, Bonnie, and they continue to look at it. But we're hopeful we'll hear from them soon. We remain very excited about the prospects of bringing IQOS to the U.S. marketplace. We think it's a very good product with a good sensory experience that has good satisfaction parallel to cigarettes. There's no ash, there's less odor. And it's a compelling harm reduction opportunity, as we know, from the application. So, I know there has been some discussion about its performance in Japan.","I know that you'll remember that when we've been asked to try to pick a market that we like, we've refrained from doing so. And I think that turns out to be right. We're trying to gain the insights from each of the markets, apply them to what we think will happen in the U.S. market. It's also worth reminding people that we have a portfolio approach to harm reduction. So while we're very excited about IQOS and we are going to be working very hard to convert adult smokers, we also have the largest smokeless business in the world, which is already profitable. And obviously, we're building a vapor business. So that's how we think about it in the context of our long-term strategy. And we don't get too excited about short-term information about IQOS. We continue to believe in it and we're really excited about bringing it to the U.S. market.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for that. But then that does beg a follow-on question just in terms of how do you guys envision IQOS interacting with the more developed e-cigs market than what you see outside of the U.S., because certainly that's the case here. And then you touched on your full portfolio of reduced-risk products. So help us understand how you expect that to interact within your own portfolio?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. Well, that's what we're going to \u2013 sure, good question. That's what we're going to go find out when we get to market. This is a product that has not been introduced to the U.S. market. And I know you remember from our Investor Day presentation that our belief is, is that consumers, like in most categories, will segment along product lines and we want to be there with the leading options. And so, as the consumer segment, we will make investments behind the leading bets. And the honest answer is no one will know how it will interact until we put it in the market and observe that, and that's one of the things we're going to learn as soon as we can get it there.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. One final question for me, if I may, just on your smokeable operating income growth, which was negative, which is very unusual for you guys. So, just want to understand how much of this was planned. I know you talked about stepping up spending. But I just really want to understand how we should think about this going forward? And then do you guys think that the stepped-up spending is resulting in the share stabilization you're looking for, for Marlboro. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes. I think the investments are paying back, and this is why we have said for some time now, including when we guided early in the year, that long-term investors should look, I think, at our full year performance against our strategies, including these investments. And, by golly, we're guiding to a 15% to 19% EPS growth year and we see 30% in the first quarter. So I know it's tempting in some places to bore into the segment reporting for each quarter, but that's not how we think about it. And I think investors should think about it the same way, which is long-term growth in EPS. And by the way, that gets converted into cash through the dividend payout ratio.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Your next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, Marty, I guess I just wanted to go back to kind of the industry question and the interaction between combustibles and e-vapors. And clearly, the stock price performance in the last couple of months, adjusted investors are really concerned about how much e-vapor category, particularly JUUL, is taking share away from your combustible product. So, I'm just wondering if you have any response to that or any data that you can share us in terms of the interaction across those brands.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, there is interaction, and as you know and we've been predicting this as we bring innovative products to the marketplace, there is going to be interaction because if you will remember again from presentations we've made previously, we know about half of adult smokers are looking for products to migrate to that offer them nicotine that they may want or need, but that offer them a reduced harm. So we would expect that over time. Now, again, just another historical footnote. We went back and we looked, and I have counted at least five brands in the e-vapor category that had very significant growth rates early and then fell back to earth over time. And so, this is not the first time that we have seen some excitement about a category growth.","And what we're learning is, is that you have to dimensionalize the size of the category. The category is about $90 billion retail in the United States. We think vapor is probably about $3 billion of that in 2017. So it remains a fraction of the overall category. And time will tell as adult smokers migrate. So again, we're the long-term people. Our long-term strategy is to move them to innovative products. But I think it's worth remembering the history that there have been some rockets before that haven't sustained their trajectory.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, I guess, just when you kind of think about the FDA actions, though, just in terms of \u2013 seems like there is a lot of concern around the youth access issue on e-vapor category and obviously there's been some letters being sent to some of the retailers. Do you think that that is a positive development in a sense that that actually allows some of those dynamics to kind of shift a little bit more in favor of the combustibles? Or does it sort of undermine your plan to kind of develop the e-vapor category, IQOS as well as your Nu Mark product?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I hope it doesn't. But I think it's important that everybody understand that this is a category that comes with responsibility. And those of us who have been here for some time understand that the responsibility actions we take, particularly in the area of youth access, are most important. And, some of the developments we've seen, I think may reflect that other companies have not understood that as they've entered the market. It's why we work so hard on this in terms of youth access prevention in our trade programs and the like. There is nothing inconsistent, in my view, with trying to develop innovative products for adults while taking steps to limit their reach to young people. And we have done it for decades and that's how we're running our e-vapor business.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then question for you, Billy. Just, obviously, you bought back about $500 million of shares in the first quarter. You've got another $500 million left in your authorization. But your balance sheet is still pretty strong. You're generating cash, and it seems like the stock price reaction recently would suggest that you could actually be much more aggressive in terms of the buybacks. So do you have any updated thoughts in terms of how you think about the buyback for the balance of the year?","William F. Gifford, Jr. - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, Judy, as we've said before, look, we buy back shares based on market conditions. We're currently in a program and we'll evaluate that as we progress through the year.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good to speak with you.","Operator","Your next question is from Vivien Azer with Cowen.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So thank you for the color on kind of the puts and takes on cigarette industry volumes. I was wondering if, just from an industry perspective \u2013 not necessarily for your volumes \u2013 do you have a sense of what that number would have been if you exclude California?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I don't.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. No problem. Just in terms of the dynamics within the cigarette category, Marty, I think over the last few quarters we've been discussing some of the dynamics that are happening at the lower end of the category.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","And it looks like, per your disclosure, deep discount does continue to gain share. So could you offer a little bit more color on the dynamics that you're seeing at the low end, please?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. Maybe two things, Vivien, from our end. One is sort of how the consumer is doing and then the movement within discount. So we continue to be net positive on the consumer. But we're watchful of a few things, to be sure. I mean on the positive side we're at full employment. And confidence remains good and the housing starts look okay to us. On the watch-out list I think is you haven't seen the wage gains that you might expect in a full employment environment. And, of course, they're not evenly distributed. Gas prices are up about 10% year-over-year, as you and some others have noted. And we're also watching to make sure that there aren't other costs that are kind of eating away at disposable income. But net-net I think we remain positive.","There is no question though that there are manufacturers in the marketplace that are investing behind trying to get the lowest price cigarette brand in the store. And you see that in the deep discount. So discounts about 24% according to our estimate. It's up about three tenths, which is a tick up from where it had been. All of that basically from the deep discount end. Looks to us like about half of that is switching out from manufacturers discount. And then the other three-tenths, give or take, it's not quite this precise, but roughly, Vivien, comes from the remaining 75% there. So there are consumers, to be sure, who will go into a trade channel and ask for the cheapest brand in the store. And there are some companies that are offering it to them. So I think that probably explains our view of what's happening in the discount category. Obviously, it's not an area of focus for us, as we're focused on premium, especially Marlboro.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Absolutely. That's really helpful. If you take a step back, Marty, and I really appreciated your comments that, yeah, when gas prices were good...","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","...clearly it was apparent with cigarette volumes. And if we kind of go back to 2015 and look over the last three years, have you notice any evolution in price elasticities?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","No. And we \u2013 it's something we look at all the time, and we have not seen any change there.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. That's good news. Last question for me. On FDA \u2013 I'm not sure if you're going to comment on this, but I'm going to try to ask the question anyway.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","I'm curious whether you think the FDA appreciates that the pharmacokinetic profile can be very different within e-cigarettes, because as I think about the ANPRM around characterizing flavors, anything that is a combustible cigarette, and certainly what you guys are aspiring to do on IQOS fits into a much more tightly-regulated flavor profile. And I wonder whether they, whether they're kind of looking at that, if the pharmacokinetic profile matters and whether that informs how you're thinking about characterizing flavors \u2013 or whether you think they should be. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I can't speak for the FDA, but I'm confident that they will look at that, along with a host of things. Our experience with them has been that they're very thorough, and I think that they will look at the product performances and I'm sure with the flavor ANPRM, this is going to come up. So, while I can't speak for them it seems sensible to me that they would do that.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just had one question. The investment in \u2013 that you made in the all-other segment this quarter was a bit below our expectations. And, I guess I'm asking more in absolute rather than relative to my own expectations, but you highlighted expanding MarkTen Elite into 6,000 stores but given the magnitude of measured channel growth in the e-cigarette category, what are the constraints against more rapidly accelerating investment in the all other segment? Are there capacity constraints that are guiding that or is it really just taking a more measured approach before you fully commit to one of the new technologies that you're supporting this year?","William F. Gifford, Jr. - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, Matt. There're really no constraints from a capacity standpoint. It's really when you see that, you'll see fluctuations when you compare year-over-year, quarter by quarter. There'll be puts and takes as we move through the year. And so we certainly are disciplined as we approach the e-vapor category but no constraints that are limiting us.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I guess...","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Steve.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Continuing on with e-vapor and the topic du jour, I'm wondering what your analytics tell you about the demographic overlap between today's e-vapor consumer and really I guess the JUUL adopter specifically, and your core smokeable segment consumer. Because I guess I'm just trying to \u2013 is there anything there that might make you more or less optimistic when you think about direct smokeable cannibalization risks on your brands from e-vapor? Especially in the near term as JUUL growth remains robust and for example your MarkTen franchise grows. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Maybe I'll take that up a level, Steve, so I don't, be commenting about other people's products and competitive information which we have which I'm not particularly interested in sharing on a call. But I think what we do know is that among adult smokers, it's pretty widely held that they are looking for alternatives and that's true for both adult male and female smokers as well as across the age cohorts. I can say also that we take great care when we we're looking at the age cohorts to make sure that we're focusing our efforts on adult smokers and so forth. But in terms of the interplay between one brand and our cigarette brand, I think that's a topic I'm not going to discuss on the call. I hope you can appreciate that.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I do. I just thought I'd try.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I appreciate it.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I guess separate tact on the topic.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","As your vapor business grows and builds on some of the newer products that you're bringing to market, is there any update on how you're thinking about the profitability ramp and how you dimension where run rate margins might mature towards in that segment under the various growth scenarios that you're considering?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, I thought when we presented at Investor Day and Jody took us through how he's thinking about it, what our aspiration for vapor is to be the leading e-vapor company in the United States that offers superior products to people who want them. And that we have cigarette margins \u2013 cigarette-like margins at scale and that continues to be our aspiration and as the volume comes in it helps us along that way. So we are bullish about the ability to build a business there that has cigarette-like margins. It's early right now of course and we're investing. And there's a lot of FDA spend, but over time, we're pretty bullish about that possibility.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great. If I can squeeze in one more.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","The various advanced notices of proposed rulemaking that you mentioned that the FDA had issued over the last several months, can you remind us...","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...of the expected timeline from here of your responses and the likely news flow that you see associated with it? Because just given what we saw in March, obviously, FDA-related headlines can certainly have an impact on how the market perceives risk around your stock. So, I just, I think it's important to remain clear about what may or may not lie ahead on that front.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, so if I remember this correctly, there are 90 day response deadlines to each of the ANPRMs and they all came out within about a week or so of each other. I don't have the date in my head at the moment, but we can get you that. I think that we and others have asked for extensions. These are enormously complex topics they've asked on, and so they may be extended. And if that's of interest to you, Steve, I'll have Bill get you those dates. I just don't have them top of mind. But nominally 90 days, but there may be extensions for the replies. And the replies will probably trigger some discussion of those as well.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question is from Owen Bennett with Jefferies.","Owen Bennett - Jefferies International Ltd.","Good morning, guys. Hope all well.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Owen.","Owen Bennett - Jefferies International Ltd.","Just one question for me, I think, just following up on Vivian's. So you spoke about the deep discount competition, but could you comment on the promotional environment ex the deep discount brands, please? Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, it continues, I would say, to stay competitive. I don't think there's been any significant changes in the first quarter that I would call out from the typical back and forth on the promotional. Naturally, you have some folks that are expanding brands, and they put promotional devices in place. But I don't think it's anything materially different from the fourth quarter.","Owen Bennett - Jefferies International Ltd.","Cool. Thank you, guys.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Owen.","Operator","Your next question is from Adam Spielman with Citi.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi. Thank you very much. Two questions, if I may. The first one is on the discount segment within cigarettes. How big does that have to get before you start getting concerned about it, would be the first question?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. Well, we watch it carefully obviously given our focus on premium business, and you'll probably remember, Adam, there have been periods in the past where the discount category grew such that we had to take action to compete more effectively there. I would say at 24% of the market, it's relatively stable, and you see us continuing to do a good job. So, we don't have a trip wire that I'll call out, but it's something that we monitor.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Can you just remind us sort of back in \u2013 my memory was in \u2013 was suddenly in the sort of mid-2004 period, sort of beyond that, it was an issue. What sort of percentage was it at that point? I know you're not going to say sort of a 28.2% is suddenly...","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Right.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","...going to do something. But sort of ballpark, are we talking 30%? Are we talking 28%? Are we talking 35%?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I'll give you a different metric that we monitor...","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Yes.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","...which is price gap. So I think that's probably the easier way to think about it. You remember this from Marlboro Friday and others. Net gap gets out of line, and then we know we have to be mindful of that. The gap's right now at about 30%. And it can probably expand a bit, but that's probably the better number to look at, Adam.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Fine. Okay, that's very good. And then secondly, we haven't talked about \u2013 much about smokeless in the Q&A. Obviously, volume's roughly flat. As we think about the next quarter or two, we've got the recall. But if you sort of strip out the effects of the recall, should we sort of be thinking that this category is flat now? And the other thing I was really surprised about was your strong margin. And again, whether in the medium term you see significant upside from here? Or whether it's going be a much more gradual thing on the OCI margin?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, well, thanks for that because it allows me to observe that it's hard to grow margin from 69%. I mean, it's a very high margin category, isn't it?","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Yes.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","That's flatter a bit because of the recall. Obviously, we had a lot of costs in the first quarter of 2017, so the delta between this quarter and that, Adam, is flatter a bit by that, but it's a high margin business. There's no denying it. I think it's fair to observe that the category has been flattish in terms of its volume growth. It used to go about 5%, call it, and it's clearly slowed down a little bit to be flattish or down a little bit on the six-month moving.","There's probably a couple of reasons for that. One is something we talked about earlier which is there are consumers that are trying other products; and secondly, the retail pricing is up more in 2017 than it has been over 2015 and 2016. And I think that's had an effect on category growth which is something we're also looking at.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you. And that was partly a tax rise, if I remember, in Pennsylvania?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, and MST also had an excise tax increase in California last year, too.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Your next question is from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Good morning, everyone.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Marty. So just two questions from my end. First on just general Marlboro trends, outside of California, can you guys like pinpoint the areas? I'm just curious how broad-based it is versus is it isolated in certain regions, markets where you could be a lot more tactical? That's the first question. And then the second question is just maybe an update on MarkTen Bold, if you can give us any thoughts on kind of early consumer response.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. Billy, you want to talk about Marlboro?","William F. Gifford, Jr. - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, I'll talk about Marlboro. From a standpoint of being broad-based, it is broad-based, Nik. From a standpoint of fine-tuning, we are always in the process of fine-tuning. That's something that the PM USA team does very well. And they'll look and adjust state-by-state to fine-tune the effectiveness of our spending related to Marlboro.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","MarkTen Bold, I think, is off to good start, Nik. It's a very good product, particularly as it appeals, I think, to adult smokers who are looking for similar experience there. And so, it's early days with MarkTen Bold, but the early feedback is very good.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And I guess what I'm really trying to get at, maybe I should have been more explicit. Obviously, MarkTen Bold is your first foray with the salt technology.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And obviously, there's certain other products in the marketplace that have done very well with that technology. So I'm just trying to understand, how much of this is about the brand versus the actual experience? And can you do more stuff with MarkTen Bold to get consumers to try it, because obviously with the salt technology, the consumer experience is a lot better?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, it's true. And I think it's also format. So I think in the e-vapor category, the product bundle is both the format, the satisfaction and the flavor. And so we have very good flavor there, and I think it has good satisfaction. But it is a cig-alike product, and that is a segment that is under some pressure in e-vapor. We've got, obviously, in MarkTen Elite, a pod-based product, which is a different formulation. And what we're trying to do there is to match consumer expectations through different devices. You may know, for example there, that the pod has about twice as much liquid as another competitive brand. And we're trying to meet the consumer where they want to be through different techniques.","I think we're going to see this for a while, Nik, as both formats, flavors and satisfaction are worked on in the category. And remember, we also have the complexity of the FDA rules that allow you to launch some products but not others, given when they were in the marketplace. So that's the bundle of things that we're working through. But when I look at what Nu Mark has done, we have a very good offering in cig-alike. I think we have a very good offering now in a pod-based product. And through our interest in Avail, we're learning a lot about the open segment. So I think that's the right strategy.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good to talk to you, Nik.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi Michael.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","You mentioned on IQOS, obviously assuming that it's approved for marketing authorization, that you would have a lead market and then other lead markets. And so it sounds a little bit like you'll have a measured approach. How do you think about the range of scenarios? Is it something you could accelerate if the responses click? Is there capacity limitations? What are some of the things that frame how you think about the trajectory that would presumably build towards an ultimate national expansion?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, good question. We built at least three scenarios that depend on the consumer reaction to it. We have contingency plans in place to scale it faster in faster scenarios. Capacity we do not expect to be an issue. We've got some things to learn, as you know, about pricing and the brand and how we go to market. I mean, I don't want people to underestimate, this is all new with IQOS, as PMI has experienced. What we've tried to do is to have a program in place that allows us to learn quickly, make the adjustments we need, and to scale fast depending upon its performance, which we continue to be optimistic about.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Oh, no. That's helpful. Thank you. And just back to gas prices as well for a minute. It was, depending on where exactly you benchmark it, about a two to even four or so point lift a couple years ago. In terms of magnitude, obviously, prices now are higher than in the last few years. But do you have any ability to quantify how much that may be driving some of the category pressure?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I think it's one of many factors. It's not the same dramatic effect as when they dropped. I think that's fair to say. But because so much of the volume moves through convenience and gas, Michael, if it's up \u2013 I saw a figure, I think, $0.25 maybe year-over-year \u2013 it's not insignificant. And so we're keeping a close eye on it. It's not the same magnitude, but I think it's one of many factors that has affected the volume, probably, in our view.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. And on Marlboro Ice, obviously, 130,000 stores is a tremendous reach. I think you call on maybe twice that, or something close to that. Is that something you expect to have further expansion potential? Or is it in the right places already? Or maybe somewhere in between?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, we're about eight weeks out, so we try to get to the right places fast. And then, obviously, when brands continue to succeed, we'll get them in a wider distribution. But the way we do this is we set target distributions and dates and we're right on track with Marlboro Ice. And given its success, it wouldn't surprise me at all to see it expand over time.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thank you. One last one on the MRTP for snuff obviously some of the FDA's own targeted timing is not strict, but just to understand when their theoretical clock starts, has that application been accepted already? Because I think that's when they sort of began the countdown. I know you submitted it but is it sort of finally \u2013 officially formally accepted by them?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","No. You're getting pretty good at this about knowing all this technical stuff Michael. It's been filed but it has not been technically accepted which takes some time for them to go through the application, dot the I's, and cross the T's. So, I guess in FDA's view, the clock has not yet started to run.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for calling in.","Operator","We invite the media to ask questions at this time. Your next question will come from Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.","Gilbert Alexandre - Darphil Associates","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Gilbert Alexandre - Darphil Associates","Could you give us an estimate of where excise tax increase at the state level may be coming from this year? And I have a second question.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. We've had two that have been passed this year. There's been one in Oklahoma, which was $1 a pack and there was a second in Kentucky which was $0.50 a pack. We had proposals for about 26 of them. Some of the state legislatures are now starting to wrap up but we continue to see those as risks but so far this year anyway those two I called out.","Gilbert Alexandre - Darphil Associates","I thank you. And could you give us an indication now that you're past the California excise tax what the volume declines could be over next 12 months? I know (49:36)...","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Let me go back to where we started, it may be you were not on the call early. We don't guide on volume. What our observation was is that we would expect for the volume decline rate to moderate as we lap California going into the second quarter.","Gilbert Alexandre - Darphil Associates","I thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thank you for your questions.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We do have a follow-up question from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I just wanted to get back in.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, again. I had another question on Marlboro.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Sarah Knakmuhs, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Sarah Fitzgerald Knakmuhs - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria's CEO and Billy Gifford, our CFO, to discuss Altria's 2016 second quarter and first-half business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing these results which is available on our website at altria.com or through the Altria investor app.","During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2015. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.","Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release.","Now I'll turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Altria Group delivered strong 2016 second quarter and first half results, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.5% in the second quarter and by nearly 11% for the first half.","Our core tobacco businesses continued to produce very strong results, with yet another solid quarter of income and retail share performance. Marlboro matched the record retail share it set in the first half last year, and Copenhagen and Skoal produced excellent share results on a combined basis. And we continue to reward our shareholders, paying out more than $2.2 billion in dividends to shareholders thus far in 2016.","So here are some of the operating highlights from the quarter and the first half.","The smokeable products segment continued to produce excellent results. Despite difficult year-over-year comparisons, it grew adjusted operating company's income by 4.5% in the second quarter and nearly 7% for the first half. You'll recall that last year the smokeable segment grew adjusted OCI by nearly 16% in the second quarter and over 14% for the first half.","This growth in 2015 benefited from higher reported volumes at PM USA driven by stable industry volume and a trade inventory build influenced by upcoming cigarette excise tax increases. In the second quarter of 2016, the trade depleted inventory levels. So when adjusted for these inventory movements, PM USA estimates its second quarter cigarette volume declined 3%, in line with PM USA's estimate for the total industry decline rate. For the half, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined 1.5%, in line with the industry.","For the first half of 2016, Marlboro's retail share was unchanged at 44.1%, matching its record share level set a year ago. Marlboro's second quarter retail share also was 44.1%, down one-tenth of a point from the year-ago period. We are extremely pleased with the smokeable segment's performance in both the second quarter and first half of 2016.","Our Smokeless Products segment continued to deliver excellent income performance, robust volumes, and strong share growth on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. USSTC grew adjusted OCI by nearly 14% in the second quarter and more than 15% for the first half. USSTC estimates that its volume, after adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, grew approximately 5% in the second quarter and 4% for the first half while estimated smokeless industry volume grew approximately 3% for the past six months.","Copenhagen and Skoal increased their combined retail share by 1.5 points in the second quarter and by nine-tenths of a share point for the first half. Copenhagen's retail share gained nearly three points in the quarter benefiting from the first full quarter of Copenhagen Mint's national expansion at retail. Copenhagen Mint has performed extremely well, bringing excitement to the brand for both adult dippers and for the trade.","Skoal's retail share declined 1.3 points in the second quarter, reflecting in part USSTC's portfolio strategy to invest behind Copenhagen and expand Copenhagen Mint. And as you know, part of USSTC's strategy is to grow the combined share of Copenhagen and Skoal.","In Innovative Tobacco Products, Nu Mark continues to invest with discipline in developing a portfolio of products to meet the evolving preferences of adult tobacco consumers. In e-vapor, market results for MarkTen XL remain encouraging as Nu Mark has now distributed the brand into stores, representing approximately 50% of e-vapor category volume in mainstream retail channels including C-stores.","On the heated tobacco platform, our work with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications for pre-market authorization and a modified-risk tobacco product destination remains on plan, and we're making excellent progress on commercialization strategies for the U.S. market.","As you know, in May, the FDA published its final deeming regulations, extending its regulatory authority to all tobacco products including cigars and e-vapor. We believe we're well-prepared for these regulations, and Nu Mark and Middleton are working now to comply with them. Our companies also continue to engage with FDA and other stakeholders to advocate for changes to the regulations where we believe appropriate.","So in summary, we're very pleased with our first-half performance. Based on these results and our expectation that our businesses will deliver solid results over the balance of 2016, we now expect to deliver 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $3.01 to $3.07, representing a growth rate of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. As a reminder, this guidance does not include any impact from the proposed AB InBev\/SABMiller business combination as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined.","Speaking of our beer investment, we're pleased with the significant progress AB InBev has made securing regulatory clearances. AB InBev has announced that it has obtained approval in 22 jurisdictions, including approvals in the United States, North America, Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America. And AB InBev continues to pursue the remaining regulatory clearances that are necessary to close the transaction.","In addition, as you know, on July 26, AB InBev announced its revised and final offer to SABMiller. This offer among other things would increase the pre-tax cash that Altria expects to receive to $3 billion from the previously estimated $2.5 billion. The other material terms related to Altria remain the same.","Internally, our teams are preparing to transition our investment from SABMiller to the new combined entity. One such area of preparation is coordinating how our accounting teams will share information. And through this preparation, we now expect a timing difference between how we currently report results for our SABMiller investment and how we'll report for our investment in the new combined company. Once the proposed transaction closes, we expect to record our share of results from the new company on a one-quarter lag. Billy will provide you with more detail in his remarks. We remain excited about the proposed transaction and look forward to supporting the combination of these two great companies.","Now I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance.","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some more color on the smokeable products segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.6 percentage points in the second quarter to over 50%, primarily driven by higher net pricing and lower SG&A costs, partially offset by higher resolution expenses. For the first half, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 2.2 points to 49.2%, primarily driven by the same factors.","PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline and trade inventory movements. In the second quarter last year, the trade built inventory ahead of excise tax increases in several states that went into effect in the next quarter. For the first half, PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.1%. At retail, PM USA's overall share was unchanged in the second quarter and grew 1\/10 of a point for the first half.","In cigars, higher shipment volume contributed to the smokeable products segment's performance in both periods. Middleton grew Black & Mild's volume by 7.5% in the quarter and nearly 8% for the first half by focusing on the brand strength in the more profitable tipped segment.","In the Smokeless Products segment, adjusted OCI margins expanded in the second quarter by nearly 3 percentage points to 69.3% and by 2.6 percentage points to 67.5% for the first half, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix due to higher popular price product volume. The Smokeless segment's reported shipment volumes increased 4.3% in the second quarter and 6% for the first half of 2016, primarily driven by the industry's rate of growth and retail share gains.","In wine, Ste. Michelle continued to deliver strong income by growing volume of its premium wines. During the second quarter and first half, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by nearly 6% and 5% respectively. Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volumes grew more than 3% in the second quarter and 5.5% for the first half.","Altria reported equity earnings from its SABMiller investment of $199 million in the second quarter and $265 million for the first half.","So let me close with some more information on the accounting of our beer investment that Marty mentioned. For context, Altria currently records results for its SABMiller investment concurrent with Altria's reporting calendar. Because NewCo's results will not be available to us in time to record them in the concurrent period, we expect to report our share of NewCo's results using a one-quarter lag. This means that after the transaction closes, there will be a one-time three-month transition when no earnings from our equity investment in NewCo are recorded in our income statement. For example, Altria's share of NewCo's results in the quarter in which the transaction closes will be recorded in the subsequent quarter.","The precise periods affected will depend on when the transaction closes. It's important to understand that this lag will not affect our cash flows or quarterly dividends per share, but we do expect it to impact our year-over-year comparability of our reported and adjusted diluted EPS in the short-term and could also affect 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance.","As noted in our earnings release, our guidance does not yet include the impact of the expected lag because the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined.","That wraps up our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we posted our usual list of quarterly metrics including pricing, inventory, and other housekeeping items.","Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Investors, analysts and media representatives are now invited to participate in today's Q&A session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Chris. How're you?","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'm doing very well. Thank you. Nice report here.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I just had two questions for you, if I could. There was a comment in the release about higher promotional spending in both smokeable and Smokeless. And I know you've had, certainly in Smokeless, a good number of \u2013 some new product activity to help you there and I imagine that's the main item that's driving that. But I was curious within the smokeable division how you see the promotional environment and if there was an area you gotten more aggressive on and where that promotional spending was rising.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll ask Billy to comment on how it flowed through. I think that the environment remains relatively constant, Chris, is your short answer. It's competitive out there; it always has been but we haven't seen any material changes.","Billy, do you want to say more about it?","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","No. I think the only thing I would add is, Chris, from a timing quarter to quarter in a short period, you'll have timing fluctuations. You'll recall as part of our productivity initiative, one of the areas we said we would reinvest in was brand building. And so this is reminiscent of that.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Got you. And then just a question overall on the category. Down 3%'s a little different from what Reynolds had indicated. But either way, we're moving back towards more of a normalized rate of decline. I know you don't like to give guidance on volume. So in this quarter with the gas price down, the consumer still in better shape, it looked like volumes did weaken a little bit sequentially more than I expected. Anything you'd offer in relation to that? And if you could speak at all about the second half, that'd be great as well.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Chris. Listen, we don't see anything in the quarter that causes us to call it out for you. I do think it's consistent with what we've said and you and others I think have said over time that you would expect for the long-term trends to revert back to their trend line. If you look at 2015, we ended the year up a half (0.5%). The quarter before was down a half (0.5%), and now for the year so far, the first half we're down about 1.5%.","So 1.5% obviously is lower than the long-term trend line, but it's higher than it was in 2015 when we had these interruptions because of the gas prices and all. So I think it's consistent with how we see it, Chris, which is it's just slowly reverting back to the long-term trend line.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for your time.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Chris. Thanks for calling in.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Russell Miller - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Morning. This is Russ Miller on for Nik.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Russ.","Russell Miller - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just a philosophical question for you guys. How does Altria think about innovation within the context of the new deeming regs and the FDA's more stringent view on substantial equivalents? And more specifically there, should we assume innovation will be delayed from hitting the market? And if so, how should we think about volumes in that context? Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks for the question. For a thorough summary, I think of our views, I might refer you and others to the comments that we filed \u2013 I'm sure you've seen them \u2013 in which we picked up this very point. We do think that innovation in the category is important. We're working very hard on our innovation system and on innovated products for the adult tobacco consumer. And we believe that it would be good public policy for the FDA to encourage that. Our comments have pointed out to the FDA that some of what's in the deeming regulations does not seem to be particularly friendly to that concept.","And so we continue \u2013 I think we mentioned in our remarks this morning, we're both complying with the regs and we're trying to influence and advocate where we think the regs could be improved. And I think in the area of innovation, I think you've picked up on an area where they could be improved. I think it's too soon to tell what the effect will be on volumes. I hope that's helpful to you.","Russell Miller - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's excellent. Thank you, Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks for calling.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Judy. Good morning.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So I just wanted to clarify the industry volume numbers and understand there may be some differences in how you adjust for inventory adjustment, but it still seems like a pretty big gap in terms of what you're reporting as an adjusted industry volume decline versus Reynolds. So is a 3% decline just purely sort of industry shipment that you estimate and then adjusted for? Your estimate of the inventory movement and when you think about sort of the true consumption decline, whether you'd look at wholesale shipment to retail or retail takeaway, is that 3% you think is the more representative of the true consumption decline?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me make a comment, and then I'll ask Billy maybe to talk about how we do the estimate so as to try to help you. Remember, it's a tough comp because the industry was stable for the second quarter of last year. So in terms of the underlying, I think that's the way to understand it. And I'm sure you heard the conversation we just had with Chris about the reversion to the trend over time. I know, Billy, we can't comment on how other people estimate, but maybe you could help Judy with how we estimate it.","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Judy, basically the way we approach estimating that industry decline is we take total shipments that are reported and then we look at inventory movements and we adjust for those inventory movements so that we get towards a more true consumption offtake, to your point. And then the only other difference in this period is a calendar day difference. And so those are the major factors that we would adjust for to get to a more consumption offtake.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, Billy, just \u2013 I mean, the press release talks about the accounting of SABMiller transaction and some of the quarterly lag. So maybe just help us frame kind of what we should expect, and I know you're not necessarily talking about the updated guidance, but just broadly speaking, how does that impact potentially the full year guidance and just more on from a timing standpoint?","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Really kind of reference, I'll give you an example. So if this transaction were to close in the fourth quarter, SAB would be recorded as we currently record it. All those results from NewCo would be picked up and recorded in the first quarter of 2017. So that's how that one quarter lag affects from a go-forward basis.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So the accounting of the equity income based on the 27% still holds, even if the transaction closes at the beginning of the fourth quarter for your year impact?","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","That is correct. It continues until NewCo comes into existence and then those results are on a quarter lag.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for calling, Judy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Matt.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Marty. I guess I just had two follow-up questions on deeming. First \u2013 this may be pretty straight forward \u2013 but could you give us a reminder of where you stand on the challenge that you filed to the descriptor ban included in the cigar deeming portion? Do you have an injunction? Do you expect to have an injunction by August 8 or would you have additional flexibility to continue marketing your products beyond that date?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep. Good question and I'm pleased to tell you the matter has resolved. So we had objected to that, as you know, in our comments and FDA put it in the deeming regulations. We filed suit and FDA has informed us that they do not at this time intend to enforce that against Black & Mild. And in consideration for that, we have withdrawn our lawsuit. The parties have reserved their rights, but we will continue to use Black & Mild unless something changes.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's good to hear. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And just another one. Even though the published regulations didn't make any immediate changes in your ability to market products with characterizing flavors, the red line draft that was made public afterward indicated that the FDA had initially intended to take a more rigid position on flavored products...","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And voiced some concerns around their impact on youth consumption. So the end outcome was favorable, but I'm just curious how you interpret the implications of the red line draft and what that might mean for their orientation toward menthol going forward?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we'll have to see going forward. I mean, I think menthol stands on its own merits and I won't repeat what we both know, Matt, on that. You know the science on that and we've put in our papers on that. So I'm not sure it has a big effect on menthol.","I do think that there have been instances in which some in tobacco control have argued to take flavors away from adult tobacco consumers in the name of trying to prevent youth consumption. Our view on that is that there is so much that can be done to prevent youth consumption, most of which we have worked on and the numbers are trending in the right direction that we want to defend the flavors for our adult tobacco consumers who have enjoyed them and the cigar category is a perfect example where flavors have been in that category for, gosh, decades and decades. So we'll have to see how the FDA approaches that, but we think that they're actually very separate issues about youth consumption and flavors.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, Marty. I appreciate it.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.","Aaron Grey - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. It's Aaron Grey on for Vivien.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Aaron. How are you?","Aaron Grey - Cowen & Co. LLC","Doing well. After benefiting from a benign excise tax environment over the last few years, I was hoping to get an update on the state excise taxes. Given we saw three states pass tax increases in the first half of the year and have open legislation as well as notable proposed ballot initiatives, how should we think about the outlook for the weighted average SET over the course of the year?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we have a little bit of information in that in the housekeeping, but you're right, we've had three increases so far in 2016 \u2013 Louisiana, West Virginia, and most recently, Pennsylvania. We also had the phase-in effect of a few that were passed previously that came into effect, Connecticut, Minnesota and Oregon, if I recall correctly. The weighted average I think is $1.56 as we stand, but we will have Pennsylvania coming online obviously after August 1.","So it has heated up a little bit. It's a good question. We continue to resist these. We think they're unfair to adult tobacco consumers, but state budgets being what they are, we just have to go through this every year. The one that I would recommend that you be watchful, of course, is California where the ballot has qualified. So that's proposed $2 which will be on the ballot in California in November.","Aaron Grey - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right.","Aaron Grey - Cowen & Co. LLC","And with MarkTen XL distribution representing 50% of volume coverage in traditional retail, what can we expect as it relates to the cadence of XL's roll-out going forward?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're trying to step into it with discipline. We're trying to go where the business is. The stores that we've chosen have good e-vapor business. We've had a very good marketplace response. We've had very good consumer response.","So you know our strategy there which is we have aspirations to be the long-term leader, but we want to proceed with financial discipline, always learning from the consumer. And I'm very pleased with the progress that MarkTen XL is making in that regard. So I would expect more of the same kind of an approach.","Aaron Grey - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Great. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for calling in with your questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Michael. Good morning.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Just curious if you could talk a little bit about how you think about some of the resource allocation \u2013 just looking at margins in Smokeless now, they're a hair shy in the quarter at least of 70%.","So do you give a disproportionate amount of R&D resources there, or to some extent I recognize you need to follow the consumer, but how much can you also try to maybe lead them a little bit versus say vapor? That's a different margin profile, certainly at least at the moment, and some different competitive dynamics. How do you think about all that? And of course, price is a lever as well, and we saw that in the quarter too. How do you think about balancing all those to take advantage of the opportunity in that segment?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we have a process to do that, of course. Actually, I have two processes. We have a strategy process and it's tightly linked to our budget process. So our operating companies come in with their plans. We've talked about this previously. We have one-year plans and three-year plans and longer-term plans, and they make the case for investment, and then Altria Group decides on how to allocate resources about where the best opportunities lie for our shareholders.","And the good news is all of our operating companies have lots of good ideas, so it's always a good discussion about where best to go. But that's the process we use, Michael. We look at it, and then when we put our strategy and our budget together for both one-year, three-year and longer plans, we try to put the resources where we think the greatest opportunities lie, including in margin enhancement.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then looking at the other segment and PMCC, your finance assets on the balance sheet certainly have been coming down. Obviously, you've been not investing in that business and essentially unwinding it. Can you give a look ahead at what the trajectory is on that? Certainly some of these leases have long lives, but you've been doing some sales opportunistically. What should we expect for what that contributes near-term and maybe medium-term?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think Billy can help you with that.","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, you're right, Michael. From a standpoint the net finance receivable is down to $1.2 billion and we have been unwinding that business for quite some time now. We look at those leases and when it makes sense to sell those, we do. As you recall at CAGNY, we talked about a three year to four-year wind-down period that we would have before we're completely out of that.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","And is there anything that might accelerate that, or is that pretty likely to stick? What's the variance to that, possibly?","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, leverage leases is kind of complex, but in the life of a leverage lease for both the counter-party and us, there's a, if you will, a nice period of time when those sales make sense to both parties, and so that's what really drives the unwinding of that business.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly on iQOS, obviously there's a long process in terms of potentially commercializing that here. And needless to say, the FDA application is the one of the nearer-term and bigger pieces of that. What's the right way to think about some of the costs and investments, and to what extent would that be offset by some of the reinvestments from your productivity savings from this year?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think we talked about this when we announced the productivity initiative, which is that we do want to make some continuing investments of area of long term value to the shareholder, and clearly an investment in innovative tobacco products, particularly those with the potential to reduce harm, are high on our list for investment.","So we haven't given much detail below that. Not to preempt your next question, Michael, but those are the areas. And I think when you think about vapor and iQOS and other innovative products for consumers, that's a good place to invest for the long-term proposition of both the company and for our consumers.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Have you had an ability to engage with the FDA yet and have any sense on how receptive they might be to a heat (29:55) platform?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we talked about this last time, right? Which is that I didn't want to comment in too many particulars about an application that involves obviously PMI, because it's their product that they're trying to get qualified. But we did talk about the process. And the process is, there is typically a high degree of engagement between the manufacturer that's trying to bring that product to market and the FDA staff. I think we talked previously about, for example, you don't want to design and execute clinical trials which are lengthy and expensive without knowing that the FDA I think is thinking that you're asking the right questions.","So I would also point to comments that Director Zeller has made publicly about understanding that there is a continuum of harm among tobacco products and that the agency has to be thoughtful about how they encourage manufacturers and consumers to migrate to these kinds of products. So, these things aren't done until they're done. But I continue to be optimistic that this is the way forward, by bringing innovation to consumers which may reduce harm. It's a good idea for everyone.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for calling, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Bonnie. Good morning.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I just had a quick follow-on question from an earlier one on your level of spending behind brand building. Just hoping to get a sense of how much this might accelerate in the second half or should it be more evenly spread throughout this year? And then any thoughts on where your spending levels behind brand building will need to increase in the future? Just kind of want to get a sense of will levels stabilize or do you think you need to keep increasing spending to maintain some of the share gains you've been getting?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Billy, you want to take that?","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Bonnie, when you think about brand building, it'll fluctuate from time period to time period. But I would not expect material fluctuations as we move forward. You always have fluctuations in a shorter time period compared to others. From a standpoint of on a go-forward basis, you'll recall the strategy here is to maximize income and keep Marlboro healthy \u2013 the share momentum there. And so that's what we invest towards, that's what the top line strategy is for that segment and that's the way we think about that segment of the business.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then I had a question on Marlboro. I was hoping to get a sense of what Marlboro volume was during the quarter, if you can adjust for the inventory fluctuations. And then could you drill down a little bit further on some of the different styles such as special blends and their performance? That would be really helpful.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I could try to help you a little bit. I know that we've had this conversation before.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yep.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There is a desire, I know, to get under that. We just don't break them out. I mean, we have the tables in the earnings release which shows as much as I think we're willing to disclose.","Look, the way to think about this, Bonnie, I think is that overall, Marlboro continues to perform terrifically. You know, because most of our shipments in the Cigarette segment are Marlboro. And actually, you would expect for the volume to track. But we don't report at that level. But Marlboro's doing great. It continues to have, as we mentioned, record share if you measure it against the half. Its equity is doing great. The Marlboro architecture continues to perform well. You and I have spoken previously about the exciting digital marketing for adult...","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...tobacco consumers, and we've improved the app further and we've got exciting promotions on there. So I think the way to think about Marlboro is it's doing exactly what we want it to do and it's doing it well.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, speaking of that, I was going ask you a little bit more on that because I do keep hearing positive feedback on your Marlboro app. So give us a sense for the rollout and where \u2013 or how many stores that app is being used in and where that can be by, say, the end of this year.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, we're working it at two levels. One is directly with the consumer, obviously, because adult consumers, once they're age-verified, can get the apps and participate that way. But another big area for us \u2013 and we're very grateful for the partnership with our trade partners. Our trade partners are increasingly excited about the ability to use their loyalty programs with our digital marketing and our apps and the like. And so many of our trade partners are working with us on that. So we're getting very good distribution on that.","I'd like to say that I think that we're ahead on this and I think that our trade thinks we're ahead on this. And our consumer reception has been nothing short of terrific. So it's very efficient and it's very responsible and we're reaching the people we want to reach in a responsible kind of a way. And I think it's the way forward.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. One final question, which I know you're probably not going to want to answer this but I'm going to bring it up.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","The pre-tax cash proceeds from of the sale of SAB. Certainly $3 billion is a lot of money. I'd love to hear a sense from you of where these proceeds will be used. But if you can't say that, maybe just update us on your priorities for free cash co [consideration].","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Out of courtesy to you, I'm going to hand it to Billy to see if he'll accommodate you, Bonnie. How about that?","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right.","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Bonnie. Thanks for the question. Yeah. We have not made decisions around the $3 billion. But I can walk you \u2013 let's step back from that. So absent the $3 billion \u2013 here's the way we think about allocating our capital, the excess cash. So we think about, of course, dividends first and that's that 80% dividend target payout ratio. Then when we have the excess cash, you've seen us do a multitude of things with that. Certainly, we do share repurchases. You've seen us do debt tenders and you've seen us do debt tender refis. So this being excess cash, we would assess it based on market conditions at the time and make the appropriate decisions.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question, Bonnie. We'll see you.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Bye.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Maybe another question on the ABI\/SAB that you probably won't want to answer but I'll give it a shot.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","From a different angle \u2013 and it's one \u2013 the updated outlook which, aside from the $2.5 billion going to $3 billion is pretty much consistent outlook on that deal. It assumes a pretty high degree of confidence \u2013 or implies a high degree of confidence in very limited, if any, kind of proration risk. And given the value gap between the PSA and the cash offer for SAB shareholders, I'm just trying to get a sense for how confident you really are in that proration risk being minimal. What kind of insight you have to the SAB shareholder base and how to assess that risk as you look forward?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Steve, I appreciate the question and I know there's a lot of interest in this. But I think it's probably best this morning that we kind of limit our remarks to what's in the earnings release and in our prepared remarks. We tried to give you as much color as we thought was appropriate under the circumstances. But some of those questions I think are really best directed at the two principal parties to the transaction and I want to respect that. So I'm going to be careful about this, as you can appreciate.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Billy, anything you want to add?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think Marty covered it.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","All right. And then I guess from another angle, fundamentally, everything seems to be pretty solid up and down the P&L across the business line. So I guess is there anything \u2013 focusing on things within your control, are there areas where you're more focused, more risk that you see, whether it's implementing the productivity initiative or any of the go-to marketing initiatives you've got in place? Anything that you're more focused on where the fundamentals, not to say they're weak but just more where they're more in question?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I don't think so. Listen, we don't want to sound, for a moment, arrogant about it, but the business is really performing well. I think the strategies are the right ones. And I have to commend the people at our operating companies and our service companies. They are executing with high fidelity to the strategies, with high focus and high alignment. And I think that's why the results are what they are. So look, there's always risks to the business. You know what they are. I mean, you've got regulation and taxes and the like. But I wouldn't call out anything of the sort that you're asking about, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Spielman with Citi.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Question. If I can come back to the deeming regs, and in particular two questions. First of all, you said you're in conversation about trying to change aspects of them. And I wonder if you could just highlight what you are most keen to change that you think there's a realistic chance that the FDA will listen to what you're saying and actually change how they're approaching deeming?","And the second question is this. Reynolds has said that they believe based on Mitch Zeller's comments about continue of risk, that they're seeing some ways they may take a more relaxed approach to pre-market approvals for e-vapor products than they have done, it would seem, with cigarettes. And I guess the related to question to that is, do you agree with that? And do you think those will be a difference in degree of let's say, harshness of interpretation of cigars and e-vapor products? Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks for the questions. I'll give you an example on your first question, which is predicate date. We had argued to the FDA and advocated to the FDA, as did many others, that it made little sense to go back and use a cigarette predicate date of 2007 for products that basically came into the marketplace after 2007. So...","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Yep.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...there continues to be a lot of dialogue about that. It's not limited to the FDA. You know that there are legislative proposals pending. And so I think a lot of people think that it would be wise to revisit that question. We certainly do. And you may have heard the conversation we had earlier about encouraging innovation. Using that predicate date, to us, does not seem to do that.","So that's one area. With respect to PMTAs, I'm not familiar with the conversation you referenced with someone else, but I can tell you that it would seem to make sense that for pre-market approvals, you certainly if you were the regulator, ought to be taking into account the degree of harm of the products. And so cigarettes, as we all know, bear a high degree of risk and while the evidence is not completely in, it appears to be that, because they don't burn, e-vapor probably has a lower risk. That, of course, ought to be taken into account in approving whether they should come to market. So that would seem to be a sensible approach. I think that's a development that would be good for consumers and for manufacturers and for public health.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you very much. Can I just come back? I do understand that Congress may change the predicate date, but assuming they don't, do you think there's any realistic chance that a dialogue other than via Congress or maybe through litigation will actually alter that date?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I hope so. Listen, FDA has a job to do. We have found them to be open to listening to reasonable arguments. But at the end of the day, Adam, it's up to them. But we have not found them to be immune from listening to points of view and hopefully coming to some reasoned judgment on it. Particularly if other stakeholders besides us weigh in on it, as I understand is the case.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks for those questions.","Operator","We will now also open the call for media questions. With no further questions, I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Sarah Knakmuhs for closing remarks.","Sarah Fitzgerald Knakmuhs - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, everyone, for joining our call this morning.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.","William Marshall - Altria Client Services Inc","Thank you, Laurie. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're here this morning with Howard Willard, Altria's CEO, and Billy Gifford, Altria's CFO, to discuss Altria's 2018 second quarter and first half business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing these results, which is available on our website at altria.com and through the Altria Investor app.","During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2017. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements, and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Howard.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.","We continued our strong start to the year with adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 18.8% in the second quarter. Our core tobacco businesses performed well, as they continued to make strategic investments in support of their long-term objectives. Of course, our results benefited from a lower corporate tax rate. We continued to reward shareholders in the quarter by paying over $1.3 billion in dividends and repurchasing approximately $437 million in shares.","This is a dynamic time in the tobacco industry, and just as we lead in traditional tobacco products, we intend to lead in offering adult smokers more choices with innovative reduced-risk products. In May, we announced a new corporate structure to maximize our core tobacco businesses and accelerate our innovation pipeline. We believe that our new structure will enhance our ability to drive the change necessary for us to continue our success in the future.","Let's move now to our operating segments. Our strategy in the smokeable products segment remains to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro and Black & Mild over time. So far in 2018, we are pleased with the performance of the smokeable products segment. Adjusted operating companies income declined 2.8% in the second quarter and 2.4% in the first half, as expected, given our investments. PM USA entered the year focused on stabilizing Marlboro with investments in product expansions, packaging innovations, and brand equity. We are encouraged with our progress in the first half, as Marlboro market share increased 0.1 share point to 43.2% from the fourth quarter of 2017. PM USA is successfully executing its strategy, which resulted in strong smokeable segment net price realization of 6.6% and 5.6% in the second quarter and first half respectively.","We estimate that when adjusted for the significant trade inventory movements, the smokeable segment's cigarette volumes declined an estimated 5% in the second quarter compared to an estimated industry rate of decline of 3.5%. This is consistent with our view that industry volume declines would moderate as the effects of the California SET were fully lapped.","While industry performance may be volatile on a quarterly basis, over the past four quarters the industry's rate of decline was approximately 4%, consistent with the historical long-term decline rate of 3% to 4%. We believe the adult tobacco consumers' economic situation remains positive, and we continue to closely watch the many economic factors, including gas prices and wage growth, that could affect their spending habits.","In the smokeless products segment, USSTC delivered adjusted operating companies income growth of 3.5% in the second quarter and 13.5% in the first half. In the first half, business fundamentals were quite robust, with strong profit growth and net price realization. Copenhagen and Skoal combined gained 0.2 share point from the fourth quarter of 2017.","As for volume, USSTC believes that smokeless industry volume growth continues to be affected by adult tobacco consumers moving among tobacco product categories. USSTC estimates that over the past six months, the smokeless products segment adjusted shipment volume declined an estimated 1.5% and smokeless industry volume declined an estimated 1%.","You'll recall USSTC submitted its modified risk tobacco product application for Copenhagen Snuff in March, and earlier this month USSTC submitted premarket tobacco applications for VERVE Discs and Chews, innovative oral tobacco products that offer adult smokers a discrete choice to get tobacco enjoyment almost anywhere when smoking is not an option.","In e-vapor, Nu Mark grew volume by approximately 16% in the quarter, and 23% for the first half, primarily driven by expanded distribution. Most recently, Nu Mark expanded MarkTen Elite from over 6,000 stores in the first quarter to more than 23,000 stores by the end of the second quarter.","In heated tobacco, PM USA's initial lead market plans are ready. And upon FDA authorization, PM USA can begin importing IQOS into the U.S. While this will create a two to three-month period between FDA authorization and availability at retail, PM USA will take advantage of that time to activate its marketing plan, which will use a range of tools to build adult smoker awareness and demand in the lead market while gaining key insights for subsequent market expansion.","Now, a brief update on regulatory items. You'll recall that in the first quarter, the FDA published three advanced notices of proposed rulemaking. Earlier this month, we submitted our comments on each of these ANPRMs, and they're available for review on altria.com. As we've said before, we believe we're in the early stages of a long-term process in which we will remain actively engaged.","In summary, we had a great first half of the year and believe we are well-positioned for the second half. We remain positive on our core tobacco business fundamentals and believe macroeconomic factors remain supportive of adult tobacco consumers. And we continue to make strategic investments to support long-term strength in our core tobacco businesses and our pursuit of leadership in innovative products.","In light of a strong first half and continued confidence in our core tobacco businesses, earlier this morning we tightened our guidance, raising the lower end of our full-year 2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, which is now $3.94 to $4.03, representing a growth rate of 16% to 19% from 2017.","I'll now turn it over to Billy to provide more detail on our quarterly performance.","William F. Gifford, Jr. - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Howard, and good morning, everyone.","Let's begin with our smokeable products segment. In the second quarter, adjusted OCI decreased 2.8% and adjusted OCI margins increased 1.1 percentage points to 52.6%. Results were driven by lower cigarette volume, partially offset by higher pricing and lower promotional investments.","Reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 10.8% in the quarter, permanently driven by a large reduction in trade inventories. As you can see in our housekeeping items, the trade entered the second quarter with significantly higher cigarette inventories than it did last year. Over the course of the quarter, wholesalers depleted PM USA inventories by an estimated 1.6 billion units, compared to a build of 600 million units in the year ago quarter. While there can be volatility quarter to quarter, inventory movements typically smooth out over time.","Looking ahead, we are monitoring the effects on the cigarette category from the excise tax increases in Kentucky and Oklahoma, which each went into effect on July 1. On a combined basis, these two states account for roughly 5% of U.S. cigarette industry volume, and Marlboro over-indexes with retail share, exceeding 50% in both states.","As Howard mentioned, Marlboro's retail share was up a tenth of a share point from the fourth quarter of 2017. And we believe PM USA's investments in the first half have helped stabilize Marlboro. For example, in the first quarter, PM USA expanded Marlboro Ice nationally. We're encouraged by performance in the menthol segment. PM USA is pursuing options to adopt Marlboro Ice's innovative resale pack on other offerings in its portfolio.","Additionally, Marlboro's Points West rewards program in Texas continued its early success by increasing Marlboro's digital engagement with adult smokers. Specifically, unique logins on Marlboro.com increased over 65% year-over-year in the State of Texas. Points West continues to exceed expectations, and we believe it will grow equity and loyalty among adult smokers.","In the super-premium tobacco and water segment, Nat Sherman continues to build awareness and trial in Colorado, and we remain pleased with its performance. As a result, Nat Sherman expanded Nat's into 13 additional states across the Western U.S. in mid-June. In cigars, the business continues to perform well, as reported shipment volume grew 2.7% in the second quarter and 2.8% for the first half.","Turning to our smokeless products segment, in the second quarter, USSTC grew adjusted OCI 3.5%, and adjusted OCI margins expanded 0.5 percentage points to 69.9%. These results were primarily driven by higher pricing, partially offset by lower volume. In the second quarter, USSTC's retail share declined two-tenths of a share point. Copenhagen's retail share remained unchanged at 34.3%, and Skoal's retail share declined 0.4 share points to 16.4%.","Turning to our alcohol assets, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI 8% in the second quarter, driven by higher volume and favorable mix, partially offset by higher marketing and sales expenses. In beer, adjusted earnings from our equity investment in AB InBev were $156 million in the second quarter, which reflects Altria's share of AB InBev's first quarter results.","We continued to reward shareholders by returning significant cash to them through dividends and share repurchases. In the second quarter and first half of 2018, we paid dividends to shareholders of $1.3 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. Altria's current annualized dividend rate of $2.80 per share represents an annualized dividend yield of 4.9% as of July 20, 2018, which compares to a 2.9% yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury.","We also repurchased approximately 7.6 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $57.65 for a total cost of approximately $437 million. Through the first half of 2018, we repurchased approximately 15.6 million shares for a total cost of $950 million. In May, the board authorized a $1 billion expansion to the share repurchase program, and at the end of the second quarter, we had slightly more than $1 billion remaining in the current $2 billion repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of the second quarter of 2019.","With that, we'll wrap up, and Howard and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory, and other housekeeping items. Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Investors, analysts, and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I have a question on Marlboro. I guess I was hoping you could drill down a bit further to help us understand if some of the changes you made in the market earlier this year in terms of your promotional programs behind the brand are working. And then it appears there are some signs of stabilization already, but what's your outlook for the remainder of the year for the brand? And then do you guys have anything else in the pipeline to further improve the equity?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I think if you look at the investments we made in the first half of this year behind Marlboro, probably the most significant one was the launch of Marlboro Ice, with an innovative package design. And that was launched at the Marlboro full price, although with some promotional offerings to drive trial. In addition to that, we've made some adjustments to our trade programs and improved the visibility of the brand at retail.","So, I think we were quite pleased to see Marlboro up a tenth in the first half compared to fourth quarter, and we continue to believe we'll have plenty of activity in the second half of the year to continue with that stable to up trend on Marlboro.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then just a quick follow-on to that, in terms of the spending levels, Howard, how should we think about that just in terms of what you guys have got behind the brand in the first half? Do you expect those spending levels to ease as we head into the second half of this year? Or will they stay elevated?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, I think as we look at the investments we've made behind the brand, I think we communicated that we plan to invest about a third of the tax reform benefit this year in a variety of investments, many of those in the innovative products segment, but certainly Marlboro received some of those investments. And we really expect those to roll out throughout the year. One thing I would point out though is that if you look at price realization on the smokeable segment in the first half, price realization was up about 5.6%. So, we had strong pricing, and I think that reflects the fact that although there was some trial offering on Marlboro Ice, overall, the price trend on Marlboro in the first half was quite positive.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then switching over to IQOS, and just maybe any update on timing of approval. I know you touched on this, but it just seems like you might think it could be any day now based on your remarks. And I guess I'm also suggesting this, and I'm aware that you guys have been certainly trying to secure additional shelf space at retail. So, I'd like to hear it from you how you think these efforts have gone, and then are you getting the space you need for IQOS? And has it been mainly incremental?","And then finally on this topic, I just would like to hear how you guys are thinking about the rollout of IQOS, now that BAT just received substantial equivalent approval from the FDA for their Eclipse heat-not-burn product. So, just wondering how you think about the positioning of IQOS relative to that brand, and are you concerned at all that IQOS may lose its first-mover advantage?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I'll start off with the fact that we have been ready for quite some time to launch IQOS into the U.S. market, and we are really just waiting for FDA approval. And as is often the case with FDA, they move at their own pace. So, I don't know that we can make a good forecast of that, but we certainly have taken advantage of the time we've had to make sure that we've got a very solid launch plan for IQOS in the U.S. market. We've been learning from all of the experiences that PMI has had overseas, and we will be ready with a very compelling marketing offering in the marketplace.","You are right that we have been contracting to gain additional space for innovative products at retail. And certainly that space would be available for IQOS, for e-vapor, and for a range of other innovative products we're bringing to the marketplace. We think that would give us plenty of room to display the portfolio of products that we have in the marketplace, and we've been quite pleased with our success in securing that space.","I did read in the BAT announcement about the SE they got on what I guess is an improved version of the Reynolds product. And I think in some respects, probably there's some benefit to having a number of different heated tobacco products in the market. And I have to tell you, given the success that the IQOS heat-not-burn format has had around the world, I'm happy to compete in the market with IQOS against that BAT product. And we're just eager for the opportunity to begin marketing.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks, and then just one final quick question for me on your guidance. The revised guidance certainly suggests you have increased visibility for the year, but I'm curious if you still expect that your EPS growth rates in FY 2019 and 2020 will be above your long-term 7% to 9% EPS growth aspirations, as you stated earlier this year. Thanks.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","At this point, there's no change to that expectation.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Michael.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Could you just give us an update on any potential tariff impact, either on your vapor products or, obviously IQOS isn't yet approved for launch. Would there be anything on the devices or potentially the Heatsticks there that we should have in mind?","William F. Gifford, Jr. - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Michael. From a tariff impact, we've had minor impacts from tariffs. I would call it clearly immaterial. We are monitoring to see if it's going to expand to any of the other categories, some of those that you mentioned, but we don't see any expectations at this point. So really, from a tariff to date, it's very immaterial to our business.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, great, thanks. And on the state settlements, I just want to make sure I understand a couple things correctly. It looks like you're excluding those benefits from your adjusted earnings, but you're getting the cash. Roughly it seems like around $225 million. Is that the correct starting point?","William F. Gifford, Jr. - Altria Group, Inc.","You're in the right range there, Michael. We try to exclude the benefits that were related to previous years, and so that's the exclusion you see between adjusted and reported earnings.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","And I know there are quite a few states in there, and they may vary one to another. But does that close the books on all of those, or do those states still have any disputed amounts that could potentially lead to future additional settlements?","William F. Gifford, Jr. - Altria Group, Inc.","That catches us up-to-date, Michael, for those that we've settled with. So that takes the total to, if you include states and territories, to 36. Arbitration process has started for those that are non-settling states, but there would be additional years potential for those that have settled thus far.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just a last one, could you give any sense of now at the beginning of this quarter, we had fully lapped the California tax hike. Can you give any sense of just sequential momentum throughout the quarter, or maybe how the volume trajectory has been progressing and just what it may look like today?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I think you're probably referencing that the cigarette category decline rate in the first quarter was about 5.5% on an adjusted basis for the industry, and in the second quarter, it was 3.5%. I think probably the biggest driver of that was, as you said, we lapped the California state excise tax increase. And I think that this was a fairly solid trend through the second quarter, and I think it was to be expected, although it's a bit complex because you've got the lapping of the California state excise tax increase. You've got generally a positive environment for adult tobacco consumers, but you do have gas prices up over 10%. And then you've got growth in the e-vapor category. But I think the best way to look at the overall impact of that is to look at the adjusted 3.5% decline number.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's helpful. Just to clarify, within the quarter, was there any notable sequential evolution, or was it roughly steady close to that 3.5%?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","I don't know that we pay that close attention to week-to-week variations, but I think the 3.5% down for the quarter I think represented the trend well from the second quarter to the first.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you very much.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Pamela.","Pamela F. Kaufman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for the question. I was wondering if you can talk about the acceleration in the e-cig category, and to what extent you think that JUUL's growth is coming from cigarette volumes. BAT mentioned today that they think there was around a 40 basis point impact to industry volumes from e-vapor in the first half. What's your estimate, and do you think that this impact is going to grow?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I don't know that we have the information to make that precise a calculation. But clearly in mainstream retail channels, the e-vapor category has returned to very strong growth. I think what makes it a bigger challenge to gauge its impact on the cigarette category is that, unlike most of the other tobacco product categories, most of the volume in the e-vapor category falls in vape stores and on e-commerce that are less well measured. And so I think that some of the growth in mainstream retail channels likely represents cannibalization in those other channels.","And then I think the second impact or the second thing to consider is that as part of the secular decline rate that makes up this long-term 3% to 4% decline, we normally view the secular decline rate as a 2% to 3% decline. That includes consumers that moved to other tobacco categories from cigarettes. It includes people that stopped tobacco products altogether, and it includes changes in their consumption in number of sticks per day.","So, there's always a certain amount of movement between categories in that secular decline rate. And so, the real question here is, is there an abnormal amount of impact on the secular decline rate? And I think given the 3.5% decline for the cigarette category in the second quarter, I think it seems to be covered by that long-term decline trend.","Pamela F. Kaufman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you. And just another question, I was wondering, what the disconnect is between what we're seeing in measured channel data, where Altria's volumes and market share are outperforming the industry versus what we are seeing in your reported results? Does that imply that we're seeing elevated weakness in non-measured channels that's contributing to the higher declines in your reported numbers?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","I think the best way to judge the way our business is performing over time is to rely on the IRI numbers that we generate and share in our quarterly earnings release. We have a custom IRI panel that is designed to accurately predict and project activity in any given quarter in mainstream retail channels. And of course, we go to great care to make sure that IRI has access to the new products we put in the market, any promotional activity. So, I think that's the best read.","I know that there are some less complete services that others look at, but I think when we looked at it this quarter, certainly there are always differences. And frankly, sometimes those differences benefit the trends for our business, sometimes they don't. But I think our view is the best gauge of the success of our business is what we report in our quarterly earnings release, and we go to great care to make sure the year-over-year comparisons are fair.","Pamela F. Kaufman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. First I have a question, Howard, in relation to the inventory movements. I feel compelled to ask about that at least. But I know it's going to happen from quarter-to-quarter. I'm just curious, as you see inventory levels now, do you regard them to be at the right levels, if you will? They obviously are below the year ago. You had a larger decline than the category overall. So, I'm just curious if you could characterize the inventory levels overall?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","I'll turn that over to Billy.","William F. Gifford, Jr. - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, Chris, you're right. I think it was exacerbated in the second quarter. As I mentioned, we saw depletions of 1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2018, and the opposite was taking place in 2017. They built inventories by 600 million. I think there are a number of different strategies that wholesalers and retailers use to manage their inventories.","So that causes, to your point, distortions in the short-term. I think if you look over a longer-term period, you'll see that inventories are generally in line with consumer consumption. And so, I would encourage us to look over a longer period of time to really gauge where inventories are. You're right. Inventories are at the lower end as we ended the second quarter.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then just a question for you on that, and you'd given some information in your release about the deep discount share growing and discount overall though, just growing modestly. It seems like L&M is getting caught up in that and then performed poorly in the quarter. I just was curious how you're addressing that. If there's any actions you've taken to address that shift in share amongst the discount segment?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I would say we are addressing that L&M weakness in a measured way. I think it's helpful actually to go back and look at the discount category trends over a longer period of time, and I went back to 2011, which is the year before we launched the new Marlboro architecture. And if you look at first half trends in the discount category from 2011 to today, we've had growth of over a share point in our discount share, and that was really all driven by L&M. And the discount category is down over a share point over that period of time. What has happened more recently is that the overall discount category, I would say is stable. If you wanted to find a tick-up, it's up a tenth in the first half of this year compared to 2017, but I don't think that's a significant move.","Really, the only news you can find I think in the discount category is that during that time period, branded discount gave up four-tenths and deep discount picked up five-tenths. And certainly, some of that share that branded discount loss came from L&M in this very short-term period. But I think to understand that, you have to consider two things, which is the margins on the branded discount products, which continue to make up the majority of the share in discount, have improved quite a bit since 2011, which is a real positive. And then secondly, while the economic situation is generally positive for adult tobacco consumers, it is being somewhat unevenly distributed, and I think there are some consumers that continue to be under economic pressure. And it's not surprising that a few of them are finding value in the deep discount, cheapest cigarettes in the store.","I think our view is that first and foremost, we're pleased that the overall category is flat and it's healthy for premium brands, given our focus on Marlboro and on Nat's. And then secondly, I think we like the margin on L&M. So, we'll monitor it, but I don't think there's any significant action we feel is necessary. We're doing it more by making small adjustments on a state by state basis.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that color.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, following up on that theme, it's interesting that the cigarette industry volume declines are normal I think. Very encouraging to see that. That said, like you are seeing the deterioration in MST. So, is it your view that there's more kind of cross-elasticity of demand between some traditional tobacco categories relative to others? I'm just still trying to make sense of those diverging trends. Thanks.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","I think you are right. You used to have a smokeless segment that was growing, call it 4% to 5%, and now the category is flat to slightly down. I think probably the first driver of that is that there has been more price increase in the category over the last couple of years than there was previously. And just like there's a price elasticity in cigarettes, there also is in smokeless. So, that is certainly one driver.","But then I would say the second driver, I think, is that if you go back five or six years, I think that the primary beneficiary of adult cigarette smokers moving out of cigarettes to alternative products was probably the smokeless category. And I think now that you have the e-vapor category that's got some new product options and is back in growth, I think that category potentially is intercepting some consumers that, in the past, would have gone to smokeless.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Perfect, that's helpful. Thank you. And I heard your message on the IRI, but unfortunately, I subscribe to Nielsen. And so, when we're looking at the category price elasticity on combustible cigarettes, that data looks like it's deteriorating. So, can you comment on what you've been seeing in terms of cigarette price elasticities? Thanks.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I'll hand it over to Billy, who I think is familiar with the number. And it sounds like you may be actually referencing relative pricing and mix, but we can certainly address any question about elasticity as well.","William F. Gifford, Jr. - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, just to answer your question on elasticity right away, we see it's unchanged at this point. It's the negative 0.3 that we've quoted for quite a while, and that's been in place for well over 10 years. I think when you look at retail, there are a number of things that are moving price at retail. You have excise taxes in the prior period that don't repeat in this period. I think sample differences can cause that. So, we try to go right to the \u2013 our detailed information, and we're seeing it hold at negative 0.3.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. The question is on just helping dissect the delta between the Marlboro volume declines and the industry volume declines. Just trying to get better perspective on what you think is driving that disconnect, just so we can understand kind of the future and forward drivers. That's the first question.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, I mean I think the explanation of the category being down on an adjusted basis 3.5% and us being down more than that is quite simply the fact that on a year-over-year basis, second quarter this year compared to last year, Marlboro did lose some share. But when you look at our share trends in the first half compared to fourth quarter, we're up a tenth of a share point. And I think if you run the math, the share difference really explains the difference between our smokeable segment's decline rate versus the adjusted number for the industry.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's a fair point, Howard. I'm just trying to understand, like was it the excise taxes, I mean, as you kind of look at the business and try to understand why the share losses occurred? That's what I'm trying to get at just some of the drivers? Was it the new excise taxes? Are you more sensitive to gas prices than maybe some of your competitors? I'm just trying to get a little bit more context around that.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I'm sorry. I understand your question now. I think if you look at last year, after a number of years of modest positive share growth, Marlboro's share had a tough time last year. And I think there were really two primary drivers of that. The first was the California state excise tax increase. And while that impacted all of the premium brands and all the brands in the market, it was a large excise tax increase at $2, and it was in a geography, where Marlboro was significantly overdeveloped. So, it had a greater impact on Marlboro, which essentially impacted Marlboro's share trend last year.","And then the second driver of that was that we had a heightened level of competitive activity and competitive spending last year that we decided to be more restrained in responding to, with the knowledge that we knew we had a good first half and full year plan for this year. So, we gave up some share last year. You'll recall that while we gave up some share, we had quite strong profit growth and price realization in the smokeable segment, and essentially, we decided to really make our investments to stabilize Marlboro in the first half, which we're pleased has come through.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, Howard, for that. And then the second question, just maybe you can give us an update on some of the e-vapor products. I know you said it grew 16%, but just trying to get an understanding of maybe some of the consumer metrics behind MarkTen Bold and MarkTen Elite.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I think there's some insight in the way you asked the question. If you look at it, the primary products that we have in distribution at retail in large numbers of stores are the Original MarkTen, the MarkTen Bold product with nicotine salts, and then MarkTen Elite. The drivers of the growth in second quarter and first half was MarkTen Bold and MarkTen Elite. So those products are getting traction with consumers, albeit in the shadow of a product that's growing much more quickly. And then we continue to focus on some of the other products in our pipeline, but they are not distributed in retail in any significant numbers.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, Howard.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So I wanted to go back to the e-vapor category and just wanted to get your assessment in terms of what you're seeing from JUUL, because I guess in the past when you talked about the brand leadership in that category, you've talked about how that cycle is pretty short. You've got new product coming into the category, and that leadership changes pretty quickly. Clearly, that brand has maintained very strong momentum, getting distribution gains as well, and velocity is still very high.","So I'm just wondering, from your perspective, how would you characterize that brand's leadership and the sustainability of that leadership versus some of the prior products in that category? And what data points would you be watching to gauge how much it's impacting the Marlboro's performance or just the combustible business in general?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. There's no question JUUL has had a strong performance with regard to volume growth in mainstream retail channels in the first half, and you are right that this has happened before. I'd reference back to \u2013 I call this the third growth phase of e-vapor in the U.S. The first growth phase was in 2013 and the second was in 2014. Both of those growth phases were driven by new, different products being offered into the market, and they went through a period of very strong trial, and then ultimately, consumers that tried them sorted themselves out. Many went back to their traditional cigarette product, and then some decided to continue to dual use or switch to those e-vapor products.","Actually, interestingly enough, the amount of growth that happened in 2014 seems to line up with the rapid growth that's happening in 2018 if you look at it on a number of pods or number of milliliter basis. And I think this growth phase is really depending on whether you measure it either two quarters in or three quarters in. So I think based on historical patterns, if it follows, you'd expect that it could have some more room to run here through the end of the year.","I think the best indication of its impact on the cigarette category is to look at the adjusted cigarette decline rate of 3.5% in the second quarter. And I would note that during the prior two growth phases for e-vapor, you had in both of those years a 4% decline in the cigarette category, albeit the smokeless category was growing at a higher rate, 2.5% and 5% respectively. So I think there's a fair amount of room in the secular decline rate that makes up that 3% to 4% decline for there to be growth in some of the smaller alternative product categories.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then just following up on an earlier question about the investment spending, and I know you gave some high-level color just in terms of some of the initiatives that you have planned to do and have done so far. But I guess in terms of maybe timing of some of the spending, first half versus second half, would there be any big difference in terms of the phasing? And then the nature of the investment, so combustible versus the new products versus at a brand level, would there be any big differences in terms of the first half versus second half spending phasing?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","I don't think there's been real significant change in our spending plans or our phasing since we announced it earlier in the year. We're making investments in our smokeable segment and in our smokeless segment. Certainly in smokeable, the Marlboro Ice launch was included in that. And then we've made equity investments in both smokeable and smokeless in the first half.","We've also invested in some of the expansions of our innovative products. I mentioned in the release that we've expanded VERVE into some test markets, and of course we've expanded our MarkTen Elite product. And then we've got a significant amount of scientific activity going on to support future applications to the FDA.","The only thing I think is worth calling out from a timing perspective is that we did include in our investment plans for this year the lead market launch of IQOS. And that is obviously FDA approval dependent. So we'll have to wait and see how that develops in the second half.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And just quickly on the IQOS, Howard, you talked about the two to three-month lag once you get the FDA approval to the lead market launch. So I'm just wondering what that lag is.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","It really involves the time necessary in order to ship the product over, get it through customs, get it tax stamped, and get it distributed to the stores. And while on the surface it might feel like optimally you'd like to go faster, it actually turns out that given that we can't communicate about the product until it receives FDA approval, actually having a couple of months to build awareness and to do some early trial on that product, we find that actually hits the sweet spot to make sure that as we have the product available \u2013 full availability at retail, that there's significant awareness and significant demand for the product. And of course, we'll communicate through traditional mass communication vehicles as well as through digital.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you for taking the question. Can I just follow up to make sure I've understood the last answer to Judy's questions? I think what you were implying, and I want to check this, is if for whatever reason the FDA does not grant approval for IQOS this year, that would actually result in, let's say, a positive surprise for you in terms of profit because you wouldn't be spending marketing dollars you were otherwise budgeting for that I guess would move you towards the upper end of your EPS guidance.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","I think you are right that we have some dollars allocated in this year to the IQOS launch. But of course, every year, we have a number of puts and takes that result in the number we ultimately deliver. But certainly, if IQOS was not approved by the end of the year, that would be a positive variance that we would put into the kitty with other changes in deciding where to end the year from a profit growth perspective.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay, thank you very much. And I just wanted to follow up on this, your marketing plans. You've said that they're broadly unchanged, and I'm talking about the sort of equity building and the rolling out of Ice in terms of first half, second half split. But the question is, is there anything that we should be aware of that is either going to accelerate or decelerate in the second half versus the first half? I mean, for example, it might be that you're expecting much more in terms of promotions behind Ice or maybe less. I was just wondering how your marketing plans I guess differ in the two halves?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I think if you're talking about the smokeable products segment, I wouldn't call out a significantly different level of investment in the back half of the year than in the front half of the year. I think that the initial trial promotions for Ice have largely run their course. And anytime you launch a new brand, in the third and fourth quarters of that brand launch, you are going to have some level of trial promotion. But typically it steps down from the initial launch. So, I think that we'll have a fairly normal distribution of marketing resources across the core businesses this year.","The only thing I would call out that is a back half impact is that we're going to have excise tax increases that take a place on July 1 in Oklahoma and Kentucky. And while those excise tax increases are substantially less of an increase than we had in California, and they don't have the volume that we had in California, they do happen to be two other states that Marlboro's overdeveloped in. So, there'll be a little bit of pressure I think on Marlboro in the third quarter, but we continue to feel good about our performance in the back half.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","And then one final question for me: If you look at Marlboro Ice's performance now and compare it with your plans you had when you launched it last year, is it in line with those plans, little bit better, little bit worse?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","To be specific, we launched Marlboro Ice in the first quarter of this year, so we've really got two quarters' worth of information. And I would say Marlboro Ice is largely on plan, and we're very pleased with its performance. And I think it was driven by the fact that I think it's a nice new Marlboro offering in a menthol category that has been growing. And I have to tell you that the innovative reseal pack has been well received by consumers. So, we would mark this up as a success for the Marlboro brand launch.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I guess, first just going back quickly to the topic of inventory rebalancing, I think you mostly addressed it before, Billy, but just to be specific, was there any particular reason that you see for why the trade decided to run inventories down as low as it did this quarter? Is there any specific driver that you can point to, or is it just normal, if outsized volatility?","William F. Gifford, Jr. - Altria Group, Inc.","I think it's just normal outsized volatility. If you look over prior years, you'll see periods of times where inventories run up and periods of times where inventories run down.","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just to be clear, I'm assuming you expect the roughly 2 points or so, the 2-point gap between shipments and whatever rate of underlying demand is established in the second half. You expect that to close. Is that correct?","William F. Gifford, Jr. - Altria Group, Inc.","I think based on what I said earlier, if you look through time, inventories tend to follow consumer consumption, and so you would see a balance through time.","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then look, I guess just stepping back, as you said in the opening remarks, there's been a ton of development this quarter from a regulatory perspective. But I actually wanted to ask your opinion on about two things that have happened more at the local level versus the federal level in the quarter. First is just the flavors ban in San Francisco that was passed in June. And the second, which I guess is outside the quarter, but the recent Attorney General investigation in Massachusetts into JUUL. I'd just love your thoughts on both as the potential precedents.","And on the latter, just to be clear, I don't expect you to comment on a competitor situation specifically, but I am interested in your views as to what implications such an action might have indirectly on the e-vapor category broadly or even on your MarkTen business specifically?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I'll start with the San Francisco flavor ban. What we have found is that there is some low level of activity in various localities and occasionally a city that is at odds with the general trend at the federal and state level. And that's really how I would frame that San Francisco flavor ban. I think it's more of an aberration than it is the beginning of a trend. But it would not surprise me if you had a handful of other localities or cities that are particularly anti-tobacco take up that activity. But I wouldn't expect it to get much traction on a larger scale.","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then as to what the Attorney General is doing or may do in Massachusetts, as it relates to e-vapor?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I think what we're seeing is that for quite some time, the tobacco industry has been expected to operate under a very specific set of rules, and the Master Settlement Agreement laid those out for the cigarette category. But frankly, as we've expanded into other categories, we've always had a significant focus on making sure that we market only to adult tobacco consumers, and that we minimize unintended reach of our marketing to folks that are non-smokers. And we are always aware that the FDA and the Attorneys General are watching everything we do to make sure we're operating responsibly. And I think that we think that has resulted in a category where the level of marketing that is seen by non-tobacco users has come down dramatically. And of course, youth smoking rates are at all-time lows.","I think that that is the way any responsible tobacco company needs to operate in the U.S. And I think that the AGs, who monitor marketing activity and all other tobacco activity across the country, I think don't hesitate to reach out to tobacco manufacturers if they think they're not operating against the basic rules of the industry.","And so, I can't specifically comment on the details of the action in Massachusetts, but I think as an experienced player in the category, we're not surprised, and frankly, we appreciate the AGs making sure that there's a minimum level of performance expected from everybody in the industry.","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Petros Voulgaris of Goldman Sachs.","Petros Voulgaris - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Petros Voulgaris - Goldman Sachs","So, just a few related questions I just want to throw out. Since IQOS isn't going to be sold as a cigarette, is not having IQOS in the MSA something you're going to pursue with the regulators? Or would you pursue a separate MSA for IQOS? And as a follow-up, can IQOS in an updated iteration of the product not be considered eligible for inclusion in the MSA?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. To be clear, based on the definitions of a cigarette in the U.S., our belief is when we enter the market with IQOS, IQOS will be classified as a cigarette under the federal definition and most state definitions. So, it will incur MSA payments and excise tax payments for the Heatsticks as a cigarette. But I think you do bring up the fact that when you look at the performance characteristics of the IQOS Heatstick used in the IQOS device, and you compare it to a cigarette, there's significant differences that we think would warrant a lower excise tax in order to encourage people to use the IQOS system versus a traditional cigarette. And we've been pursuing that with the governmental authorities primarily by saying, for any product that gets an MRTP, we try and get a lower state excise tax rate. We've had success in a couple of states.","But I think as it enters the market, unlike the case that PMI has had in many international markets around the world, where it's been classified in its own tax classification category, at least at the beginning, that will not be the case in the U.S.","Petros Voulgaris - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Howard A.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Marshall (00:40), Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.","Unverified Participant","Thank you, Lori. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria's CEO; and Billy Gifford, Altria's CFO, to discuss Altria's 2017 third quarter and first nine months business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing these results, which is available on our website at altria.com and through the Altria investor app. During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2016.","Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statement section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board.","The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both the reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affects the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Bill (01:59). Good morning, everybody. Altria delivered outstanding financial performance in the third quarter contributing to a strong first nine months of 2017. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share of 9.8% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first nine months. As we expected, our earnings growth is accelerating as we move through the second half of the year. We continue to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase as Billy will describe in more detail, and in August, our board of directors voted to increase our quarterly dividend by 8.2%, and that's the 51st increase in the past 48 years.","Our core tobacco businesses were the primary drivers of our earnings growth. In the quarter, the smokeable products segment delivered 7.7%, adjusted operating company's income growth, a strong pricing and lower cost more than offset volume declines.","For the first nine months, smokeable products segment adjusted operating company's income grew 7.4%. Reported cigarette volumes were challenged in the quarter due to the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and one fewer shipping day. We're very pleased with the financial performance in the smokeable segment.","Our strategy continues to be to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro and Black & Mild over the long-term. As you know, we view momentum has continued strength across various brand metrics including equity, demographics, profitability and retail share. Marlboro continues to have category-leading equity, strong demographics and is, of course, highly profitable.","As for retail share, Marlboro declined by 0.5 share point to 43.2% in the quarter and 0.3 for the first nine months to 43.4%. So let's look at what's happening here beginning with California.","As we described in the second quarter call, we expected the dynamics related to the California $2-per-pack SCT increase to dampen Marlboro's share through the back half and that's continuing to happen. You are familiar with Marlboro's over-indexed share in California at over 50%, and Marlboro thus continues to experience disproportionate share impact during this period due to the SCT increase.","Second, there was elevated competitive activity in the quarter, including high levels of promotional spending and a competitive brand launch. In fact, there have been five such launches by major competitors this year, many with multiple packings behind them. Those launches and the promotional resources accompanying them have increased the short-term share pressure on Marlboro, the share leader.","Share performance is best measured over years, not quarters, of course, but it's important to understand that PM USA is addressing Marlboro's recent share declines. First, it is reallocating certain marketing resources, including in California. These have included changes to promotional resources and product expansions.","For example, PM USA has revised its retail trade programs to focus retailers on the profitability Marlboro brings to their stores. In this process, PM USA has reallocated resources from underperforming retail program options to promotions that support maintaining Marlboro's leadership position.","Second, PM USA recently announced the expansion of Marlboro Black label in California and Washington state. Marlboro Black label features the latest in Marlboro's packaging innovation, its exclusive soft touch technology. We expect these actions to help stabilize Marlboro's share while staying on strategy to maximize income. Look for more product news from PM USA at our Investor Day next week.","Moving to the smokeless product segment. USSTC delivered outstanding adjusted operating company's income growth of 15.7% in the third quarter as higher net pricing and lower costs more than offset lower shipment volume. The smokeless product segment delivered 6.3% adjusted operating company's income growth for the first nine months of 2017.","Copenhagen's retail share grew 0.2% to 33.9% in the third quarter and by 0.6% for the first nine months to 33.6%. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 1.2 share points in the third quarter and 0.9 share points for the first nine months driven by Skoal declines. These results reflect USSTC's continued focus on growing Copenhagen while refining its Skoal investments to enhance its profitability.","In e-vapor, Nu Mark grew MarkTen's third quarter volume by more than 50%, driven by expanded distribution and category growth. MarkTen had a third quarter national retail share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream channels. And Nu Mark recently announced plans to expand the distribution of MarkTen Bold to approximately 15,000 additional stores in the fourth quarter.","In heated tobacco, the team at PM USA has made significant progress on its commercialization plans for IQOS, which we're excited to share with you next week at our Investor Day. Another focus of our Investor Day will be the regulatory environment. As everyone knows, in July, FDA announced its comprehensive plan for U.S. tobacco and nicotine regulation. FDA stated its belief that this approach will strike an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes.","We're encouraged by this important evolution in the agency's stance on innovation, having long advocated for a comprehensive regulatory policy that acknowledges the continuum of risk. We also support FDA's stated intention to issue regulations, outlining what information it expects to be included in product applications and in reports to demonstrate substantial equivalence. Obviously, establishing the rules before any decisions are taken is simple regulatory fairness.","And we further support Commissioner Gottlieb's direction to the Center for Tobacco Products to reconsider its approach to substantial equivalence for provisional products, a process we previously have described as increasingly onerous and expensive.","Finally, FDA also stated its intention to explore a product standard relating to nicotine; a possibility since the act became law in 2009, and for which PM USA has been preparing. As the FDA itself acknowledged, developing such a standard will be a long and complex process requiring significant stakeholder comment and engagement, and again we'll say more about all this next week.","In summary, we're very pleased with our performance through what's been a challenging nine months. Thus, we reaffirm our 2017 full-year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth.","And here's Billy for more detail on our performance.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some further color on the smokeable products segment. Cigarette industry volumes declined an estimated 3.5% in the third quarter. The smokeable products segment's reported cigarette shipment volume declined by 6.2%, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and one fewer shipping day.","When adjusted for inventory movements and calendar differences, PM USA's cigarette shipment volume declined by an estimated 4.5%. The better look is probably the first nine months, where industry cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 3.5% and PM USA's cigarette shipment volume decreased 4% from both a reported and adjusted basis. The cigar business continues to perform extremely well, delivering volume growth of 6.6% in the third quarter and 10.6% for the first nine months.","Smokeable segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 4.5 percentage points to 52.2% in the third quarter, driven by higher pricing and lower SG&A and resolution expense. The favorable cost comparison is driven in part by California ballot spending in the year-ago period and NPM-related credits booked in this quarter. For the first nine months, adjusted OCI margins expanded by 3 percentage points to 51.6%.","In the smokeless products segment, industry volume grew by an estimated 0.5% over the past six months. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that it's adjusted smokeless products shipment volume declined by 3% in the third quarter and 1.5% for the first nine months. Smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins increased by 6.8 percentage points in the quarter to 70.3%, driven primarily by higher net pricing and lower cost, partially offset by unfavorable mix. For the first nine months, smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.6 percentage points to 67.7%, primarily due to higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix.","Turning to our alcohol assets. Wine segment adjusted OCI declined 5.3% in the quarter due primarily to higher cost. Ste. Michelle's volume trends improved in the third quarter relative to the first half and were essentially unchanged compared to the year-ago level. In beer, third quarter adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev were $203 million, reflecting AB InBev's second quarter results which were reported in July.","I'll wrap up by highlighting our cash returns to shareholders. Through the first nine months of 2017, we paid shareholders more than $3.5 billion in dividends and increased the dividend in August. We repurchased nearly $2.4 billion in shares, leaving $576 million in the program as of September 30. We expect to complete the program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.","With that, Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",". Your first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi Chris.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I thought I'd just start with a question for you on California, really on the smokeable business and some of the challenges you had there around elasticity. So I just wanted to understand did you see an improvement in the quarter or do you expect the kind of the consumer to adjust to these price a little more, you'll see less elasticity going forward? And if I could ask related to that, does the new product pipeline from Marlboro, is there more \u2013 it sounds like there's more to come, we'll hear that next week, but just to understand how the new products have been contributing to potential market share improvements for that brand?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. Good questions, both. So we've discussed previously, Chris, that elasticities with respect to cigarettes and we've had big jolts before like the one that we've experienced in California. And what happens is, as you know, there's an immediate disruption and you get a deep decline, and then it comes back to the curve that we've observed over the years, which is about negative 0.3.","So a lot of it depends on how big the shock is California $2 a pack, after not having had an increase for decades, really. So it's coming back. We expect it will come back to where it is on the curve and we see some improvement there. But it's going to take some time. It was a big shock to the system. And you see that in the numbers, I think.","So on Marlboro, we're very pleased actually with Marlboro's product pipeline. You see that what we try to do is we try to bring out SKUs to the market where we think that there's a niche where Marlboro can gain some business from competitive smokers. We're also, frankly, trying to create news in the marketplace about Marlboro to keep its momentum moving forward, and so we're going to talk about this next week. And I mentioned, I think, Black label already in the remarks.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And to just a follow-up for you then on \u2013 you have a larger than expected price increase you put through recently. So I suspect there's some areas you want to invest in, having more pricing coming through. Can you talk about that broadly or perhaps just specifically where you want to invest in some areas that you can fund, perhaps an advance on RRPs or that kind of thing before that may become an opportunity for a launch next year?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. I won't comment too specifically, Chris. But I think we've called out several areas before. We are building a very, very strong competitive advantage in digital marketing and we continue to invest there. We continue to invest in the equity behind our brands. And obviously, as the FDA has now set the new direction with respect to reduced-risk products, you have to make investments there in order to compete effectively. And those are some areas that we obviously have been investing in and expect to invest further.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks for your time this morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, I was hoping you can touch on, please, the evolution of your inventories as well as wholesaler inventories. I recognize that it ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter for a variety of reasons; taxes, price increases, new product launches. But as I look at the absolute levels of inventory in the system, both for you and for the industry as a whole, I don't think I've ever seen numbers this high before. And for your inventories, it's going to be the third quarter of a sequential build. So any color on that would be really helpful. Thanks.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Vivien. Vivien, this is Billy. You're right, the third quarter ended a bit higher than if you look at it on a historical basis. But as you mentioned, when we look at this over a longer period of time, they tend to ebb and flow. It's really when the wholesalers decide to take inventory. At times, it can be when the holiday occurs in a quarter. But again, we expect that to balance out as we move through the rest of the year.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","But anything else that you could offer really because it doesn't seem like it's just a one quarter phenomenon if it's three quarters of sequential increases? I mean it's not quite close to a doubling versus where you were second quarter of 2016.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I guess the only thing I'd add to that, Vivien, has been that the wholesalers have strategies around when they build their inventory in, when they decide to take their inventory down, which they're free, of course, to do.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, that's fair. Then just in terms of Marlboro and perhaps we'll hear more about this when we see you at the Analyst Day, but any incremental color just in terms of the composition of some of the share evolution, either by price segment within the Marlboro brand family or by geography, anything outside of California to call out, perhaps reflecting back on some of the commentary from last quarter's call around some softness in the Rust Belt and the Southeast? Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So I'm glad we're going to see you next week and we are going to talk about Marlboro in some detail there. I think what we would say is you have to assess it in the context of the strategy, which is to maximize income. And so when we look at back at Marlboro shares, we don't decompose it down to the SKU level, despite I know there's quite a lot of interest in that; we don't do it for competitive reasons.","But if we go back to Marlboro share gains, for example, during the period 2011 through 2016, we actually gained ahead of what the historical rate had been. It was about 1.7 percentage points of share gain. And you can see in the first nine months, we've given back about 0.3 share points. So I think the reasons are pretty straightforward. It is California for the reasons we just finished discussing. There were all these competitive launches and then I think there is a market dynamic change, which is \u2013 because of industry consolidation, there are very few brands left, frankly, that don't have marketing support on them.","So Marlboro used to gain share by picking up some of the share from those unprotected brands as did other competitive brands \u2013 that's a market dynamic change. But, overall, I think we're on strategy, particularly when you see the income performance. So we'll talk more about the Marlboro brand family next week. We just don't break it down sort of at the level that you're asking. I hope you can appreciate that.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Certainly, I can. Thank you so much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","My question, I hope you can answer. So if you looked at Marlboro outside California, so the other 49 states, my guess is you've lost market share in the first nine months but to a lesser extent. I was wondering if you can help quantify that since you're trying to get rid of the California effect?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","0.3 share points.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you very much. Secondly, turning to smokeless. You obviously gained margin very strongly. And one of the things you said is in the nine months, it was mainly driven by price increases. But in the final quarter we're talking about \u2013 the third quarter, there were also some cost saves. I was wondering if you could detail that. And also you've given some around color around competition in the smokeable, I was just wondering if you can give some color about the competition in the brand dynamics and what's really happening in smokeless because you haven't so far and I'd really appreciate that.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. Let's try both. So I think one of the principal contributors at the cost line was, remember in the year-ago comp, we had California ballot spending, Adam.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Yeah.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","And that came out obviously in the comp and that was a significant delta in the year-over-year comp.","I would say that the competition in the smokeless side of the business is competitive. We obviously are doing great with Copenhagen. You know our strategy on Copenhagen and Skoal but we have a competitor that's got a brand there, and there were significant promotions in the quarter. I think that accounts for it as well.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for your call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, everyone. It's Rita Joe (22:19) filling in for Judy.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","You're welcome. (22:23)","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. So I have a question on the competitive activity that you're seeing in combustibles. Greatly appreciate the color on the call thus far, but digging a little bit deeper in terms of the increased competitor spending. Has it primarily been related to these new launches or is it behind the core flagship brands and how do you expect some of those competitive dynamics to persist over the next few quarters?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure, let me see if I can help you. I think the answer is, there was quite a lot of activity around new product launches. So we mentioned in our remarks, we've got, I think, five of them over the course of the year, which is higher than we typically see. It's also worth mentioning that it's just not five, there are multiple SKUs with the five, so you actually have a lot of SKUs coming into the marketplace. And as you know, in our category, because of the way we have marketing restrictions is the battle is at retail. People put promotional resources on them, including us, when we do this, to try to promote trial. And when you have smokers who are trying a new product, it puts pressure on the share leader on Marlboro. So that's our diagnosis of what's been happening; that and California, obviously.","Unknown Speaker","Great. And then a follow-up on MarkTen. So the results were pretty positive this quarter, with volume growing more than 50%. So what are your expectations this year for e-vapor category growth? Clearly, it's accelerated a little bit this year versus what we've seen over the past couple of years and what are the plans behind further investment behind the MarkTen franchise?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. So on your last question, I'd invite you \u2013 either Judy will let you come to the Investor Day or you can certainly dial in, we're going to have a lot to say about our vapor business on Investment Day, and we've got exciting plans there. Look, the category has picked back up, as you say. The last number I saw, I think it looks like it's picked up maybe about 8% on a volume basis, higher on a dollar basis because you've got devices obviously which contribute to the dollar sales there. So as the technology gets better in vapor and those products become more acceptable to the consumer, we continue to see high trial and there is some stickiness as the products get better. So I think that's one of our key platforms for our innovative products and we're excited about the chance to continue to grow that business.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks so much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Michael.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","I'm wondering if you could help us just get a sense for some of the timing on any potential IQOS approval. I know that the FDA accepted your PMTA application in August, I believe, and the targeted time from then is, I think, usually it's six months; I don't think they're bound to that. And, if I'm correct, I also think that sort of clock stops, so to speak, if they come back with quick questions and there's a dialogue back and forth which obviously we wouldn't have visibility on. But have you had a lot of interaction like that or what do you think you could give color-wise as far as what we should anticipate?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. First of all, I think the timelines that you called out are correct, and those haven't changed since our last discussion on that. And as you point out, they are nominal, to use that word, I guess, at the FDA. But I think that they're working hard on it; those are PMI applications, of course, it's assisted by us so you may want to speak to them as well about it. But we've been encouraged by the degree of interchange on those applications and I think maybe another milestone to be watching for is if there were to be a TPSAC hearing on the applications, Michael, which as you know, is part of the process. And so PMI, with our assistance, is getting ready for all those things and we are working really hard to be ready so that when that authorization comes, as we hope it does, that we can get to market quickly. But I think your understanding of the process is correct and I don't really have anything new to add except perhaps the possibility of a TPSAC hearing should they announce one.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on the buybacks, you've got a little over I think $750 million in this quarter. You've got an average close to that for the year, and you've got about $570 million something, I think, left in the authorization. Your cash balance relative to the third quarter is above average in the recent history. Would it be reasonable to assume you might conceivably finish ahead of the 2Q 2018 schedule and what would we relatively expect beyond that? I know it's at the discretion of the board, but is that something you think you have some upside to perhaps?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Michael, this is Billy. I won't forecast out what we're going to do in the future on share repurchase. To your point, we still have the $576 million left. We'll see how we progress with that before we take any action. But if we're going to take any, of course, we'll go to the board and we'll be sure to tell you when we do.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks. And just one last one, for the corrective statement ads that you're going to be starting running next month, that's, I believe, around the $31 million cost. Can you just help us understand how to think about modeling that and is that an incremental expense and would it be spread evenly over the next year or so? How do we factor that into our numbers?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. So you remember when we actually proceeded with that case, that $31 million has already been accrued, and so those expenses, as we go through time, will be charged against the accrual.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Matt.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just had two quick questions. One, I guess with respect to some of the competitive dynamics in the smokeless business. You called out unfavorable mix as being one of the drivers of net revenue in the quarter and it's \u2013 I think that may be a factor that you don't typically call out in the release. Just wondering if you could elaborate on whether that's a byproduct of some of the competitive promotion that's going on or whether there are other factors driving that?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, Matt. Basically, if you look at the smokeless market, it has a couple of different price points that occur in the marketplace. And so it's just a mix of the volume that occurs at those 2 price points related to Copenhagen and Skoal.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, understood. So is that something that was an outside impact from the quarter or is that a dynamic that you as being maybe a bit stickier as you've observed it over this year and going forward?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","I think if I recall correctly, Matt, we called it out a couple of times in the past. I wouldn't say anything was abnormal about this quarter than other quarters.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Billy. And then just from a category standpoint, a variety of peers across the CPG landscape have talked about C-store trends some more cautiously than others. So just curious if you were seeing any perceptible change or slow down in C-store activity within the tobacco category, specifically.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","No, we haven't. Although we're following it closely, because obviously we've been following other people's reporting on that. And we've been following the C-store dynamics. It just hasn't shown up in our category, Matt.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie, your line is open. Please state your question.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. A question on the FDA's plan to reduce the levels of nicotine in combustible cigs. You touched on this and how you're thinking about it but I guess any more color on this would be really helpful given the pressure that's been on your stock. And then I know it's still very early to talk about, but could you touch on your capabilities to reduce nicotine levels in your tobacco leaves and the expected costs involved? I guess I'm trying to understand how complicated this might be and if you really have the capability to do this?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. So this is another topic that we're going to cover in some detail next week. So I don't want to put you off on your question but I'll give you a high-level sort of a lead-in, if you will.","There's quite a lot to do, obviously, as you know of any nicotine standard or any other standard, for that matter. Wherever to be implemented, there has to be science and evidence-based, and in the nicotine area there's a lot of science that would have to be answered, so let me just call out a few for instance.","So I think folks are going to have to understand how consumers might react to a nicotine standard, including the question of whether compensation would occur, because you obviously, from a public health point of view, wouldn't want people smoking more cigarettes to get their nicotine.","There is no standard that is currently developed with respect to what the level should be or where it should be measured \u2013 is it in the aerosol or is it in the filler? How would it be implemented? Would it phased in over time or would it be done on a more immediate basis? Those are questions which have to be answered that are not answered yet; and the government has research going on that regard.","As you might expect, our scientists are fully engaged in all the scientific questions, both tracking government research as well as doing our own research so that we're fully informed on those.","There are big questions around technical achievability, which is an area that you're asking about. Now, the possibility of a standard around nicotine has been in the statute since 2009, so it won't surprise anyone to know that we have been looking at ways that we might meet any potential standard.","You can look at product design, you can look at tobacco leaf treatments, you can look at tobacco seed technologies; most of which are proprietary, so I won't comment beyond them, but I think people should be assured that we have been looking at this.","And then finally, I think another area that's going to have to be wrestled with is what about unintended consequences if a standard comes in? We're going to have to make sure that the market still works. So as you can tell, just from that high-level description, there's quite a lot that has to be wrestled to ground and again we'll talk more about that next week.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That was really helpful. And I'll come next week to hear more.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","We're looking forward to seeing you.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I have another quick question, if I could, on Marlboro.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","You touched on this a lot. You mentioned that the Marlboro's equity is quite strong. So is there any more color you can give us on that or any metrics? I'm just trying to understand how you measure that and what you're looking at that we are not able to see.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","We tried to share that with you on a yearly basis. I think you'll remember, typically at CAGNY, we put up the equity scores. We do an equity study every year. I believe the last chart we put up, we called out that Marlboro's equity is at least 14 points higher than the next closest competitor, off of an already high base, and that Marlboro's equity has been improving over time.","So that work is underway again, and as soon as we have an update to the equity study, I assume that we'll be updating you in due course. But its equity remains strong, there's no question about it, and you'll see it in the premium price it's able to command.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then one final quick question on your debt levels. Your net debt-to-EBITDA is pretty low right now at around 1.5 times. And I know you guys don't have targets for this, but could you give us a sense of how you're thinking about current levels and your possible appetite for taking on more leverage?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question. We'll end the quarter, Bonnie, at 1.3:1. From a standpoint of taking on additional debt, I think if we see the opportunity to do that, based on what the business needs are, we will. As you know, we generate after dividends about $1 billion in excess cash just from the normal operations in the business, so it's a really cash-generative machine that we have here in the operating companies.","And so at this point, we're very happy with where we're at. You're right, we don't have a specific target number that we're looking at, but we definitely want to make sure we maintain investment grade.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I'm just thinking, again a comment on the stock pressure, it could be a way to create values for shareholders, just even more aggressively buying back your stock at these lower levels. All right. Thank you.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","I understand, but you're...","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right, Bonnie. Thanks.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hey, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. So some of this stuff you might cover next week, so I look forward to seeing you guys then. But maybe if you could just give some thoughts on Nat Sherman, how it's doing? I guess, it's been over a year now since it's been in the portfolio, so I was just curious on how that's doing?","The second question is, would it be a fair assumption to say that if IQOS have rolled out into the U.S. more broadly after the testing and all that kind of stuff, would be a lower margin than your overall portfolio just given the \u2013 it will have the same SCT, the same MSA, but perhaps you'll have to spend a little more to kind of build brand awareness? That was the second question. And then I have a third question after. I don't want to ask too many at once.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Yeah, we're going to talk about Nat Sherman next week. Just for precision, we acquired it in January of this year, so it hasn't been quite a year. I think we just talked about before what we've been doing is getting the product ready, getting the package ready. It's a huge whitespace opportunity for us as you know, Nik, and we've got plans to get that in distribution, and I think it's going to \u2013 I think you'll be interested to see what we have on Nat Sherman.","For IQOS, well, for sure, when we launch IQOS, it's going to have a lower margin because we're going to be investing in it. But the idea, over time is, is that when you get to scale obviously, that you could have a nice margin business in IQOS. So we're working through all that. We're going to talk about IQOS in some significant detail as well next week.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, I guess, the last question is kind of more of a broader question from looking across CPG. It seems like a big trend, there's kind of local assortment even in the U.S. And I'm wondering, Marty, given all of your very sophisticated relationships with distributors, with retailers, all your trade contracts, if there's a way for the company to optimize its assortment in different regions to kind of get the best out of the portfolio.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","The answer is yes, Nik. I think it's a very insightful question, and in fact, our sales team has been working on that project and others. I think as personalization becomes more important to the consumer and particularly with the analytical tools and the data sets that we now have that \u2013 take revenue growth management tools, for example, which we've deployed already in the smokeless business and are rolling it out across the rest of the businesses, it allows you the precision to do just that. It's an excellent question and we're working on it.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks a lot, Marty. See you next week.","Martin J.

Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Sarah Knakmuhs","Thank you, Lori. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We are here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Howard Willard, Altria\u2019s CFO to talk about Altria\u2019s 2014 business results for the third quarter and the first nine months.","During our call today unless otherwise stated, we\u2019re comparing results to the same period in 2013. Earlier today, we issued a press release regarding our third quarter and first nine month results. For a detailed review of Altria\u2019s business results, please review the earnings release on our website at altria.com.","Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today\u2019s earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and timing of share repurchases remain subject to the discussion of Altria\u2019s Board. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.","Today\u2019s call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in today\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Marty.","Marty Barrington","Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Our companies are delivering well against their strategies, and our business results are on track.","In the first nine months of 2014, Altria delivered solid adjusted diluted EPS growth of 5.5%. During the third quarter, the Board increased our dividend by 8.3% and authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. And earlier this morning, we\u2019ve reaffirmed our adjusted EPS guidance of 7% to 9% for the full-year of 2014. Here are the highlights for the third quarter and the nine months of 2014.","The smokable production segment performance this year has been outstanding. We delivered strong adjusted operating company\u2019s income growth of 9% in the third quarter and 6.3% year-to-date, driven by solid pricing. Adjusted operating company\u2019s income margins also grew both in the quarter and the first nine months.","Marlboro continues to show modest share momentum as again one-tenth of a share point in both, the third quarter and year-to-date, in line with our strategy in the smokable segment. It\u2019s apparent that the investments made in the Marlboro architecture are paying dividends and we\u2019re excited about the brand\u2019s strong equity and momentum.","In smokeless, USSTC continues its strategy to grow income by growing volume, at or ahead of the category, and maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. In the first nine months, the smokeless segment delivered 4.4% adjusted OCI growth, in a competitive environment, with lower industry volume growth.","USSTC strengthened its leadership position behind the combined performance of Copenhagen and Skoal. For the third quarter of 2014, these two premium brands achieved their highest combined share since the acquisition of UST at 51.3 share points.","Turning to innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continued its national expansion of MarkTen e-vapor products and is developing a robust product pipeline. MarkTen achieved distribution in nearly 80,000 retail stores.","As of September 30, 2014, MarkTen continued to be ranked in the top three e-vapor brands in the Western US based on retail market share. Nu Mark plans to further expand MarkTen in the Eastern half of the US and complete its national expansion in the fourth quarter.","Our diverse business model and strong balance sheet support our strong and growing dividend in our ability to enhance shareholder returns through share repurchases. In August 2014, Altria\u2019s Board increased the regular quarterly dividend by 8.3% to $0.52 per share. Altria paid shareholders almost $1 billion in dividends in the quarter and nearly $3 billion in the first nine months.","We remain focused on our target, dividend payout ratio of 80% of adjusted diluted EPS, and we expect to continue to raise the dividend in line with adjusted diluted EPS growth.","In the third quarter, Altria completed the prior $1 billion share repurchase program. In July 2014, the Board authorized a new $1 billion program, which Altria expects to complete by the end of 2015.","During the third quarter of 2014, Altria repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares of its common stock, at an average price of $42.87 for a total cost of approximately $275 million. As of the end of the third quarter of 2004, Altria had approximately $778 million remaining in the current $1 billion share repurchase program.","In summary, we\u2019re very pleased with our year-to-date business performance and strong execution. Our core tobacco businesses are performing well, and we are making disciplined investments in innovation for the future. Together, we are managing our diverse business model and strong balance sheet with the objective of delivering consistent earnings growth and shareholder returns year-after-year.","Howard will now provide additional details on the quarter and for the first nine months.","Howard Willard","Thank you, Marty. Good morning everyone. Altria Group third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by 6.2% and today we reaffirmed guidance for both, adjusted and reported diluted EPS. Altria expects to deliver adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 9% in a range of $2.54 to $2.59 of an adjusted base of $2.38 per share in 2013.","We expect stronger adjusted diluted EPS growth in the fourth quarter driven by several factors, including a significantly lower fourth quarter effective tax rate on operations, resulting from Altria\u2019s 2013 debt tender offer and lower fourth quarter costs in the smokable products segment, due to the end of the federal tobacco quota buy-out payments.","Turning to the smokable products segment, we delivered strong adjusted OCI and adjusted OCI margin growth in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, primarily through higher pricing. Adjusted OCI margins expanded 2 percentage points in the first nine months of 2014. PM USA grew Marlboro\u2019s and its total cigarette category retail share in the third quarter and nine months year-to-date.","After adjusting for trade inventory fluctuation and other factors, PM USA estimates that its third quarter and first nine months cigarette shipment volume declined approximately 3% and 3.5% respectively, and the total industry volumes declined approximately 3.5% and 4% respectively. The 2014 year-to-date industry cigarette decline of 4% continues to be in the range of the decline rate we\u2019ve seen in the last few years.","Middleton\u2019s reported cigar shipment volume increased 8.4% for the third quarter and 6.8% year-to-date, driven by Black & Mild\u2019s strong performance in the tipped cigars segment including Black & Mild Jazz.","In the smokeless products segment, adjusted OCI grew 0.7% in the third quarter and 4.4% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margins grew 3.1 percentage points in the third quarter to 64.9% and 2.4 percentage points to 64.6% year-to-date.","After adjusting for calendar differences and trade inventory changes, USSTC and PM USA estimate that their combined domestic smokeless products shipment volume grew approximately 2.5% in the third quarter and 3% in the first nine months of 2014. USSTC and PM USA estimate that the smokeless products category volume grew approximately 3% over the last 12 months, reflecting slower industry volume growth in the past two quarters.","Copenhagen and Skoal delivered third quarter retail share of 51.3 share points, up four-tenths from last year, driven by Copenhagen\u2019s retail share growth of 1.4 share points. USSTC is investing both in Skoal\u2019s equity and to narrow price gaps on Skoal Classic. These investments are designed to enhance the long-term combined performance of Copenhagen and Skoal.","The wine segment continued to deliver solid results. Ste. Michelle grew OCI by 10.7% for the third quarter and 11% for the first nine months. Shipments increased 4.2% in the quarter and 2.5% year-to-date.","That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items.","As a reminder, comparisons when made are against the third quarter of 2013, unless noted otherwise. Marlboro\u2019s price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 33%, down 1 percentage point.","Marlboro\u2019s net pack price was $5.98, up $0.12. The lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.51, up $0.15. The cigarette discounts segment retail share was 24.9%, down from 25.3%. Wholesale inventory changes are one factor PM USA uses to estimate adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM USA estimates that for 2014, wholesale inventories were approximately 2.3 billion units at the end of the third quarter and 2.1 billion units at the end of the second quarter.","Last year, PM USA\u2019s wholesale inventories were estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion units at the end of the third quarter and 2.2 billion units at the end of the second quarter. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax was $1.48 per pack, up $0.01. Copenhagen\u2019s price gap versus the leading discount brand was 30%, down 6 percentage points.","Copenhagen\u2019s retail price was $4.15, up $0.08. The price of the leading discount brand was $3.19, up $0.20. In the third quarter, CapEx was $56 million, and ongoing depreciation and amortization was $49 million. Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Investors, analysts and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Marty Barrington","Good morning Judy.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So Marty, I guess you had a very strong cigarette profitability or the smokeless division had very strong profitability with very strong pricing, margin expansion. Just curious if you can talk about the competitive landscape and the ability to sustain this kind of very profitable growth in the segment, and especially as you get into the fourth quarter where you been obviously will have another favorable tailwind in terms of your cost standpoint?","Marty Barrington","Well, thanks for your question and thanks for your comment. There was very strong performance over at the smokable segment. When you look at the numbers that we\u2019ve reported this morning you see, income growth 9% and margin expansion, very good pricing realization, very good steady momentum on Marlboro in line with our strategy, and then of course the volume declines have moderated below what the industry estimate is from us. So that\u2019s a very strong performance.","I think what it represents, Judy, is that coming together of some of the work that we\u2019ve done. If the Marlboro architecture is clearly paying back dividends, our strategy is to maximize income. That\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to execute our plan this year and that\u2019s what we should expect going forward. They change a little bit over time quarter-to-quarter, but over time that\u2019s the strategy and we\u2019re trying to be consistent in that regard.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then Howard, any help you can give us just in terms of just really dissecting a bit more the all other segment performance from a sales and profitability perspective? I understand there is a lot of noise around the financial services business, but you\u2019re also making investments on the MarkTen. So just curious how we should think about that business? And then, are we done in terms of all the investments related to the MarkTen national launch. Does this step up again in the fourth quarter or is this sort of the peak investment quarter, as we think about that business?","Howard Willard","Yes, I think as we\u2019ve indicated previously, we\u2019re not going to break down the detail in that other segment any more than that as indicated in the release. But as we\u2019ve said since the beginning of the year, our results this year are impacted by the fact that we are both making investments in Nu Mark throughout the year, and at the same time, the comparisons of our PMCC operating company\u2019s income are affected by lower asset sales this year than last year. And both of those create a negative year-over-year comparison in the other segment.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, but sequentially is there anything you can talk about just in terms of how much the national expansion of the Nu Mark would have helped the revenue line, just to get a sense of, if we\u2019re actually seeing progression on the MarkTen sales side, I understand there is a lot of investment that\u2019s going on, but just trying to just sort of reconcile with what we\u2019re seeing from a Nielson market share data perspective and sizing the MarkTen number, from that data to kind of what you\u2019re actually reporting from a shipment perspective?","Howard Willard","Yes, I\u2019m not going to provide any further detail on a quarterly comparison basis.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, all right. And then just my last question, Marty. Just the smokeless tobacco segment, I mean clearly you had the one less shipping day that impacted the reported shipments. The category seems a little bit slower though if you adjust for the shipment days. So just can you talk about what\u2019s happening from a category perspective? And obviously you\u2019ve had some investments you\u2019re making to tweak some of the pricing around Skoal. How do you think that that\u2019s going in terms of the context of your market share performance?","Marty Barrington","Sure, let me talk about those in turn. As you know, we try to estimate the category growth in smokeless on a 12-month trailing basis. And using that metric over the last several years I guess I would say, it\u2019s been in the range of about 5%. And then you see that our estimate today is about 3%, because it\u2019s slowed down in the last two quarters which has that effect.","We\u2019re analyzing what\u2019s going on with the growth rate right now carefully. It goes I think without saying that, as categories get bigger, the growth gets harder as they get bigger. And I think everyone also recognizes that tobacco consumers have choices today as they choose their products. So we\u2019re looking at that carefully. I think it\u2019s important probably to say what we\u2019ve said with respect to that growth rate, what we say with respect to the cigarette decline rate, which is it\u2019s really best measured over time. And so we have two quarters of data here which are taking us in this direction, but we\u2019ll look at it carefully over time.","With respect to Skoal, I always start out by reminding folks that, while Skoal has its challenges, it is a top three brand with 20 share points in a segment for us that has 65% operating margins. So it\u2019s a big brand with good profitability. Its challenge though is that it competes both, with its competition, but it competes with Copenhagen, which is the iconic brand in the category of ours that continues to grow very strongly.","So we\u2019re trying to work on that. As you know, this takes place over time. Howard has already made reference to the fact that we\u2019ve worked on its equity positioning. We have a new equity campaign. You\u2019ve seen the ads in print, I\u2019m sure. We have very good new equity based promotions for Skoal in the marketplace that have been very well received. And then with respect to Skoal Classic, which remembers at the premium price point, we\u2019re trying to get that price point adjusted for price gap management purposes, so that to compete more effectively against this principal competitor, and we\u2019ve been able to do that, we do that tactically by state because it makes difference in terms of the excise tax rates.","So it takes place over time, but we are encouraged by where we\u2019re going with Skoal. We manage our premium brands for the long-term and we are patient.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Marty Barrington","Judy thanks for calling in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","Good morning.","Marty Barrington","Hi Vivien.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","So Marty, you called out the success of the Marlboro architecture, and that\u2019s clearly evident in the continued momentum that you have on the Marlboro brand. I know you guys don\u2019t like to talk about individual product lines within the Marlboro family, but may be could you talk about Marlboro Black in totality, where you\u2019ve called that out as a good share gainer over time in previous discussions?","Marty Barrington","Yes, I do think that the Marlboro architecture is best understood in context of the four families, but it is true that the addition of the Marlboro Black flavor family has been a terrific boost for Marlboro. That brand continues to perform very well. I think we\u2019re now in our 15th consecutive quarter of growth for that. And it\u2019s highly relevant to adult competitive smokers. It\u2019s a terrific product in a great pack.","But I do think that apart from Black, the best understanding of the Marlboro architecture as we\u2019ve discussed previously as you know, is to understand that it has opened up the marketing freedom to speak to people who are in the franchise and adult competitive smokers in different ways, and to market to them in different ways.","And I think in totality, that\u2019s why you see Marlboro performing as well as it has done. That and many other things \u2013 by the way Marlboro.com has been improved, how we go to market has improved. So I think the team has done a really great job with Marlboro.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","That\u2019s terrific. Thank you. In terms of the cigarette industry volume declines and I heard you loud and clear on the work that you\u2019re doing on MST and I\u2019m sure there is some cigarette analysis involved there as you think about kind of the cross elasticities of demand, but I know you guys also focus a lot on the health of the consumer. Can you give us just an update on how you\u2019re seeing your consumer trending, in particular in light of lower gas prices?","Marty Barrington","You\u2019re talking about the economic conditions?","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","Yes.","Marty Barrington","We had in our 2014 plan that, while the US economy was improving that we assumed that it was not going to show up quite as strongly for our adult tobacco consumers. And I think that has proven to be the case throughout the year. Unemployment rates obviously are down, but they\u2019re not down where they should be. Underemployment is down, but it\u2019s not down to where it should be. And on those two measures in particular, our adult tobacco consumers over index.","There is pretty tepid year-over-year wage gains, but then you do see the suits of other good economic activity. Housing starts are up, consumer confidence some months are up, and then we have seen lower gas prices, although that\u2019s less of a factor in our view.","So I think for 2014, while we\u2019re encouraged and we hope that it gets traction, our continuing assumption is that our adult tobacco consumer is going to be under some pressure.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","That\u2019s very helpful. And Howard, just one last one for you. As we think about the fourth quarter, anything that we should keep in mind in terms of SAB, because the SAB number came in higher than I have been anticipating given, I guess, the casino sale?","Howard Willard","Yes, I think that\u2019s \u2013 the only thing I would point out is that third quarter was impacted by an extra gain related to the sale of their casino business in Africa. And I think that\u2019s the only thing I would point out from a SABMiller perspective.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for calling in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Good morning.","Marty Barrington","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","When you give you market share updates, is that on the adjusted category numbers that you mentioned or on just the unadjusted sort of pure number?","Howard Willard","Yes, I mean I think our market share comes from our syndicated panel that essentially measures market share at retail. So I think there is obviously a relationship between shipments and retail, but it really comes out of a difference system that we\u2019ve invested a fair amount in to get an accurate read of the mainstream retail outlets.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Okay, yes, that\u2019s helpful. And do you have a sense of what \u2013 I guess, you\u2019ve sighted the adjusted shipment category number, do you know what the retail number for the category is that you look at for the third quarter, just for context of what the share gain is against?","Howard Willard","Yes, I don\u2019t think we really look at it that way. If you think about it \u2013 when we look at our shipments, we\u2019re shipping out to wholesale. And obviously when we read retail market share, there is a bit of space between our shipments to wholesale and what happens at retail. So that is why we provide both the actual and adjusted shipment numbers to give your perspective on that, as well as then going further downstream and providing you with retail share figures that allow you to understand how we\u2019re doing in the overall retail market.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just looking back a little bit actually just for context. When you look at your 2009 market share loss of about a percentage point or slightly more, do you know \u2013 do you have an ability to estimate how much of that might have been related to your integration of UST as sort of a disruption, or was it in your view more related to economic pressures or trading down or other things like that?","Marty Barrington","Yes, I\u2019ll be honest with you. I\u2019m a bit uncomfortable analyzing the 2009 numbers at this stage, but certainly if you want to have some conversation about 2009, you can speak to the IR group.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Well, or I guess maybe let me put it in a different way. You have experienced with integration of your own that obviously are a major effort. How much of a distraction do you feel like that could have been in that particular timeframe I guess, or just in terms of focus or managing through that?","Marty Barrington","Yes, I think our experience in the UST integration was that given the size and professionalism of our sales force, certainly there was some incremental work placed on the sales force when we took over UST, but remembering back to that time, I think it went pretty smoothly. So I don\u2019t have a recollection that there were significant disruptions in the cigarette category related to that.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Okay. That\u2019s helpful context. And just last question on PMCC, obviously the finance assets is down pretty dramatically from where it would have been even just a couple of years ago. Is it still kind of your approach to opportunistic sales or is there some degree of flat-towing [ph] that the sales you think make the most sense to me have probably been done, or what\u2019s kind of the run rate looking ahead? This quarter, the asset balance there didn\u2019t change very much from 2Q. Is it leveled off or what should we expect looking ahead in that segment there?","Marty Barrington","Yes. I think, as you know, we\u2019re trying to wind that business down completely. And so essentially looking at the cash flow impact and the profit impact of selling assets in any given year, our bias is towards selling them if we can sell them for a reasonable financial outcome, but we\u2019ve been in that mode for quite some time. So I would say that we are probably reaching a period where we\u2019re going to see a slowdown in some of those asset sales. Certainly that is what is driving the negative year-over-year comparison at PMCC this year, compared to last year was, we had very good asset sales last year.","Now that said, in the leasing business, there is a sweet spot which then becomes more favorable to sell assets in the life of the lease. And so at any given year, I think we do expect to have some asset sales that could potentially occur as we get closer to the end of some of those leases. So we\u2019re managing through that, but I think the most important point was the one you made, which was the net finance receivable on that businesses come down tremendously. We\u2019re now down below $2 billion, and so we\u2019re well on our way to completely exiting that business.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for calling in Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good morning.","Marty Barrington","Hi Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","I have a follow-on question from an earlier one asked a little differently in terms of how you\u2019re balancing your business in the short and long-term. Marty, as you mentioned you\u2019re generating strong volume and pricing, and then your smokable margins have expanded quite a bit. So if you back out your other segment, which includes MarkTen, you would have reported double-digit EPS growth in the quarter. So I guess I\u2019m trying to understand why you believe the e-cig or vapor category weren\u2019t the levels spending right now and how big this opportunity can truly be in the long-term, and essentially how you\u2019re balancing this versus rewarding shareholders right now?","Marty Barrington","Yes. Good question, let me try to give you some context about how we think of that at the strategic level, and I think you and I have discussed this previously which is, we\u2019ve tried to maximize our core business while we innovate for our future. And we have tremendous core businesses, we have the leading positions, we have the leading brands. We have high margins that generate enormous amounts of cash, most of which we give back to the shareholders through the dividend, periodic share repurchase.","We keep those businesses relevant in growing by investing in them appropriately. I think that\u2019s how to think about the core. However, we also know that consumers change and businesses change and markets change. And so you always have to be looking ahead about what you need to be doing today to be ready for tomorrow. That\u2019s how we think about innovation and other categories for example heat-not-burn, which as you know, we have the license from PMI.","As consumers evolve, we want to have products for them. We want them to be premium, we want them to branded, and of course we aspire to have the good margins that we do in our tobacco businesses today. The way to do that in our view is with discipline. You learn your way in, you do it wisely and you do it over time. And I think that you can see that\u2019s the approach we\u2019re trying to take in e-vapor. So I hope that context may be helpful about how we think about that.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","Very much. I appreciate that. And then speaking of heat-not-burn, the iQOS platform is being rolled out now in two countries like Philip Morris [ph] and then as you mentioned how access to this. Could you update us on the process and have you filed for potential equivalent, timeframes, where you\u2019re at with this in terms of eventually rolling that out here in the US?","Marty Barrington","Yes, I\u2019d refer you to comments that PMI has made about this for further context, but obviously you know that the deal is we struck an arrangement with PMI, where we will sell them our e-vapor products for sale through their distribution network internationally and we continue to work with them on that and we\u2019re excited about that. And then on heat-not-burn, we\u2019re cooperating with PMI as it goes through the process at the Food and Drug Administration in pursuit of a reduced harm claim.","You might expect that we would be working on ideas about how to commercialize that project when it becomes successful. These are longer term projects, but our strategy is to offer consumers alternatives for those who want them. And we\u2019re very excited to be working with PMI and that I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think they would say and I would certainly say it\u2019s going quite well.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And I just have one final quick question on MarkTen and the consumer behavior. How is it been, what do you think in terms of repeat purchases. We\u2019ve seen maybe some share losses on a sequential basis in Nielson\u2019s. So maybe you could address that. And then I\u2019d be curious to hear your robust product pipeline behind MarkTen. You mentioned that. So how soon would you be able to roll-out your next generation products?","Marty Barrington","Sure. So I\u2019ll start I guess by talking about shares, and it\u2019s just a word of caution in the e-vapor category. I think if you look back over the last three years, you\u2019ve had at least five brands at one time or another have claimed share a leadership. And what in fact you see is a lot of dynamism among the shares as consumers continue to try products. You\u2019ve heard us speak about this before. Consumers are continuing to shop for the product that they want in the e-vapor space. Brands have sort of come and gone and up and down and it continues to evolve.","Our long-term aspiration is leadership in the category, which means we will offer consumers in this space, superior products. We will build brand equity and we\u2019ll build share over time.","With respect to MarkTen, we\u2019re very happy with the start that we have. We believe we have a very good product. It\u2019s differentiated by its technology, but there is no denying that consumers are continuing to shop for our products and others will continue to roll products out as we have them. I\u2019m obviously not going to tip my hand about what\u2019s coming, but I can tell you that Nu Mark has a lot of great ideas and we\u2019re working very hard on a whole range of products to offer to consumers in this space.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","That makes sense. Thank you so much, Marty.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for calling Bonnie.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.","Owen Bennett \u2013 Nomura","Good morning guys.","Marty Barrington","Hi Owen.","Owen Bennett \u2013 Nomura","Thanks for taking my question. I was just hoping for a bit more commentary on price mix in smokable, and I guess, I\u2019m really just playing devil\u2019s advocate on this one. Although strong in the quarter, it was below that of one of your competitors. I was just wondering if you were seeing any ongoing specific mixed pressures, especially as you continue to see strong share momentum with L&M [ph]? Thank you.","Marty Barrington","Okay, thanks for your question. I wouldn\u2019t characterize that way. I think again, when I look at the smokable performance for the quarter and certainly for the year-to-date, we\u2019ve got income up 9% and margin growth and strong pricing realization and the volumes are below the estimated industry decline again. We look at this over time, but when you look at the year-to-date for PM USA in the smokable segment, it\u2019s nothing short of an outstanding performance and we\u2019re very happy with it.","Owen Bennett \u2013 Nomura","Okay, thank you.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for calling in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, good morning.","Marty Barrington","Hi Chris.","Chris Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi. Just two quick questions if I could. I wanted to ask, you gave some data, I believe it was at the Back-To-School Conference about the vapor category and you have a better tracking mechanism for that. So I\u2019m just curious in relation to the cigarette category. Have you seen any slowdown in vapor? Is that in part what\u2019s driving better volumes in cigarettes, or do you have some other explanation for what has been a better category growth condition here in the quarter?","Marty Barrington","Again Chris, if you look at it over time, we\u2019ve got a model that we use, that\u2019s a secular decline rate of about 2% to 3% and then you\u2019ve got of course your pricing elasticities. And in our secular model includes adult consumers trying other kinds of products including vapor. So we don\u2019t see anything remarkable there to call out.","Chris Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And then just one other question on MarkTen. In the way that product has gone or at least I\u2019ve seen it, it\u2019s within your cigarette shelf set. Is that what you expect for new products going forward, and we\u2019d be careful talking about new products, but are you trying to fit those within your existing shelves that you are looking for space on the back counter and the counter at the [indiscernible]. So just curious how we should think about new products that reach the shelf?","Marty Barrington","Yes, that\u2019s an excellent question. I think that the merchandizing of innovative products into the traditional categories is going to have to be resolved over time. I think clearly in the short run, what you\u2019re trying to do is you\u2019re trying to get awareness of your product to the adult consumer at retail. And because PM USA has space that it could provide the Nu Mark on appropriate terms. That\u2019s the approach we took.","It will depend I suppose on how large the categories get to bay [ph]. What we would expect is for retailers to adjust their merchandizing approach and their scale with the size of the category and we\u2019re working closely with retailers to try to help them in thinking through that. I think that\u2019s the best way to think about it.","Chris Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning everyone.","Marty Barrington","Hi Matt.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi. So I have couple of questions. Marty, first just to revisit Vivien\u2019s earlier question about the economic health of the smoker. You echoed what others in the industry have talked about this quarter with cigarette volumes decline \u2013 with the decline in cigarette volumes moderating from down 4% or 4.5% during the first half to down only perhaps 3.5% or a bit less in the third quarter. And you commented that you have not seen a material improvement in economic conditions or behavior among core smokers. So I\u2019m just curious if it\u2019s not macro-driven, what other factors would it play the most meaningful role in this sequential improvement?","Marty Barrington","Well, I think there is two answers to it Matt. One is, actually when you look at the decline rates that we\u2019re estimating for the quarter, its spot in the middle of the range that we\u2019ve been estimating for some time now. So I don\u2019t think it represents the deviation from curve as much as it represents a data point best understood over time. So I guess that\u2019s the first thing I\u2019d say.","The second thing I\u2019d say to be clear about the macro environment is that it simply is uneven. It clearly is improving at a macro level for the reasons I called out. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s uneven over time, and it also appears to be somewhat uneven in its distribution. And so the adult tobacco consumer is not participating in the recovery to the same degree in many instances, as is the general public. So we\u2019ll have to see going forward, but I think that\u2019s honestly the answer, which is, we\u2019re trying to be mindful of what the macro environment is and in particular for our consumer set.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. But just to be clear, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily attribute changes in cigarette volumes to sequential changes through the year in cross category dynamics or retailer working capital dynamics, anything along those lines?","Marty Barrington","No, I don\u2019t think we would.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks. And Howard just on SABMiller. Last quarter you addressed some of the speculation there and how you might evaluate cash transaction from the perspective of shareholders. Just to take the other side of that hypothetical. I\u2019m just curious how you would assess the potential impact or attractiveness of taking on less than 20% stake in another publicly traded company in an equity transaction, and whether you felt, in that circumstance, it might be possible to justify the continuation of equity method accounting?","Howard Willard","Yes, I think the answer to a detailed scenario is probably best answered in the moment when the details are available. I think our view though has been that we continue to view the SABMiller asset as an attractive asset that is contributed strongly to our earnings growth into cash flow through dividends. And at this point, our view hasn\u2019t changed, which is we think it\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders to retain that asset, but as always, we\u2019re doing a lot of analysis, we\u2019re doing a lot of future scenario planning to make sure we\u2019re prepared for whatever the future brings. And I think we\u2019re open-minded, but we continue to view the asset as a positive contributor to the business.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, understood. I had to give it a shot. You answered it last quarter. And then lastly, just on the interest expense. I think you exercised the may-call [ph] provision on one of your outstanding bonds during the quarter. Should we expect to see some sequential favorability on interest expense, and do you see additional refinancing opportunities going forward over the next six to 12 months?","Howard Willard","Yes, we did called some bonds. It was about $300 million worth of UST debt. It was actually the only debt we have that wasn\u2019t at the parent level. And so we thought to clean that up, not only helped our maturity towers, but had some compliance in some operational benefits.","It will have some positive impact on interest in this quarter. It actually was \u2013 the impact will really be felt in the fourth quarter, and certainly we\u2019ll have some impact next year, but the scale of that was actually quite small compared to some of the activity we\u2019ve done in the past. And I think as indicated by this transaction, we\u2019re always looking at how to best manage our debt load. And I think we\u2019re opportunistic going forward, but I have to say that I think the significant activity that\u2019s occurred over the last couple of years is probably going to represent the biggest opportunity there.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks everyone.","Marty Barrington","Matt, I\u2019m glad you joined us. Thank you.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Marascia of Capitol Securities.","Steve Marascia \u2013 Capitol Securities Management","Good morning everyone.","Marty Barrington","Good morning.","Steve Marascia \u2013 Capitol Securities Management","Two question. Can you guys, sort of, outline your plans for expanding into the Eastern US, and what do you foresee as being the total amount of retail outlets you might like to be in as you complete the \u2013 or as you move into the Eastern area of the United States?","Marty Barrington","Sure. We are expanding into the Eastern United States. That\u2019s been the plan. We\u2019re going to be national. We hope to have that completed by the fourth quarter. I am sure that we can provide you with an estimate of the total stores. I just don\u2019t have that in front of me.

After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Sarah Knakmus, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Sarah Knakmus","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We are here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Howard Willard, Altria\u2019s CFO to talk about Altria\u2019s results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013.","During our call today unless otherwise stated, results are being compared to the same period in 2012. Earlier today we issued a press release regarding our fourth quarter and full year results. For a detailed review about Altria\u2019s business results please review the earning release on our website at altria.com.","Our remarks contain forward-looking cautionary statements and projection of future results. And we direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today\u2019s earnings release for review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.","Today\u2019s call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis which exclude items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in today\u2019s earnings press release and are available on our web site.","Now I will turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Barrington","Thank you Sarah. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call. Altria successfully delivered against its financial goals in 2013 and continued its strong track record of delivering earnings and dividends growth for its shareholders.","For the full year, Altria delivered adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7.7% on the strength of its diverse business model and solid performance by its core tobacco businesses. We also enhanced our capital structure in 2013 and provided significant cash returns to our shareholders. We increased our dividend by 9.1% in 2013, our 47th dividend increase in the last 44 years, and paid shareholders more than $3.6 billion in dividends.","Altria further rewarded shareholders by repurchasing shares totaling $600 million in 2013. We have approximately $457 million remaining in the current $1 billion program, which we expect to complete by the end of the third quarter of 2014. Of course the timing of any purchases will depend on marketplace conditions and other factors.","In the fourth quarter of 2013, Altria tendered for high coupon debt and replaced it with new lower cost debt. These transactions along with the retirement of debt at its scheduled maturity improved our debt maturity profile and lowered future interest expense. As a result of our 2013 capital market\u2019s activities, Altria reduced its weighted average coupon rate to 5.9% at year-end 2013 from 7.2% at year-end 2012.","We also delivered on our cost reduction commitments. Altria completed its cost reduction program in the fourth quarter of 2013 by achieving $400 million in annualized savings versus previously planned spending. And Altria continued to deliver value to shareholders through mixed diverse income streams, including our equity investment in SABMiller, which generated pretax income of approximately $1 billion for Altria in 2013.","So in summary, in 2013 Altria complemented its operating company\u2019s performance by effectively employing multiple tools, cost savings, share repurchases, debt management and its SABMiller investment to enhance shareholder value.","Let's turn to the performance of our core businesses. In the smokeable products segment PM USA delivered on its strategy to maximize income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro over times. This segment grew adjusted operating companies income for the quarter and the full year primarily through higher pricing. Investments in the Marlboro brand architecture and product expansions helped PM USA balance income growth and share gains to maintain its marketplace leadership. Marlboro grew 0.1 of the retail share point for the year.","In the smokeless product segment our strategy is to maximize income by growing volume at or ahead of the smokeless category and to maintain modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. In 2013, the smokeless product segment produced solid adjusted operating companies income growth, primarily through higher pricing and volume and grew Copenhagen and Skoal\u2019s combined volume and retail share. Driven by its strong brand equity, Copenhagen performed well in both the quarter and the end year while Skoal continued to face strong competitive pressure.","In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered double-digit operating companies income growth for the full year through higher pricing and its focus on increasing distribution of premium wines.","Altria also took important steps in 2013 to develop and commercialize innovative products for adult tobacco consumers. In the fourth quarter Altria increased its investment in the e-vapor category. Nu Mark expanded the MarkTen e-cigarettes test market into Arizona with a new flavor system and packaging configuration. So far MarkTen is off to a very strong start in Arizona and has benefited of gaining trial. It\u2019s now available in about 1,900 Arizona stores and about 5,000 stores across both the Arizona and Indiana test markets. Nu Mark is making good progress in understanding adult smokers and vapors preferences and the MarkTen value equation in a disciplined way.","Also in December Altria announced disagreements with Philip Morris International that creates opportunities to commercialize our e-vapor products internationally and to expand our innovative products portfolio in the U.S. Through licensing, regulatory engagement and contract manufacturing arrangements Altria is providing PMI with an exclusive license to commercialize Altria\u2019s e-vapor products internationally and PMI is providing exclusive rights to two of its innovative next-generation products to Altria for commercialization in the U.S.","We have also agreed to cooperate with PMI on scientific assessment, regulatory engagement and sharing of improvements regarding these products. We view these agreements as mutually beneficial to us and PMI and an important opportunity to advance Altria\u2019s development of innovative products for adult tobacco consumers.","2013 was a successful year for Altria. We delivered against our strategy to maximize the core tobacco business while innovating and investing to grow revenue streams for the future. Altria delivered 2013 total shareholder return of 28.6%, which outpace the S&P food, beverage and tobacco indexes return to 22.9%.","Looking ahead to 2014, our core tobacco businesses are well positioned to deliver strong income growth through their leading premium brands. We also expect to benefit from lower interest expense, a lower effective tax rate and a reduction in shares from our ongoing current share repurchase program. However, we plan to make disciplined and incremental investments to build our e-vapor business, and we anticipate continued variability in gains from asset sales at Philip Morris Capital Corporation.","Finally, although some economic indicators are improving, adult tobacco consumers continue to face challenges. Altria thus forecasts its 2014 adjusted diluted EPS will increase by 6% to 9% to a range of $2.52 to $2.59 from its 2013 days of $2.38.","I\u2019ll now turn things over to Howard, who will discuss our business results in more detail.","Howard A. Willard III","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. As Marty mentioned, each of our reportable segments grew adjusted operating company\u2019s income in 2013. Notably each of the segment also expanded adjusted operating company\u2019s income margins through solid price realization and a continued focus on cost management.","Although we have concluded the $400 million cost reduction program, we will continue to focus on carefully managing costs in 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the smokeable product segments reported operating company\u2019s increased 4.5% to $1.6 billion, primarily driven by higher pricing lower selling, general and administrative costs and lower restructuring charges partially offset our lower reported shipment volume.","The segments fourth quarter adjusted operating company\u2019s income grew 3.6% and its adjusted operating company\u2019s income margins grew 2.2 percentage points to 42.1%. For the full year, Altria\u2019s sociable product segments grew reported operating company\u2019s income 13.2% to over $7 billion, primarily through higher pricing. PM USA\u2019s non-participating manufacturer\u2019s adjustment settlement and the NPM Arbitration Panel Decision as well as lower selling, general and administrative expenses.","These factors were partially offset by lower reported shipment volume and higher resolution expense. Excluding the impact of items detailed in today\u2019s press release including the NPM adjustment items, adjusted operating company\u2019s income increased 2.4% in 2013 to approximately $6.4 billion. For the full year, sociable product segments adjusted operating company\u2019s income margins increased one percentage point to 42.2% in 2013.","Over the last couple of years PM USA estimates its cigarette category volumes have declined at a rate of 3% to 4%, and we believe that trend continued in 2013. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors PM USA estimates that its domestic cigarette shipment volumes decreased approximately 4% for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2013 and that the category also declined approximately 4%.","Marlboro's fourth quarter retail share grew by 0.2 of a share point to 43.7%. PM USA's total share of the cigarette category was up 0.3 of a share point to 50.7% for the quarter. Marlboro's retail share was 43.7% for the full year as well. Share gains by Marlboro and L&M were partially offset by share losses another portfolio brands. In 2013 L&M continued to gain retail share as the total discount segment was flat to declining.","In total PM USA achieved a 50.6% share of the cigarette category in 2013, up from 50.3% in 2012. We are pleased to the performance of both PM USA and Marlboro especially in light of competitive line extensions and price promotions in the second half of 2013.","In the machine made large cigar category Middleton's volume decreased 3.2% for the full year. Black & Mild declined 1.3 retail share points driven by heightened competitive activity from low-priced cigar brands. Middleton adjusted its plans during the year and moderated its decline rate although the competitive environment remains difficult. For the fourth quarter Middleton's volume increased 8.5%. Black & Mild's retail share was down 0.7 of a share point in the fourth quarter.","Turning to smokeless products in the fourth quarter reported operating company\u2019s income for the segment was essentially flat, while adjusted OCI increased by 1.2% primarily driven by higher pricing and offset by higher promotional investments and lower volume. For the full year the smokeless product segment delivered reported operating company\u2019s income growth of 9.9% and adjusted OCI growth of 7% to over $1 billion, due primarily to higher pricing, increased volume, lower restructuring charges and effective cost management. These factors were partially offset by higher promotional spending and mix.","Smokeless products segments adjusted operating companies income margins grew by 1.5 percentage points to 62.3% for 2013. Due to calendar differences, the smokeless product segment had one less shipping day in the fourth quarter and the full year of 2013, representing approximately one full week of volume, which affected reported shipments for both periods.","In particular, Copenhagen and Skoal combined reported shipment volume was down 3.5% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, Copenhagen and Skoal combined reported shipment volume increased 4.3%.","After adjusting for calendar difference, trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC and PMUSA estimate their smokeless shipment volume grew 5% and that the smokeless category volume for both periods grew at a rate of approximately 5.5%.","For the full year, USSTC grew combined Copenhagen and Skoal retail share by 0.3 of a share point to 50.7% supported by product expansions over the past several years included Copenhagen Winter Green and the southern blend.","Ste.

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi. Please go ahead.","Vivien Nicole Azer \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Hi, good morning.","Martin J. Barrington","","Hi, Vivien.","","Vivien Nicole Azer \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","My first question has to do with your outlook for 2014 and specifically for the U.S. cigarette category combustibles. Can you offer a little color on how you\u2019re thinking about category volumes for the year?","Martin J. Barrington","","Well, as you know, we don't forecast volume going forward, but I can tell you that what we see over the last several years is that the cigarette volume declines have been in the range of 3% to 4% and we\u2019ve gone through our model on that of both secular decline and some pricing elasticity. That's what we see basically in 2013, the continuation of that trend and we don't see any particular drivers in 2013 that caused us to believe any differently about that.","Vivien Nicole Azer \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","That\u2019s fair. Given kind of the state of the consumer, do you think it\u2019s fair to say that volume declines will probably come in at the lower end of that range like it did in 2013?","Martin J. Barrington","","Well, it\u2019s hard to say going forward. I do think that a word or two about the consumer is important. It\u2019s a good question. The macro trends are improving in some domains, but the way we look at our business is always \u2013 well, half of those macro trends impact our adult tobacco consumer. And so, I can tell you how we\u2019re thinking about it is that unemployment remains unfortunately high at about what \u2013 six, seven underemployment is higher than that. Labor participation rates are not robust and as you know the adult tobacco consumer tends to over index in those domains. So it\u2019s hard to find a lot of encouragement there.","Consumer confidence generally is up, but it\u2019s nowhere around where we\u2019d like to see it, which is difficult for us, say 100 before the recession hit. We watch housing starts pretty carefully. We see some improvements in the housing figures, but again they\u2019re far below where they should be. So we\u2019re always hopeful that the economy is going to improve for everyone. It\u2019s just hard to find a lot of drivers that cause us to believe that for the adult tobacco consumer 2014 is going to look very much different than 2013.","Vivien Nicole Azer \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","That makes a lot of sense to me. One last one please. On the competitive landscape, you cited since that competitive activity in the back half. Would you categorize that as relatively rational? Are you seeing any shift in kind of competitive bolstering?","Martin J. Barrington","","Well, I\u2019d say what I always say about this. This is a business that has always been competitive. It was competitive in 2013. Our plan assumes that the businesses will continue to be competitive. I think what\u2019s important though I think is to have \u2013 look at how PM USA is able to navigate through that environment. We had very good price realization as you saw last year. We had margin expansion, grew adjusted OCI to nearly $6.5 billion, modestly grew Marlboro share, modestly grew overall PM USA share and that was at a time when we continue to invest in our plans like through the Marlboro architecture. So what I would say, Vivien, even though it\u2019s competitive it\u2019s an environment in which PM USA and has been able to really effectively operate on its strategy, had very good results in 2013.","Vivien Nicole Azer \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington","","Thanks for your call, Vivien.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Martin J. Barrington","","Good morning, David.","David J. Adelman \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","I had two questions, Marty. The first, can you explain or speak to this gap in the fourth quarter between your cigarette shipments down 5.8% and your estimate that the underlying consumption was down 4% and I asked that in the context that the timing of your \u2013 end of your price increases both years were fairly similar.","Martin J. Barrington","","Yes. This comes up from time to time. I think we talked about this actually in the first quarter if memory serves. It really is the difference in trade inventory movements and other factors, but the trade inventory movements, as you know, make a big difference. If you look at it throughout the quarter though, on an adjusted basis or for the full year, David, on an adjusted basis, we\u2019re confident that it\u2019s about 4%. The pricing is, I remember, for the quarter was \u2013 I think PM USA announced its pricing, I think the last week of November this quarter to have become effective around the first of the year and though when we model that out that\u2019s what it looks like to us.","David J. Adelman \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Marty, with respect to MarkTen, could you speak to the market share you\u2019ve been able to generate in the geographies in which you\u2019re competing, what the trajectory of your market share has been in those markets? And also because the spending, considering the P&L wasn\u2019t insignificant this year and you are calling out that as a potential headwind in 2014, what\u2019s the potential opportunity that you\u2019re calibrating, you\u2019re spending against?","Martin J. Barrington","","Yes, that\u2019s a great question about MarkTen. Thanks for asking it. Look we have about a month\u2019s worth of data and so I don\u2019t want to roll out numbers. We\u2019ll have more to say about this in CAGNY, which is coming up and I hope to have some numbers to show you there. What I can tell you is that we have a plan that we\u2019ve set out in Arizona, the same way we did in Indiana really about what we\u2019re trying to learn. That\u2019s how you do test markets in a disciplined kind of way and I think we have very good plan in place to learn, and what we\u2019ve learned is so far we wanted to get broad distribution of our MarkTen product at retail and our sales force has done a great job of doing that. As I mentioned in the remarks, we\u2019re in about 1,900 stores there. We wanted to find out trade acceptance and I can tell you the trade acceptance of the product is enthusiastic and so we\u2019re learning a lot about working with the trade there.","I can tell you we like the MarkTen product a lot. It is a terrific product. We think we have a good offering and we believe if we can get it in the hands of consumers that they will think so too. And so we have a revised promotion plan that is setting us out to do exactly that. I can assure you when we enter these test markets though we had very specific goals we\u2019re setting out to answer and to learn from. We have metrics that we have put in place to know whether we\u2019re achieving them and then of course we\u2019re always looking to try to leverage those learnings as we did, for example, from Indiana to Arizona about learning our way forward.","We believe that\u2019s the right way forward in emerging categories. We try to learn wisely and we try to learn it in a disciplined kind of way. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about Arizona. And again, I hope that we will have more for you at CAGNY about that.","David J. Adelman \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Okay, thanks. See you then.","Martin J. Barrington","","Thanks for calling in.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington","Good morning Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","My first question is on Marlboro and I guess I\u2019m trying to get a sense of the overall health of your Marlboro franchise in light of the recent line expansions with Edge and then NXT earlier last year. How incremental were these lines and how well did your core Marlboro perform and then any learning\u2019s from these extensions and how full edge in your Marlboro innovation pipeline for this year?","Martin J. Barrington","Yes, well, we think Marlboro performed terrifically and we\u2019ve talked from time to time about its brand equity using a variety of measures. I won\u2019t repeat them all here, you know what they are in terms of the scale in terms of being the largest brand everywhere, in terms of being able to have a really premium price gap that\u2019s been constant despite the ad recessions and FET\u2019s and so forth and so on.","When we will allow Marlboro extensions, we always check to make sure that they are incremental to the equity of Marlboro and so when we bring out products like NXT or we bring out products like Edge, we\u2019re confident that they are adding to the Marlboro equity and we measure that as you know Bonnie overtime. This has been the most successful brand in the category for decades and our approach continues to be that to do that over time.","We\u2019ve spoken before about the number of SKUs in Marlboro. We don\u2019t bring them willy-nilly. We try to make sure that there is a consumer demand for them there. And of course, we\u2019re always trying to attract adult competitive smokers and I think that PM USA has done a very good job with that both over time and in 2013.","Bonnie L. Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks for that. And then I wanted to ask you a little more about the agreement you\u2019ve reached with Philip Morris International, and you think it\u2019s like a very big opportunity. So could you talk a little bit more about this opportunity as well as timing and next step and also how should we think about the potential upside to your earnings and the relative payment you\u2019ll receive as PMI rolled out your e-cig technology internationally? And then finally as you work into the future could you talk about how you envision your reduced risk portfolio evolving?","Martin J. Barrington","Okay, there is a lot there. Let me see if I can impact that a little bit for us. It is an important step forward and I appreciate your asking about it. From the Altria perspective, as I was just discussing with David, we really like our technology in e-vapor. We think we\u2019ve done a very good job with that, and so it\u2019s great that we have an opportunity to partner with PMI so that it can be sold in international markets. As you know PMI is a terrific company. We have a higher regard for it. It has global scale, it has global infrastructure. And I think putting our technology in PMI hands to trying to sell that to a adult vapors elsewhere in the world is a good thing for Altria, it\u2019s good thing for PMI.","I think, in addition, as we\u2019ve spoken about previously, our innovation strategy for adult tobacco consumers is to offer them a variety of products that are innovative from conventional products and may hold out the promise, if FDA where able to approve them of reduced harm and that's exactly what PMI has been working on with its NGP platforms one and two. So we now have those in our portfolio through this agreement and as PMI and with our support work on FDA it\u2019s an extremely important strategic step forward for harm reduction, I think for consumers and we're hopeful about that.","In terms of contribution to earnings, I think it\u2019s early there. There are royalty agreements in place, but really I think this is more about getting the products in each other\u2019s hands and seeing if we can bring them to adult tobacco consumers and see if they will take themselves.","From our perspective that's the way we\u2019re thinking about innovation. We follow the consumer. The consumer will decide about the innovative products. Our job is to invent them, to commercialize them, and to work with the FDA where appropriate to make sure that they make it to market. So that's kind of our strategy in a nutshell.","Bonnie L. Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks for that.","Martin J. Barrington","Thanks Bonnie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies LLC","","Good morning, everybody.","Martin J. Barrington","","Thilo.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Just a follow-up on the MarkTen question. In your base business case for MarkTen, what level of indoor usage restrictions is built into that base business model?","","Martin J. Barrington","You broke up just a little bit Thilo. Say it again.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Oh, sorry. For the base business case for MarkTen what level of usage restriction is similar to smoking ban? What level of user instructions you have included in that base business case for MarkTen?","Martin J. Barrington","Yes, we have modeled out basically three scenarios. We don't know there are some unknowns obviously in e-vapor and innovation generally. They regard excise taxes, technology improvements and then the regulatory situation. So, rather than to have a [indiscernible] we have three cases where we assume there is varying degrees of flexibility or regulation there, so we\u2019ve actually done three cases.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies LLC","And what's the assumption for the base case?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, I\u2019m not going into get into the proprietary nature of how we\u2019ve modeled it out. I think it's fair to say though that if there is a general belief by the regulators and others that moved into e-vapor is a good thing for adult tobacco consumers. You can assume that there will be greater migration than less.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Fair enough. And then, in your outlook for fiscal 2014 or calendar 2014 what impact will the end of the tobacco grower buyout have on the competitive landscape, what's your expectation there?","","Martin J. Barrington","Howard?","Howard A. Willard III ","Yes, I mean I think with regard to the end of the quarter, it happens really the impact of the fourth quarter of 2014 and that really occurs across the industry, so I think it\u2019s a cost reduction opportunity really across the sector in the U.S. With regard to how the various players react to that cost reduction I think we\u2019ll have to wait and see how that plays out but of course, we continue to be focused on our strategy in the smokeable segment of maximizing profitability while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro and clearly that cost reduction is an opportunity.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies LLC","So there is no assumption that \u2013 yet that you would be willing to share whether you can be able to keep that cost reduction or whether you have to pass it on to smokers given the competitive environment?","Martin J. Barrington ","Yes, I think we\u2019re not going to share kind of our plan at that level of detail, but certainly that is one of items that\u2019s baked into our overall guidance for the year.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay and then last question I have for you. Can you give us an update on your strategy and plans for L&M? I think so far you\u2019ve always commented that it was supposed to offset the share losses for Basic, is that still the case or is that maybe something more ambitious in place for L&M?","Martin J. Barrington ","No, I think it\u2019s pretty much as we described it before deal \u2013 there are some people who participate in the discount segment that\u2019s not our focus of course, but we want to have an offering there. L&M is the offering that we give them our retailer, trade partners in particular who like for us to have a good discount for them, but we\u2019re not trying to grow the discount category. That\u2019s not our focus.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington","","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Hessler with Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","[indiscernible] for Greg.","Martin J. Barrington ","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Quick question about your \u2013 good morning. Quick question for you about kind of your debt plans and capital structure plans going forward. I know you guys did the tender at the end of last year as well as paying down that maturity. What are your plans for the upcoming maturity and do you and kind of as a follow-up to that do you have any more liability management plans going on in the future?","Martin J. Barrington ","I think we\u2019re pretty pleased with the progress we made on our balance sheet. We\u2019ve got our weighted average interest cost down to 5.9%. And we feel pretty comfortable with our current credit ratings as well as our current debt to EBITDA ratio. So I don\u2019t know that I would communicate anything beyond the fact that we\u2019ve been following a pretty consistent strategy over time to bring our interest rate down, we think we\u2019ve been successful and we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities in the future to improve that, but we\u2019re certainly not going to share anything at the detailed level about changes in the short-term.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington","","Thank you for calling in.","","Operator","","Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with CLSA.","Michael S. Lavery \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington","","Hi, Michael.","Michael S. Lavery \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","","So your press release in smokeable in the quarter was good, it was roughly about the pace it's been all year or even a slight uptick from 3Q even despite that the competitive launch of Newport Gold. What are you seeing kind of in the marketplace there and can you compare or contrast that to when Newport Red would have launched?","Martin J. Barrington","","Well, I guess maybe I\u2019ll take it up a level. We did have good price realizations. You could see both \u2013 we had all the quarters then above 4% for the year. So I think this is consistent with what Howard just said about trying to maximize income in the smokeable segment. It is always a balance between growing income and watching the share. And I think PM USA did a good job of that and I expect a good job of that in 2014. Manufacturers do launch products into the market from time to time, you do see promotional pricing as they try to gain adult tobacco consumer awareness. That's just part of the usual backdrop of how the business gets done, Michael.","Michael S. Lavery \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","","All right, that's helpful, thanks. And somewhat related on the margins you had a strong list in that segment as well, against a decent comparison and even stronger one the year before. Is there anything specifically driving that or part of what I\u2019d love to get a little color onto is the fourth quarters gone from one of the lowest margin quarters in the year, so one of the higher ones, is there any shifts you have made in kind of the operations or is it just getting some better pricing there. What's been driving that?","Howard A. Willard III","","Yes. I wouldn't put too much into kind of quarter to quarter variations in the cost trend. I would probably tend to look at this full year of 2013 compared to the prior year to get a better estimate. You certainly \u2013 you\u2019re pointing out to the fact that we had and above trend for the quarters, cost reduction in the fourth quarter. But I think that has more to do with just the way the spending unfolded on a quarter by quarter basis, and of course we're always managing to a full year. So I don't think there is anything significant that I would call out there was a change in trend.","Michael S. Lavery \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on the review process for the dealing regulations with the FDA, it\u2019s been that OMB now for a few \u2013close to months. Is there any involvement you have with them or any visibility you have on that process or is that a little bit of kind of a black box.","Martin J. Barrington","","Yes, I mean we said before we had lots of ongoing relationships with the Agency and also with OMB and others. But I just don't have anything to offer you on that. You are exactly right, splendid [ph] OMB and there have been periodic announcements that is coming, but we haven\u2019t seen it and we haven\u2019t heard \u2013 really heard much about when it might be coming other than what they have said.","Michael S. Lavery \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Now, okay that\u2019s helpful. And then just one last one on e-cigarettes in terms of how you think about a broader launch internationally. Is it just a question of getting the learning and the products in the sort of toned or is there any capacity issues or what are the sort of things that would trigger that international launch?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, we haven\u2019t said anything about that and I won\u2019t this morning, but we have a disciplined way of learning our way in, all of the factors you mentioned of course are important to make sure that we would know, if and when we decide to do that. We want to make sure that product offering would be right and the branding is right and the promotion is right. We just think about this through our value equation that you heard us talk about before and certainly you want to make sure the capacity is in line.","Michael S. Lavery \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Great, thank you.","Martin J. Barrington","Michael thanks for calling in.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington","Good morning, Judy.","Judy E. Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","So Marty just wanted to go back to your 2014 outlook, between the interest expenses coming down the lower taxes and the share buyback benefit. It seems like the operating income growth in 2014 is expected to be pretty modest, and I understand you caught out some of the headwinds, but let\u2019s just hoping to get some more perspective, and is this really the set of spending that\u2019s causing a bit of a slowdown in terms of the operating profit growth. How should we think about that in the context of your guidance?","Martin J. Barrington","Yes, thanks for asking. Listen, we have a good plan for 2014, I like the plans of our operating company\u2019s, I think they have done a good job at that, but it\u2019s the factors that we identified for you really that we are trying to explain, which is we do had some headwinds in terms of making investments in the innovative space. And then we do have variability, I\u2019m going to ask Howard to comment in this. We have variability in the capital core contributions from time to time, you want to talk about that, Howard?","","Howard A. Willard III","","Sure, I mean I think we\u2019ve communicated this before that as we \u2013 in wine and PMCC not only does the lease income come down over time, but there are asset sales that equate variable on a year-to-year basis. And certainly in 2013 we had quite strong asset sales after settling some of the tax issues of the IRS on the LILO, SILO leases. We found the opportunity to sell several of those assets in 2013. So I think that certainly one of the drivers of the comparison from 2014 to 2013 is some of the lumpiness in PMCC\u2019s income. And then I think the second thing is that while certainly we made investments in 2013 towards competing effectively in the e-cigarette category. We are certainly planning in 2014 to make further investments as we focus on being successful in that emerging new category.","Judy E. Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Okay. And then just may be a bit of a follow-up on MarkTen and just the e-vapor category generally Marty. As you obviously participate in the broader tobacco category, how do you sort of think about, you know how you build equity, brand equity in e-vapor category versus cigarettes or smokeless, are there some differences, similarities that you can call out and you know your thought process and thinking about how to invest in that particular product or category.","Martin J. Barrington","","Yeah, I actually \u2013 that\u2019s a terrific question. The brands obviously that have been in the take the cigarette category have obviously been out there for sometime and brand equity as you is built over time. Marlboro\u2019s equity has been built over decades and because everyone is now launching products and trying to gain brand equity, it will take sometime. I think one of the advantages that some players will have is those that know how to build brands, will have an advantage here. I would argue that Altria and its operating companies have a long and a rich heritage of being able to built brand, that\u2019s one.","Two I think is making sure that you are just being consumer centric. You always have to start with a consumer, you have to get it in the offering that they want and then you build equity off of that platform. So that\u2019s how we think about it at least, but its early days in e-vapor, it\u2019s going to take some time for a lot of things to sort itself out and it will take time for equity to be build in this category just like most others.","Judy E. Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","And the two test markets that you have entered Marty, have you noticed the pick up in the category growth in those markets as you have entered in those markets.","Martin J. Barrington","We obviously Arizona is very, very early. We\u2019ll have some data to share about this, I expect at CAGNY, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of looking at those numbers at this time. But we will try to get that information for you.","Judy E. Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay, thank you.","","Martin J. Barrington","Judy, thanks for calling.","Operator","We will now take questions from the media. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital.","Nik H. Modi \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning guys.","Martin J. Barrington","Hi, Nik.","Nik H. Modi \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","So just two quick questions, Marty, there\u2019s been a lot of talk honestly about e-cigarettes, and different shift from regular cigarettes, but if you really look at the underlying trend and then go back kind of rolling over the last two years, looks like for this particular year in 2013. The category declined, it has moderated as year progressed despite e-cigarettes growing as faster as they\u2019ve been growing. And I wonder that you can just provide some big picture thoughts on that.","And then the second question which is more specific to Arizona, can you talk about some of the product changes that you have made to MarkTen, direct with the Indiana just kind of talk about some of the modifications that makes the product? Thanks.","Howard A. Willard III","","Sure. Thanks for the question. We continue to look carefully at the growth of e-cigarettes and its potential effect on cigarette volumes and we continue to believe that it\u2019s modest. It\u2019s obviously is a category that has grown very fast and you\u2019re right. It gets a lot of attention. But we believe it\u2019s probably still in the secular decline rate, which we\u2019d estimated to be 2% to 3%, which makes up a variety of things which is lower incidents, fewer cigarettes per day \u2013 people babbling and pipe tobacco. We believe that the e-cigarette number is probably in that number.","With respect to Arizona, we made a couple of changes that are probably worth mentioning. One of them is we put a new flavor system and we think it significantly enhanced the censorial experience. We changed the bundle that we were offering including a charger in the kit, and I think those things have been extremely well received by the consumer today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Gowe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Martin J. Barrington","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Growe \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, just a two questions for you. I want to ask first, maybe bit of a follow-up to the question earlier, and how can I get a response from the variability in PMCC. If you were to look at the fourth quarter where that division turned to a loss, is that \u2013 I just wanted to be clear or maybe you can categorize this. Was it the heavy investments in e-cigarettes, was that something like kind of a dramatic mover in the quarter or is it more about the volatility in PMCC that caused that to turn to a loss in the quarter?","Howard A. Willard III","","Yes, certainly I would say that the year-over-year kind of variance there was driven by both PMCC and e-cigarette, but I would tell you that the Arizona test market given that that a lot of that investment occurred in the fourth quarter was certainly a driver.","Christopher Growe \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And so would you then expect that division in 2014, just from your commentary, to be down in profitability noting the investments that are making plus the volatility at PMCC?","Howard A. Willard III","","Yes, I think as we indicated in kind of the guidance paragraph, we do expect to make incremental investments in the e-vapor business in 2014 compared to 2013.","Christopher Growe \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just a follow-up question on new products and we had a pretty slow process around the substantial equivalence approval you got from the FDA, and so I just was curious for Philip Morris USA. You had a good bit of activity, new productivity in that division. The longer this takes for SE applications, is it putting the division at more of a disadvantage going forward, which \u2013 do you have less than the half or if you will and you need more sort of activity from FDA on SE application?","Martin J. Barrington","We\u2019re actually in pretty good shape I would tell you and we continue to interact with the FDA regularly about our SE applications. So I think, well, everyone would like to see more outcomes from the Agency I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape, Chris.","Christopher Growe \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","","Okay. And if I could ask one follow-up which is just \u2013 you characterize the inventory change in the fourth quarter. If you said I didn\u2019t hear because you characterize the inventory levels. Are you at the right levels you were or at where you were a year ago with the fourth quarter given that change that occurred in the quarter?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, the inventory levels of cigarettes ended the quarter lower in 2013 than it did a year ago what we were trying to phase it.","Christopher Growe \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","","Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington","Thanks for talking.","Operator","","Our final question comes from the line Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Yes. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington","Good morning.","Bonnie L. Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the smokeless category, it looks like your reported volume was down through the quarter and through the year, but I didn\u2019t hear you talk about with some adjustments. Shipment volume, you estimate, actually grew about 5%.","Martin J. Barrington","Right.","Bonnie L. Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Can you help us reconcile the difference there?","Martin J. Barrington","Sure. The principal difference was, I think, in both the fourth quarter and in 2013 there was one fewer shipping day and in the smokeless business it had to be a Monday when a lot of the volume goes out. So it\u2019s roughly equivalent to a shipping week and that basically explains it, few other factors, but it\u2019s basically that movement.","Bonnie L. Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington","Thanks for calling.","Operator","","Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Sarah Knakmus for closing comments.","Sarah Knakmus","","Okay. Thank you everyone for joining our call this morning. If you have any follow-up questions please contact us at Investor Relations. Just a reminder, Altria will present at CAGNY and the presentation will be webcast. Thank you again.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Marshall (00:58), Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.","Unverified Participant","Thank you, Lori. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria's CEO; and Billy Gifford, our CFO, to discuss Altria's 2016 fourth quarter and full year business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing these results, which is available on our website at altria.com and through the Altria investor app.","During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same periods in 2015. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.","Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.","Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Bill (2:25). Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report that Altria had another outstanding year. In 2016, we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 8.2%, in line with our long-term objectives, while returning a large amount of cash to shareholders, improving our balance sheet and strengthening our organizational capability, thus well positioning Altria to continue to deliver on our long-term goals.","During 2016, we also rewarded our shareholders by paying out over $4.5 billion in dividends, raising our dividend by 8% and repurchasing over $1 billion of our shares under an expanded $3 billion share repurchase program.","Since the beginning of 2011, we have returned over $28 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And our dividend payout ratio of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS is among the highest in our peer group.","In 2016, we strengthened our balance sheet by tendering for high coupon debt and refinancing it with lower coupon longer maturity debt. And in October with Altria's support of Anheuser-Busch InBev's landmark business combination with SABMiller, we enhanced the value of our beer investment and our position in the global brewing profit pool.","We continue also to improve our operating efficiency, through a $300 million Productivity Initiative announced in January 2016, and a separate $50 million manufacturing consolidation plan announced in October. These efforts and others have strengthened our organization, streamlined our business processes, and provided greater autonomy to our business leaders in this dynamic environment.","For 2016, Altria delivered a total shareholder return of 20.5%, marking the fourth consecutive year that total shareholder return has exceeded 20%. And over the last five years, Altria's total shareholder return was 187%, significantly outpacing both the S&P 500 and the S&P Food, Beverage and Tobacco Index. All these results are made possible by our dedicated and talented employees, so I want to thank them all.","Here are some operating highlights. The smokeable products segment produced another year of strong results on the strength and consistency of its leading premium brands. Adjusted operating companies income grew by 5.3% for the year, primarily through higher pricing and effective cost management. The smokeable segment delivered this growth despite very difficult comparisons to last year when it grew adjusted OCI nearly 11%.","For the year, PM USA gained one tenth of a retail share point to 51.4%, and Marlboro maintained retail share near record levels at 44%. PM USA continues to bring innovative products, packaging and adult consumer engagement activities to the market to reinforce Marlboro's vibrancy and relevance.","For example, the national expansion of Marlboro Menthol Slate, a bold menthol product featuring PM USA's innovative soft touch ink packaging is receiving positive feedback from our trade partners.","Last month, we further enhanced our smokeable products segment by acquiring Nat Sherman. Nat Sherman has an excellent and differentiated brand portfolio, which complements the brands in Altria's smokeable products segment. Nat Sherman brands will benefit from the retail distribution, brand management and adult tobacco consumer engagement expertise of Altria's companies. Integration and business plans are already well underway, and we welcome the Nat Sherman team of employees to the Altria family of companies.","In cigars, Middleton maintained its leadership position in the profitable tipped segment, posting strong full year volume growth on the strength of the Black & Mild brand.","Turning to the smokeless products segment. USSTC delivered a terrific year. The segment grew adjusted OCI 11% for the year, driven by higher pricing and volume, partially offset by higher cost and mix. Consistent with this strategy, USSTC grew retail share of Copenhagen and Skoal combined by 0.9 of a share point to 52.2%, the highest full year share since we acquired USSTC. Our portfolio strategy has enhanced Copenhagen and Skoal's competitive positioning and improved USSTC's efficiency and profitability.","In 2016, Copenhagen continued to build on its position as the smokeless category's largest brand with the successful national expansion of Copenhagen Mint. Copenhagen is also the fastest growing smokeless tobacco brand posting a 2.2 retail share point gain for the year, more than offsetting Skoal's 1.3 share point decline.","Product innovation was also a focus area in 2016. In e-vapor, Nu Mark made excellent progress this year toward achieving its long-term aspiration of becoming a leader in the e-vapor category. Nu Mark's disciplined test and learn approach to MarkTen's national expansion continues to gain traction. At year end, MarkTen was available in stores, representing about 55% of the e-vapor category volume in retail channels, including c-stores.","In heated tobacco, Altria continues to partner with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications for IQOS. In December, PMI submitted a modified risk tobacco product application to the FDA for the heated tobacco product that PM USA will commercialize in the U.S. under our agreement with PMI. PMI plans to file the premarket tobacco product application during the first quarter of 2017 and concurrently, PM USA continues to develop its U.S. plans.","For example, a commercialization team is now dedicated to preparing for the launch of IQOS in the U.S., including working closely with PMI, as it gains trade and consumer insights from other markets.","In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered another strong year on the performance of its premium brands with adjusted operating income growth of nearly 10%. For the second consecutive year, Ste. Michelle's premium wines received more than 260 ratings of 90 or better.","In October, AB InBev completed its business combination with SABMiller, with Altria ultimately securing a 10.2% ownership in AB InBev. This transaction enhanced the value of Altria's beer investment and we expect it to deliver strong long-term financial returns to our shareholders.","So to sum up, 2016 was another excellent year for our strong premium brands, our companies and our shareholders. We achieved significant milestones against an ambitious plan and we believe that we have positioned Altria well for continued future success.","Let's turn for a moment to the regulatory environment. As you know, we continue to work closely with the FDA as it builds out its regulatory framework. One area is our company's substantial equivalence applications both for provisional and new products, so one of our priorities is to resolve those applications and the pace of work there has picked up.","Second, for cigars in e-vapor, we're preparing the product applications now required by the deeming regulations and continuing to advocate for sensible interpretations consistent with the act.","Third, our companies continue to develop new and innovative products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer expectations, including products that advance tobacco harm reduction. This too requires advocating FDA and others to support and foster innovation that will benefit adult consumers. We expect to step-up in investments because of these activities.","As you've seen from our press release, we expect to grow our full year adjusted EPS for 2017 to a range of $3.26 to $3.32, representing growth of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS base of $3.03. So we expect another strong year for Altria.","It may be helpful to share some further color on how we're thinking about that. So to begin, we're expecting continued strong performance from our operating companies and we believe that the macroeconomic environment remains largely constructive for adult tobacco consumers. We also will have the benefit of reporting four full quarters of equity earnings from AB InBev.","On the other hand, we've seen some cigarette volume declines reverting back to more long-term norms. We also know that in April, California, a high volume state will implement significantly higher excise taxes and there are already proposals in several states to raise excise taxes further.","And finally, we've taken into account an expected increase in our effective tax rate for 2017, which Billy will explain in a moment. The most important point is that we are entering 2017 with very good momentum from last year and are expecting another year of growth in line with our long-term financial goals.","And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Marty and, good morning, everyone. Our operating companies delivered solid results in the fourth quarter. In the smokeable products segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI grew by 3.7%, and adjusted OCI margins increased by 2 percentage points, both driven by higher net pricing and lower benefits cost.","For the year, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 1.8 percentage points to 48.2%, driven by higher net pricing and lower benefits cost, partially offset by higher resolution expenses.","PM USA maintained its leading retail position in the fourth quarter. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 4.8% in the quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline and one fewer shipping day. After adjusting for calendar differences, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately 3.5% in the quarter, and that total industry cigarette volumes also declined by approximately 3.5%.","For the year, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined approximately 2.5% and that total industry volume also declined by approximately 2.5%. Over the last three quarters, we are seeing the cigarette industry volume decline rate gradually revert to more long-term historical norms.","In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the profitable tipped segment continues to yield strong results. Middleton's volumes were up 5.3% in the fourth quarter and 5.9% for the full year.","In the smokeless products segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI grew by 4.3%, driven by higher net pricing and volume, partially offset by higher cost. Fourth quarter adjusted OCI margins decreased by 2 percentage points, due primarily to higher manufacturing costs and promotional investments.","For the year, adjusted OCI margins expanded seven-tenths of a percentage point to 64.4%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix, higher manufacturing cost, and higher promotional investments.","In the fourth quarter, USSTC grew volume ahead of the category growth rate, and increased Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share by 1.1 share points to 52.5 share points (sic) [52.5%]. USSTC's reported shipment volume increased 2.2% in the quarter and 4.9% for the year.","After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its shipment volume grew by approximately 4.5% in the quarter and 5% for the year. This growth is well ahead of the estimated industry volume growth of approximately 2.5% over the past six months.","In wine, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by 16.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.9% for the year. Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volume grew 4.2% in the quarter and 5.3% for the year.","Let me pickup on the tax issue Marty mentioned when discussing our guidance for 2017. For a variety of reasons, we expect that our 2017 full year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 36% compared to 34.7% for 2016. One of these reasons is because we anticipate fewer foreign tax credits related to AB InBev dividends. Though technical, this is driven by differences in the profit pools between AB InBev and the former SABMiller.","That wraps up our results. Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we've posted, for your reference, a usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.","Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Investors, analysts and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for much for taking my question.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","So, obviously, your main competitor has agreed to be taken over and there's been speculation with respect to your sales. I was wondering, my first question is, can you outline what you would see as the advantages and the disadvantages of being part of a bigger tobacco group? Because there must be some advantages and there must be some disadvantages.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","No, I think I'm going to steer away from that topic, Adam. As we've discussed previously, I think it's just not appropriate for me to be drawn into either anyone else's transactions or speculation about future transactions. I just don't really know how to discuss that intelligently without going there. So I'm afraid I won't do that.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you. It's a clear and sensible answer I would say. Moving on to the domestic cigarette industry, I was wondering if you could talk about a little bit and give some color about how you're seeing the pricing environments? Particularly in the light of the fact that Imperial has said, if anything, it wants to invest a little bit more in pricing to grow market share perhaps a little bit faster. And also in the light of the fact that, at least according to the scanner data, Reynolds market share has stopped growing and is perhaps declined. So it's really a question about the pricing environment in the light of that. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yep. Thanks for calling in. I appreciate your questions. I won't talk about anyone else's pricing, but I can tell you how we think about pricing and the numbers that we put out I think demonstrate it. Listen, for us, we're a publicly-traded company. We have growth aspirations and our Master Settlement Agreement payment goes up every year and we have FDA payments that go up every year. And our principal income contributor is the cigarette category where the volume goes down. So the strategy there for us is to take appropriate pricing in order that we can grow in line with our aspirations. And we've been able to do that. You've seen that pricing for the year in the smokeable segment of about 4%. If you look at it slightly longer periods, Adam, I think it's on average somewhere between 4% and 5% \u2013 it bounces there \u2013 and that algorithm works for us in terms of the profitability we expect from the smokeable segment. So that's how we think about pricing.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.","Owen M. Bennett - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys. Hope all are well.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Owen.","Owen M. Bennett - Jefferies LLC","And just two questions, please. Firstly, I was wondering if you could be a bit more specific on expectations for cigarette industry volume into fiscal year 2017. And secondly, could you comment on the current share and share trends of Nat Sherman and then what are your realistic expectations for the brand going forward? Thanks a lot.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. Good questions, both. Listen, I think you know we don't guide on volume, but Billy made reference to this in his prepared remarks. For the year, on an adjusted basis, we've got volume down for us at about 2.5%. But obviously, the declines were higher in the back half of the year than they were in the first half of the year. And you're familiar with all the reasons for that, I know, so I won't repeat them. So we've taken that into account as we thought about our plan for the year. And in addition, of course, we mentioned we've got the California excise tax coming online in April and we've been mindful of that.","Listen, we're really happy about the Nat Sherman acquisition. They have a terrific team of people over there. They have a very complementary brand portfolio to us. It's a small share position as you know. It's much more of a niche position. But we believe that when we combine their talented people and brands with the system that we have in terms of retail distribution and brand expertise that we can really make this grow quite nicely. So we haven't put out any targets on that, as you can appreciate from a competitive point of view. But it's a very nice addition to the smokeable segment for us and we're really excited about it.","Owen M. Bennett - Jefferies LLC","Cool. Thanks very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Owen. Good to hear your voice.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So two questions for me, please. First, Marty, your commentary about your constructive view on the consumer heading into 2017. Just curious your thoughts on how a potential border adjusted tax would impact that view. Obviously, a lot of moving pieces in terms of the tax proposal. But perhaps more broadly, like what do you think would make you more cautious on the consumer in 2017? Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I don't know that we thought that, that would be material. And I guess it's just so \u2013 it's moving around so much, Vivien, in terms of what those proposals are that we haven't really built that into our plan. I'll give that some thought, but nothing comes immediately to mind that would change the view that I expressed.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's fair. And then secondly on the commercialization team for IQOS, just from a regulatory standpoint as you look at what is permissible in terms of product activation in the United States. Can you point us to a couple of countries where PM is already in the market that would most closely mirror the U.S. from a regulatory standpoint in terms of communication and advertising and consumer engagement? Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. That's a thoughtful question. What we're doing is we're trying to look at each of the markets and see about those parallels and extract the \u2013 not just the consumer insight but the trade insight. So, for example, if one goes to Italy, as you know, it's quite a dark market. And because IQOS requires a fair amount of exposition to the consumer to understand what it is, I think that PMI would be the first to tell you that Italy's been a bit more challenging. There are other markets that are more open in terms of the ability to communicate with the consumer. You see the results in Japan and you know the regulatory situation there.","Our job at PM USA is to read all of that data, and with our expertise about what is permitted in the United States, including under the Master Settlement Agreement, for example, is to weave that into a plan that will meet our goals. What we're going to try to do, of course, is to introduce adult smokers to the product, try to explain what it is and its attributes and to give them an opportunity to see if it's for them. And we've got very good plans coming together on that and many of which, I think, are drawn from the international market experience.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's really helpful. Just to follow up on that. So as you understand it like sampling and execution models similar to Italy with the embassies where IQOS would be permissible in the United States?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","We'll have to work through all that. I don't want to prejudge the results on that because we'd want to get a good plan together and take advice to make sure that we're staying on the right side of the line. But our aspiration is to use the tools that are available to us to get very good exposure to adult smokers and to explain to them as best we can what it is and what its attributes are. That's the idea.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thanks very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. Good to talk to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. So I guess my first question, I wanted to talk to you guys a little bit about this smokeless recall and hoping you could talk a little bit more about that and really how extended it could be. Trying to understand the facility that's impacted, I believe it's one out of five facilities, and my understanding is, you're not shipping out of that plant yet. Maybe give us a sense of when you could be or if you can make up some of the volume or supply from your other facilities. Just trying to understand what kind of impact this could be over the near term? And is this factor \u2013 just confirm it's factored into your guidance?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, let me start with that. I think the guidance that was issued this morning, of course, is a range and we've taken everything that we know today into account in issuing that guidance. Listen, I can't tell you much more than what's in the press release because we put in the press release basically what is known. So just to reprise, we've got, as you know, we produce hundreds of millions of cans of smokeless. We have eight consumer complaints with metal objects in the cans and so we've been working closely with the FDA. No one has reported any injuries. What we're trying to do is to make sure that we're doing the responsible thing with respect to the consumers. We want to make sure that we're doing everything we can so that no one is injured as a result of this particular incident.","And also, it's important of course to protect the brand trust. So the way I think I would think about it is, of course, it's a short term disruption, but in the long-term what you want to do is to protect the consumer from harm from this and protect the trust of the brand. We actually have two smokeless factories. The Franklin Park facility is the only one that is affected, Bonnie, and it is the smaller of our factories. So the Nashville factory has not been implicated and that's actually where most of the volume goes through.","We want to make sure that we've got this buttoned up before we ship any more product out of Franklin Park and we'll do that as soon as we feel like we have our arms around it. And I just can't give you that date while we're on the call this morning because I don't have it.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Well, that's helpful. And then switching gears to IQOS. You mentioned that the expectation for the PMTAs to be filed during the first quarter. So in your mind then a realistic timeframe, when do you expect to commercialize IQOS? Would it be Q4? And then just trying to get a sense for the resources PM might be sharing with you and maybe your plans for opening retail stores to educate consumers about this technology. And any color on that in terms of how many and maybe potential locations and just again, wanted to confirm that the expenses of this are also factored into your 2017 guidance.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I'll take that again last, which is the answer is yes. Everything that we know about right now is factored into the range of the guidance that we issued this morning. That includes the work that we're doing to get ready to commercialize IQOS. As you know, we can commercialize IQOS when the FDA rules on its applications and you know what the schedule for that is. I don't want to really tell folks what our competitive plans are about how we're going to do that.","But I would go back to what we were discussing earlier, I guess, which is that the object is to make sure that we get the product to adult smokers and explain how it works and what its attributes are so that they can make a choice about whether it's for them. And there's a whole range of activities that you can use to do that. I just don't want to lay them out, as you can appreciate, for competitive reasons. But we're well underway. We have a crackerjack team on it. We're very excited about the technology. We're working closely with PMI. So from my read, I think all the signals from a commercial point of view are in the right direction and we're just going to have to work through the FDA process.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Understood. That's helpful. And just maybe one final quick question on circling back on cig volumes. I was just curious to hear from you what you saw in December, specifically on volumes. The reason I'm asking is because the scanner data was very weak for that month in particular. I'm just curious if that's consistent with your business and what you think could have been the reason for that. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I'm not sure I can help you on a month by month basis, but you did see that the volume decline accelerated in the fourth quarter. And, of course, I know you know this, but we had one fewer shipping day. So I think that's the way to think about it. It's just hard to grind into it on a monthly basis.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So when \u2013 just a quick follow up on the smokeless recall. If I kind of look at the SKUs that you highlighted in the press release, are we in the ball park in thinking the volume impacted is around 10% to 15% of the total smokeless volume?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","I wouldn't hazard a number because we're not there yet.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. I was just taking all of the SKUs and trying to extrapolate the volume. But...","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, to explain that we'd have to get into what factory makes what SKUs and at what percentages and that \u2013 I just don't think that's a good use of our time.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, Marty, I think it came up a little bit earlier in the call, but just in terms of some of the potential changes that you may be expecting both kind of on the regulatory front and also on the tax front as it relates to some of the changes that are potentially going on at the agency level as well as some of the corporate tax reform policies, how are you thinking about the base case scenario for those outcomes? And then sort of how that impacts the investments or any kind of decision to invest more into the business or return cash more to shareholders going forward.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Got it. Well, let me talk about the long-term, Judy, and then maybe I'll try to talk about 2017. Listen, to the extent that corporate income tax rates could be reformed as we've discussed previously, that would be a good thing for American business obviously and, as you know, Altria, it would be a good thing for Altria. And so we've had a program underway to try to urge that as a matter of public policy to reduce the corporate income tax rate. We have not built that into our 2017 plans because I think the best thinking is corporate tax reform is pretty complicated. It's likely to take 2017 to do it.","But obviously, it would be a material step up for Altria if we got significant corporate tax reforms. So that would be important for us to think about if and when it occurs. I think it's the same thing on a regulatory basis. Both at the FDA and for regulatory agencies, generally there appears to be a movement to try to lessen the regulatory burden on business. Our view that would be good. But those things take time to work their way through the agency. Take HHS for example. We don't even have a cabinet appointee yet much less changes that would occur down the line. So our government affairs team and our regulatory affairs team are working very hard on that. But I would think of those more in the long-term than in the short.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And then just when you talked about the speed in which some of the SC applications are just getting decided is improving. I mean, just elaborate on what's driving that and did you say you're also spending more resources to make that happen from your perspective?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","We have been investing in both regulatory capability and in R&D capability and I was trying to provide some color around the guidance in that regard because there's more of it than there used to be. The SC process has picked up. Look, if you're at the agency, you're not only looking now at working your way through substantial equivalents, but you have under your deeming regulation a lot of product applications that are going to be heading your way. So we see a pickup in the activity, and our activity naturally has picked up commensurate with that.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. Good to talk to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","So you \u2013 hey. So you finished 2016 with $1.9 billion remaining on the buy-back and about $2.2 billion more cash on the balance sheet than when you exited 2015. So it seems reasonable to assume you'd expect to execute the vast majority, if not all of the remaining authorization in 2017. But at the same time there are some restructuring costs to consider and we've recently seen you prioritize M&A in the form of Nat Sherman. So and I appreciate you're not going to want to give guidance on this, but just a little bit more color on how to think about cash priorities in the coming year just given all those moving parts.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. Billy?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Steve. You're right. We had $1.9 billion left over at the end of last year. From a standpoint of cash needs or the way we think about capital allocation, nothing has changed. And so, when we announced that program, we said we would complete it by the middle of 2018 and you can see with the progress we've made, we're on track to do that. And so really nothing has changed either from a cash needs or cash priorities or from the capital allocation process. Thank you for the question.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. And just one more on IQOS and thanks for the prior updates that you've been providing on this call. But you'd mentioned Marty, some of the learnings you're drawing from other markets as you look around the world and plan for the launch in the U.S. I was wondering if there are anything unique to your strengths in the U.S. that you might also be uniquely positioned to deploy? And I'm thinking specifically of your mobile app and your digital activation capabilities and how that may play into any rollout of IQOS and how that may differ from other rollouts we've seen around the world? Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, that's a good question. We do, as you know we've discussed previously, we have a strong digital marketing team and I'm really proud of the work they're doing on the core business. And you're right to think that there are lots of applications that if you're trying to communicate and educate consumers about what products are, that digital is the way to go. It has to be done empirically and responsibly of course and I don't think anybody would be surprised to learn that we're considering that and others. We have, I think, a significant competitive advantage in our sales force.","It's large, they're very talented, they're very well led and so naturally we would be thinking as we go to market about how we can use that to help IQOS be successful. I think we have excellent relationships with our trade partners. That's another area that's going to require a lot of thinking about how we take IQOS to market and working with our trade partners. So those are all areas of inspection. And you're thinking about it the right way which is, what is it that we have that we can use to the best effect to make IQOS a big success.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for calling in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I had a question for you if I could first in relation to pricing. There was a little larger price increase taken back in November. And I know that could be beneficial for profitability, but I suspect you want to reinvest some of that. At the same time, you have a couple of cost savings plans that you're also reinvesting back in the business. So I wanted to understand with that incremental pricing, do we think about that as being another lever, if you will, for you to reinvest back in the business? And are there any areas you're trying to accelerate your investment beyond what you already talked about?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Chris. This is Billy. From a standpoint of our productivity, as we previously talked about, some of that productivity would fall to the bottom line, some from a reinvestment. I wouldn't read too much into any specific individual price increase. We think about pricing over the long term. And so we make those decisions for that in that regards. And it's really to balance for our long-term financial goals, so that seven to nine through time.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. You have a very narrow price gap today as well between say Marlboro and discount products. And is that playing into the view that you could take a little bit more pricing in the short run while that gap is quite low.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. I was looking at the housekeeping that we put out. If you look, Chris you've probably seen this this morning, but when you look at what happened to the Marlboro net pack price, year-over-year was up $0.12 and the lowest effective \u2013 that was $0.12, and then lowest effective was up $0.16. So it's really just the math that narrowed the price gap. But as you know, we're trying to maximize income and to the extent that pricing is an element of that we're always mindful of that.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I had just one follow-up question. As we think about the California tax increase going into place in April, should we think of \u2013 can you \u2013 are you likely to experience an inventory build prior to that or anything that could really distort the first quarter and maybe actually help it if they're able to build inventory prior to the tax increase?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, Chris, this is Billy. We don't project any significant changes in inventory. You know they always fluctuate over a shorter time period. That SET does go into place April 1. I do think it has a floor tax provision in it that tends to moderate any inventory movements in a short term basis.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hey, Matt.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I just \u2013 hi. I just had two follow-ups on things that have come up earlier in the call. First, on IQOS. You've talked about a number of dynamics that you've taken into account in the EPS guidance for next year. Beyond the equity income and the tax rate, et cetera, how much of a spending contingency are you building into your 2017 plans for some of that commercialization spending on IQOS and continuing to build up that infrastructure?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, gosh, Matt, if I told you I'd have to tell everyone, wouldn't I? So I appreciate the question, but we can't \u2013 we're just not going to lay that out as you can appreciate.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, I know.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, good try though.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, small, medium or large, I don't really need an absolute dollar figure.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","(39:18) yeah, sure.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I'm digging deep here. I don't know if anyone's after me but on California, just from a portfolio standpoint, is there any sense you can give us of whether you're materially over-indexed or under-indexed in any way to the state? My sense is that you're moderately over-indexed to California from a volume perspective. But not sure if that's a fair characterization.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","We're strong in California. You're right.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Matt. Appreciate your questions. See you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hey, Michael.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Just wanted to follow up on the Nat Sherman expansion a little bit. Can you just give some sense of your execution plans there? Is it primarily a distribution push? Where is it strong now? Where would it sit on the shelf set? Would you integrate it with your current shelf set? And what kind of timing would that take? And what are some of the marketing initiatives you would expect to put behind that?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, I'd like to tell you more but, honestly, the close was just so recently we're working through all of that now. But I can help you, I think, understand what we're trying to do, which is they've got very nice brands and they are differentiated from the current portfolio on smokeable. They tend to be sold a lot, as you probably know, in tobacco stores and some other niche locations. There's no reason that they can't be distributed more widely and I think that would definitely help the brand. I think when you put them in a sales force, like the one that Altria has, you would expect for there to be a good distribution growth there. And we're very excited about it, but we're just not in a position to lay out sort of the strategy for 2017. We've just really closed on it, although they're fast added over there.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then on IQOS, I know we've touched on some of these, but can you give some context around some of the potential economics for that and how it might compare to the rest of the portfolio? Is there a substantial royalty? And if so, is there flexibility in how you would think about pricing? Or what's the right way to think about how you manage that relative to the other pieces of your portfolio?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think, Michael, when you think about the way we manage our portfolio, we like high margin businesses. We like profitability. You can see from the strategies we reiterate over and over again, it's way too early to get into that discussion with IQOS. Remember that application was just filed. Commercialization would be towards the end of this year, at the earliest, into next year. So we still have a while to go before we can get into those details, but thank you for the question.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","And then just one last one. On any costs associated with the smokeless recall, would it be reasonable to assume that those would be treated as one-time items excluded from adjusted earnings?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","I think, again, Michael, not to push you off into the future, but we just announced that recall. We're in the process of garnering all of that. Rest assured, we felt comfortable issuing the guidance we did this morning, but to talk about how we're going to treat that cost on a go forward basis, it's too early.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling in.","Operator","We will now open the call to members of the media. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you for the follow-up question. Very quickly, if I look at your guidance this year, you've got a $0.06 range. Previous years you've had a $0.05 range. I guess that implies that you see a little bit more uncertainty for 2017 than you did this time last year. I was just wondering where you think this range of uncertainty has widened?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks. I actually wouldn't read that into our guidance at all. As a matter of fact, what I would read into the guidance, just for historical reference, this is the strongest guidance we have come out with in January, I think, in the last eight or nine years and I think that's actually what should be read into the guidance. I wouldn't read anything into that range at all.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you. And actually a follow-up question related to the previous one. Obviously when you're preparing your guidance, you have to make some assumptions about your beer business, previously SAB now ABI. And I'm just wondering whether the way you thought about the range of outcomes that you're going to get from beer has altered or whether you're adopting exactly the same mechanical approach now with ABI as you used to with SAB?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think from a standpoint of, you know we don't guide down to that level, but to explain how we build it into our guidance, you're right. We build a range of scenarios for all of the factors that we incorporate into guidance. So we ran a range of scenarios on those, very similar to the way we would have with SAB. The only difference is we have a one quarter accounting lag. And so the fourth quarter of 2016 will be recognized in 2017, and then that lag will carry forward. We'll have a full four quarters in 2017. One quarter will be from the fourth quarter 2016 and the first three quarters of 2017. That's the way we incorporate into guidance.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you.","Martin J.

Thank you so much for taking the call.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Jennifer Kaplan - Bloomberg LP","Good morning. Given the potential timeline for IQOS in the U.S., I'm wondering what are your plans for bulking up customer support given some of the technical difficulties faced by PMI, for example, when they first launched in Japan? And kind of the growing pains in getting customers accustomed to the new product? I mean, how do you deal with creating that, sort of, tech support that's obviously not needed for cigarettes?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, thanks for that question. I guess I'd refer back to the remarks I made earlier this morning which is, all of that's under consideration right now. We have the benefit of working closely with PMI to gain the learnings that they've gained in that regard. And we're looking at the tools that we have available at our disposal and thinking about how best to match those goals with the tools that we have. And I'm confident that with the great work we're doing with PMI, and our existing business, we know a lot about this consumer set that we'll be able to solve for a great deal of that. So we're working on that now.","Jennifer Kaplan - Bloomberg LP","Got it. Just a quick follow up. Is there any sense of a need to hire more people, or different kinds of people, in order to deal with that?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I guess the way I would think about it is you always have a \u2013 it's a question of how you're going to deploy your resources against your most important initiatives. And you may have heard us say earlier in the call that the dedicated commercialization team, for example, to work on IQOS, because it's their job to get up every day, and come to work, and think about how to make IQOS a success. So it's not about more, as much as it is, I think about having the right people working in the right focused way.

","Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Marty Barrington.","Marty Barrington","Thanks Brendan. Good morning everyone. Altria delivered strong results and returns for its shareholders in 2012. Altria grew its full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share by 7.8% behind the business performance of our operating companies, complemented by higher earnings from our equity investment in SABMiller.","Our 2012 total shareholder return of 11.8% for the full year outperformed our U.S. tobacco peers and the S&P 500\u2019s consumer staples sector, though not the S&P 500 index which delivered a total return of 16%. Altria\u2019s results were driven by effectively executing on our core strategies. First, our consumer products companies invested in strong premium brands that provide the foundation for future income growth. Each of our tobacco operating companies seek to grow income while maintaining modest share momentum for its core premium brands.","Despite a continuing challenging external environment, our tobacco operating companies\u2019 premium brands had an excellent year as our companies continued investing for their long-term success. These companies grew their adjusted operating companies\u2019 income and gained retail share in cigarettes, cigars and smokeless tobacco for the full year of 2012. ","Beginning with the smokeable product segment, PM USA introduced Marlboro\u2019s new brand architecture in 2012 and supported Marlboro\u2019s four product families, red, gold, green and black with brand building activities throughout the year. These activities included expanded distribution of products and equity enhancing promotions to engage millions of adult smokers. ","PM USA also engaged adult competitive smokers with trial generating promotions as PM USA moderated as the year progressed. Behind these investments PM USA grew Marlboro retail share and strengthened the Marlboro brand. Middleton continued to enhance its product portfolio and new products contributed to its full year retail share gains. ","In smokeless product segment, Copenhagen and Skoal delivered solid volume growth and retail share gains on a combined basis for the full year. These results were primarily due to the ongoing contributions of Copenhagen long-cut wintergreen and long cut straight and the expansion of Copenhagen southern blend. In wine, St. Michelle delivered solid volume growth through its continued emphasis on expanding distribution into off-premise channels. ","Second, our companies continued to pursue product innovation. Products introduced in recent years by Marlboro, Black & Mild and Copenhagen and Skoal gained retail share and contributed to the company's full year share growth in 2012. During the year, PM USA repositioned Marlboro black, expanded Marlboro NXT, a part of the Marlboro black family into additional geographies and introduced Marlboro 83s, part of the Marlboro red family in updated packaging. ","In 2012, Middleton continued to address adult cigar smokers interest in variety in seasonal cigar blends. Black & Mild dark blend and Black & Mild summer blend as well as with its 2012 third  quarter introduction of Black & Mild Jazz untip cigars into select states. In December 2012, the brand announced the plans to launch Black & Mild Jazz, plastic tip and wood tip cigars nationally. In the smokeless products segment, U.S. STC expanded distribution of products, including Skoal, Ready Cut and Copenhagen Southern blend. Skoal Ready Cut offers adult long cut diverse great tastes in an innovative moist smokeless tobacco form. Copenhagen southern blend delivers a mellow taste in a manageable long cut form. ","Our companies also continued to support the development of spit-free smokeless tobacco alternatives to cigarettes with the 2012 introduction of Verve discs into elite market and integrating it to develop innovative nicotine containing products with Okono AS. ","Third, our tobacco operating companies effectively managed costs in 2012. For the full year, cost management and higher pricing supported expansion of adjusted operating companies\u2019 income margins for the smokeable and smokeless products segments. Our companies made significant progress on our current cost reduction program by reducing head count, consolidating certain facilities, improving business processes and pursuing other savings. These actions with initiatives planned for 2013 as part of the program make us confident that we will achieve our goal of $400 million in annualized savings versus previously planned spending by the end of 2013. ","Finally, Altria maintained a strong balance sheet which enabled it to continue to deliver strong cash returns to shareholders. In 2012, Altria enhanced its capital structure by purchasing high coupon debt and issuing new lower cost debt. These actions reduced our 2018 and 2019 maturity towers, lowered future interest expense and reduced our weighted average coupon rate. ","Dividends contributed 5.8% to our 2012 total shareholder return of 11.8% as Altria maintained its target dividend payout ratio of approximately 80% of its adjusted diluted EPS and increased its dividend by 7.3% in August. As you know, Altria joined with the broad coalition of businesses, associations and shareholders to support making permanent the lower person tax rates on dividend income and maintaining parity between the tax treatment of dividends and capital gains. Congress and the President now have established dividend and capital gains tax rates for couples earning $450,000 or less between 0 and 15% and that 20% couple\u2019s earnings more than $450,000.","We\u2019re pleased that parity has been retained between the tax treatment of dividends and capital gains. In addition to returning cash to shareholders through dividends, Altria repurchased $1.1 billion of its shares in 2012. We have $57 million remaining under the current $1.5 billion program and expect to complete the program by the end of the second quarter of 2013. ","In summary, in 2012 Altria continued its track record of delivering strong returns to shareholders. We achieved these results through disciplined execution of our core strategies and we believe that our 2012 performance including investments in our premium brands position us well for 2013 and beyond. ","Turning to 2013, while there are signs of modest improvement in certain economic indicators, we remain cautious about the business environment. Adult consumers remain under economic pressure as they face the end of the payroll tax holiday, as well as continuing high unemployment. And with a number of states facing budget shortfalls, tobacco products will remain a target for excise tax increases. ","Altria forecasts that its full year adjusted diluted EPS will increase by 6% to 9% to a range of $2.35 to $2.41 from a base of $2.21 in 2012. We also expect to achieve 2013 reported diluted EPS in the range of $2.34 to $2.40. Howard Willard, Altria\u2019s chief financial officer will now discuss Altria\u2019s business results in more detail. ","Howard Willard","Thank you, Marty. Good morning everyone. The smokeable products segment\u2019s reported operating companies income results for the fourth quarter increased 25.9% primarily due to higher list prices, lower restructuring charges and lower charges related to tobacco and health judgements partially offset by higher promotional investments by PM USA behind Marlboro\u2019s new brand architecture and increased resolution expense. ","For the full year of 2012 reported operating companies\u2019 income for the segment increased 8.8% primarily due to higher list prices, lower restructuring charges, lower charges related to tobacco and health judgements and effective cost management, partially offset by higher promotional investments, increased resolution expense, unfavourable mix due to L&M\u2019s volume growth and lower shipment volume. ","Adjusted operating companies\u2019 income, which is calculated excluding restructuring charges and tobacco and health judgments, increased 5.9% to $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter and 4.2% to $6.3 billion in the full year of 2012. For the fourth quarter and full year, adjusted operating companies\u2019 income margins for the smokeable product segment increased nine-tenths of a percentage point to 39.9% to 41.2% respectively. ","PM USA\u2019s reported cigarette shipment volume increased 0.4% for the fourth quarter primarily due to retail share gains and one extra shipping day, partially offset by the industry\u2019s rate of decline. After adjusting for the extra shipping day and changes in trade inventories, PM USA\u2019s fourth quarter domestics cigarette volume was estimated to be down approximately 1%. For the full year PM USA\u2019s reported shipment volume decreased 0.2% primarily due to the industry\u2019s rate of decline, partially offset by volume growth as a result of retail share gains and one extra shipping day. ","When adjusted for an extra shipping day and changes in trade inventories, PM USA estimates that its full-year domestic shipment volume was essentially unchanged, outperforming the estimated adjusted industry rate of decline of approximately 3%. Brand building initiatives to support Marlboro\u2019s new architecture contributed to the brand\u2019s retail share gains of one percentage point for the fourth quarter and six-tenths of a percentage point for the full year. ","Marlboro\u2019s retail share was 42.6% for both the fourth quarter and full year. These gains were complemented by L&M\u2019s growth in discount. PM USA\u2019s discount products gained three-tenths of a percentage point to deliver a 3.9% retail share for the fourth quarter and five-tenths of a percentage point for a 3.8% share for the full year.

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from line Nik Modi with UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS","Yeah. Good morning, everyone.","Marty Barrington","Good morning, Nik.","Nik Modi - UBS","So just a quick question on the Marlboro architecture, and I guess, now that\u2019s been kind of in place for a year and you saw some pretty good retail share gains with pricing improvement. Just curious are there any diagnostics that you have, that you can share, kind of giving us some insight on how effective this has been and so we can think about next year and the years after in terms of some of the benefits you will get from this initiative.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for your question. Sure we have diagnostics, some of which are internal and some of which we talk about in settings like this, I think you\u2019ve already alluded to one, which is we had nice share gain which is consistent with PM USA\u2019s objective to maximize income but trying to keep Marlboro healthy. We have diagnostic, Nik, on resetting retail. One of our objectives during the year was to try to get a number of retail stores reset to better reflect the Marlboro architecture, and I think our sales and distribution group did an excellent job of doing that. If you have been in stores I think you have seen the improvements that have been made at the presentation of the Marlboro brand at retail. At the end of the day, it\u2019s always about that balance about trying to maximize income while taking the steps that are appropriate to make sure that Marlboro is healthy over the long term, and we\u2019re very pleased with how PM USA executed on that this year. ","Nik Modi - UBS","And Marty, just a quick follow up to that. I don\u2019t think I remember two quarters in a row where Marlboro has gained this much market share which is quite a feat given how big the brand is and it\u2019s philosophical, I mean you say you want to maintain market share momentum and optimize income. It would be crazy for me to think that this is just too much share gains for a brand that size.","Marty Barrington","I think Nik, the difference simply is in what time period you are looking at. If you look at it, say for a quarter or even for two quarters you have to be sure that there were some share gains there, but that is not the strategy. I\u2019d just give you a \u2013 for example, just one data point because we manage the brand over time, and when we say over time we\u2019re talking about more than several quarters, in fact over years. And if one looks back, pick the data point, fourth quarter of 2009 and you measure share gains to the fourth quarter of 2012, it\u2019s nine-tenths. So you have nine-tenths of share point over three years. We would characterized that as modest share momentum for Marlboro over time, and of course, we have other metrics to measure Marlboro\u2019s health. We want to make sure that all of its brand equity numbers are strong and hopefully improving in the right direction. Nik, I think that\u2019s how we think about it.","And we try to be sure -- share gains are not just a function of how much we invest into brand but other competitive dynamics. And so it\u2019s awfully, awfully hard to read simply on a quarter or over two quarters. So I would return I think to understanding our strategy. Our strategy is to maximize income there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley ","Just a follow up on pricing, Marty, if I could. So in 2012 relative to the last few years, there was clearly a greater emphasis on investing in Marlboro promotional spending, somewhat less than that pricing, and very good share growth. Can you give us a sense what\u2019s in the plan for 2013 in terms of the relative emphasis of those variables?","Marty Barrington","Now I think we will continue with our strategy, David and obviously for competitive reasons we\u2019re not going to lay out PM USA\u2019s promotional plan for 2013. But I do think at a strategic level, it's important for investors to remember our strategy is to maximize income. You\u2019ve seen the numbers in the release. In the smokeable segment we\u2019ve got revenue net of excise up 3.6% for the fourth quarter, and overall the Marlboro brand is heading in the right direction. We have the Marlboro architecture started but remember big brands like Marlboro we don\u2019t do everything in one-year. We've been clear I think about saying that we\u2019re going to invest in Marlboro appropriately throughout 2012 and 2013. But I think that's just more of executing against that consistent strategy and some years as we say we invest a bit more, some years a bit less, some years the shares go up a bit more, it comes down a little bit. But it\u2019s consistent with that long term strategy of trying to maximize income. I think that\u2019s the way to understand it.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley ","Marty, with respect to the total U.S. cigarette category dynamic, you mentioned volumes for the full year or consumption got about 3% with almost no net price increase to consumer. Is that the kind of secular volume decline you would have expected and that you envision going forward?","Marty Barrington","Well, I don\u2019t know about going forward, because it\u2019s awfully hard to predict the future. But I think that we\u2019ve seen the estimates of the secular decline rate being in the neighborhood of 2% to 3% for some period now, and that\u2019s probably in the right neighborhood. ","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley ","And then lastly Marty, you would be surprised if the FDA doesn't release its report on menthol by when.","Marty Barrington","I\u2019d try not to be surprised by regulatory action. I just don\u2019t think we now \u2013 I mean they have had it for some time as you know and our understanding remains I think the last time we spoke about this which is they have sent it out for period review on the science. We led to understand that they probably have it back and are looking at it, and we would expect that would be the first action that they would take would be to publish their position on the science on menthol.","As you know they have had it for quite some time. So would you expect something in 2013? I suppose so, we just don't have a lot of line of sight into that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Just looking at the CapEx, your guidance is sort of roughly flat to up for \u201913 and it looks like this \u201912 was ahead of last year as well. What\u2019s driving some of that increase?","Howard Willard","This is Howard. I don\u2019t think there is any single big item. As you will note, our CapEx runs at a relatively low level for a company our size. I think that\u2019s driven by the declining cigarette business. But our direction to our operating companies is they ought to spend the appropriate amount of money to keep the infrastructure appropriately ready to manufacture our products and execute our programs. So I think it really is more driven by the addition of a number of relatively modest sized projects across the business.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","And then just as you look at e-cigarette segment, it\u2019s clearly got some strong growth at least in recent times especially, how do you view that, is it an opportunity to get involved in, a threat, something that you sort of dismiss, what\u2019s your thinking? I mean obviously haven\u2019t heard any announcement yet but do you have plans to participate in that somehow?","Marty Barrington ","Well, what I would say about e-cigarettes, Michael, is that we\u2019re monitoring it carefully. It\u2019s obviously a development that has resulted in high awareness among adult smokers and everyone else the best I can tell. There is some trial but it\u2019s still a relatively new phenomenon, and you are right to point out that it does grow off of a relatively low base. The FDA has said as you know that it intends to regulate e-cigarettes. So we\u2019re monitoring all of that very carefully. ","Michael Lavery - CLSA","And then lastly, just looking at share repurchases, you mentioned that you had $57 million remaining in this authorization. But you\u2019ve said you would expect to complete that by the end of 2Q which would be a sharp slowdown, you did $360 million in 1H \u201912. If you use that how quickly could you get a new authorization or do you think it will run its latest 2Q before you have another one?","Marty Barrington","Yeah. I think it\u2019s hard to project exactly when we will finish that authorization but certainly we will have it complete by the end of the second quarter. I think you pointed out I think rightly so that we had fairly heavy purchases in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re only $57 million left. There is not a lot of share repurchase needed to complete that. But at this point, the only authorization that we have out is that authorization is scheduled at the end of the second quarter.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Brendan McCormick","Thanks for coming on the call, Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Marty Barrington","Good morning, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Marty, just a general kind of a macro comment, I know, in the press release you\u2019ve talked about and then also in your prepared comment some of the cautions that you pointed to at the expiration of the tax holiday et cetera. I know you sort of start the year with the similar caution in the past but is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in the market place that gives you a bit more caution at this point, particularly with the tax holiday being expired.","Marty Barrington","No. We haven\u2019t seen any evidence of that but we\u2019re just -- we're reminded almost everyday right about how complex the macro environment is. It looks like on some days the things are starting to turn in the right direction, say housing starts through the like, which is important. And then you get a big drop in consumer confidence or you see a kind of a tepid prediction on GDP.","I think that's part of it. I think the other part of it is excise taxes. We\u2019re always careful at the beginning of the year with respect to state excise taxes, state budgets remain in difficult circumstances. Nothing\u2019s happened yet but you\u2019ve seen already a number of states proposing -- and proposing is one thing and getting them is another but they\u2019re proposing fairly significant excise tax increases. And given that the FETs have been relatively restrained the last couple of years. We would expect that there would be an uptick in activity there.","So to answer your question directly is not that we see anything in the market that gives us that any cause for alarm. We\u2019re just trying to be careful as we read the macro environment.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then just going back to the Marlboro brand architecture, so heading into sort of the second year of that program. Can you elaborate on sort of your success with some of the line expansions, certainly the Black and then now with NXT. How are each of those brands kind of tracking versus your expectation. What is some of the other innovations of line expansion that we should look forward to in 2013 and then just in terms of the level of investment behind the brand equity program as well as some of the retail program. How do you sort of gauge whether the spending level is sort of at the right level if there is a need to continue to step up that spending?","Marty Barrington","Okay. There is a lot in your question there. Let me see if I could take sort of pieces of it at a time. If you look back at \u201812 at the accomplishments of the Marlboro architecture, I think they are actually quite significant and we pointed out that when we talk about building up the Marlboro architecture, it consists of multiple elements, right.","It's focusing on all of the elements of the value equation that we used to manage that terrific brand. So what have we done in packaging, you see what we\u2019ve done with Marlboro 83s which is really a nice expansion into some more modern and classic packaging for that brand to bring news to Red.","So our product expansions in Marlboro-Black which has been a terrific contribution to the family while we don't report out at this sub-segment level on growth. As you know, I can tell you that we\u2019re very pleased with how Marlboro-Black has done. And it certainly contributed, I think to the overall Marlboro equity.","But we saw Marlboro NXT, you see all this innovation in Marlboro space and that's good for the brand. And we think of building up the Marlboro architecture sort of less as a program, if you will then, what good stewards of tradition -- of wonderful brands like Marlboro are supposed to do that. They manage the brand over time. They keep it refresh, they keep it relevant to its target audience and that's how we've been working on it.","So you see, I\u2019ve already mentioned retail, you see product introductions, you see packaging changes. I think that's the way to try to understand how we\u2019re thinking about Marlboro. It's a big brand. It has a big franchise and our four product families, I think, are working hard to try to understand their consumer set carefully and bring to the market, what that consumer wants.","So we don\u2019t announce in advance, when we\u2019re ready to announce what we\u2019re going to do in 2013. But you're probably aware of Southern Cut, which has been launched already in January. So there's a lot of innovation in Marlboro but we do this in a discipline way because all of that, that I have described sits under the strategy of trying to maximize income in that segment. We\u2019ll make true that the brand does well.","So it\u2019s a balance. That\u2019s why we get paid to balance and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do throughout 2013. But I think that PM USA did an excellent job of that in 2012 as you see in the results.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Good morning.","Marty Barrington","Hi Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Hi. I guess, my first question is on retails and what are your thoughts on retailer cigarette margins being squeezed over the past year. How do you strike the right balance between growing your own profitability and then maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship with your retail partners? And also how do you ensure that retailers continue to emphasize important cigarette category and prevent them from shifting resources to other categories either within tobacco or other categories outside of tobacco maybe such as food service.","Marty Barrington","Okay. Well, thanks for that question. Our approach to retail has really been the same for some time which is we want to have a terrific relationship that\u2019s mutually beneficial for both us and them. We work really hard at multiple levels to do that and we do that programmatically.","And so you see that we have programs like MLP in Marlboro [Flakes] and the like. And we try to have a range of options so retailers can decide which programs if any they want to participate in with us. We try to make it attractive for them to do so. Retailers for their part, of course, the cigarette and the tobacco categories a big part of their traffic, a big part of their revenue stream and we try to work with them very carefully.","We do that to our very talented salespeople who had very good market data to help them almost down to a store basis but our job isn\u2019t to tell them what to do or to prevent them from doing something else, just to try to align their interests with ours. So that as we go to market that's a robust trade channel.","I think overall -- overall I think our retailers would tell you we do, I think, a pretty good job of that and we also meet with retailers regularly, Judy, both at the executive level and all the way down to the store level to get feedback from them about how we\u2019re doing. Our hope is that we\u2019re really the category leader for them in terms of solutions.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Okay. That makes sense. And then I had another question on kind of circling back on some of the earlier questions regarding promotions. And I guess, I\u2019m aware that your promotions on certain line that Marlboro has decreased this month and then in February.","So I guess this leads me to believe that volume impact has been minimal on Marlboro. And I just want to make sure this is the right way to think about this and maybe you could touch on other levers you have to pull to improve your net price realization next year. And I definitely would like to clarify or verify that this is in fact a priority for you in 2013.","Marty Barrington","Well, I think I would say what I\u2019ve said before on this topic, which is when you're trying to maximize income there are a number of ways one can do that. Certainly, pricing has been important in the category. It has been, it\u2019s likely to be. It\u2019s certainly something we look at very carefully. You saw PM USA took two price increases last year. You\u2019ve already pointed out that you\u2019ve seen some of the promotions moderate over time. So PM USA is very attentive to keeping an eye on the pricing element, but it's not the only one. You can expand your margins as you\u2019ve seen them expand through effective cost management and Howard\u2019s already described where we are in our current cost programs. We try to be efficient in going to the market. So we keep a good eye there, we have very good margins there. We\u2019ve expanded them throughout 2012, and we\u2019re mindful of that as we head into 2013. ","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","And then just my final question is on innovation in your portfolio and understanding your strategy regarding innovation and in light of the lack of progress with substantially equivalent application approvals. So I guess I would like to know if your innovation will be as robust as last year, if approvals don\u2019t happen for a while and maybe you could update us on the status of that please.","Marty Barrington","Sure. Well we continue to engage with the agency on our substantial equivalence application and I think we have good dialogue with them back and forth as they work through that. You probably know Bonnie, there is something in the order of 4000 applications that came in March two years ago but they are coming up on the two-year anniversary of that batch of filings. And so I think you expect for them to start working through those at some point in time.","With respect to our pipeline, we were pretty thoughtful I think about trying to get ready for the new regulatory environment, and you saw actually in 2012 that we've been able to keep a pretty robust pipeline of products and other offerings to our consumers. We do that in compliance with all the rules that are in place. We would expect to continue to do that. So it\u2019s awfully hard to predict right because we don't see into the agency, I know you don't and I don't. But I would expect for them to start moving things along.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta Barclays Capital","Can you share your view around the potential for additional liability management, exercises, perhaps targeting your longer dated maturities that didn\u2019t get tackled the last time? And then secondly, how do you think about the timing of prefinancing your upcoming maturities given the current market backdrop?","Howard Willard","Sure, this is Howard. I think as everybody is aware, we did do a tender for some debt last year and one of the drivers of that was we were mindful of the fact that we had some high maturity towers in 2018 and 2019. Additionally it provided us with some ongoing interest savings when we reissued debt at a lower interest rate. I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable with our maturity towers right now. And I think as we look at both the debt issuance and any kind of tender or refinancing activity, I think we look at it in the context of a much broader analysis, how to effectively use our cash. And I think as you know 80% of our underlying EPS go out in the form of dividends, and then each year I think we make a decision as to what the most effective use of that remaining cash is, and I think we are going to remain flexible as to how we use that cash going forward. ","Priya Ohri-Gupta Barclays Capital","And then any comments on how you think the runway ahead of the maturity if you are thinking about refinancings you like to have three to six months cushion, or sequentially even do something afterwards given the flexibility from commercial paper uses?","Howard Willard","Yeah obviously, when we are looking at issuing debt, we do quite a detailed analysis. I don\u2019t know that we have kind of a hard and fast rule like you may be suggesting there, but it\u2019s something we analyze quite carefully.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Citigroup","I was hoping that we could talk a little bit more about Marlboro and specifically on the share gains that you posted, if you could give any color on the contribution from new product introductions to the share gains that you have seen in 2012 as well, if you could offer some color on some of the consumer demographics as you have done the work on that, are you gaining outside share with smokers of 18 to 30 or anything like that?","Marty Barrington","We do look at those, of course, but those are competitively sensitive details that we don\u2019t discuss in these kinds of settings. But I can tell you Vivien, overall we\u2019re really happy with those product introductions and what they brought to the brand. They brought innovation to the brand, they brought great packaging to the brand. We like the contribution that they're making to the overall equity of the brand. And as you might expect our brand teams monitor all of that activity carefully, and I think overall we\u2019re very pleased with that. We just don\u2019t break it out at this level for these purposes, I am sorry.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Citigroup","That\u2019s fair. In terms of your guidance for 2013, you\u2019re coming off of a big year in terms of the contribution that you got from SABMiller, certainly that\u2019s really been a good contributor to your earnings growth. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what your expectations are and how you are thinking about the balance between other non-operating items like that and then your reported operating income growth for your segment?","Marty Barrington","Well, I will start and Howard may want to say a word on this. We always start with the operating performance of our companies. This is as you heard in my remarks that, that's why we were able to grow the way we were in 2012 which was our operating companies had terrific business performance. And so we always start with that and they have robust plans for \u201913. And now that said, we do have other levers that we can use to try to balance the overall equation but I think it\u2019s important to understand that we always start with the operating performance of our tobacco companies and our wine companies because that\u2019s the core of our business. Howard, do you want to say more on that?","Howard Willard","Sure, I would just add \u2013 the comment on SABMiller, I think you pointed out why we saw that SABMiller\u2019s had a strong performance last year and has had quite a run of strong performances over the years. And so when we put together our guidance we certainly factored in an estimate for SABMiller and we have a fair amount of insight into that because of our broad participation. But certainly we have a much deeper assessment of the operating plans for the businesses that we operate. But we continue to expect SABMiller to be a nice contributor going forward. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport. ","Ann Gurkin - Davenport","I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d comment on the elasticity model and how it has performed or how it compares to historical measures following the price increase taken in December. And I guess elasticity for the premium segments, the Marlboro brand architecture buildouts and the discount segments, can you comment at all on that?","Marty Barrington","Well, I can comment generally on elasticity and over time it hasn\u2019t changed very much with respect to cigarettes, negative 0.3, we\u2019ve seen that really for quite some time now and we don\u2019t see any change in that. We haven\u2019t seen any change actually in a while, we certainly don\u2019t see any change in it now. ","Ann Gurkin - Davenport","And then just want to be clear, as you think about the Marlboro franchise and your MST business, are there still white bakers (ph) opportunities whether it\u2019s packaging or blends or mixes, to roll out new products, just in general, not specifics.","Marty Barrington","That\u2019s what the brand teams are doing every day. They are trying to study their consumer set, trying to figure out where there is opportunity and try to develop products for adult customers that we could take to them, sure.","Ann Gurkin - Davenport","Okay. Thank you.","Marty Barrington","","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America","Hey, thanks. Guys, sorry for the basic question of advance. But I guess following up on the elasticity question, can you just talk about I guess, how you gagged the long-term capacity of U.S. consumer due to endure higher cigarette prices? I hear you that the point there hasn\u2019t changed in a while, but I mean surely you guys must spent some time thinking about at what price levels that might change, right. So, I\u2019m just curios how you sort of think about that framework?","Marty Barrington","I think it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know how to predict that in the future other than to be informed by what we've seen in the past. There has been a lot of history with respect to, what the prices have been in the industry over time. And that elasticity has remained pretty durable.","I guess another way of looking at it, Chris, is that if you look at the pricing in the U.S. domestic markets, the other markets of course you would see that it probably has a pretty long runway in front of it. But nobody knows that I think until you get there and we are not there yet.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America","And I guess just bringing it more to the short-term, I mean do you guys think that at current levels you could sort of maintain or drive modest share momentum without pricing below the industry average in the cigarette category?","Marty Barrington","Well, I\u2019ll go back to the comments I made before, which is, it is always tempting I think to kind of break these things out into single constituent elements and it just doesn't work that way. There's always the dynamic between wanting to increase income, which is what our strategy is while trying to maintain share. And that's the balance that you have to assess based on a lot of factors at any one point in time. It depends on what the economy is doing. It depends on consumer confidence. It depends on other factors that we pointed out I think previously.","So the way we think about it is, we try to be thoughtful about that, as we run our business each year and we pay close attention to it, but to make a general statement about that is awfully hard to do.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America","Thank you.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Chris Burritt with Bloomberg News.","Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News","Hey, thank you for your time.","Marty Barrington","Good morning.","Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News","I was going to ask, the release mentions a headcount reduction and was wondering if you could discuss the number of jobs cut last year and whether there maybe further cuts this year?","Marty Barrington","Well, I can certainly talk about the program that we had in place which was, I think we all described it if I\u2019m not mistaken. I think the results are in our public filings. We have to watch our headcount like every business does, but particularly in our category because cigarette volumes declined.","We prefer to manage that over time and we work really hard to do that over time by maintaining our headcount through attrition if at all possible. There have been programs in the past. No one can, never say that there won\u2019t be one in the future. But that\u2019s not our current intention. We are trying to manage our headcount over time, and we hope that we are going to be able to do that.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Brendan McCormick for closing comments.","Brendan McCormick","Thank you everyone for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in Altria. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact us on Investor Relations.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brendan McCormick, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.","Brendan McCormick","Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. This morning we will only be discussing Altria's 2011 business results for the fourth quarter and full year and will not be discussing the status of tobacco litigation. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today's earnings release for the review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. For a detailed review of Altria's business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website, altria.com.","Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Altria's management also reviews operating companies income, operating margins and EPS on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations.","Last month, Altria announced that it would also include charges for tobacco and health judgments from adjusted financial calculations. References to adjusted financial calculations on today's call reflect this redefinition. Today's call also contains various operating results on both a reported and on an adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings press release and are available on our website.","In addition, comparisons discussed in this conference call are to the same prior year period unless otherwise stated.","Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Mike Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Altria Group Inc.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Altria has delivered strong returns for its shareholders in 2011 in a challenging business environment, while taking steps to continue creating shareholder value into the future. Altria grew its adjusted diluted earnings per share by 7.9%, which is consistent with adjusted EPS results over the past few years. Altria delivered total shareholder return of 26.9% in 2011, outperforming the return of the S&P 500 for the 12th consecutive year. Dividends remain an important component of Altria's shareholder return. The company paid out approximately 80% of its adjusted diluted EPS in dividends and increased its dividend by 7.9% in August. Altria also repurchased $1.3 billion of its shares in 2011 at an average price of $26.91 per share. Altria intends to complete the balance of the October 2011 $1 billion repurchase program by the end of 2012, subject to the discretion of the Board. Altria completed its previously announced $1.5 billion cost-savings program ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2011. Following the completion of this program, we announced a new program that we expect to deliver annualized cost savings of $400 million versus previously planned spending by the end of 2013.","Altria continues to focus on developing lower-risk products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers. To support this goal, Altria Client Services has entered into an agreement with Okono, an affiliate of the Danish company, Fertin Pharma, to develop innovative noncombustible-nicotine-containing products for adult tobacco consumers. Fertin is a global leader in the development and manufacture of nicotine gum with additional capabilities and other products and technologies. This new product initiative combines the expertise of the Altria family of companies with Okono and its affiliates, product development and manufacturing capabilities.","Altria's operating companies delivered strong 2011 profitability. Adjusted operating companies income and margins grew in cigarettes, smokeless products and wine. These gains were partially offset by declines in adjusted operating companies income in cigars and financial services.","Earnings from our equity investment in SABMiller also contributed to Altria's profitability. PM U.S.A. continued to focus on maximizing income from its cigarette business while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro over time. In 2011, higher pricing and effective cost management helped PM U.S.A. grow its adjusted operating companies income and margins, which exclude the impact of restructuring charges and tobacco and health judgments.","Marlboro retained some of its strong share gains that contributed to a record retail share performance of 2010, as its full year share in 2011 is higher than its 2009 share. Marlboro's retail share gains 2010 were exceptionally strong due to an attractive introductory offer on Marlboro\u2019s Special Blend. Marlboro share decline in 2010 versus 2010 reflects PM U.S.A.'s focus on growing income and margins and not building the brand on price promoted share. Marlboro's underlying brand equity remains strong. Price gaps continue to be stable, and retail share deviations that Marlboro experienced in 2011 were driven by short-term, year-over-year changes in promotional spending in the marketplace that influence promotion-sensitive adult consumers.","PM U.S.A.'s income and margins benefited from our continued focus on equity-driven premium brands. Premium brands represented over 93% of PM U.S.A.'s cigarette shipments last year, a much higher premium mix than its competitors.","Marlboro plans to continue to focus on brand-building initiatives and equity-enhancing new products and programs in 2012. PM U.S.A. recently launched Marlboro Black with packaging in non-menthol and menthol varieties to distinguish the product's bold flavor. Marlboro has other exciting plans for 2012 and 2013, some of which we will share at the CAGNY conference.","In the smokeless products segment, USSTC and PM U.S.A. delivered strong full year adjusted operating companies income growth behind Copenhagen and Skoal. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal grew their volume faster than the category and gained retail share in 2011. Copenhagen had a very strong volume and share performance last year, as the brand benefited from continued momentum from new products introduced over the past few years as well as Wintergreen Pouches introduced in 2011. Skoal grew its volume behind the launch of Skoal X-tra varieties and 2 new Skoal Snus products. The brand's full year retail share declined as share losses, including those from 7 SKUs delisted in the second quarter of 2011 offset gains from Skoal's new products. This SKU delisting will continue to impact Skoal's retail share performance comparisons in the first half of 2012. However, we believe that the actions taken on Skoal during 2011 have stabilized the brand and positioned it for growth.","In the cigar segment, Middleton made significant progress during the year to improve its competitive position in a marketplace where low-priced imported cigars continue to grow. Middleton's income and margin performance was much stronger in the second half of 2011 compared to the first half, driven by more efficient promotion of Black & Mild. New products and packaging enhanced Middleton's competitive position in the untipped cigarillo segment where it is not historically focused. Black & Mild introduced untipped Sweets, Classic and Wine varieties last year, as well as a new Aroma Wrap foil pouch packaging. Middleton also began shipping cigars manufactured under its overseas contract manufacturing arrangement during the fourth quarter of 2011.","In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered excellent full year operating companies income growth while expanding its adjusted operating companies income margins. Wine shipment volume growth was also strong, as Ste. Michelle expanded the distribution of its premium products.","Altria forecasts its 2012 adjusted diluted EPS will increase by 6% to 9% to a range of $2.17 to $2.23 from an adjusted base of $2.05 per share in 2011. We also expect to achieve reported diluted EPS in the range of $2.14 to $2.20 per share.","Today, we also announced that I have informed our Board of my intention to retire as Chairman and CEO, effective immediately following this year's annual meeting of shareholders on May 17. It has been an extraordinary experience to lead the reshaping of Altria, following the completion of the Kraft and Philip Morris International spinoffs. I believe the company is well positioned to continue to prosper. As I near retirement, now is the time to transition leadership to people of an age to guide the company through its next phase of growth.","I am very pleased that our Board has elected Marty Barrington to succeed me as Chairman and CEO upon my retirement. And I am equally pleased that they have elected Dave Beran to work with Marty as President and Chief Operating Officer, effective at the same time.","Marty has held various roles in the Altria family of companies since 1993, including Vice Chairman and Chief Compliance Officer and as General Counsel of both PM U.S.A. and Philip Morris International. And these and other roles, he has participated in the work of virtually every business function of the Altria family of companies through direct business responsibility for regulatory and external affairs; research and development; human resources and compliance, as well as working closely with marketing, sales, strategy and business development and operations. This unique background gives the Board and me, personally, great confidence in his ability to lead Altria's businesses going forward. Moreover, I believe the combination of Marty's expertise, Dave's extensive operations, marketing and financial background and the talents of the rest of the Altria leadership team will create the strongest executive team among consumer packaged goods companies.","I will now turn the call over to Howard Willard, Altria's Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss Altria's business results in more detail.","Howard A. Willard","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. The cigarette segment's reported operating companies income results for the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by higher restructuring charges related to the cost reduction program we announced in October and adverse judgments in the Bullock and Williams cases that we announced in December, partially offset by higher list prices. Reported operating companies income for cigarettes decreased 5.4% for the fourth quarter. Cigarette segment operating companies income for the full year increased 2.3% to $5.6 billion on a reported basis, primarily due to higher list prices partially offset by lower volume, higher restructuring charges associated with our new cost reduction program, charges related to adverse judgments in the Bullock, Scott and Williams cases and higher FDA user fees. Excluding charges for restructuring and tobacco and health judgments, adjusted cigarette segment operating companies income grew 13.7% for the fourth quarter and 5.2% to $5.9 billion for the full year. PM U.S.A.'s focus on margin expansion helped drive these results. PM U.S.A. grew its 2011 adjusted operating companies income margins by 3.2 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 1.8 percentage points for the full year, bringing its adjusted margin for the full year to 40.2%.","PM U.S.A.'s reported cigarette shipment volume declined 4% for the full year and was also down an estimated 4% when adjusted for trade inventories and one less shipping day. PM U.S.A. estimates that the total cigarette categories adjusted volume declined 3.5% in 2011, the lowest decline rate since 2006. PM U.S.A. believes that the historical price elasticity estimated at negative 0.3 remains unchanged and that the secular decline rate, which reflects societal trends in adult consumers shifts from cigarette to smokeless and other tobacco products, has been stable for several years.","PM U.S.A.'s volume in the fourth quarter increased by 0.2%, primarily due to trade inventory dynamics and retail share gains for L&M, partially offset by retail share losses on Marlboro and its other brands as well as one less shipping day.","Marlboro's fourth quarter and full year retail share declined 0.7 and 0.6 share point, respectively, from its strong retail share performance in 2010. PM U.S.A.'s decision not to build Marlboro share on price promoted share is reflected in both PM U.S.A.'s strong margin performance and Marlboro's retention of some but not all of the 0.8 share point that the brand gained in 2010. Marlboro's full year retail share of 42% continues to reflect the brand's strong position across multiple flavor segments.","PM U.S.A.'s fourth quarter retail share decreased 0.4 share point, as share losses from Marlboro and other premium brands were partially offset by discount share gains driven by L&M. PM U.S.A.'s full year retail share declined 0.8 share point.","The smokeless products segment reported fourth quarter and full year financial results were negatively impacted by higher restructuring charges associated with our new cost reduction program. Fourth quarter income, margin, volume and retail share comparisons were also impacted by higher 2011 fourth quarter promotional activities versus lower levels of promotions in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the rollout of an enhanced retail platform. Reported operating companies income for the segment decreased 8.3% for the fourth quarter primarily due to higher restructuring charges and higher promotional costs, partially offset by higher pricing and volume. For the full year, reported operating companies income increased 7% to $859 million primarily due to higher pricing and volume, partially offset by higher restructuring charges. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related charges, fourth quarter adjusted operating companies income for the smokeless products segment increased 3.6%. Fourth quarter operating companies income margins decreased 1.9 percentage points to 59.3%, reflecting a difficult comparison to the fourth quarter of 2010 when lower promotional activity boosted margins. Adjusted operating companies income for the smokeless products segment grew a strong 7.7% to $896 million for 2011. Adjusted operating companies income margins also grew for the full year, increasing 1.5 percentage points to 59%.","Copenhagen and Skoal's combined shipment volume grew 6.5% for the full year. Copenhagen benefited from new products introduced over the past few years including Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen, Long Cut Straight, Extra Long Cut Natural and Wintergreen Pouches. Skoal's volume also benefited from its new products: Skoal X-tra and Skoal Snus, partially offset by the delisting of 7 SKUs in the second quarter of 2011.","Total smokeless products volume for the full year increased 1.4%, as gains for Copenhagen and Skoal were partially offset by declines in other portfolio products including non-focused brands and Marlboro Snus. Marlboro Snus' volume was negatively impacted by significantly lower levels of promotional support compared to its national launch in 2010 and the shift in mix from packages with 6 pouches to tins with 15 pouches.","Fourth quarter smokeless products shipment volume comparisons were favorably impacted by reduced promotional activities in 2010. Copenhagen and Skoal increased their combined shipment volume by 13% for the fourth quarter, while total smokeless products volume increased 9.7%. After adjusting for changes in trade inventories, USSTC and PM U.S.A.'s 2011 fourth quarter and full year combined smokeless products shipment volume was estimated to be up 6% and 4%, respectively. USSTC and PM U.S.A. believe that the smokeless category's full year volume grew at an estimated rate of 5%.","Retail share comparisons for the fourth quarter were favorably impacted by the promotional dynamics I discussed earlier. Copenhagen and Skoal's 2011 combined retail share increased 2.4 share points to 49.9% in the fourth quarter and grew 1 share point to 49% for the full year. Copenhagen's 2011 fourth quarter and full year retail share increased 2.4 and 1.5 share points, respectively, as the brand's retail share results continued to benefit from new products. Skoal's retail share was flat for the fourth quarter and down 0.5 share point for the full year, as share losses including the impact of SKUs delisted in the second quarter of 2011 were partially offset by share gains on new products.","Fourth quarter retail share for the total smokeless products segment increased 1.1 share points, as gains for Copenhagen were partially offset by losses on other portfolio products. Segment share for the full year decreased 0.1 percentage point, as declines on other portfolio products in Skoal were mostly offset by gains in Copenhagen.","Middleton's fourth quarter operating companies income and margins improved significantly versus the same period in 2010 when Black & Mild made promotional investments to defend its competitive position in the marketplace against low-priced imported cigars. Reported operating companies income increased 85.7% for the fourth quarter primarily due to lower promotional spending and higher list prices, partially offset by lower volume and higher restructuring charges in connection with the new cost reduction program. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, fourth quarter adjusted operating companies income grew 95.5%, and adjusted operating companies income margins grew 16.8 percentage points to 47.8%.","As Mike mentioned earlier, Middleton's income and margins were stronger in the second half of 2011 compared to the first half. Full year reported operating companies income decreased 2.4% primarily due to costs related to manufacturing infrastructure upgrades and new product costs, partially offset by higher list prices. Adjusted operating companies income decreased 1.2% for the full year to $167 million, and adjusted operating companies income margins decreased 2.2 percentage points to 46.4%. Middleton's 2011 full year reported cigar shipment volume was unchanged, while fourth quarter volume decreased 5.6% primarily due to changes in trade inventories. Middleton believes the wholesalers depleted Black & Mild cigar inventories built in the third quarter following Middleton's December list price increase. Black & Mild delivered strong retail results for both the fourth quarter and full year. Fourth quarter retail share of machine-made large cigars increased 0.9 share point to 30.8%, and full year share increased 0.5 share point to 29.5%. Black & Mild's retail share benefited from the introduction of new untipped cigarillos that Mike mentioned earlier.","The wine segment reported strong operating companies income and volume results in 2011. The wine segment's reported operating companies income increased by 23.3% for the fourth quarter and by 49.2% to $91 million for the full year. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating companies income for the wine segment was unchanged for the fourth quarter and up 14.5% to $95 million for the full year. Ste. Michelle's 2011 wine shipments grew by 10.9% in the fourth quarter and 9.6% for the full year, as the company continued to focus on expanding its distribution of its premium products.","The financial services segment's 2011 fourth quarter operating companies income was $10 million, reflecting a $60 million increase in the allowance for losses related to the bankruptcy filing by American Airlines. For the full year, the segment reported an operating companies loss of $349 million primarily due to the 2011 second quarter charge of $490 million related to certain leveraged lease transactions and a $25 million net increase in the allowance for losses, partially offset by higher lease revenues, which included gains on asset sales. Full year adjusted operating companies income for the segment, which is calculated excluding the impact of the leveraged lease charge decreased $16 million to $141 million.","Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items.","Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 35% for both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2011. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.73 in the fourth quarter and $5.70 for the full year, while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.24 in the fourth quarter and $4.22 for the full year. The cigarette discount categories retail share was 28.1% for the fourth quarter and 27.8% for the full year.","The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.37 per pack, unchanged from the third quarter and up $0.01 from the fourth quarter of 2010. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.18 for both the fourth quarter and full year, and it's brand's price gap versus the leading discount brand was 42% for the fourth quarter and 43% for the full year.","CapEx was $30 million for the fourth quarter and $105 million for the full year. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $69 million for the fourth quarter and $253 million for the full year.","Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christina McGlone-Hahn with Deutsche Bank.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, first question, just in terms of the wording with regard to the 2012 Marlboro strategy, it seems like you've been trying to balance share with profit growth, and it looks like, just from hearing the comments, that 2012 may be more tilted towards share growth. And I just was wondering if you could comment on that and then maybe talk about some of -- when you talked about Marlboro Black, is that nationwide? Is that positioned like Special Blends? Or is it positioned differently?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, Marlboro Black is nationwide, and it's positioned as Marlboro Black. Relative to plans for Marlboro in 2012, from a forward-looking point of view, we've provided EPS guidance. We don't like to get into the detail of how we're going to deliver what we think we're going to deliver for competitive reasons, but at CAGNY, we will provide some additional context regarding our thinking about Marlboro when some of the things that we're looking at relative to the brand as we go forward through 2012 without providing too much information from a competitive point of view.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And when I think of -- about cash flow, if -- with the $500 million pension contribution -- and I'm sure -- I think that there will be a LILO\/SILO payment this year. I don't know if that's definitive or not, if we should be building something like that in. But given the 2 of those, would that basically limit your ability to go beyond the $1 billion share repo already announced?","Howard A. Willard","Yes, I think as you look at our balance sheet, we continue to have a strong balance sheet and strong cash flow. With regard to our share repurchase program, I'm not going to comment on an activity beyond the program that we've currently announced.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Citigroup.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My first question has to do with the portfolio mix. I mean, to be sure, the fact that you've held onto as much of the 2010 share gains from Marlboro is certainly a good thing. But from my perspective, I'm a bit encouraged by the discount volume growth. As we look out to 2012, can you talk a little bit about how you see your portfolio mix in cigarettes evolving?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I think nothing's changed from a strategic point of view for us. We're focused on premium brands. This year, L&M recovered a bit of the share that basically got lost. Our objective there is to kind of hold our position in the discount segment and transition it to L&M as a brand. So some of that occurred, but our absolute share of the discount business has remained pretty constant over the past few years, as we've kind of ceded some share on basic and recovered some of that on the L&M. You shouldn't read any into that, any suggestion of strategic change.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. In terms of the new partnership that you announced this morning, can you give us any color on when we might see some new product innovations come out of that and whether that you would be Marlboro branding or branding under any other brand in your portfolio?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I'll tell you what, I don't think I'm going to comment on it any further right now. At CAGNY, we'll talk a bit more about our relationship and the whole subject of alternate [ph] products for tobacco consumers. And so I'd suggest that you wait until that point before we communicate any further on the subject.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay that's great. And just last -- one last more if I could. Could you offer some color on your outlook for SET and FET increases in 2012?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, we always view that as a risk to the business, and so it's an area where we have to be prepared to participate and we do. It's an election year. Sometimes that makes it a little bit more difficult to call. So we'll see. Right now, we're just watching to see what kind of activity might emerge so that we can be prepared to deal with it appropriately.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","There's 3 things I wanted to ask you. First, do you think Marlboro can profitably grow share? And what's your response to, I think, the concern in the investment community that if the brand doesn't grow, you'll resort to higher levels of promotional spending?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, look. We've been pretty clear with our position relative to the cigarette business. We believe that the appropriate strategy in the cigarette business is to maximize profitability but maintain modest momentum on Marlboro because we want to have sustainable profit growth. So I believe that our cigarette position is very good in that regard that as I explained in my remarks, I think share deviations on Marlboro this year really have more to do with differences in promotion spending and timing, both ours and competitive activity and that it's to be expected to have some of those kinds of share deviations particularly in this kind of economic environment where you have a certain segment of your consumer base that is more price sensitive and is more volatile relative to shopping and relative to promotion activity you see in the store. I think Marlboro's held up very well in that environment. Price gaps have remained stable throughout that environment. The brand was able to contribute to expanded margins at Philip Morris U.S.A. And I think it's well positioned, as I said in my remarks, to go into 2012. So we look at this on a long-term basis. We think that based on the guidance we provided that we can continue to deliver a solid growth rate in EPS to our shareholders and that Marlboro will be a part of that proposition.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Secondly, let me ask you about the prepared comments you made about no change in elasticity, no change in the secular volume decline rate. How do you reconcile those 2 beliefs with the fact that year-on-year, there's been very little retail price increases to consumers? As an example, I think Marlboro's pricing year-on-year is up 1%, and yet consumption is down 3.5%.","Howard A. Willard","Well, David, this is Howard. I'll address that question. I mean, as we look over the last 3 or 4 years and we calculate the decline rate, we calculate it as a combination of the secular decline rate and a price elasticity impact. And as we've looked over the last 3 or 4 years, as I said in my remarks, we've seen a very consistent secular decline rate, and frankly, we've seen the price elasticity hold up pretty well. And that applied even during the large FET increase here. So again, we study this pretty carefully, and we're seeing quite a bit of consistency there.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, just a question on the FDA, and it's a big picture question. There have been now some instances. I guess, they've had control going on for 2 years over tobacco, some instances where the FDA's had some freedom to operate, some capacity to provide indications of its sort of underlying approach to regulating tobacco. And I guess there are 2 potential extremes. One is that they'd be non-science based and extremely hostile, and the other one would be that they'd be cautious and science based. And I'm just curious. To this point to the extent, Mike, that you have a read, where do think the FDA is coming out on that spectrum with respect to its philosophical approach to regulating tobacco?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I think so far what we've seen has been about what we would have expected, a methodical approach to applying the legislation that was passed, that the FDA has the obligation to do that. And that legislation calls for the FDA to use science and evidence to do things that are in the interest of public health related to tobacco. And while I still think it's early in the process, I think the FDA has followed the legislation and is moving right along relative to the legislative imperatives that it's been given. And I think is from our perspective, it's been appropriate in the way it's been moving forward. So it remains to be seen what the outcome will be on some of the issues. And I'm sure there will be places, and there have already been some places where you may see industry disagreement with conclusions that have been drawn or regulations that have been issued by the FDA. But I think that's always to be expected in a regulatory environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","I just wanted to see if you could give a little more color on the restructuring savings and how you think you might use some of that. How much would you reinvest in marketing or brand building? And how much would drop to the bottom line?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, once again, we provide guidance, as the forward-looking way for investors and analysts to have some idea of what we're thinking and what we anticipate will be the outcome for the year, but we don't like to get into breaking down the internals because it does have a bearing on competition and how people view or try to determine what our competitive positions might be and what we might do. So I'm going to decline to break it down any further than the guidance that we've provided.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then looking at consumer sentiment and in C stores specifically, we've seen some trading up to things like better beer and energy drinks that have been strong there. Have you seen that be a tailwind for Marlboro in that channel as well? And do you feel like you might be getting some trading up coming back from people who have been switching to cheaper brands?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, look, the premium discount mix in the cigarette category has remained pretty much in the range that it's been in over the last number of years. So any activity in shifting between premium and discount -- and remember, this is largely a premium business -- is really driven by short-term activity in the marketplace. So we haven't seen any trend outline changes. We see actually a lot of promotion activity between the leading premium brands and some trading of volume back and forth and share back and forth between those premium brands, once again, based on levels of shorter-term promotion spending. And there -- everybody has to understand that in any category and on any brand, even the most premium of premium brands, there is always a segment of that brand's consumer population that's more price sensitive and promotion sensitive and does in fact switch from time to time between other brands that they've found to be satisfactory when they can buy them on promotion. And so we have a segment of that business on the Marlboro brand, even though the brand has a very high loyalty factor of people who buy the brand 100% of the time. So I don't see any underlying trend changes right now in the category between premium and discount. I just see promotion-driven shifting that is short term. And in our view, again, we're managing this category to maximize profitability and maintain longer-term strength of position for our brands so that they can continue to deliver good profit growth.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","That\u2019s helpful. And then lastly on Black, I know it's just launched and so I don't know how much you've seen actually in market yet. But where is that sourcing volume from or where do you expect that to be sourcing volume from?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Yes, it's a bit early for us to talk about that. We'll talk a bit more about it at CAGNY.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had a quick one and actually a bit of a follow-up to the last question. Based on kind of the current economic outlook for 2012 GDP, consumer confidence, that's where things should all sort of modestly improve through the year. I'm just curious, just for perspective, do you believe that would be enough to -- or would the industry respond with less aggressive promotions in an improving economic environment? Or do we need a real step-up in improving the economy to see maybe more pricing or less -- and\/or less promotion?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Yes. Well, generally, unemployment and consumer confidence have been factors that have been associated with the ability for brands to sustain a wider gap between a premium brand's price and the lowest price in the marketplace. But that generally -- that outcome generally follows those things occurring. And we're still at high levels of unemployment, and we're still at low levels of consumer confidence. Okay? So I think that I can't predict the future on how fast or when that's going to change. I might just say that if it does, then it could have some positive impact. But I don't know when that will be.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Sure. And then I wanted to ask a question about the MLP program, since we have to ask one of those every quarter. But my question being there's been some adjustments to that program and reflecting some of the guidance you've gotten from retail. And so I'm just curious if -- it's a bit early, I realize. But is there any sort of increase in participation rates or anything like that, that you can speak to that you think the new program will allow for?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, once again, I think I'll defer to CAGNY, I think, when we talk about the business in a little more detail and a little more time has passed.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one final one if I could. The -- do you regard the cigarette inventory levels today as -- at good levels here? And are there -- and then I guess related to that, any shipping day differences in 2012 we should be aware of?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, the third quarter ended with really low inventory levels. Inventory levels on cigarettes grew a bit in the fourth quarter, and then toward the end of the fourth quarter after pricing activity in the marketplace, they declined again. So it was kind of a complex quarter from the point of view of inventory movement. Probably the easiest way to understand it is that we began 2012 with inventory levels that are pretty equivalent to how we began 2011.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And that'd be considered a good level for you?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Yes, that's a reasonably normalized level. I mean, there's always some movement in these things that are driven by particular wholesaler or retailer motivations at any point in time. But I think the easiest way to understand where we are as we began 2012 with inventory, wholesale inventory levels that were pretty equivalent to where we began 2011.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Chris Byrd [ph] with Bloomberg News.","Unknown Attendee","Mike, wanted -- it seems appropriate to ask you since you're leaving in a few months. I wonder whether you could take a look back and just offer some sense of how the company has managed volatility in the business and its share price. I'm just wondering whether conditions are such now where volatility is less of a risk than it was, say, 10 years ago.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, that's kind of a hard question to ask -- answer because oftentimes volatility is driven by external factors rather than what we're actually doing and how we're actually performing in the business. I do think it's fair to say that in the cigarette business, we've gone -- in my career, we've gone through really 3 downturns with this last one, I mean economic downturns, with this last one being probably the most severe. And I think that the cigarette brands or Marlboro in particular has been most successful in the way its business has been performing and its ability to grow profitability in this last one, which is the longest, and probably the most difficult. And I think to some degree that's a reflection of what we learned from the other ones. So I'd say that we've gotten better at dealing with that particular area where from time to time, there are economic situations that develop that aren't particularly attractive for consumers and kind of knowing how to run premium brands in that kind of environment and continue to give stable, consistent returns to shareholders, I think, is one of the things that the company is good at.","Unknown Attendee","Marty, if I may ask quickly, obviously you're taking charge. Do you have a sense of look...","Michael E. Szymanczyk","I'm sorry. Are you asking a question to...","Unknown Attendee","Just looking ahead, Marty, what are the biggest challenges going forward in terms of the company managing the volatility that goes with your business? Is it FDA regulation? Is it...","Michael E. Szymanczyk","I'm sure Marty has an excellent answer to that question except he's not here.","Unknown Attendee","Oh, I'm sorry. Well, Mike can I ask you that question?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","And he doesn't get to be CEO until May 17. Okay? So between now and then, you're stuck with me.","Unknown Attendee","How about giving me a little forward look then, Mike, if you don't mind?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I think that the issues remain pretty much what they have been. I think the risk to the business are always competitive risks, marketplace risks, economic risks. We have regulatory risks. We have legal risks. They're not new news, nor are they unknown. They're pretty much the same ones that have been around for a bit now and that we have had pretty successful track record in managing. But they continue to be the risks that I believe that the company faces.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mike, just maybe taking a step back here in the last couple of years. If we look at the company's performance, obviously the profit growth, the earnings growth have been pretty healthy. But if you look at just the revenue growth, you haven't really seen any growth in revenues just if -- even if we just take the -- all of your tobacco businesses, so certainly, a bit of a different algorithm than, I think, what you've laid out at the time of the spinoff. So as you go forward, is top line growth even a consideration for Altria? Can you continue to get pretty healthy profit and earnings growth really without getting top line growth? And if so, sort of what's changed on the cost side or other factors that are driving better profit growth as opposed to top line growth as we think about the next few years?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Yes. Well, if you're getting a -- what you're primarily referring to is the cigarette business because the other businesses are growing categories. But I think in the cigarette business, the answer to the question is that given the complexity of the math model, it actually isn't a necessity to have top line revenue growth in order to have profit growth. And that continues out, I think, into the future. It's nice to get it when you can get it, but it's not a necessity to get it in order to have profit growth. And I think we've demonstrated that.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But if you take the total tobacco portfolio as a whole now that you're going to put cigar business with PM U.S.A. -- obviously smokeless tobacco is growing, but it's still relatively smaller portion of your total tobacco business. So when you look at in totality, is your point that you can still get to the profit growth algorithm without really getting the top line growth? And then maybe then talk a little bit about the cost savings opportunity. You've laid out the $400 million. But beyond that are there a lot of opportunities to really get continued cost savings out of different businesses that you operate?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Yes. Well, just once again, as growth the businesses grow, the cigarette business becomes less of a percentage of the total profit pool. But we continue to expect that our cigarette profitability is going to grow out to the future. And my point is it's not really necessary to actually get top line growth in order to get profit growth out of the cigarette business. Relative to cost, we lay those things out as we get to them rather than provide a lot of forward-looking information, so I'm not going to report on that. We have a program we've announced, and as we accrue those savings, we'll be talking about that.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of the competitive landscape, you've seen now some of the price increases coming up either from Newport, [indiscernible] or at the discount segment. So as you think about 2012, do you feel better about the competitive backdrop today than maybe a year ago where you did have a lot of introductory promotions going on behind Newport and some of the discount brands that were pretty heavily promoted?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, again, I would describe the cigarette industry right now from a pricing point of view as pretty stable. I mean, if you look at price gaps, across the key brands, it's pretty stable, but it's very competitive. So there's still a lot of ebb and flow of short-term promotion activity. There are no fundamental trend changes that seem to be taking place in the industry, so I expect it to continue to be competitive. But within that, it's pretty stable overall industry, and the profit pool continues to expand.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just clarification on the inventory comment you made, so the gap in the Q4 numbers to your shipments coming in, up 0.2 and your underlying volume being down 3% or 4%. So all of that difference was attributable to just really the low level of inventory at the end of 3Q and then just to catch up to getting to a normal level in Q4?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","No, I don't think I spoke to that nor am I going to try and reconcile it. My comment was simply that inventories at the beginning of 2012 were about the same as they were at the beginning of 2011.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Should we think anything differently about Q1 in terms of whether any inventory movement could impact shipments?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, we can't predict what the inventory movement's going to be by wholesalers, so I'd decline to comment on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Felberbaum of Associated Press.","Michael Felberbaum","In regards to the agreement that you announced today for -- as far as noncombustible nicotine products, does that -- other companies have previously announced agreements and ventures into this area. Do you have confidence that the FDA will ultimately make it possible for companies to market some of these products as less harmful than or safer than cigarettes? And do you think that consumers will ultimately be interested in these alternatives?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, to answer your -- first part of your question is I have confidence that the FDA is going to study this issue and make a determination about it because it's a part of what's in the legislation. And I think that they'll -- they've already begun to look at the subject. So I do have confidence that it's going to be reviewed. And relative to how consumers react, I think that's going to be depending upon the products.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Gurkin of Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to return to the Marlboro franchise. And I know you talked about this a little bit, but in '10, we focused on gaining volume; '11, improved profitability for the franchise, and kind of as we move through '12, can you give us any kind of metrics we could track as to how the Marlboro franchise is performing versus your expectations?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","No, I'm not going to do that.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I have to try. And then secondly, do you care to comment at all on the timing of an FDA decision on menthol by any chance?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","No, I can't. I think that process continues along, and I don't know that there's any decision for the FDA to make. I just think they have a mandate to study the issue, and they've continued to move through a process that meets their legislative mandate. So I don't know what the outcome of that will be.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Smith of UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Actually, it's Nik. So just 2 quick questions for me. On the smokeless side, it looks like you're having some good volume gain on the premium end. I'm just curious, American Snuff put out a new contract, looking to get more space [ph]. Just curious how you've seen the competitive interaction there at least at the shelf, what kind of impact it has had. And then the second question is I continue to pick up kind of a dissatisfaction at the retail level on broader execution. This has been a concern of mine for 1.5 years now. Just curious, do you see it? And what is Altria doing to help address that? That would be very helpful.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, to answer your first question is I don't really know the answer at this point. I mean, there's always some movement in the trade programs, and we have had some in ours, and we've seen some recent activity from some competitor, competitive activity. And it's kind of hard at this point to gauge what the outcome is because some of that's still in motion. Relative to our retail organization, we've been continuing to work through the integration of all these businesses into one sales organization, and one of the impediments that we had was we had to take the different systems that existed and take these 3 categories and put them into our system, which at the time, was really designed to accommodate one category. And over the course of the last couple of years, we've built a new system and installed that system in December and trained the entire organization on that system. And so they're just now getting up and running. We also will complete a reconfiguration of the organization based on how the business development is with the totality of these businesses from a geographic point of view versus the way it was originally designed, which was around the cigarette business. So that has implications for coverage and the amount of coverage and then having your coverage in the right places. And so all of those things are a continuation of the completion of these acquisitions that we made and kind of beginning to tune up some of the places where you have some residual effect. So I think that as we come to a close on that kind of disruptive activity in the sales organization that we'll be in a better position. Now we haven't really seen, I don't think, an impact on the business from that, but it is difficult for our people sometimes when they're having to work with less-than-optimum systems for example to get their work done.","Operator","Your final question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Priya Ohri-Gupta. Just wanted to get a sense from you as we sort of model out the forward year. What sort of core cash balance should we be baking in? And for example, I'm just talking about the amount of cash needed to address your day-to-day ongoing business requirements.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Yes. We don't provide forecasts on what our cash balances are expected to be. If you want to understand our needs, you can certainly look at the historical financial statements, and there's a pattern there that you could probably take a look at.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just as we sort of think about your debt refinancing needs over the coming year, should we sort of continue to think that you would manage to existing balances? Or would you continue to look at potentially refinancing just given where rates are?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Yes, I'm not going to make any comments on our future plans in the debt markets.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Brendan McCormick for closing remarks.","Brendan McCormick","I want to thank everyone for joining our call today. We will be webcasting our presentation at the Annual Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference on February 22, where Mike and our Altria leadership team will make a presentation, so we look forward to having you join us there.

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Altria\u2019s management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Sarah Knakmuhs, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Sarah Knakmuhs","Good morning and thank you for joining us. We are here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria\u2019s CEO; and Billy Gifford, Altria\u2019s CFO to discuss Altria\u2019s 2015 first quarter business results.","During our call today unless otherwise stated, we\u2019re comparing results to the same period in 2014. Earlier today, we issued a press release regarding our first quarter results. For a detailed review of them, please review the earnings release on our website at altria.com or via the Altria investor app.","Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today\u2019s earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria\u2019s Board. The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.","Today\u2019s call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website and via the Altria investor app.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Marty.","Marty Barrington","Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Altria is off to a strong start in 2015. Our core tobacco businesses continued to deliver on their strategies, backed by the strengths of their leading premium brands. Each of our reportable segments grew operating companies income and expanded their margins.","Altria grew its adjusted diluted EPS by 10.5%, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, and repurchased 3.6 million shares in the first quarter, and earlier this morning we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 full year adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 9%. Here are some important highlights from the quarter. PM USA delivered on its smokable segment strategy of maximizing income, while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro over time.","This segment produced outstanding results in the first quarter driven by higher pricing, higher volume and Marlboro retail share growth. PM USA has invested steadily to strengthen Marlboro and those investments continue to pay-off. As a result, the smokable segment grew adjusted operating companies income by over 12% in the quarter. PM USA\u2019s reported cigarette shipment volumes grew 1.6% in the quarter, benefiting from a moderation in the industry decline rate, trade inventory movements and retail share gains.","In the machine made large cigar category, John Middleton continued to strengthen its leadership position in the profitable tipped cigar segment. The company posted strong double-digit volume growth in the quarter driven primarily by Black & Mild. In the smokeless product segment, USSTC grew first quarter operating companies income by 5% and expanded its operating company income margin by one percentage point to over 63%.","USSTC estimates that its adjusted smokeless segment volumes grew approximately 4% in the quarter, while smokeless industry volumes grew 2% over the past 12 months. Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined retail share by half of a percentage point in the quarter.","Turning to innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark remains focused on building a robust portfolio of innovative tobacco products for adult smokers and vapors. Nu Mark began shipping its next generation e-vapor product, MarkTen XL, into lead markets this month.","In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle posted a quarter of nearly 23% operating companies income growth, primarily through improved premium mix. In the first quarter, equity earnings from SABMiller investment were negatively affected by SABMiller special items and unfavorable currency impacts from a stronger dollar. The investment continues to support our strong balance sheet and provides cash flow through its dividend.","So, we came into 2015 with momentum, and our first quarter results reflect another quarter of strong execution against our well defined strategies. We believe our businesses are positioned to help us deliver against our full-year guidance. Billy Gifford will now discuss our business results in more detail.","Billy Gifford","Thank you, Marty. Good morning everyone. Our smokable products segment helped drive adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10.5% in the first quarter. The smokable products segment and fewer shares outstanding also contributed to that growth.","The smokable products segment delivered strong adjusted operating company\u2019s income growth of 12.6%, primarily driven by higher pricing, higher shipment volume and lower resolution expenses due primarily to the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments.","Despite costs being higher in the quarter due primarily to higher pension and benefit cost and timing of SG&A spending, the smokable segment expanded its adjusted OCI margins by 2.3 percentage points. Volume was also strong. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its first quarter cigarette shipment volume was essentially unchanged and that total industry volumes declined approximately 0.5%.","For the quarter PM USA grew Marlboro\u2019s retail share by three-tenths of a share point to 44%, and grew its total cigarette category retail share by fourth-tenths of a share point. L&M share gains also contributed to PM USA's first quarter performance as the brand continued to grow its share while the overall industry discount category declined in the quarter.","In the total machine-made large cigars category, Black & Mild\u2019s retail share declined 0.6 points in the first quarter. As Marty mentioned, Middleton continued to concentrate on the more profitable, tipped cigars segment, where Black & Mild gained share. ","In the smokeless products segment, operating companies income increased 5% in the first quarter as higher pricing was partially offset by higher promotional investments. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates that its domestic smokeless product shipment volume grew approximately 4% in the quarter, while the industry grew approximately 2% over the past 12 months.","Copenhagen and Skoal\u2019s combined retail share grew five-tenths of a share point in the quarter to 51.2%. Copenhagen\u2019s retail share grew one share point, while Skoal\u2019s retail share declined five-tenths of a share point. ","The wine segment delivered very strong results in the first quarter. Ste. Michelle grew operating companies income by 22.7% in the first quarter, primarily driven by improved premium mix. Shipments increased by 0.5% in the quarter. ","That wraps up the operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, let us cover a few housekeeping items.","As a reminder, comparisons when made are against the first quarter of 2014 unless we note otherwise. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 31% in the first quarter, down 2 percentage points.","For the first quarter, Marlboro's net pack price was $6.06, up $0.15, and the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.62, up $0.17. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax was $1.49 per pack for the first quarter, up $0.01.","Wholesale inventory changes are one factor PM USA uses to estimate adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM USA estimates that its wholesale inventories were approximately 2.6 billion units at the end of the first quarter of 2015 and 2.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. At the end of the first quarter of 2014, PM USA's wholesale inventories were estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion units.","PM USA estimates that cigarette industry wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units at the end of the first quarter of 2015 and 5.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. PM USA estimates that first quarter of 2014 wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units.","Copenhagen's price gap versus the leading discount brand was 29% in the first quarter, down 3 percentage points. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.22 in the first quarter, up $0.13. The price of the leading discount brand was $3.26 in the first quarter, up $0.17.","CapEx was $48 million for the first quarter. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $49 million for the quarter. ","Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.","Owen Bennett","Good morning guys.","Marty Barrington","Hello Owen.","Owen Bennett","And couple of questions please, I mean firstly, any commentary on Marlboro Black is that still taking share, if you could say, I mean, how much of Marlboro share growth is being driven by Black and then secondly, any update on recent market share trends for MarkTen. I notice how you no longer have the statement about being amongst the top e-vapor brands nationally like you did at year end and should we read anything into that? Thanks very much.","Marty Barrington","Sure. Let us start with Marlboro Black. It continues to do a terrific job. In fact, it has grown for 17 consecutive quarters. We don\u2019t break the shares out by SKUs as you know Owen, but Marlboro Black is doing a terrific job, particularly in the important segment of adult smokers, 21 to 29.","I hope you had a chance to see our remarks [Indiscernible] about our vapor business. Our aspiration there is to succeed in the long term. What that means is we are moving with appropriate dispatch, but with financial discipline, always learning from the consumer and frankly what we are working on principally right now in addition to our distribution and brand building is product development.","Consumers are telling e-vapor manufacturers that the products are not yet there. That is why you see us improving our product development pipeline and to be sure, share is important, but it will be important as soon as the products are established with the consumers. We are not unduly focused on share. We are focused on getting the right products in the consumer\u2019s hands.","Owen Bennett","Okay. Thanks very much.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Good morning.","Marty Barrington","Hi Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi. My first question is on consumption, given the strong industry cigarette volume and the decelerating smokeless industry volume, do you have a sense of underlying total tobacco consumption when considering both of these categories, and then do you believe it is rising and if so why? And then maybe touch on, your outlook for, the cigarette decline rate, is the 3% to 4% decline rate realistic going forward?","Marty Barrington","Okay, great. Thanks for those questions. Let me start with cigarette volume. We don\u2019t forecast volume going forward as you know. It has been 3% to 4% over the last several years and we think that, you have to look at that over time. To be sure this quarter is a break, but it is only a quarter. So we will have to see. Probably the best answer to your question about consumption is the total consumption rate over the last several years as measured by government sources, which has been declining at about call it 1% to 1.5% total pounds.","So that takes into account Bonnie, all of the products that adult tobacco consumers are trying and of course it is a dynamic time. We have seen more movement among the categories. That is probably the best marker.","Bonnie Herzog","Yes. I mean that was kind of the basis for my question because, how smokers industry volume has been \u2013 has been performing not as well. So I think there has been a lot of interplay between the two categories. So you would agree with that?","Marty Barrington","Yes, and I think there is still growth there of course.","Bonnie Herzog","Right. Sure, it has just been [disarranged] slightly. And then I did want to touch on MarkTen and just hear from you just any updates you have about recent consumer behavior for MarkTen and then could you talk about the revenue for the business given that was down quite a bit sequentially, but was up year-over-year, but I am trying to also understand how much of a drag potentially was in those numbers from your financial service business. So if you could help me understand that that would be helpful?","Marty Barrington","I will try to give you a little help. It is in the all other category and so we don\u2019t break it out too much under that. But we are in investment mode. That is the best way to understand it and in response to Owen\u2019s question I pointed out that we have a lot of work underway to make sure that we have a robust portfolio of products because that is what the consumers are saying to everyone, which is, I\u2019m willing to try these products, but they are not quite there yet.","And so we are continually working to improve our offerings. That is why we have come out with MarkTen XL, twice the battery size, and so forth. And so I think that is the way to understand it and we are going to be investment mode here, but we do it in a financially disciplined way, always cognizant of our long-term financial goal of 7% to 9% growth in our EPS and we have been able to pull that off, and I\u2019m confident that we will over time.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay, thank you and then speaking of MarkTen XL, when do you expect that to be a nationwide expansion. I think you mentioned you are growing out into lead markets, and then how incremental do you anticipate this is going to be and how concerned are you with cannibalization for that extension?","Marty Barrington","We will talk about national once we get into lead markets and we see how it does. That is our innovation system, which is to put products in consumers hands, conducting experiments about whether the offering is interesting to them, find out how we can improve it and then we roll forward, and you saw that is how we did MarkTen. I think that is what you should expect with MarkTen XL.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay, and then just my final last question is your discount volume has been strong especially O&M, I like to hear what has been driving that especially given the stronger consumer, and maybe here have you touched on how you are balancing the growth of this segment with margin expansion, and what your strategy is in this space?","Marty Barrington","Yes, good questions both. Look, our focus is on the premium end of the business. More than 90% of PM USA cigarette shipments are premium and that is where the action is for us. But of course there is a discount segment out there. It is declining over time. The real reason that we are growing our discount business there is because of L&M. It is a terrific product that is priced competitively in the marketplace and it is doing great. So it is not our principal focus, but it does help the business albeit small.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Thank you.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for your questions Bonnie.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Marty Barrington","Hi Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. Just had a question for you, this is several quarters in a row where the price gap between Marlboro and the lowest priced product in the market has been down, and you have been taking very strong [Indiscernible], two questions around that, one would be as you look at your promotional setting overall in the quarter, could you say that was up or down, and I mean for the cigarette business overall, and then is there any \u2013 are you pulling back on promotions say in the premium side versus discount to help widen that gap. We seem to be in a little better economic situation today and perhaps that gap could widen a bit from this level?","Marty Barrington","Okay. Thanks for your questions. Let me go at it this way. We had net pricing realization in the cigarette \u2013 in the smokable segment of more than 5%. So you can see that despite the fact that the price gap has narrowed, we are as you point out taking strong pricing, which is great. The reason the price gap has narrowed in the quarter is because some discount brands increased their pricing faster than the premium brands did, and that is what accounts for the math, including some rounding frankly when you do the math and the price gaps.","So price gaps are a important metric as we have spoken about and we keep an eye on them, but boy, to have a quarter where we can grow our volume, grow our margin, get strong pricing realization, you can see the result of that Chris with nearly 13% operating company income growth. That is pretty good algorithm for us price gaps narrowing or not.","I don\u2019t know Bill you want to say a word about promotional spend?","Billy Gifford","Yes, I think if you think about it Chris, you will recall last year we actually had started dialing back promotional spend around Marlboro, and so we\u2019re lapping that as we go through the first quarter.","Chris Growe","Okay, great. Thanks for your time today.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for calling in Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Good morning.","Marty Barrington","Good morning Judy.","Judy Hong","So I guess I wanted to just go back to the cigarette consumption question and I hear this is one quarter, we really have to look at it on the longer term basis, but I don\u2019t recall a quarter where you had this kind of volume performance with the price growth that you are seeing across all the players. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color just in terms of the sustainability of this kind of performance within the current macro and competitive backdrop, if there is anything in terms of the investments that a lot of the players have made and perhaps bring equity building initiatives are kind of driving some of that as well because it seems to kind of imply that historically when you saw the volume performance really come through, typically it was associated with lower pricing and certainly that is not what we are seeing today?","Marty Barrington","Yes. Let me see if I can give you a bit more color to try to help you with it. You are right. It has been some time since we have seen numbers like this. Part of it is the comp versus a year ago. I mean the volume was down pretty significantly in the first quarter of \u201914 as you remember. But there is no denying that several factors are at play here. The economy is improving. It is improving for our consumer set finally, happily after this very difficult time during the recession.","We have the phenomenon of dropping gas prices and if it occurs for us at a time after we have made very significant investments in Marlboro. We implement the Marlboro architecture. We launch Marlboro Black. I would say all of those factors came together to contribute to what is a very strong quarter for PM USA. That is our analysis for our business at least.","Judy Hong","Okay. And then Billy, just thinking about the SABMiller contribution clearly the effects and some of the headwinds from a macro perspective is depressing SAB with contribution right now. It is a business that obviously you don\u2019t necessarily have a control over in terms of the operating performance. How do you sort of think about your 7% to 9% earnings growth algorithm to the extent that if SABMiller, the currency continues to weaken, do you have levers, either buyback or at the operating line that you can offset the weakness or because it is sort of outside of your control, you kind of look at that as more of a transient factor?","Billy Gifford","Yes, Judy. I think when you think about the SABMiller asset, it has been a great asset for us. It has performed very well. We are talking about one quarter and you mentioned the negative drivers from that equity income year-over-year, one being the special items, which were primarily related to asset impairment and then the negative currency drag.","We don\u2019t provide down to that level for the total year, but now at the beginning of the year when we provide that guidance we incorporate a number of factors and SAB was incorporated in that.","Judy Hong","Okay. So basically you have a view of how SABMiller would perform throughout the year and that bakes \u2013 that is just baked into your guidance. But to the extent the SABMiller piece gets worse than your anticipation, I guess the question is really do you have other levers to kind of drive the offset?","Billy Gifford","Yes, I think Judy overall you heard us reiterate guidance today. We feel good about that and we feel good about where the business is.","Marty Barrington","I do think Judy, it is Marty, that your reference to levers is exactly correct. That is what differentiates the Altria offering. We have numerous levers that we can use to try to meet our long-term goal of 7% to 9%, and if you look over the last several years we have been able to do that has various businesses have been up or down.","Judy Hong","Understood. Okay, thank you.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","Hi, good morning.","Marty Barrington","Hi Matt.","Matthew Grainger","Hi, two questions, one, first I wanted to ask you about the performance in the smokeless products segment, and specifically the acceleration in consumption for your products during the quarter, improving to 4%, Marty I just wanted your assessment of what actions you have taken or what factors during the quarter would have driven that acceleration, is that a function of perhaps addressing the value proposition around some of the brands in the degree of pricing that you have taken or would you attribute some of that to tactical efforts that you have made on Skoal whether you are seeing any impact there?","Marty Barrington","Sure. I think you have identified the two drivers. One is Copenhagen continues to grow strongly. You see a share point in the quarter and I do think the actions we are taking on Skoal are improving. In fact if you look at the quarterly results for Skoal, it is down half a share point, but it is the fourth consecutive quarter where it has narrowed those share losses year-over-year. We gave it a new equity campaign. We have terrific equity-based promotions I think that are improving its relationship with its consumer set and then as we have been working on the price gaps on Skoal Classic. I think all of that is helping to steady up Skoal, and that is spot on strategy for us. So I think it is the combination of Copenhagen\u2019s continued growth and our work on the value equation on Skoal.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, and I think we saw more improvement in [UST] volumes than we did for the category overall, but would you say there is any change in the level of interaction between smokeless and other alternative \u2013 other smokable alternatives?","Marty Barrington","Yes, I know. It is just hard to tease that out right now. It has been a couple of quarters. We do know that some of the growth previously in smokeless was due to cigarette smokers coming into the category. We now know that there are vapor alternatives. We now have a recovering economy. It is just really hard to tease out Matt what exactly those factors are, but we will be able to do it over time I would expect.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, thanks. And just one question on the cigar performance as well, just if you could help me better understand the mismatch between the volume growth in the market share trend? I know you are focused on tipped, but with volumes up 10% and share down roughly 50 basis points, does that imply that growth is up 15%, 20% in untipped, or is that just noise in the data?","Marty Barrington","It is probably short term noise, although untipped does continue to grow. What we\u2019re trying to do is to balance the share question with profitability and in this segment we always try to maximize income first. So, Black & Mild happily has a very strong share position in the segment that is providing frankly most of the profitability, and we think that is the better course at this time.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, great. Thank you both.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for calling in.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer","Hi, good morning.","Marty Barrington","Good morning Vivien.","Vivien Azer","So not to labor the point, but I also do have a question on smokeless tobacco, Marty we talked a lot about price elasticity in cigarettes and clearly they are holding up quite well, can you just remind us how you guys think about or chalk out price elasticity in the smokeless segment?","Marty Barrington","Yes, we have some proprietary models for that that allow us to try to get some sense. They are not as highly developed as you might expect in a category that has been around as long as cigarettes, but that is really a proprietary view of it, which I\u2019m not prepared to talk about on the phone candidly.","Vivien Azer","Okay, fair enough. As we look ahead to the mix shift that is ongoing in the cigarette segment, is it wise to say if the consumer continues to hold up, can you point back to another time where we have seen this much kind of trade up or resumption in trade up and how we should think about that trajectory continuing all else being equal from a macro perspective?","Marty Barrington","Well, we do know that when adult tobacco consumers are feeling better about their economic situation, they want to be in premium brands. And in this category, the premium brand they want to be in is Marlboro. We have seen that several times if you go back in history for example and you look at the [indiscernible] narrow price gaps got out of line the consumer was not feeling good about that. You\u2019re much too young to remember Vivien, but people predicted that was going to be end of brands and so forth. In effect it wasn\u2019t, it was that one the consumers thought that the price gap was appropriate. They came right back rowing into Marlboro. So, Marlboro has that kind of equity and we would expect that as consumers continue to consolidate around premium brands that Marlboro will do just fine.","Vivien Azer","Terrific, thank you very much.","Marty Barrington","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning.","Marty Barrington","Hi, Michael.","Unidentified Analyst","Just back on Marlboro, obviously it had a strong share performance in the quarter, can you just highlight any of maybe what the key drivers were there and how much Rich Blue have contributed?","Marty Barrington","It\u2019s early for Rich Blue, it\u2019s having a nice little effect in a trace I would say Marlboro architecture, Marlboro Black, strong Marlboro equity those continue to be the drivers of Marlboro\u2019s growth.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then, just looking at it on a longer view going back 5, 6 years it\u2019s up a little over 2 share points, your discount share is up slightly as well, but it is partly offset by about a 1.5 share loss for the other premium, you just said obviously your premium focused company and clearly Marlboro is the focus and the star, but is there anything you can do with the other premium brands that would make sense to invest there or is there any way, how do you think about those as a piece of the puzzle and is there any way to hold or gain share in those that make sense?","Marty Barrington","Yes, that\u2019s really a terrific question, we do have these other terrific premium brands that we offer for adult smokers they don\u2019t get a lot of support because frankly they have their franchise pretty settled and are very profitable. But parliament is probably the best example, we gave some limited support to parliament last year and it really paid back very well. Our focus is Marlboro, the other premium brands produce nice profitability contribution and if we can do some modest things for them that help stabilize their share well producing that profitability, we\u2019re open to that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that\u2019s helpful thanks. And then, just lastly on maybe a little bit just broader view where do you see sort of risk is there near term or long term and just what do you kind of see as where the watch outs are, what maybe specifically for this year in terms of what could put you at the lower end of the guidance or just longer term in terms of strategically?","Marty Barrington","Well, there is always risks in every business right, and we kind of look at that at the beginning of the year and the category like this, you\u2019re always watching volume, you\u2019re watching your pricing power, you\u2019re watching regulation, you\u2019re watching excise tax, I mean, you\u2019re competitive activity now those of all, then well handled overtime and we have good plans and place for all of them but if you are trying to identify factors in this industry that present risk as well as opportunity those are probably some of them.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you very much.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for calling.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Bill Marshall of Barclays.","William Marshall","Thank you, good morning.","Marty Barrington","Hi Bill.","William Marshall","Just kind of building off of Judy\u2019s question I think from earlier in your comments Marty, obviously there is a lot of top line momentum here and even underlying the consumer seems to be doing better and you pointed that the levers that you have across the P&L, just want to put into context your strong first quarter into context with your full year outlook of 7% to 9% earnings growth. Is there anything specific we should be looking out for the spending ramp up, is it just a matter of a tougher 4Q comparison anything specifically in there as you launch Nu MarkTen product anything that we should be looking out for?","Marty Barrington","No, I don\u2019t think in particular. I think Billy said it best earlier which is when we put the year together for our guidance, there are always puts and takes and we look at the operating company performance and we look at SAD contribution, you always look at exercise taxes and so forth and so on. So, I think the guidance that we put together which we reaffirm today just reflects our view particularly early in the year about we can do. I think we pointed out previously, I think when we gave the guidance, we have got some pension and benefit expense which is flowing in. We\u2019re are winding up the Philip Morris Capital core business so it\u2019s not contributing at the same rate it used to contribute at. And we\u2019re making discipline investments in the innovators space that\u2019s probably the best way to look at that Bill.","William Marshall","Okay, thank you. And just a quick question. I\u2019m just a curious on your side, as you see when your competitors go through the MRTP modified with tobacco product process with the FDA, just wanted to get your thoughts about prospects for the PM technology \u2013 and if you had any idea of a timeline when you think that could be commercialized and kind of the process that you\u2019re looking at going through onto get that into market?","Marty Barrington","Yes that\u2019s an interesting area to ask about, thank you. Listen, one of the reasons we supported FDA was because this process now allows manufacturers to bring products to the FDA to try to see if we can get them qualified as modified risk or reduced risk. And so, the [indiscernible] was the first hearing and there was quite a lot of buzz about that but it was just a first hearing, it was expected to be a long term project to bring these projects to market so I think I wouldn\u2019t be over reading that too much. We continue to work with BMI on our own process regarding heat not burn, the first milestone to watch for will be the filing of the application. And then hopefully the one after that will be its approval and that we continue to work in the meantime on our branding and marketing and go to market strategies as we\u2019re very hopeful about that product and as you know we\u2019ll have the exclusive on that product in the United States. So, we continue to pursue that.","William Marshall","Thank you.","Marty Barrington","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Thank you, there are no further questions. At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Sarah Knakmus for any closing comments.","Sarah Knakmuhs","Thank you everyone for joining our call this morning.

We are here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Howard Willard, Altria\u2019s CFO to talk about Altria\u2019s 2014 business results for the fourth quarter and full year.","During our call today unless otherwise stated, we\u2019re comparing results to the same period in 2013. Earlier today, we issued a press release regarding our fourth quarter and full year results. For a detailed review of Altria\u2019s business results, please review the earnings release on our website at altria.com or via Altria investor app.","Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results.

Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in today\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website and via the Altria investor app.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Marty.","Marty Barrington","Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. ","Altria had another terrific year in 2014. For the full year, we again delivered against our two long term financial goals. We grew adjusted diluted EPS by 8% and we paid out approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in dividends which totaled $3.9 billion. ","We also raised our dividend by 8.3%, marking the 48th increase in the last 45 years. We further rewarded shareholders by repurchasing nearly $1 billion in shares between the program we completed in 2014 and the new $1 billion program we announced in July. ","And in 2014, Altria delivered total shareholder return of 34.5%, far outpacing both the S&P 500 and the Food, Beverage and Tobacco Index. We achieved these results by the clarity of our core strategies and our talented employees\u2019 strong execution against them. ","Here are some important segment highlights from the quarter and the full year. The smokable products segment produced outstanding results by consistently executing its strategy of maximizing income while maintaining modest share growth on Marlboro and Black & Mild over time. The segment grew adjusted operating company\u2019s income by almost 8% in the quarter and by nearly 7% for the full year, primarily through higher pricing. The end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments also contributed in the quarter. ","The segment also expanded adjusted operating company\u2019s income margins in both periods. Marlboro was the primary driver of these strong financial results. ","PM USA's long-term investments in the Marlboro architecture have strengthened the brand\u2019s equity and expanded its ability to engage both loyal and competitive adult smokers. In 2014, the brand posted its third consecutive year of retail share growth. ","And Marlboro continues to innovate. In November, PM USA expanded distribution of Marlboro Menthol Rich Blue to 28 states, primarily in the eastern US to enhance Marlboro\u2019s position in the menthol segment. It\u2019s early but Rich Blue is off to a good start. ","In the machine made large cigar category, John Middleton strengthened its leadership position in the tipped segment. The company posted solid volume growth in the quarter and the full year, driven primarily by Black & Mild. Over time Middleton has enhanced the brand with innovative introductions like Black & Mild Jazz and in December, Middleton announced the national expansion of Black & Mild Casino, a dark tobacco blend in the tipped segment. ","In the smokeless products segment, USSTC continued to execute its strategy in 2014. USSTC grew full-year adjusted operating company\u2019s income by more than 3% and expanded its already strong adjusted operating company\u2019s income margin by more than 1% despite a slowdown in the industry volume growth rate. We estimate that growth rate to be about 2% for the last 12 months. ","USSTC maintained retail share leadership in the smokeless category in 2014 with its premium brands as Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined share in the quarter and for the full year. Copenhagen posted strong share gains in both periods, behind the strength of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen. ","In 2014, USSTC began enhancing Skoal\u2019s value equation with a new equity campaign and targeted investments to narrow price gaps on Skoal Classic. We\u2019re pleased with the results we\u2019ve seen so far. ","Turning to innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark made steady progress as it builds e-vapor category leadership. The company is taking a disciplined approach and remains focused on building a robust portfolio of superior innovative products for adult smokers vapor. ","In the fourth quarter, Nu Mark evolved MarkTen by adding a new offering with 2.5% nicotine concentration by weight in classic and menthol varieties. In December, Nu Mark completed its national launch of MarkTen e-vapor products achieving distribution in over 130,000 stores and at year-end MarkTen was ranked among the top e-vapor brands nationally based on retail market share.","Nu Mark also acquired and integrated Green Smoke in 2014. This acquisition added great people, deep supply chain expertise and technology and we\u2019re excited about the brand\u2019s potential. It\u2019s still early days in this dynamic and evolving category but we believe Nu Mark is increasingly well-positioned for the future. ","In 2014, our alcohol assets continued to diversify our income and contribute to income growth. In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle posted another year of double-digit operating company\u2019s income growth, primarily through higher volume. Critics awarded Ste. Michelle\u2019s premium wines more than 180 ratings of 90 or better in 2014. Our earnings also benefited from our SAB Miller investment which continues to support our strong balance sheet. ","So to sum up, 2014 was another excellent year for our strong premium brands, for our company and for our shareholders. We\u2019re maximizing income in our core premium tobacco businesses and innovating for the future. We\u2019re extremely proud of the results produced by our very talented employees and of our track record for creating value for shareholders. ","Looking ahead to 2015, Altria forecast its 2015 adjusted diluted EPS will increase by 7% to 9% to a range of $2.75 to $2.80 from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57 in 2014. ","Finally today we are announcing some executive leadership changes all to be effective March 1 this year. First, Dave Beran, our President and Chief Operating Officer has decided to retire after 38 years of distinguished service to the company. Dave\u2019s strong expertise, knowledge, financial acumen and leadership have contributed immeasurably to Altria success and he will be missed. ","When Dave retires, Howard Willard will become Altria\u2019s Chief Operating Officer. He has significant experience having been with the company since 1992. In addition to his current role of CFO, Howard has held leadership positions in numerous business functions of the Altria companies. ","Bill Gifford will succeed Howard as Altria\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Billy has been with Altria since 1994 and also has held numerous roles including President and CEO of PM USA and his current role as Altria\u2019s Senior Vice President, Strategy and Business Development. ","These moves are consistent with our long-term succession planning and these talented experienced leaders will serve us well for the future. ","I\u2019ll now turn things over to Howard who will discuss Altria\u2019s business results in more detail.","Howard Willard","Thank you, Marty. Good morning everyone. In 2014 strong performance in our smokable products segment helped drive adjusted diluted EPS growth of almost 16% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. A lower effective tax rate on operations and lower interest expense were also contributors to adjusted diluted EPS growth in both periods. ","The smokable products segment delivered strong adjusted operating company\u2019s income growth in the quarter and for the full year. The segment also expanded adjusted operating company\u2019s income margins 1.8 percentage points in the fourth quarter and 1.9 percentage points in the full year. ","For the full year PM USA grew Marlboro\u2019s retail share by one-tenth of a share point and grew its total cigarette category retail share by two-tenths of a share point. L&M share gains also contributed to PM USA's full-year retail share performance while the cigarette discount segment declined slightly. ","The smokable products segment\u2019s fourth quarter reported operating company\u2019s income grew 7.6% primarily driven by higher pricing. For the full year, the segment\u2019s reported operating company\u2019s income declined 2.7% primarily due to higher gains on NPM adjustment items in 2013. ","After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its fourth-quarter and full-year cigarette shipment volume decline approximately 2% and 3% respectively and the total industry volumes declined approximately 2.5% and 3.5% respectively. The 2014 full-year industry cigarette decline of 3.5% continues to be in the range of the decline rate we\u2019ve seen in the last few years. ","In cigars, Middleton's reported cigar shipment volume increased by almost 4% for the fourth quarter and over 6% for the full-year driven primarily by Black & Mild strong performance in the tipped cigars segment. Black & Mild\u2019s retail share decline four-tenths for the quarter and three-tenths for the full-year.","In the smokeless products segment, adjusted operating company\u2019s income was unchanged in the fourth quarter as higher pricing and higher volume were offset by higher promotional investments and the timing of selling general and administrative expenses. ","For the full year, the segment grew adjusted operating company\u2019s income 3.3%, primarily due to higher pricing and higher volume, partially offset by higher promotional investments and product mix. Adjusted operating margins declined 2.5 percentage points in the fourth quarter, to 60%, and grew 1.1 percentage points to 63.4% in the full year.","After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates that its domestic smokeless product shipment volume grew approximately 2.5% in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2014. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share grew four-tenths of a share point in the quarter to 51.3% and grew 5-tenths to 51.2% for the full year. The wine segment delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and the full year.","Ste. Michelle grew operating companies' income by 17.8% in the fourth quarter and 13.6% in the full year, primarily driven by higher volume. Shipments increased 9.6% in the quarter and 4.8% for the full year.","That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, let's cover a few housekeeping items.","As a reminder, comparisons when made are against the fourth quarter and full year of 2013 unless we note otherwise. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 32% in the fourth quarter, down 2 percentage points, and 33% for the full year, down 1 percentage point.","For the fourth quarter, Marlboro's net pack price was $6.02, up $0.16, and the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.55, up $0.17. For the full year, Marlboro's net pack price was $5.96, up $0.13, while the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.49, up $0.15.","The cigarette discount segment's retail share was 24.9% for the fourth quarter and full year, down 3-tenths in each period. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax was $1.49 per pack for the fourth quarter, up $0.02, and $1.48 per pack for the full year, up $0.04.","Wholesale inventory changes are one factor PM USA uses to estimate adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM USA estimates that its 2014 wholesale inventories were approximately 2.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and 2.3 billion units at the end of the third quarter. In 2013, PM USA's wholesale inventories were estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion units at the end of both the fourth and third quarter.","PM USA estimates that the 2014 cigarette industry wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and 5.7 billion units at the end of the third quarter. PM USA estimates that 2013 wholesale inventory levels were 5.9 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and 6.3 billion units at the end of the third quarter.","Copenhagen's price gap versus the leading discount brand was 32% in the fourth quarter and full year, down 3 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 4 percentage points for the full year. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.19 in the fourth quarter, up $0.12, and $4.13 for the full year, up $0.07. The price of the leading discount brand was $3.17 in the fourth quarter and $3.14 for the full year, up $0.15 in each period.","CapEx was $47 million for the fourth quarter and $163 million for the full year. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $59 million for the quarter and $208 million for the full year. Looking ahead to 2015, we expect capital expenditures will be in the range of $200 million to $250 million and the depreciation and amortization will be approximately $200 million.","Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger ","Congratulations to everybody. There's a couple people, so I'll just say everyone. But -- so Marty, I guess first, I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on the current economic outlook and how that is impacting cigarette consumption, because we've seen now two consecutive quarters of improving volume trends, which I know, generally, you would attribute just to quarterly volatility and the full year was in line with the long-term average. But at this point, can we say that we are seeing some evidence of stronger consumption or as you look across the industry, better product -- better portfolio mix?","Marty Barrington ","Yes, that's great question. Let me give you are view of the adult tobacco consumer for 2015, which I really think goes to the heart of what you're asking about. We've been cautious for the last several years, as you know, as we went through this difficult recession. We are actually seeing a modest improvement, I think, in the economic situation for the adult tobacco consumer, although it remains a bit of a mixed bag. The US economy is clearly improving, as everyone knows, and particularly in relation to the rest of the world economies, we see unemployment and underemployment have come down, we see housing starts are coming back, we see very good consumer confidence numbers. So I think all of that is a positive -- those are positive factors.","On the other side of the ledger, you have labor participation rates maybe not where they should be. And then year-over-year wage gains are still modest. But I think on balance, our view is that the adult tobacco consumer is feeling better about their economic situation and their economic future and we expect some modest improvement in that over 2015.","Matthew Grainger ","Do you have any industry volume outlook that you're willing to share at this point?","Marty Barrington ","No, we don't do that, as you know. But I think especially if you look out over the last three to four years, which includes, of course, this very difficult recessionary period, you see it, Matt, really 3% to 4% and you call it maybe 3.5% on average over the last four years. PM USA has done better than that at about 3%, because of its strong portfolio and its share gains. So we don't see any big disruptors in that, but we don't forecast volume going forward.","Matthew Grainger ","And Howard, if I could just follow up on smokable products. The 8% adjusted OCI growth in the quarter, obviously it's a very strong number, but I guess I'm almost surprised that it wasn't even stronger, given the absence of quota buyout costs during the quarter. Can you just talk about the increase that we saw in per-pack costs year on year, excluding the quota buyout and where within the cost architecture of smokeable products you are seeing places to reinvest back in the business?","Howard Willard ","Sure. Yes, I would tell you that, as you note, the cost per pack in the smokable segment was up quite a bit in the fourth quarter. I have to tell you I think that is primarily driven by timing. If you looked, we had less expense in the third quarter and we don't tend to manage our expenses and our project execution quarter to quarter. We are really managing to a full year. And I think if you look at the trend of expenses in the full year, it was at a much more normal level. But certainly, we felt good about the fourth quarter performance. We had strong increases in net revenue per pack, up around 5%. And of course, we did receive the savings in the FETRA payments in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer ","So to follow up on Matt's question, clearly, the cigarette industry volume dynamics are easing, but we've got a deceleration in MST. So can you talk about the interplay? I know we talked about this a little bit last quarter and it's something that you will watch over time, but with another quarter of deceleration, I was hoping you could opine on what is causing that deceleration and whether there's a dynamic that involve cigarettes as well?","Marty Barrington ","I think we will have to see. Obviously let's will start with smokable. It really had a strong -- Howard has already described the strong quarter and the strong year and we are very happy with the smokable performance. And actually, you see USSTC had a very good year; it grew its income at about 3%. But we've observed this volume deceleration now over the last three quarters and that's at odds with what we've seen for the prior several years.","So Vivien, they have more choices today and so there's some movement there, but these things best are evaluated over time. So I'm not sure I have any big insights to share with you this morning on that, except to say that it speaks first to the wisdom of having a total tobacco platform. So as adult tobacco consumers move within these categories, that Altria is well positioned to offer them premium brands with great margin structures. So that's how we think about the business. And we will have to study the volume, I think, for some time yet to know the answer to the question you're proposing.","Vivien Azer ","Fair enough. For our modeling purposes, if you will, is this a deceleration that you guys are planning for to continue internally as you think about 2015?","Marty Barrington ","Well, I'd like to say we try to help you guys as much as we can with your modeling, but I can't -- and I applaud your courage for trying to get me to tell you -- but I really, honestly -- the answer I gave you was the honest answer, which is we're going to have to see. And we've set up our year with our operating plans, I think, which is all embedded in our full-year guidance, which is quite strong at 7% to 9%.","Vivien Azer ","On the cigarette side, as we look across to 2015, can you provide an update on the outlook for the state excise tax environment, given how the NYMEX has been over the last few years please?","Marty Barrington ","I missed what you said, Vivien. You faded out right at the end, I'm sorry.","Vivien Azer ","Oh, I apologize. Can you provide an outlook for the 2015 state excise tax environment?","Marty Barrington ","Yes. Well, we're always cautious at the beginning of the year, aren't we? And we\u2019ve all seen that the state excise tax environment has been more moderate in the last several years than it has been previous. But we go into each year prepared to answer the call, because as you've observed and others have observed, as soon as the legislatures come back in January, we see the proposals start to roll in and there are a number of them that are out there. We have very good government affairs people that point out that this is unfair to tobacco consumers and these products already highly taxed, but we will have to see how the year plays out. It's been a fairly moderate environment over the last several years and we hope that plays out in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog ","So in terms of your EPS growth guidance of 7% to 9% for this year, it is in line with your historical trends and seems very conservative given the strong pricing and tremendous cost savings you have this year. So I assume you will be fully reinvesting these savings into your different businesses. So my first question is why not let some of the strength flow to the bottom line? And then second, could you give us a sense of what the different investment buckets are, for instance, 70% of the savings will be invested in e-cig's vapor, 30% in combustible? Just again, trying to get a sense of your priorities.","Marty Barrington ","Sure. Let me offer you a slightly different perspective. In previous years, we've come out, I think, for the last several years at 6% to 9%, not at 7% to 9%. And the factors that went into our judgment this year about how the guide includes some of the things we've already spoken about on the call, which is a modestly improving situation for our adult tobacco consumer. Obviously, we have the benefit of some FETRA payments, but we I think pointed out in our release we have some pension and healthcare cost changes due to long-term assumptions.","And so every year, you put your guidance together and you have puts and takes about what you're going to do. Some years, we invest, some years, we have factors which are flowing in the other direction. I think 7% to 9% in the current environment is a strong signal about the confidence we have in our business and our operating Company plans. Howard, you might want to supplement that answer.","Howard Willard ","Yes, no, I think you covered it, Marty. The only other thing I would point out -- and this has been with us for some time and I think has been quite orderly -- but we are continuing to unwind the PMCC business and as that progresses, there are fewer and fewer asset sales that are available. So that's another element that plays into the overall company performance.","Bonnie Herzog ","And then I do have a broad question on the consumer and uptrading. So I'm certainly hearing from a lot of the retailers that consumers' greater disposable income is leading to up trading. So is this, too, what you've seen in your Marlboro franchise and has there been a mix shift to premium Marlboro, if I could call it that? And also you generated the strong net price realization in cigs, but I'd be curious to hear from you what happens when gas prices go back up? In other words, how sustainable do you think the strong pricing in cigs will be, especially if and when gas prices rise?","Marty Barrington ","Okay, let me try to comment on a couple of those to try to help you. I think gas prices for us -- historically, we have not called out gas prices as one of the principal drivers of consumer behavior, although we acknowledge that it had some effect. To us, it was really more about the unemployment rate, consumer confidence, and housing starts. Now the way that gasoline prices have gone down so precipitously has obviously had a bigger effect on the consumer, right? The C stores, as you and others have pointed out, are seeing better traffic. And I don't think there's any question that it is contributing to consumers feeling better about their economic situation. But historically, Bonnie, we have not called that out as one of the big three drivers. So I don't know what people here are expecting for gasoline prices, but it probably will not have that much more of an effect.","We did have very good pricing. And the way that we achieve pricing, as you know, is we took list pricing in 2014, combined $0.13 a pack. And then as always, we can moderate our promotional allowances and we did so last year. We moderated our allowances on Special Blend -- Marlboro's Special Blend and on Black. And as you know, we are able to do that quite tactically by state by using our SVP tools. So we did see a year in which we think we could take some pricing and I think you see that in the numbers for 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong ","So one follow-up and another question. So on a follow-up perspective, Howard, you have talked about the fourth quarter being impacted by some timing of expense items. Just on a full-year basis though your marketing and R&D expenses were up over $200 million. So I just wanted to get a bit better sense of where that spending was allocated in 2014, how much is that sustainable into 2015 and thinking about the guidance for 2015?","Howard Willard ","Yes, I think with regard to marketing and R&D, I really don't feel that there's been any dramatic departure this year versus prior years that I would call out, with probably the one exception being that this was the year that we made some significant investments through Nu Mark in the e-vapor category. And obviously, that's had an impact on our R&D investments as we built that product pipeline and certainly, there's some marketing that supports that as well. But that's really the primary impact there.","Judy Hong ","And then maybe on the e-vapor category itself, if you look at some of the measure channel data, the category has slowed. You've obviously expanded the MarkTen distribution. I'm just wondering if you could talk about your assessment about the category generally at this point? And then you also talked about more of a disciplined approach to building MarkTen. So can you just elaborate on that and in light of the dynamics, how you're thinking about the performance that you are seeing from MarkTen?","Marty Barrington ","Sure. Well, let's start with the category. Our estimate is that the consumer spending in 2014 increased by about 50% to about $2 billion. And that\u2019s compared to a year before, which I think you've seen in the numbers are roughly of a 160% increase. So you can see that it has slowed, although 50% increase is still fairly large. It's growing in both traditional trade channels and it's also growing in vape shops, which are harder to get a line of sight into. To dimensionalize that spend, though, $80 billion is spent on conventional tobacco products versus the $2 billion that we estimate. So just to put it in its proper context. ","With respect to Nu Mark, our belief is that that is an interesting enough category for us to participate in and to aspire to have leadership in. That is a leadership that will be achieved over the long term and for the long term, which is why we use these words about financially disciplined and over time. We want to participate there. We believe Nu Mark had a very good year. Gosh, we got the MarkTen product in 130,000 retail stores and that's easy to say and that's hard to do. And so our sales force at Nu Mark did a great job there. They rolled out, as we mentioned in our remarks, the 2.5% product.","Consumers continue to look for their product and so I think a lot of what's going to happen with vapor is about manufacturers trying to bring out products that better satisfy their consumers. And that's what Nu Mark is doing. It's for the long term. It will be for the long term. And we are learning our way in with our consumer and using a disciplined approach, but with the acquisition of Green Smoke and their people and their technology in addition to Nu Mark, I am very encouraged about what we have in the pipeline for MarkTen.","Judy Hong ","And then lastly, Howard, just in terms of 2015 guidance, can you tell us how much share buyback is incorporated?","Howard Willard ","I'm not going to guide at that level. I think we previously talked about the fact that we have an existing share repurchase program in place. It's got a little over $500 million left. And we had communicated we expected to finish that by the end of the year, so that hasn't changed. And certainly any share repurchase plans we have are incorporated into the 7% to 9% guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.","Owen Bennett ","Just following on the e-vapor question then I guess, have you got any update on potential timescale and for commercialization of PMI's heat-not-burn?","Marty Barrington ","No, we are working on it. That has to go through the FDA process, as you know, and we are working closely with them on it. And I think we feel like we're making good progress and I think PMI would tell you the same thing, but I can't give you a date, because it's subject to the FDA's processes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe ","Just I have two questions. I think a bit of a follow-up from earlier questions. The first one would be, Marty, in relation to Marlboro and the discount products on the market today, that price gap is quite narrow at 32%. It's been there for several years. You talked about I think to an earlier question, the improving consumer environment. Could we see that price gap expand? So therefore, are economic conditions in such a place that it would allow for premium products to take a little bit more pricing than discount products?","Marty Barrington ","And that would be our hope, of course, as we try to maximize income in the smokable segment, which is the price gaps have been higher at times in its history and -- but you have to be thoughtful about how you do that and when. But certainly, that would be in our interest of maximizing income.","Chris Growe ","And then another question on the, call it, the other division, where you have PMCC and Nu Mark. And I know it's hard -- if you can characterize each of those businesses and how they perform. But you had a large investment and a huge national launch in MarkTen in 2014 and the investments, so that operating loss in that division obviously expanded. I'm just curious, is it such that you've got a full pipeline that that operating loss couldn't come down or has the Nu Mark business, which has obviously generated some decent sales now, gotten to a point to where we should see less operating loss in the coming year?","Marty Barrington ","Yes, I know that everybody is trying to get under the all other, but we've really got two things operating there. We are investing in Nu Mark, which makes sense for the long term. And then Howard has pointed out that as we wind down PMCC, we have fewer asset sales and they tend to be lumpy from time to time. So that's what's going on over there. And we're just not going to guide down too much deeper than that, Chris, if you'll allow me.","Chris Growe ","I understand. And maybe I think you made a mention earlier, just to follow on, about a strong pipeline of products at Nu Mark. Should we expect some more activity behind product launches this year in \u201815? Is that a fair question?","Marty Barrington ","Well, it's a fair question. And I am going to reserve my answer so that I don't hand out my competitive plans on the phone. But yes, you should be thinking about this, I think, in terms of the category. We expect to have products that will be launched that will be better and better, as I expect that other people are planning similarly. I think that's exactly the nature of the category right now. We've got good plans for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Avery of CLSA.","Michael Avery ","Can you just give a sense of what some of the investments -- what type of investments would be ideal for the savings that you've got coming from the buyout just in terms of equity building. Obviously, you have some relatively limited options in some of your marketing capabilities. Can you just give a sense of what the tools are that would be highest priority for how you would think about applying some of those extra funds?","Marty Barrington ","Well, again, I'm not going to lay that out to tell everybody exactly how we're going to spend our assets to improve our business. But you've seen us over time do such things as develop the Marlboro architecture, to improve our Marlboro digital site, to roll out new products, like Rich Blue and Black, and so forth. So there's lots of places for us to invest in our businesses. Our goal is to keep our brand franchises strong and relevant and there's lots of tools to do that, even, as you point out in a category which has higher regulation. And then we have obviously, as has previously been described, some investments to make in our innovative products. So that's how I would think about it, Michael, at a high level. I'm just not going to lay it out in detail, as I'm sure you can understand.","Michael Avery ","And just looking at the 4Q market share numbers, even with the improving consumer health, you had the discount segment really driving the share gains, with Marlboro flat. Is that a focus for 2015 to try do -- obviously, I'm sure you enjoyed getting the lift in the discount share. But is there a way you want to try to manage that to bring Marlboro further ahead or is a sort of steady state also -- how do you think about Marlboro versus the total portfolio and what the priorities are in terms of just how you approach that?","Marty Barrington ","Yes, it's a good question. Our aim is modest share momentum on Marlboro. And we previously characterized, I think, that as if we get a tenth or 2-tenths a year, that's great for Marlboro. Listen, our focus is on premium. Over 90% of our shipments are premium, but there is a discount segment and so we try to participate there. And L&M is a great offering at that price point.","Michael Avery ","And then just lastly on Green Smoke, it's been the MarkTen rollout you've taken nationally. What's the next step for Green Smoke? Would that follow it?","Marty Barrington ","Well, we're working on that. I mentioned, I think, to someone else that we've been integrating Green Smoke. They've really helped us quite a lot on the front end with supply chain. They had a well-established supply chain and we've been relying on them quite heavily to help us in that regard. They have very good people and they do have a good technology pipeline. We've been integrating all that in 2014. Remember, we closed on this, I think, in April, if memory serves.","And so we've now been integrating that and we have an integrated pipeline of products as well, as we become more efficient with those two organizations. So yes, I would expect to see more from the combined Nu Mark\/Green Smoke assets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi ","Two questions from my end. The first one is on the Marlboro architecture. It's been a couple years now since it's been implemented. And I was wondering if maybe you had some context perspective you can share in terms of brand equity scores or any kind of indicator -- quantitative indicator on kind of what the effect has been? Clearly, we've seen the Marlboro franchise do well over this timeframe, so I just wondered if you had some more granularity on some of the quantification behind Marlboro.","And the second question is -- and this is I guess more strategic. It seems like the superpremium cigarettes segment is doing fairly well and has been doing fairly well and there is really not that many players in that market. I just wondered from a strategic standpoint how PM USA really thinks about that.","Marty Barrington ","Yes, let me tackle those in turn. Good questions, both. You're right; Marlboro architecture has been a terrific boost for our business. We've talked previously about having the flavor families and allowing different marketing approaches in the families and what it's done for marlboro.com has been great. I think that's shown up in the performance of Marlboro.","With respect to any quantitative brand equity data, we may talk about that some in CAGNY. So if I could just ask you to hold tight on that, I think we'll have some further information for you in that regard. With respect to superpremium, the way -- let me just mention a strategic approach to this, which is we are always looking for places in the market where there is business, where we either are under-indexed but we don't have an offering. And so we look at things all the time. And while I don't have anything to announce about that, I can assure you we look at places to build our business, both there and elsewhere.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Felberbaum of The Associated Press.","Michael Felberbaum ","I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color more broadly on the strength of the Marlboro brands and how it's been able to sort of stave off some increased competition as well as whether that the economic -- the recovering economic situation?","Marty Barrington ","Well, Marlboro is a fantastic product for adult smokers that comes with decades of leadership, with lots of innovation and with lots of offerings for people who are in the category and it has consistently grown its share over decades. We are the stewards of this brand and we pay a good deal of attention to Marlboro. It speaks both to the product's function and to its equity and that's been Marlboro's story.","I\u2019ve commented earlier on the call about -- we see that the economy is strengthening a bit, hopefully for our adult tobacco consumers. We certainly hope that's going to be the case in 2015.","End of Q&A","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Sarah Knakmuhs for closing comments.","Sarah Knakmuhs ","Thank you everyone, for joining our call this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact us at investor relations. We look forward to seeing many of you at our CAGNY presentation on February 18.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's Management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Paige Magness, Vice President of Communications for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Paige Magness","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. We're here this morning with Howard Willard, Altria's CEO; and Billy Gifford, our CFO; to discuss the Altria's 2018 business results and provide a deeper dive on the Juul opportunity and Cronos.","Earlier today, we issued a press release providing these results which is available on our website at altria.com and through the Altria Investor app. During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2017. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors.","Altria reports it's financial results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both, the reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release.","With that, I'll turn the call to Howard.","Howard Willard","Thanks, Paige, and good morning everyone. This morning I'll focus on addressing key questions we've been getting, including our outlook for cigarette volumes, our strategic investments in Juul and Cronos, and the current regulatory environment. I'll also review our guidance for 2019. Billy will then briefly highlight our 2018 performance. We've included some slides to accompany some of my remarks.","Altria closed out 2018 with excellent full year adjusted diluted EPS growth of 17.7%, and we continued to reward shareholders by returning $5.4 billion in cash through dividends. PM USA stabilized Marlboro and strengthened our combustible business. We also took proactive steps that we believe uniquely position us for long-term success. Altria enters 2019 with an evolved business platform that includes our strong core tobacco businesses and new strategic investments with tremendous potential for growth.","First, our operating companies continue to give us the industry leading portfolio in the U.S. through Marlboro, Black & Mild, Copenhagen, and hopefully soon IQOS. But now beyond these brands our investments in Juul, as well as Cronos, once closed, giving us exposure to new growth opportunities while also further diversifying our future income streams. The decision to pursue these investments stems from a desire to enhance Altria's long-term earnings and dividend growth, while also making progress on our harm reduction aspiration to help adult consumers switch from combustible cigarettes to non-combustible alternatives. We believe that Juul and Cronos present unique opportunities to meaningfully participate in fast-growing adjacent categories.","Before offering additional detail on the investments themselves, let's discuss the dynamics affecting U.S. cigarette category volumes and our outlook. The U.S. cigarette category is large and resilient, and has absorbed many shocks overtime. And despite significant e-vapor acceleration in 2018, the U.S. cigarette category volume decline rate accelerated only modestly from the recent long-term decline rate of 3% to 4%.","Let's look at the last two years for some context. In 2017, we estimated that U.S. cigarette industry volume declined by 4% which reflects the impact of a disruptive $2 per pack California state excise tax increase in the second quarter, and initial signs of the e-vapor category returning to growth during the second half of the year. In 2018 record growth in record growth in e-vapor of approximately 35% and higher gas prices accelerated U.S. cigarette industry volume declines outside the 3% to 4% range to a decline of 4.5%. Given the significant interest in cigarette category fundamentals, let me provide perspective on the specific drivers of the decline rate and our outlook for 2019.","We previously cited a secular decline rate within a 2% to 3% range. This rate includes smokers who reduced their consumption, those who stopped using tobacco products, and smokers moving to other tobacco categories. In 2018 we estimate that the secular decline rate was elevated due to increased movement by adult smokers across categories which historically accounted for about one percentage point of the 2% to 3% secular rate. This acceleration is largely attributable to e-vapor category growth, especially in light of the decline in the smokeless category in 2018. In total, in 2018, we believe e-vapor represented the vast majority of the one percentage point component plus an additional three tens. Of course, other factors also affect the decline rate. In 2018 we believe macroeconomic factors, specifically gas prices, accounted for about half percentage point additional headwind on cigarette volumes. We believe the price elasticity component of the decline rate remains consistent with our long-term estimate of negative 0.3.","Looking forward, we'll continue to closely monitor the various factors at play. We watch, for example, excise taxes at both, the federal and state level, gas prices, economic conditions affecting the adult tobacco consumer like housing starks [ph], unemployment rates, and consumer confidence in the regulatory environment. We also know that over half of adult smokers are looking for alternatives. With the recent e-vapor growth, almost entirely driven by Juul in 2018, and more alternative tobacco products available in the marketplace, we expect the 2019 U.S. cigarette industry volume decline rate to be in a range of 3.5% to 5%. This range -- this wider range covers a potential for higher levels of adult smoker trial log [ph] in conversion to non-combustible products, similar to 2018. For 2019 through 2023, our estimate for average annual U.S. cigarette industry volume declines is 4% to 5%.","Let's now move to our recently announced strategic investments starting with Juul. Through Juul, we have found a unique opportunity to not only participate meaningfully in the e-vapor category, but to also support and even accelerate transition to non-combustible alternative products by adult smokers. The Juul investment provides Altria with a significant stake in the largest and fastest growing e-vapor company with a highly-talented management team, successful end market products, a strong innovation pipeline, and significant international opportunity. When you add the Juul's already substantial capabilities, our underage tobacco prevention expertise and ability to directly connect with adult smokers, we see a compelling future with long-term benefits for both, adult tobacco consumers and our shareholders.","We are excited about Juul's domestic growth and international prospects and their potential impact on our investment. Juul's 2018 growth was quite remarkable. Juul had net revenues in excess of $1 billion in 2018, up from approximately $200 million in 2017. Juul overwhelmingly reaccelerated the U.S. e-vapor category growth rate growing Juul's volume by nearly 600% to over $450 million, refill kit pods. We estimate Juul represents over 30% of the overall e-vapor category across open and closed systems, and all-trade classes. After e-vapor growth plateaued from 2015 to 2017, rapid growth was reignited in 2018. And we expect U.S. e-vapor volume to grow at a compounded annual rate of 15% to 20% through 2023.","As a reminder, Altria share of Juul's international e-vapor income would be 100% incremental to Altria. We believe the global e-vapor and heat-not-burned segments with estimated sales of roughly $23 billion in 2018 have substantial room to grow. Juul currently operates in eight countries with plans for additional expansion this year. We expect the Juul product features that have driven Juul's success in switching adult smokers in the U.S. to strongly appeal to international adult cigarette smokers. And Juul has designed products [ph] in international markets to meet applicable regulatory requirements and also has significant new innovations in its pipeline.","Though still early days, some information from recent launch markets shows rapid growth and helps affirm our assumptions that Juul's product development and commercialization capabilities can solve for different regulatory restrictions and adult consumer preferences.","Let's look at two examples. First, in Canada, where distribution is limited, Juul reports that retail takeaway grew to more than 60% dollar share in stores selling their products after only three months at retail. Juul is also seeing encouraging performance where they have achieved distribution in Europe. For example, in the Sainsbury Chain in the UK, Juul tells us that it recently became the number one e-vapor brand in the chain with a dollar share in excess of 23% in less than 12 weeks after launch. And just to remind you, the UK operates under the tobacco products directive adopted by many EU countries, which limits the nicotine concentration level. Ultimately, we expect the international revenue and income opportunity to end up being as large as or larger than the U.S. opportunity. Our 35% investment was based on a deep strategic operational and financial analysis of Juul in the marketplace.","Clearly, we look at this opportunity over the long term, but for context, let us provide a view of five years out. Some of our independently developed key assumptions over the next five years that informed that analysis include a U.S. e-vapor category with a gross volume between 15% to 20% annually. Juul continuing to be the primary growth driver for the e-vapor category. Attractive Juul operating margins that achieved current cigarette-like-margins due to the benefits of increasing scale and automation in the supply chain. International revenues that equal domestic revenues by 2023 and international margins that approach current international cigarette margins.","Under our assumptions, our investment in Juul would generate an after-tax return exceeding our weighted average cost of capital in 2023. Additionally, with five year e-vapor category volume growth in the range of 15% to 20% annually, we would expect the U.S. cigarette category volume decline rate to be consistent with the decline rate estimate of 4% to 5%. I'll remind you that in 2018 with e-vapor category volume growth of 35%, the cigarette category decline rate was 4.5%, including a 0.5% headwind from gas prices. Combined with the earnings and cash generation engine of our core tobacco business, we believe this investment in Juul will support consistent returns over the long-term by providing Altria with a significant stake in the fastest growing -- in the fast growing e-vapor category.","Briefly touching on the regulatory environment, the FDA and many others are concerned about an epidemic of UV vapor usage. We share those concerns. This is an issue that we and others in the industry must continue to address aggressively and promptly. We understand that the long-term opportunity of tobacco harm reduction is threatened by continued under-age use. Juul has already taken significant action to address these concerns. Today, it remains the only e-vapor company to have stopped shipping flavored products other than tobacco, menthol and mint [ph] to retail. These shipments stopped on November 13. Juul has taken additional steps to enhance its online age verification processes for sales on its website to adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older as well as developing a restricted distribution system for retailers.","Juul has also halted all promotional use of U.S. social media platforms and will continue to monitor and remove inappropriate material from third-party accounts. And Juul is developing new technologies to further restrict use access. We know more can and must be done. That's why we're engaged in unprecedented efforts at the federal and state level to raise the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21. We believe it is the single most important step we can take today and will be stepping up our efforts in the coming months. Already this year, we are supporting legislation raising the legal age in both Washington State and Virginia, and we continue to engage nationwide in this effort. We recognize that some of these actions may impact the short-term growth of the e-vapor category. We also know that preserving the long-term opportunity of harm reduction for adults is critical. We remain committed to being part of the solution to this issue.","Harm reduction remains central to our view of the future for the tobacco industry. In addition to the significant opportunity presented by e-vapor, we remain very excited about the prospects for heat-not-burned in the U.S. It is now approaching two years since PMI submitted the IQOS PMTA and we are fully prepared to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. We remain fully committed to the success of IQOS in the U.S. and are excited to deploy our robust commercialization plans. PM USA is establishing brick and mortar stores, including locations in multiple cities within the first year of launch. They've already hired personnel to support prelaunch activities and are collaborating with key partners to best position IQOS at retail.","Let's now turn to Cronos. While the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and expected to close in the first half of 2019, Altria's agreement to acquire a 45% stake in Cronos with a warrant to achieve majority ownership will create a new growth opportunity in an adjacent category poised for rapid growth. It complements our strong core tobacco businesses and expands our income opportunity beyond the U.S. After years of evaluating adjacent opportunities the cannabis category is quite attractive and delivers on some key considerations including accretion to our long-term financial performance and synergy without Korea's [ph] capabilities, allowing our combined resources to accelerate Cronos growth. While a range of estimates exist, a recent third-party report projects the 10-year global cannabis revenue opportunity to be in a range of $40 billion under a similar legal landscape to today to more than $250 billion assuming a fully legal market worldwide. ","We believe the growth opportunities are significant and will extend across the globe as cannabis markets open. Selecting the right partner in this category was critical and we've done just that. Cronos strong management team has built unique capabilities to compete globally across the medicinal, recreational and nutraceutical categories. Our investment will allow Cronos to more quickly expand its global footprint and production capacity. We also expect it to accelerate the execution of its strategic initiatives, including investments in cannabinoid innovation and developing differentiated products and brands across medicinal and recreational categories. We look forward to helping Cronos realize it's significant growth potential.","In summary, 2018 was a transformative year for Altria. We are pleased with the performance of our core tobacco businesses as PM USA stabilized Marlboro through its equity investments. We made strategic investments in rapidly growing categories that we believe strengthen our long-term financial profile, enhance our growth prospects and better position the company to deliver long-term value to shareholders through earnings growth and dividends. And of course, we had significant earnings growth and increased our dividend twice. We look forward to sharing more with you at Cagney [ph] in a few weeks. ","Turning to 2019 guidance, we expect to deliver full-year 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.27. This range represents a growth rate of 4% to 7% from 2018 adjusted diluted EPS base of $3.99. Our guidance reflects our expectation for a higher full-year adjusted effective tax rate, primarily resulting from lower dividends from AB InBev. It also includes increased interest expense from the debt incurred related to the Cronos and Juul transactions. Although we expect that expense to be mostly offset by savings from our previously announced cost reduction program. Our plans also take into account increased investments related to PM USA's lead market plans for IQOS once authorized by the FDA. And lastly, our guidance and little to no earnings or cash contributions from the Cronos and Juul investments.","In the first quarter, we'll have the increased interest expense without the full benefits of our cost reduction program and one fewer shipping day in the smokeable segment. Therefore, we expect the growth to come in the last three quarters of the year. We have a proven track record of delivering against our objectives and we maintain our long-term financial goals to grow adjusted diluted EPS at an average annual rate of 7% to 9% and to maintain a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS. I'll now turn it over to Billy to provide more detail on our 2018 results.","William Gifford","Thanks Howard, and good morning everyone. Although we had been busy securing these investments over the past few months, we can continue to compete vigorously in the cigarettes and smokeless tobacco categories which still deliver substantially all of our earnings.","We're quite pleased with the performance of our core tobacco businesses in 2018 and believe the equity investments we made using the benefits of the corporate tax reform set them up to deliver strong income growth in 2019 and beyond. Here are some highlights. In the smokable product segment, our strategy remains unchanged to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro over time. We saw a slight decline in adjusted operating company's income for the segment primarily driven by lower volume and higher cost, including additional investments. Those included brand equity investments behind product expansions, innovative packaging and a digital loyalty program that allow PM USA to successfully stabilize Marlboro. Following soft this in 2017, Marlboro's full-year, 2018 cigarette retail share of 43.1% was unchanged compared to its fourth quarter, 2017 share.","As we discussed in the third quarter, we believe keeping Marlboro strong and relevant is important to the long-term profit maximization in cigarettes. This may mean that Marlboro retail share varies up and down quarter-to-quarter as we continue to balance momentum behind the brand and profitability. ","Building off the success of Points West Marlboro's limited time reward program in Texas PMUSA watch Marlboro rewards nationally this month with the goal of its digital leadership, brand engagement and Marlboro's already strong brand equity and royalty. Within the first 10 days of the program, 700,000 adult smokers, 21 plus, enrolled and entered nearly $1.5 million pack codes. In the super premium tobacco and mortar segment, Nat Sherman continues to deliver against its plan and we're pleased with its performance following the regional expansion of that Nat across the Western U.S. in 2018. In the fourth quarter, Nat had a 0.3 share in the cigarette category in states selling the product. The team continues to evaluate further expansion opportunities, which we will share at the appropriate time.","In non-combustible products our businesses invested in the regulatory science to support the MRTP falling for Copenhagen snuff and in our commercialization plans for the IQOS' lead market. These are important steps on our journey towards tobacco harm reduction. USSTC will present the science supporting its application to the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee next week, and we look forward to engaging with the FDA on this application. In the smokeless product segment, USSTC generated adjusted operating income growth of 7.5% in 2018 despite slowing category volumes.","We continue to believe that Smokeless industry volume is being affected by higher pricing and adult consumer movement among tobacco products, including e-vapor and other innovative products. USSTC has exciting plans for its portfolio in 2019. USSTC announces plans to expand skull long cut, cool experiment nationally. This offering provides adult dippers [ph] a flavor ford experience and furthers USSTC's strong position in the mint and wintergreen segment. In the second quarter, Copenhagen will open its first retail location in Nashville, Tennessee. The store will sell Copenhagen products and provide a unique opportunity to directly engage with adult tobacco consumers, 21 plus. ","Turning to our alcohol assets. Ste. Michelle's adjusted OCI significantly in the fourth quarter, so let me provide some additional information on these results. Results were negatively impacted by higher investments in marketing and sales, lower volume and inventory adjustments. As we discussed previously, the growth rate in the premium wine category has slowed and Ste. Michelle works closely with its major distributors to reduce trade inventories. In beer adjusted earnings from our equity investment in AB InBev were $200 million in the fourth quarter, which reflects Altria share of AB InBev third-quarter results. In the short time we've held an interest in AB InBev, there's been volatility in its earnings resulting from the mark-to-market adjustments for hedging of share-based payment programs. A decrease in AB InBev share price as occurred last year results in losses on these hedges which are reflected in our underlying results. For the full year 2018 Altria share these losses was $128 million.","I'd like to provide some insight on the cost reduction program that we announced last month. To offset most of the interest expense associated with the debt incurred to finance the Juul and Cronos investments, in the fourth quarter, we announced a cost reduction program expected to deliver approximately $575 million an annual cost savings by the end of 2019. The savings from this program will ramp up through the year. This program includes third-party spending reductions across the business such as professional and consulting services, information technology and product research and regulatory investments. The program also includes workforce reductions of approximately 900 people, particularly within our support services.","With that, we'll wrap up and Howard and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available no altria.com. We have also posted today slides and our usual quarterly metrics which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items. On that page, we've added quarterly shipping days. NPM USA's menthol share to provide additional color around that part of our business.","With that, I'll open up the question and answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take questions from the investment community. Our first question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Stephen Powers","So, Howard and Billy, I guess my first question is just how secure you see your fiscal '19 volume outlook in cigarettes to be. And maybe to help with that, I was just wondering if you're able to decomposed some of the volume drivers that you provided as it relates to the fourth quarter, that down 5%. It was worse than the full-year run rate, so I'm just wondering what the contribution from maybe macro-elasticity factors the next -- which I'm assuming that includes excise taxes as well as manufacturer pricing. And the cross category movement would have been in the fourth quarter. And then I guess more importantly, looking at '19, where do you see within the context of those drivers, the potential improvement coming from? ","William Gifford","Steve, I think, if I understand your question correctly, if you look at it as we progressed through the year, we did have to SET increases. One was in Oklahoma and the other was in Kentucky. And so that had an effect because that was represented about 5% of cigarette industry volume. So as you progress through the year, of course, you have the initial drop for the price shock and then it returns to elasticity as you move through time. I would say as we moved to this year right now, gas prices are a tailwind to the overall adult cigarette consumer. As we experienced, gas prices dropped, last year they were up 13% year over year and we've seen them drop as we progress into the first part of this year. So we should see that impact through time. ","Stephen Powers","So the big driver of incremental potential improvement '19 verse '18 is really your gas price outlook?","William Gifford","That and the overall macro-economic tailwinds that the consumer is experiencing. ","Stephen Powers","Okay, great. And I need to run the math, but with 15% to 20% category growth in e-vapor, the negative 4%, negative 5% category declines, you call it in core combustible going forward, I'm assuming some positive contribution from IQOS and heat-not-burn in your outlook. I guess my question is that you look forward five years from now, are you expecting market wide nicotine consumption to be higher or lower in the U.S. versus now and maybe by what magnitude? And I guess within that there's an implied question about what the expected interplay between e-vapor and heat-not-burn may be with Smokeless. ","Howard Willard","I think with regard to your question, our primary focus has been on estimating by individual category and we provided that information to you. I think with regard to heat-not-burn, I think it's clearly going to have an impact going forward on cigarettes and likely e-vapor, but I think that we have not really included that in our calculations and we're really waiting until we get some experience in the marketplace this year and certainly we can make adjustments to any of our estimates. But certainly, we believe that when we do get approval from the FDA to put IQOS in the market, it is an additional driver of growth in the non-combustible tobacco product segment. ","Stephen Powers","And if I could do one more related to Juul and I greatly thank you for the insight you provided in your slides and on the call today with respect to Juul. But I guess it's kind of three-follow on questions now that you've opened up on Juul. I find myself a little bit greedy for more. So just based on your conversations with Juul management, recognizing that they're independent and private, I guess as we go forward, what level of incremental disclosure do you expect you'll be able to share over time, whether in a few weeks at Cagney or just in general? Question number one. And I guess within that, related to that, two follow ons. The first one is your fiscal '19 guidance assumes zero -- effectively zero EPS in cash contribution from Cronos and Juul. And I guess -- is that affirm estimate of break-even or you're simply excluding Juul and Cronos from guidance?","Another way to ask that question is are you able to absorb volatility in Cronos, Juul contributions within the four to seven range or does that create risk of pushing you outside the range? And lastly, sorry, the five year kind of break-even I'm return rate, economic return that you called out on Juul basing on your expectations is that -- what are you seeing in terms of like cash coming back to -- is that a theoretical return or is that actual -- do you expect to receive cash in the form of dividends from Juul? So your cash breakeven over that five-year timeframe. Sorry for all the questions. Thanks. ","Howard Willard","Well, you're going to make us work hard this morning, aren't you? I'll take a crack at them and if I miss something, I'm sure Billy will jump in. So with regard to the disclosure, as you pointed out, given the time since the closing, we put together significantly more information and shared it today. And obviously, as we get further questions, we'll look for opportunities to share more relevant information with investors. And the other thing I would reference is that we expect at some point in the future, probably later this year, we will be accounting for the Juul investment following antitrust approval using the equity income approach. And when we do that, there will be more disclosure in our SCC documents. So that's I think, something to look forward to and we do expect antitrust approval during this year. ","The second thing is with regard to our statement about 2019 income; I think that what that really reflects is that with regard to Juul, we're kind of waiting before it gets reflected in our income based on the equity income method. So we thought on the side of conservatism that it made sense to not guess as to the timing of antitrust approval. And then the second thing I would say is on Cronos, obviously they're a publicly traded company and so you have access to what their current income is. And their income today is modest. The investment is really designed to rapidly accelerate their growth rate. And so we don't expect it to be a material contribution in 2019. With regard to the guidance range of 4% to 7%, that is designed as it's always been in the past, to be a wide enough range to take into account of the variety of changes that could occur, and that could reflect changes in our core business with regard to Juul or with regard to Cronos. So it's designed to reflect our best all in estimate of what could happen during the year.","Then you asked a question about the five-year breakeven, and I think the way we calculated that; it was really taking the equity income we expect in five years tax affecting it and then dividing it by the overall investment in Juul. So it is an equity income return, not a cash return, although obviously by that point, given the significant level of income, we would expect to have some dividends as well.","William Gifford","The only thing I would add Steve, I think it's important to remember under both, Juul or Cronos as a business is growing and faces significant opportunity to expand outside of the U.S. with huge growth potential. That reinvestment in the business for a period of time is appropriate. ","Howard Willard","Yes, that's absolutely right and I think we agree with the other Juul investors that its growth prospects are so strong that now's the time to invest in ultimately driving top line growth. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Pamela Kaufman","I was just hoping to get a sense for how you were thinking about Juul's mid-term growth outlook, just given that the company is removing flavors from retail channels and then what the impact is on the economics of the investment if the category grows faster than 15% to 20%, why is 15% to 20%, I guess the right forecast and what assumptions feed into that? ","Howard Willard","Sure. I think with regard to the mid-term forecast, one of the reasons why we selected a five-year period to estimate the growth rate of the e-vapor category and Juul as a significant driver of that growth is I think there is a bit of uncertainty as to whether or not there'll be a slowdown in growth in the next year or two as the industry works together with the FDA to drive down huge usage. And so I think that is a to be determined, but I think even taking into account the fact that there could be some impact in the short run. I think we're confident in that long-term growth rate that we forecasted. It may just be that they're slower growth early on and more rapid growth later on. I think with regard to the significant action Juul took in removing their flavors from retail, I do expect that that is going to have some impact on their overall growth rate this year. But I think we also believe that adults will continue to buy the other flavored products at mainstream retail stores and, of course, with heightened age verification, those other flavors are available to adults on the Juul website. So we still think they have pretty good growth prospects for this year even with those actions. I think we're pretty comfortable with our forecasts of 15% to 20% compound annual growth rate over five years. And certainly, with that level of growth, we believe the investment in Juul is additive in a significant way to our income growth.","Your question is if it grows faster, is it still additive to our income growth? And I think that it can certainly grow faster than 20% and still be additive based on our estimates. I suppose there is some genetically higher growth rate, but that may not be the case, but we're pretty comfortable that it's under a whole range of scenarios that financially, this is a good thing for our income growth. ","Pamela Kaufman","Okay, thanks. And then just with respect to Juul's international opportunity, how do you think about the impact of some of the differences in the regulatory backdrop just given the nicotine caps and international markets and then just lower barriers to entry for competitors in the category of relative to the U.S.?","Howard Willard","I think that when you look at various international markets, there are different regulatory requirements that have to be navigated and frankly, there are different consumer expectations given differences between the cigarettes in those markets that are purchased by adults backhoe consumers over there compared to the U.S. So both of those things need to be navigated successfully in order to have a similar level of success internationally to what Juul has had in the U.S. We are a highly confident that Juul has the technical capability, the current products and the products in the pipeline to navigate those differences and have strong success overseas.","So I think that frankly, that there certainly is some work to be done there, but I think that they are already well on their way to having done that and I think that we're encouraged by the products they have in their pipeline.","Operator","Our next question from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Vivien Azer","So, my first question is for you, Billy. You called out like the favorable macro backdrop in terms of your comfort around the 3.5% to 5% declined for 2019. I have a hard time reconciling that with the pretty consistent downgrading that we're seeing at the low end of the category, where deep discount is consistently gaining share at the expense of discount. So can you help me reconcile that? That's my first question. Thank you. ","William Gifford","I think if you think about the economic recovery, it's a bit uneven. So it's a bit lumpy. So those consumers that were engaged in the branded discount as we've increased the margins and profitability of our brand specifically you can see some down trading that takes place because you can even think of the adult tobacco consumer with uneven economic recovery. Those at the lower end haven't recovered to the same extent as those at the higher end of the category and so that's where you're seeing that trend within the discount category as the branded discount brands are taking an increased profitability and margin ","Vivien Azer","And you don't think that there's a risk over time that that starts to kind of bleed up into the branded premium segments?","William Gifford","Yeah, based on our consumer research, Vivien, because of that uneven, we keep an eye on that group of consumers at that lower end to make sure that we feel comfortable with where we're at. We feel very strong with the premium segment. I think that's reminiscent. You can see with the flatness of the overall discount category and just churn within. So we don't see any signs at this point that would point to it moving up to the premium segment.","Howard Willard","Vivien, I'd refer you to the last couple of years. You know, what has really happened is you've had particularly over the last year, a pretty nice performance by the premium brands including Marlboro, but you've had -- and you've had a flat overall discount category from a market share perspective. But there's been significant movement from branded discount products to deep discount products. And of course, there's certainly market action that could be taken to try and address that, but given the nice margins that we have on L&M, I think that we're comfortable with the current trends in the marketplace. ","Vivien Azer","My second question is around kind of the longer-term outlook for cigarette industry volume declines of 4% to 5%. It certainly makes sense that if you're expecting a deceleration in e-cig, it shouldn't be like incrementally that much worse for the cigarette category. That being said, I am curious to hear your thoughts around dual use within that e-cigarette revenue pool. Because if you've got dual users today that ultimately migrate to single category use on the e-cigarette side, that would suggest that there would be some incremental degradation on cigarettes if I'm thinking about it right. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Thanks. ","Howard Willard","I think you have to consider, take 2018 as a guide. You had very substantial growth in e-vapor volume and it was both people converting completely from cigarettes to e-vapor as well as a substantial amount of dual use as people tried e-vapor and in many cases, Juul and are deciding whether to continue to dual-use or convert completely. So I think that 2018 was a pretty active year for e-vapor category growth. And, of course, as we know, the decline rate of the cigarette category was only 4.5% and that was elevated 0.5% by increasing gas prices. So, I think it shows you that the cigarette category decline rate is pretty persistent and it can withstand a fair amount of growth from e-vapor. So we continue to be very comfortable with our forecasted decline rate of the cigarette category over the next five years of 4% to 5%.","William Gifford","And I think it's important to remember, Vivien in the base 3% to 4% that was historical. There was always 1% of that that was included in sector decline of consumer doing exactly what you're saying, either replacing certain occasions or converting completely as Howard mentioned, so that if you will already in the 3% to 4% that was in the historical run. ","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Christopher Growe","Just to follow on Vivien's question there, you've mentioned this 1% is point drag on volume for moving across categories. And I think you said it was around a 1.4% drag on the category from e-vapor in 2018. That category was also pulling from smokeless tobacco as an example. I'm just curious how much of overall volume effect it might've had on your business, like how much did it pull from smokeable? Thank you. Define that as well as smokeless. I think we're seeing some effect in that category as well. ","William Gifford","We don't have an exact number for you, but that's something that we're providing the future. But you're right. I think you also had dual usage between smokeless and the e-vapor category and so you're right at that. That is also pulling some of those consumers because the e-vapor experience was closer to what they were transitioning from being an inhalable type product versus a smokeless product.","Howard Willard","Chris, I would also say on smokeless, you've got two things going on, which is I do think you have some consumers that were smokeless users that are moving into e-vapor. Probably the bigger impact on the smokeless growth rate is that in the past a lot of cigarette smokers were using smokeless as an alternative product, and I think a fair number of them have now said, \"Boy, with the presence of Juul in the marketplace, I've got a closer experience to my cigarettes and smokeless that's attractive to me.\" So I think that has also contributed to the decline in the growth rate of smokeless. ","Christopher Growe","And as you think about your outlook for them that through 2023, do you assume like e-cigarette starts to see excise tax is implemented? Is that a factor in that model? And then would you just assume from a high level that Juul grows in line with the category over that time? ","Howard Willard","Yes, I think we're comfortable with that growth rate over a variety of excise tax assumptions. But I would tell you that I believe that it's a reasonable assumption to believe that you'll get some incremental excise taxes on e-vapor, but then it will not be a significant acceleration of what's happened over the last few years. And I think that the argument that's been made at the state level about the fact that given the potential for harm reduction that's offered by e-vapor, that that is not a place where significant excise tax increases should be put in place. I think that's been fairly persuasive and I would expect it to continue to be. I think you had a second question. Remind me of it.","Christopher Growe","And then, just if Juul would grow in line with the category, would that be your operating assumption in that 5-year model?","Howard Willard","Yes, I think our assumption is that the Juul is going to grow faster than the category. I mean, if you look at 2018, Juul growth represented more than the growth in the category, and I think there's probably -- as probably likely, that it may moderate from being the whole growth of the category going forward but we would expect it to be growing at a much more rapid rate than the other brands in the category.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","On you decomposition on Slide 6; you show up modest deceleration in your projected or estimated impact from elasticity but it looks like that -- your pricing has actually accelerated in '18 versus '17; how do you reconcile that?","William Gifford","Yes, I think when you look at that Michael, you got to take in all -- the consideration of all factors. So you got to take in the total change to the consumer. So you have SET differentials that get annualized then across time, so that price elasticity is not just manufacturer list price, it's increase in list price to the consumer.","Michael Lavery","And on IQOS, can you just specify what it is that you are assuming in guidance? And would it be right to think you're not counting on any revenues until you get approval but that there are some costs you are factoring in and then would there be incremental spending if revenues come; how should we think about that?","Howard Willard","We are optimistic and hopeful that IQOS is going to get approved fairly soon and so we've got out a full rollout of IQOS included in our guidance.","Michael Lavery","So you did also mention both, a lead market but also stores in multiple cities which sound a little bit broader and faster, and maybe a bigger launch then you've hinted at in the past. Have you expanded your plans? And you also said when you were reading through that slide related to it, you said that you are establishing stores; are you doing that now ahead of approval? And how should we think about what your -- how your position is relative to that?","Howard Willard","You were listening carefully. Yes, I think -- I don't know that it's a change in our plans but our belief is that IQOS is going to be quite a success and that after the lead market we'll be moving quickly to other markets. And what we have learned as we've been focused on gaining access to and establishing retail locations is that it's not something you can do overnight. And so we've made the decision that it's worth the incremental investment in order to line up those locations in multiple markets in advance. And obviously, as the time for the approval of IQOS drags on, it does cause us to incur a little bit of incremental expense but we think the upside from commercializing IQOS is big enough that we want to be fully ready the minute we get FDA approval.","Michael Lavery","And so you mentioned the Copenhagen store in Nashville, is that one you would be able to quickly repurpose as a dual brand outlet or would you want to separate those for brand identity and marketing purposes?","William Gifford","I think that something we'll consider long-term Michael. I think the opportunity in Nashville, that's the home of the manufacturing base. And so we think it affords our consumer a great opportunity to engage with the brand, and be right there where we're manufacturing the product. So we're really focused currently on the engagement with those adult dippers right there where the product is made.","Michael Lavery","One real quick last one; will you give the share gains in the U.K. and Canada for Juul? Is that also driving category growth or is it primarily market share momentum?","Howard Willard","No, I don't know that I have a good answer to that. I could speculate but I will not.","Operator","Your next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","I wanted just a quick clarification, the category volume for e-vapor; for that you laid out on slide number 8. Is that equalized volume to cigarette packs or what is the --kind of -- how should we think about that relative to the cigarette volume?","William Gifford","I think Judy that short is trying to equalize across open systems in closed. So if you think about it that's the number of pods that are in the marketplace. If you think about the equalization to total cigarettes, you have to think about what's their pod equivalent of a cigarette. And so a pod equivalent to a cigarette we would estimate to be around one pod per pack of cigarettes.","Judy Hong","So basically, if you -- so Juul at 0.5 million pods would be equivalent to roughly like 6% or 7% of the total cigarette volume equivalent?","Howard Willard","Yes, that would be the case.","Judy Hong","Okay. So the total e-vapor category today is about 15% to 20% of the total cigarette equivalent volume in your estimate just based on this math?","Howard Willard","That's correct, Judy.","Judy Hong","So I guess that seems like it's a pretty big number in the context of the cigarette category, and I guess I'm still a little bit confused as to why it's not having a much bigger impact on the total cigarette volume if the size of the e-vapor category is already 15% of the total.","William Gifford ","I think you have to think about it Judy is, a base of that has been in place for quite a while; so if you think about the initial start because we're including open systems in this overall equalization. Open systems have been in place going back a number of years and I think that's the point I was trying to raise is, it's important to remember, within the cigarette category the historical decline rate of 3% to 4% included 1% that was moving to other tobacco categories. And so part of the historical decline already assume that there were going to be consumers progressing from cigarettes to other tobacco categories.","Judy Hong","And then just going back to the international opportunity for Juul, I mean it sounds like based on the assumptions would imply that your revenue for international markets from Juul is going to be a pretty sizeable number at a margin that's also pretty attractive. So given some of the experience that we've seen where -- we've seen some bumps along the way for IQOS and other players that have launched in markets outside the U.S. I guess I'm just wondering what gives you the confidence about sort of the big revenue contribution and margin contribution in five years.","Howard Willard","Yes, I mean -- Judy, I think the way I would frame that is, I acknowledged that there have been a number of products, particularly in the e-vapor category that have had some success, and then that success has fizzled. And so certainly that is something you have to be sensitive to but I have to point out that Juul's growth and success in the U.S market last year was unique, and first of it's kind compared to other tobacco products successes both in the U. S. and overseas. I mean the growth rate was dramatic, it represented the entire growth of e-vapor for the year and it dramatically reaccelerated the growth of e-vapor. So I think the reason that we have confidence that it's going to have more success in overseas markets over the next five years than some of the other products that have been introduced over there is because it had such dramatic success in the U.S last year.","Judy Hong","And then my last question, just -- Billy, when you think about Q1 combustible or smokeable volume, am I right in thinking that if you layer in the one less shipping day and then I think you're lapping a pretty big inventory levels a year ago; so volume sounds like it could be down double-digits in Q1; is that sort of in the ballpark?","William Gifford","Judy, you know we're careful not to guide to the quarter level on volume but I think you're thinking about trade inventories that was a big component in the first quarter of last year so it's important to pick that up; so you're exactly right from that standpoint, it's important to consider how trade inventories were moving last year versus your expectations for this year.","Operator","Our next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I had a question on your EPS growth guidance; you guys now see a wide range in 2019 but you stated back in December that you expected your EPS growth to be slightly below your long-term 7% to 9% growth algorithm. So just wanted to understand what changed or are you guys just being prudent with a wide range? And then I wanted to confirm your guidance assumes no buybacks this year but just kind of wondering if there is a chance that could change or maybe what needs to happen to get you back in the market to buy back your stock?","Howard Willard","I'll answer the first part of your question and then I'll turn it over to Billy. The short answer on December versus today is nothing changed. We viewed 4% to 7% guidance is slightly below the 7% to 9% long-term trend, and you are right that it is a three percentage point wide range but I think that -- we think it's prudent given some of the increased volatility we've seen in our income in large part driven by volatility in [indiscernible] income stream that in order to give the investment community the right confidence in our guidance that a bit of a wider range is prudent and appropriate.","William Gifford","And as far as share buyback Bonnie, remember, we had about $350 million; I think it was $345 million to be exact as we ended last year in the current program. And we expect to complete that by mid-year, that is unchanged; and then we'll assess the situation and come forward if anything is appropriate after that.","Bonnie Herzog","And then I had a question on Marlboro; you guys successfully stabilized Marlboro share in 2018. So as we look forward, do you believe it's realistic that Marlboro could take share in a shrinking volume pool, especially given your new Marlboro Rewards program? And then I also wanted to ask about the coupon inserts for Juul and Marlboro packs? Can you guys help us understand the strategy with those and how we should think about cannibalization of Marlboro versus maybe the opportunity to take share from competitors sick brands?","Howard Willard","Sure. I think with regard to Marlboro, you're right, we did stabilize this year and we think it's got very strong momentum and that will continue into this year. But I also think you have to consider the fact that our objective in the smokeable segment is to maximize income, and so I think you will see us balancing our desire to maximize income against the momentum of Marlboro, and we did that this year and I think we'll continue to do it. I think with regard to your question about putting Juul inserts on our cigarette packs; I would first of all say that I think the vast majority of the support that we will provide to Juul is really going to be brand agnostic or company agnostic with regard to how it helps Juul source volume. So if you think about them putting Juul into a much better display space of retail and having higher visibility or you think about them potentially gaining access to some of our other services. I think most of those services are not going to have a greater impact on our brands than they would on our competitor's brands.","I think you could particularly with the onserts; obviously, we can only put onserts on our packs, they don't go on competitors packs. So, theoretically I guess it could result in a bit more volume coming out of Marlboro but I think that is unlikely to be the case. And I say that for really two reasons; I think there is already very high awareness amongst all cigarette -- adult cigarette smokers and frankly, all Marlboro smokers about the availability of Juul. So I think that a lot of that awareness has already been established, I wouldn't expect a big incremental uptick from those onserts.","And then secondly, I would point out that I think Juul tends to get more of it's growth from the 21-year old to 29-year old cigarette smoker than it does from the 30-plus cigarette smoker. And if you think about it, I think as we've communicated in the past; Marlboro share of those 21-year old to 29-year old smokers is about equal to it's overall share but there are several other cigarette brands that are overdeveloped amongst 21-year to 29-year olds such as Newport, Camel or Natural American Spirit that frankly, might actually give you more volume on a relative basis than Marlboro.","Bonnie Herzog","That's really helpful. My final question for you guys is about the FDA. I was hoping you guys could give us some color from your perspective on the FDA's recent commentary surrounding harsher [ph] e-cig regulation. Was it a surprise to you that they are now putting threats out there, especially after your investment in Juul? And then wondering if you've spoken to them recently and what's your sense of how they're thinking about your ownership stake in Juul as well as some of the initiatives Juul's working on to help reduce youth [ph] use e-cig to use? Thanks. ","Howard Willard","Sure. I don't think we've been surprised at FDA is concerned about youth usage of e-vapor products. I think as you know, both Juul and Alfie, we were in talking to them in November. They had a high level of concern then, we shared that concern and we've been interacting back and forth with the agency on the actions we're taking to try and reduce the levels of youth usage of e-vapor products. And frankly, I think their concern and their focus on the industry taking significant steps to drive down youth usage is appropriate and justified. And I think that we agree with Juul that we need to take significant action. I think Juul has already taken significant action, but we also agree that more must be done. So I think that our view is that it's important to drive down youth usage in order to preserve this opportunity for adult cigarette smokers to be able to switch to a very compelling non-combustible product.","And I think we will ultimately achieve both. I think will drive down youth usage and still make this available to adult cigarette smokers as an alternative. And I just think we have some work to do and we're fully prepared to engage on that. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Spielman with Citi. Please go ahead.","Adam Spielman","Thank you very much. I suppose to kind say thank you for providing so much more data than usual. It really is appreciated. So thank you for that. I have two quick questions. I hope they're quick. So if I take what you've said about the impact of basically the growth of Juul, this is Slide 8, and equate that to cigarettes, it looks like the Juul has grown about 0.4 billion units, which equates essentially to a full percent market share growth. And that's true for the whole e-cigarettes or e-vapor category. And yet you've also said that the impact of the growth of e-vapor on cigarettes is about 1.3%, 1.4%. So this is outright [ph], we are thinking about it, but basically two-thirds of vapor growth is incremental. Is that how we should think about it? And I guess if that is right way of thinking about it, where is that increment coming from? Do you think it's mostly coming from people in their 20s or what? So that's one question.","Howard Willard","I'm not sure I'm tracking exactly with your math, but let me try and answer the question in a more general way, which is, you're right about the impact that we think it's having on the cigarette category. But beyond the impact that it's having on the cigarette category, we think it's also sourcing, as we said earlier, from the smokeless category probably from the cigar category as well. And we also think that with all the trial that's going on, part of their volume is coming from increased usage occasions by a variety of adult tobacco consumers. And that may settle out over time. I think that given the increased availability of the product, I think you have a lot of people that are trying it while still using their existing tobacco product and I think over time they're going to make a decision and they'll either switch completely to Juul but I think you saw that in the 2018 number as well. ","Adam Spielman","Fine. I mean, just to -- I mean, also how relevant it is but my math is basically, there was 400 incremental million pods of Juul sold in 2018 and that equates to roughly 4% of cigarette market if one pod is one pack of cigarettes. So that's how I was thinking about it. But the second question is really coming back to this question about the onsets and the inserts on your packs. I mean, can you confirm that Juul will be able to put or maybe deny, that they'll be able to put coupons. So the might be, I'm making this up here, but let's say $5 off advertising to somebody who buys a pack of Marlboro. So, is that right? That they'll be able to keep on whether it's just market raise awareness?","William Gifford","Yeah. I thinking you're thinking about it right. I think it's important to remember what Howard said, if our Marlboro consumer, so take the one person that receives that in their pack, if they have a decision to switch, they would have switched anyway. And so we would want them to switch to the Juul product, which we have an investment in versus searching for other alternative products out there. So the awareness is already high. If the individual is making the decision to switch, we want them to switch to Juul.","Adam Spielman","Fine. So, I understand that. And is that something you sort of been able to sort of validate with focus groups? Because to me, it's sort of kind of quite a thing that you're potentially offering your smokers let's say $5 off for sure. ","Howard Willard","Yeah, I mean, you are right that essentially we are cross-promoting, which is a fairly common thing and I think you may be thinking about the fact that we have a 35% economic interest in Juul and we have 100% economic interests in our cigarette business. And so that may be what's causing you to be surprised we would be willing to do this. I think I would frame it with a couple of thoughts. First of all, we think that even with the impact that the Juul could have on the overall volume growth and potential profit growth from our cigarette business going forward, even if it does impact it, we think when you take the sum of our of our cigarette profitability growth and you combine it with the economic contribution from Juul over the next five years, we think that's a net positive to us. And it's a net positive even if there's a bit more growth in Juul coming from our brands than from the competitors. So that's the first reason.","The second reason is if you look at it, we four, frankly I've been with the company 26 years, almost my entire career. We have believed that our business would be better in the long-term if we could offer harm-reduced products that would represent attractive alternatives to our adult cigarette smokers to switch. And we've invested billions of dollars in it and lots of effort and ultimately, until December of this year, we really didn't have the product portfolio to fully achieve our harm reduction aspiration. And the opportunity to invest in Juul, I think really makes that harm reduction aspiration a reality. And if you look at it, we've got IQOS and the heat-not-burn category, the number one product and brand in that category. We've got Copenhagen and Skull and the oral tobacco products category and we had a hole in the e-vapor category and we've now filled that with our 35% economic interest in Juul.","So I think that we are finally going to be able to achieve our harm reduction aspiration. And I think we can do that over the next 10 years and still deliver our long-term 7% to 9% EPS growth algorithm and give 80% of that adjusted EPS back to shareholders in the form of dividends. And I think our ability to achieve both harm reduction and secure our long-term financial performance was enhanced by the investment in Juul. ","Adam Spielman","Thank you very much for those answers. Kind of just very quickly ask you. And have you actually done focus groups that are found out what might happen if you put coupons or other material in your cigarettes packets?","Howard Willard","We've done a variety of work to understand the interaction between cigarette smokers and Juul. I don't know that we've done something specifically to what you're referencing, but we think we have a pretty firm understanding of what the interaction between the two categories is. ","Operator","Our next question is from Nick [ph] with RBC Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","I'll try to make this quick because I know we're going a little long here. How would you -- obviously a lot of decisions had been made, a lot of portfolio transformation. I'm just curious where the wine business fits into kind of your vision of the future of Altria. The second question is just on the pricing. I mean, very, very strong, at least relative to what we were looking for. Maybe you can provide some context around that. Was that the loyalty program kind of making you a little bit more efficient in terms of promo spend? And then the third is just on Cronos. Is this a kind of a platform, a strategy, meaning you will look to get into all types of products, or is this going to really be just focused on your existing categories? Thanks. ","Howard Willard","I think with regard to wine, I don't know that there's a real change there. I think that we have long said that we very much like the wine business and we are committed to returning it to strong income growth. But we've also said that it's not core like the rest of our tobacco businesses are. And that's been the case for quite some time and there hasn't been a change there. So we remain committed to running that business well. It's had a bit of a downturn over the last two years, but we're confident that the employees there have strategies in place to turn that around. With regard to Cronos, I think that you shouldn't assume that our existing product portfolio at Cronos is where we're going to stop. I think that both we and Cronos think there are opportunities really across the world in a variety of product categories, both recreational and medicinal that would involve them entering new product forms and developing new products and new product brands. I think it's early days there and we have really not restricted our thinking with regard to that. I think I'll hand over to Billy the question on cigarette pricing. ","William Gifford","Nick, I would point you to, on pricing, it's the process of data analytics that we've enhanced here that allows us to be more efficient and effective. The way we think about the total value equation is specifically the promotional piece that we run at retail, so that drives the overall price realization up through time.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning and thank you for joining us. We\u2019re here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria\u2019s CEO; and Billy Gifford, Altria\u2019s CFO to discuss Altria\u2019s 2017 fourth quarter and full year business results.

Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today\u2019s earnings release.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Marty.","Martin Barrington","Thanks Bill. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining the call. Altria had another strong year in 2017. We delivered outstanding financial performance and continued to focus on rewarding our shareholders. In 2017, we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share 11.9%, built on the success of our core tobacco businesses and complemented by the effects of federal income tax reform. We paid out more than $4.8 billion in dividends and repurchased more than $2.9 billion in Altria shares. ","We are extremely proud of our company\u2019s long-term track record of creating value for our shareholders. From the end of 2012 through 2017, we paid shareholders $21 billion in dividends and repurchased more than $6 billion in shares. Altria\u2019s total shareholder return of 9.4% in 2017 follows four consecutive years of 20%-plus returns. Over this five-year period, our total shareholder return of 181% outperformed both the S&P 500 and the S&P Food, Beverage, and Tobacco Index by more than 70%.","Let\u2019s look first at our full year results and then we\u2019ll say a word about the recently enacted tax reform legislation before turning to 2018 guidance. ","In 2017, we continued to maximize the core while innovating for the future. Our core tobacco businesses delivered strong income growth and expanded their already high margins despite a year that presented some unique challenges in each business. We also in 2017 accomplished several important strategic initiatives for future success, including making significant progress toward our goal of becoming the U.S. leader in authorized non-combustible reduced risk products. We advanced our lead market commercialization plans for iQOS, prepared a modified risk tobacco product application for Copenhagen Snuff, and invested in new innovative products at Nu Mark. ","Our smokable segment strategy continues to be to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro and Black & Mild over the long term. In 2017, the smokable product segment delivered strong adjusted operating company income growth of 7% and expanded adjusted OCI margins by 3 percentage points to 51.2%. ","Across our brand metrics, Marlboro continue to have category leading equity, strong demographics, and of course is highly profitable. As for retail share, it remains the leading brand by far, but Marlboro declined by four-tenths of a share point to 43.3% for the year. The decline is explained by the challenging dynamics we\u2019ve been describing, specifically the effects of California\u2019s $2 per pack SET increase and elevated competitive activity, which continued into the fourth quarter. We look at share performance over the long term, and from 2011 through 2017, Marlboro\u2019s share grew by an average of about a tenth of a point annually, but there\u2019s no question that 2017 presented a share challenge to PM USA, which it is addressing by reallocating marketing resources and investing in product and packaging innovation.","On the product side, Marlboro Black Label and Marlboro Ice are the latest innovations from Marlboro. In October, PM USA announced the expansion of Marlboro Black Label in California and Washington State, and this week PM USA began its national expansion of Marlboro Ice. Marlboro Ice enhances Marlboro\u2019s menthol offerings and comes in an innovative reseal pack. ","In November, PM USA expanded Benson & Hedges menthol into select stores in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington DC to complement Marlboro\u2019s menthol portfolio. We expect these and other actions planned for 2018 to help stabilize Marlboro\u2019s share and enhance PM USA\u2019s premium offerings for the long term.","From a portfolio perspective, with the Nat Sherman acquisition in 2017, Altria now has a presence the super premium cigarette segment. Since the acquisition, we successful integrated Nat Sherman, expanded its cigarette production capabilities, and aligned them with our strong distribution system. In the fourth quarter, the Nat Sherman team began a lead market test in Colorado for its repositioned brand, Nats. We\u2019re very pleased with early results and excited about the opportunity to compete more effectively in the super premium segment. ","We continued to build our portfolio of non-combustible nicotine containing products for authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In USSTC, we have the most profitable non-combustible tobacco business in the world. The smokeless segment delivered outstanding adjusted OCI growth of more than 11% in 2017 despite the voluntary recall. Copenhagen continued to grow and USSTC improved Skoal\u2019s overall profitability while investing behind its snus and blends offerings. Copenhagen\u2019s retail share grew half a share point to 33.7%. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined nine-tenths of a share point, reflecting USSTC\u2019s continued focus on growing Copenhagen while refining its Skoal investments to enhance profitability. The product recall also affected retail share in the year predominantly for Skoal. We\u2019re excited about USSTC\u2019s role in a regulatory framework that recognizes the continuum of risk. The MRTP application for Copenhagen snuff is on schedule to be submitted this quarter. ","In e-vapor, our Nu Mark grew MarkTen\u2019s volume by approximately 60% driven by expanded distribution and category growth. MarkTen had a full year national retail share of approximately 12.5% in mainstream channel. Nu Mark expanded the distribution of MarkTen Bold to approximately 25,000 stores. At investor day, we displayed Nu Mark\u2019s expanded product portfolio, which it built through a combination of internal development, joint development with PMI, strategic partnerships, and acquisitions. These products include Apex and Vim by MarkTen, which are two closed tank systems, and MarkTen Elite and Sync, which are two pod-based products. ","In heated tobacco, the team at PM USA has made significant progress on its commercialization plans for iQOS, including a consumer engagement program and the development of digital strategies. The team is ready to act promptly upon FDA authorization of iQOS.","In summary, we\u2019re very pleased with our performance through a dynamic and challenging year.","Let\u2019s now turn to the recently enacted tax reform legislation. As we mentioned earlier, the strong 2017 results from our operating businesses were complemented by tax reform. As a result of a one-time deemed repatriation tax related to the legislation, the dividends we received from AB InBev last year were tax-free on an adjusted basis and lowered our 2017 adjusted tax rate. Beginning in 2018 and going forward, our results will benefit from the lower 21% U.S. federal statutory corporate rate and lower taxes on AB InBev dividends. ","Let\u2019s turn to our guidance for 2018. We expect to deliver full-year 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.90 to $4.03 per share from a 2017 adjusted diluted EPS base of $3.39. This range represents a growth rate of 15% to 19% from 2017 and reflects expected higher net earnings as a result of tax reform net of strategic long-term investments we are making in our business. These investments are focused on key areas of long-term growth including innovative product development and launches including iQOS, regulatory science, equity enhancements to our brands, retail fixtures, and future retail concepts. For example, our guidance reflects both anticipated investments in the iQOS lead market and equity enhancements designed to help stabilize Marlboro\u2019s share. ","Our 2018 plan includes reinvestment of approximately one-third of the total tax reform benefit we are receiving with a moderating level of investment in subsequent years. We believe this balanced approach will deliver annual adjusted diluted EPS growth rates above our long-term 7% to 9% aspiration through 2020.","Before turning the call over to Billy, today we announce my decision to retire later this year when I turn 65. I\u2019ll step down following our annual shareholder meeting in May after 25 years of service with the company. Though this change won\u2019t occur until May, let me say a word about it, and most especially about Howard and Billy.","Through its long-term succession planning process, the board has elected Howard Willard to serve as the company\u2019s next Chairman and CEO. Howard is immensely qualified to lead Altria, having served in numerous leadership positions during his 25-year career with us. Billy Gifford has been elected to serve as Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, reflecting his leadership and the valuable contributions he\u2019s made to our company. I just can\u2019t imagine two leaders more qualified and ready to take our company forward. Howard and Billy, with the other talented members of our leadership team have been key contributors to the strategies that have delivered our strong results for the last several years. I firmly believe our business is well positioned for future success and I\u2019m confident we have the right leadership in Howard, Billy and the team to deliver continuing winning results.","Now here\u2019s Billy with more detail on our performance.","William Gifford","Thanks Marty, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start with some further color on the smokable product segment. For the full year, smokable segment reported cigarette shipment volume declined 5.1% primarily driven by the industry\u2019s rate of decline, retail share declines, and one fewer shipping day. When adjusted for calendar differences, PM USA\u2019s cigarette shipment volume declined by an estimated 5% and total industry cigarette volumes declined by 4%. ","The fourth quarter reported cigarette shipment volume numbers were especially noisy with inventory movements, declining by 8.9%. When adjusted for inventor movements, PM USA\u2019s cigarette shipment volume declined by an estimated 6.5%. Total industry cigarette volume declined by an estimated 4.5%. ","The cigar business continues to perform extremely well. For the full year, cigar volumes grew nearly 10% as Black & Mild volumes grew 10.7%. For the full year, smokable segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by three percentage point to 51.2%, driven primarily by higher pricing and lower SG&A expense. In the fourth quarter, adjusted OCI margins increased by 3.2 percentage points to 49.9%, primarily due to higher pricing, lower cost and lower promotional investments, partially offset by higher resolution expense. ","In the smokeless segment, USSTC\u2019s reported shipment volume declined by 1.4% for the full year, reflecting in significant part lost volume from the voluntary recall. After adjusting for trade inventory movements, USSTC estimates that adjusted smokeless products shipment volume declined by 2% for the year. In the fourth quarter, smokeless segment volumes declined by six-tenths of a percent. After adjusting for trade inventory movement, USSTC estimates that adjusted smokeless products shipment volume declined by 2.5%. USSTC estimates that smokeless products category volume was essentially unchanged over the past six months. ","Smokeless products segment full-year adjusted OCI margins expanded by 3.4 percentage points to 67.8% driven primarily by higher pricing and lower cost, partially offset by unfavorable mix. In the fourth quarter, adjusted OCI margins increased by 8.7 percentage points to 68.1% due primarily to the same factors. ","Turning to our alcohol assets, for the full year wine segment adjusted OCI declined 12% due primarily to lower volume. In the fourth quarter, Ste. Michelle\u2019s adjusted OCI was essentially unchanged from the year ago period. In beer, fourth quarter adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev were $251 million, reflecting AB InBev\u2019s third quarter results which it reported in October. As a reminder, a year ago we had essentially no adjusted fourth quarter equity earnings from our beer investment as a result of the one quarter reporting lag.","Marty mentioned tax reform, so let me take a moment to explain this in a bit more detail. There were three main effects of tax reform on our results and ongoing business. First, in 2017 we revalued our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new lower rate. We also incurred a one-time tax related to our share of accumulated earnings from our historic beer investment, often called a deemed repatriation tax. The net tax benefit of these items is reflected in our reported results and we\u2019ve included more details on our housekeeping page posted to altria.com. Second, beginning in 2017 and going forward, we\u2019ll benefit from lower taxes on AB InBev dividends we receive. Third, we expect our 2018 adjusted tax rate to be between 23% and 24%, primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate and lower taxes on AB InBev dividends. ","Turning to our share repurchase program, we repurchased more than $2.9 billion in shares in 2017, including approximately $558 million in the fourth quarter, leaving $18 million in the program as of December 31. We subsequently completed the program in January, and yesterday the board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program which we expect to complete by the end of 2018. ","We expect 2018 full-year capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $250 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $210 million. ","That concludes our prepared remarks, and Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I\u2019ll remind you that today\u2019s earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We\u2019ve also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory, and other housekeeping items.","With that, Operator, do we have any questions? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Martin Barrington ","Hi Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi, and Marty, was surprised to see the news this morning, but wanted to wish you well. It\u2019s obviously very well deserved.","Martin Barrington","Thanks Chris.","Chris Growe","Just had a couple questions very quickly. We haven\u2019t heard, other than maybe a press release, from Philip Morris, just kind of the assessment of the TPSAC meeting last week. I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed result that came out of the meeting in terms of the voting there, and I realize it\u2019s not a binding decision, but maybe we could get your thoughts on how that process went and how you\u2019re looking at 2018. It sounds like you do hopefully expect to launch that throughout the year.","Martin Barrington","Yes. Look, it\u2019s been widely covered and analyzed, and I agree with much of what has been written about it. Chris, I think the best way to see it is it\u2019s an important step forward in the process that\u2019s required to get an MRTP approval, which we continue to believe will be the case. I thought that the teams who presented did an amazingly good job of presenting the science and the evidence and in responding to questions. I thought it was extremely important that the TPSAC was convinced, very thoroughly convinced obviously, that iQOS significantly reduces exposure to constituents of concern, so we\u2019re looking forward to continuing to work with PMI and the FDA on that. Our view is that it had, if anything, a positive effect on the PMTA application.","Chris Growe","That\u2019s great, thank you. Then just a question for you about your investments you\u2019re making in 2018. I think you have a broad array of areas in which you\u2019re investing, and obviously the tax benefit allows for that. I\u2019m curious as we think about, without getting too specific of course, but you have a lot of investments, say reduced- risk product, a lot of activity this year, as well as investments back into the underlying business. Is there any way you can better characterize where you\u2019re putting--is most of the incremental investment dollar going behind reduced risk products and MRTPAs and that kind of thing, or is it more behind the base business?","Martin Barrington","It\u2019s both. We tried to articulate it both in the release and then in our remarks, Chris, but I can try to give you an inflection point of two if it will help, within the bounds of trying to be wise about competition. We have several areas that we\u2019ve called out, so if you look at innovative products, which is obviously a significant step forward for us, we have investments in there for the iQOS launch - that\u2019s our plan, we expect to get that approval, and so we\u2019ve put investment there. We\u2019re going to expand MarkTen Elite, which is a pod-based product, and there\u2019s going to be investment there. You\u2019ll remember from the investment day, for example, that Brian Quigley was talking about an expansion of our Verve product, and all of that of course has to be supported by regulatory science, so those of you who watched the TPSAC I think now understand the importance of having very good science done and good clinical trials, and that all takes investment.","In the core, what we\u2019re trying to do is make sure that the long-term equity of our brands is strong. That\u2019s why we have the successful business we have, so whether it\u2019s the national expansion of Marlboro Ice or what I described in the remarks around Benson & Hedges or improving our digital platform, those are all areas that we invest in but we now have some benefits from the tax reform, so it\u2019s a good year to make those further investments because they will pay long-term returns for shareholders. ","So I don\u2019t want to get into numbers, as you can appreciate, Chris, but those are the areas we\u2019re thinking about.","Chris Growe","I appreciate that, thank you . ","Operator","Your next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. ","Judy Hong","Thank you, good morning. ","Martin Barrington","Hi Judy.","Judy Hong","Best wishes to you from me as well, Marty. I guess going back to investments and guidance, because I think that given Marlboro\u2019s relatively soft share performance in 2017, there\u2019s a lot of people concerned that this investment implies potential for changes in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about pricing or promotion. I guess if you could just maybe elaborate on that not being the case, because it sounds like a lot of it is equity and innovation driven activity.","Then when you think about Marlboro, you talked about California and elevated competitive activity, so share performance for Marlboro outside of California and how do you expect the share performance to progress in 2018, because obviously you\u2019re going to start to lap the California tax in April of this year.","Martin Barrington","Sure. I think your description is a good one about the investments, which is that it\u2019s going to be equity and innovation-driven. Our strategy continues to be to maximize income in the smokable segment while maintaining momentum. Momentum is best measured over time, I think, and it\u2019s best measured over multiple metrics. Share is one, and it\u2019s important, but it\u2019s not the only one, so I won\u2019t reprise this in full because I know you know it, but when we look at it, it\u2019s equity, it\u2019s demographics and its profitability. Marlboro is in really good shape, but you heard me call out unique challenges. When California, a market of that size has a $2 per pack SET increase all at once, it disrupted the market there. The good news is that in the fourth quarter, Marlboro\u2019s share stabilized in California, so we\u2019re hopefully now in the section where we can reset from that base. ","What we\u2019re trying to do is stabilize Marlboro share, which I believe the team has excellent plans to do, and some of the remarks we\u2019ve already made about that. That\u2019s the objective, but it\u2019s always done within the context of the strategy, which is to maximize income. So it\u2019s about equity, it\u2019s about innovation. Of course you have to compete, but we\u2019re mindful of how the category operates for us.","Judy Hong","Okay, then just going back to guidance, I know it\u2019s an unusual year just because you\u2019ve got this tax benefit, but if we kind of strip out the tax benefit, given the reinvestment, it actually does imply very little, if at all, earnings growth. I\u2019m just curious, number one, had there not been tax reform, would you have actually guided to kind of a flat year in 2018, and as shareholders - and I think this is probably the more important question - as shareholders, how do you think they should assess whether these investments are really paying off? I mean, is it really about earnings growth being above your long-term targets? Would top line growth have to accelerate more meaningfully? Just understanding how you would recommend to kind of assess whether these investments are actually the right investments. ","Martin Barrington","Well, I\u2019m not going to tear its constituent parts apart, as you can appreciate, but I think the best evidence of what we would have done absent the tax reform is what we have done, which is we have grown at about an 8% adjusted EPS growth rate through thick and thin. We obviously have the benefit of the tax reform, but what we\u2019ve tried to do is to be thoughtful about it so that we can make the investments that are appropriate for the long term, reward shareholders--my goodness, 15 to 19% guidance at the adjusted EPS line, and remember Judy, it\u2019s off a higher base of 339, so we think that\u2019s the right thing to do.","There will be some variability at the operating company income line because we make investments, and as you know, depending upon when they hit and the timing of each quarter, what I would suggest to investors is they just look past that because we continue to have strong operating companies that are consistent in their strategies, and we\u2019re guiding to 15 to 19% EPS growth.","Then even though we don\u2019t guide past \u201918, we knew there would be interest in understanding what might happen in \u201919 and \u201920, and that\u2019s why we made the comment we did about we would expect to moderate the investments after that, so investors should expect that as well. I hope that\u2019s helpful to you, but I don\u2019t want to tear apart the adjusted guidance.","Judy Hong","Okay, thank you.","Martin Barrington","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Spielman with Citi.","Adam Spielman","Hi. First of all, my congratulations on your retirement. I hope it goes very well.","Martin Barrington","Thank you, Adam.","Adam Spielman","Just very quick to you, there was a question that Judy asked that didn\u2019t get answered, which is an interesting one. It\u2019s how we should judge the success or not of the investments. I suppose one way of thinking about that is in terms of Marlboro market share. You\u2019ve used the term stabilize, and I guess the question is if at the end of 2018 you had the same market share as you had in 4Q17, that to my mind would be stabilized, but I would have thought you want to see it sort of pull up towards the high 43s as opposed to just staying at around 43%. I guess that\u2019s one question, and I do have a completely separate follow-up question on the tax.","Martin Barrington","Okay, let me take the first one then, Adam. I think when you are declining throughout 2017, the first order of business is to get it stabilized, so I think that\u2019s the sensible thing to do. The way that we\u2019re going to do that is through equity investments and other means that I\u2019ve already described, so I won\u2019t repeat that. I also think that it is helpful for people to remember that share is one of four measures that we use to measure the brand health, and so that\u2019s another way to answer Judy\u2019s question, which is how is Marlboro\u2019s equity, how are its demographics, what is the profitability that it generates? So those are good metrics, along with share, I think, to gauge the brand health. I won\u2019t repeat again to you what you already know, which is those metrics are all very quite strong. We had a unique year with the share and we\u2019re addressing it.","Adam Spielman","That\u2019s fair enough. Then turning to the tax, obviously the national tax rate has gone to 21%. You\u2019re suggesting you\u2019re going to have a tax rate of 23 to 24. I was just wondering if you could highlight why--you know, what the difference is between that 21% national rate and the 23, 24 that you expect to have.","William Gifford","Yes Adam, the major difference there between those two numbers that you\u2019re quoting is state tax impact. That\u2019s an all-in number for us.","Adam Spielman","Fine, okay. Thank you very much.","Martin Barrington","All right, good to hear from you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thanks, good morning, and congratulations on your retirement, Marty. You\u2019ll be missed.","Martin Barrington","Thanks Bonnie, appreciate that.","Bonnie Herzog","My first question is on Marlboro. I guess I wanted to hear from you guys if you were surprised with the magnitude of the sequential deterioration of the brand\u2019s share performance in the quarter, and then how have some of your new line extensions been performing on the brand, such as Marlboro Ice? ","Martin Barrington","Well let me take the second part first. It\u2019s early, as you know, and I think you had a discussion with us at investor day about that. We continue to work through the effects of California, is the honest answer on the share question, and remember we\u2019ve got a quarter to go to lap it in 2018. But again, I\u2019d encourage people to think about this over the long term. Again, I looked back over the last six years - on average, we gained about a tenth. In some years it went up a lot, and then the questions were about are you overheating Marlboro, and now it\u2019s going down because of California and people get concerned about it. The brand health is strong, we have excellent new innovation that we\u2019re bringing to the brand. I think the team has very good plans for 2018, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it, and I think we\u2019re going to have a strong year in 2018.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay, and then switching gears a bit, just on PMTA. I was hoping you could give us an indication of where you think the FDA might be in its review of your PMCA for iQOS. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of the 180 day clock and has it stopped or restarted along the way, so just trying to get a sense of when you might expect to hear a decision on that. Then do you guys think that the outcome of the TPSAC meeting, given how the panel voted and the conversation, do you think that will have any bearing on the PMTA review process itself, just in terms of either the outcome or even timing?","Martin Barrington","Yes, so on the timing, I wish I could give you more but it\u2019s kind of a process that\u2019s within FDA, so I really don\u2019t have an insight to share with you on that other than the nominal timeline that\u2019s in the statute, and of course the activity that FDA has undertaken on it. I mentioned to another caller that we came away from the TPSAC believing that the team did an excellent job of presenting the case for the MRTP, and we remain very optimistic about that. I don\u2019t think any damage was done at all to the PMTA - if anything, I mean, the TPSAC panel, which is after all an advisory panel, concluded that it reduced exposure relative to conventional cigarettes, and I would think that\u2019s an important thing that FDA will take into account in looking at the PMTA application.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay, and if I could just squeeze in one final question before I drop, I\u2019d love to get your take on the consumer and what you\u2019re seeing right now with the consumer, especially in terms of some growth we\u2019re seeing behind the deep dish counter, maybe four tier cig volume, and then your expectations for the consumer in this interesting year with tax reform and potential greater disposable income, especially for your demographic.","Martin Barrington","Sure. I\u2019ll give you the headline, then I\u2019ll give you ledger. The headline is I think we\u2019re net positive, okay? There are a number of continuing positive factors for our consumer. You know what they are, of course - low unemployment, high consumer confidence including for our consumer. We do see some wage gains starting to flow through, including with some minimum wage increases. Housing starts remain pretty stable, indeed maybe up a tick, and it could be that tax reform will help our consumer - we certainly are hoping so. So I think those are all strong drivers.","There are a few things that we watch. Naturally, we watch the excise tax environment. We\u2019re watching c-store trends and we\u2019re watching gas prices, so we do this every month and we look at all of those, but where we are right now, I think it\u2019s net positive. We\u2019re a long way into an economic uptick, but net-net I think we\u2019re pretty positive on the consumer.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay, thank you.","Martin Barrington","All right, glad you called. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen.","Vivian Azer","Hi, good morning. ","Martin Barrington","Hi Vivien.","Vivian Azer","I\u2019ll also extend my congratulations to you, Marty. Two questions for me, please. First, on the comment on above algorithm EPS growth through 2020, I just wanted to be clear, that\u2019s in each of the next three years? It\u2019s not just a function of \u201918 being above algorithm, so as you kind of think about the average growth through 2020, it\u2019s going to be above 7 to 9?","Martin Barrington","I think I\u2019ll stick to what I said so I don\u2019t trip a wire here about guiding beyond the year in which we\u2019re guiding. I really have given you about as much as we can say about that without going astray there. What we\u2019re trying to communicate is because of the significant effect of tax reform, how we are thinking about it, not just for \u201918 but for \u201919 and \u201920, but I don\u2019t want to guide for \u201919 or \u201920. You just have to indulge me, Vivien, I\u2019m sorry.","Vivian Azer","Certainly, you can\u2019t fault me for trying, though.","Martin Barrington","No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t fault you at all.","Vivian Azer","I wanted to follow up on Bonnie\u2019s question, not necessarily about the consumer, and all of that makes a ton of sense, but specifically on your outlook for category volumes both in cigarettes and MST, and in particular on the latter. In MST, if you could offer any thoughts on cross-category elasticity and the interaction with either cigarettes or e-cigarettes, given the volume decline for the category. Thanks. ","Martin Barrington","Sure. We have some internal models on that, but I do think it\u2019s a fair conclusion that you do have movement between--you know, when an adult tobacco consumer is poly-using products. I think the--you know, we estimate the category growth in smokeless on a six-month trailing basis, it\u2019s kind of flattish. It\u2019s probably due to two principal things. The first is price effects - there has been some pricing, including from excise taxes, and interplay between the categories, and I would call out in particular vapor. We\u2019ve seen this once before and it looks to us like there may be some interplay between cigarette smokers, for example, who may be going to vapor instead of to smokeless. ","That said, when I look at how UST did in a year with flattish volumes for the industry, it\u2019s ability to grow more than 11% and to keep Copenhagen growing despite a recall on top, that was really a testament to the job they did, and I commend the UST team.","Vivian Azer","So just to be a little bit more specific then, do you think it\u2019s fair to think of the MST category as flat now? I mean, obviously 5% growth, that was a long time ago at this point, but even 2 to 3, is that reasonable anymore?","Martin Barrington","I don\u2019t know. You know, we can only look at the data that we have, and we try to do it over a six-month basis, Vivien, because there\u2019s a lot movement up and down that distorts the numbers. But for the last six-month period it was flattish. I can\u2019t recall what it was on the last call, but it was in that range, I believe, so I can\u2019t predict what it\u2019s going to be but we\u2019re watching it carefully, because there is a lot of movement, I think, with the consumer within the categories.","Vivian Azer","Understood, thanks very much.","Martin Barrington","All right, thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.","Russ Miller","Hi, good morning. This is Russ Miller on for Nic. Congrats Marty on your retirement. ","Martin Barrington","Thank you.","Russ Miller","We were wondering if you could provide more color on the competitive activity you mentioned in the release. Outside of California, is the competitive activity isolated to a certain geography or more broad? Any color there would be helpful.","Martin Barrington","Sure. Well, \u201917 was lively, I would say, on the competitive front. We had a lot of product expansions by competitors, including on multiple SKUs. Some of them were regional. I think that\u2019s actually good insight into how the category is working increasingly, which is we tend to talk about all the national numbers but we do see regional activity, and we see some activity, for example, in chains. A few chains have gotten behind some discount products and that puts pressure on everybody\u2019s brand, including ours, but you don\u2019t really see it affecting us - the discount, that is - at the national level. Certainly in the southeast we have some areas where there are products that are very significantly priced below our products, and that puts pressure on everybody\u2019s product. ","So I would say that it\u2019s always competitive in our industry, and \u201917 was no different. It may have been on the high end of what we\u2019ve observed over the last couple of years. ","Russ Miller","Thank you, Marty, and could you provide any more detail on the MarkTen Bold rollout and what the early consumer response there is?","Martin Barrington","Yes, it\u2019s been very good. I mentioned I think in the remarks, Russ, that we\u2019re now in 25,000 stores, and I think the consumer has reacted very well to the product and we like what we see with MarkTen Bold. ","Russ Miller","Thank you very much.","Martin Barrington","Okay, thanks for calling in.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. ","Matthew Grainger","Great, thanks for the question, and congratulations Marty as well. We\u2019ll miss having the opportunity to work with you.","Martin Barrington","Thanks Matt.","Matthew Grainger","I guess first question, just on the TPSAC meeting and the MRTP process, I know you\u2019ve spoken about this a little bit and I jumped on the call late, so apologies if I missed anything. Just curious, lessons that you learned from those discussions and the initial phase of the process so far, and not specifically to predict the outcome of the iQOS application, more just broader learnings that you can apply to try and streamline the process for other applications you plan to file, like for Copenhagen for instance in the future.","Martin Barrington","I think that\u2019s a good question. I think we learn every time we go there, and I think you and I may even have discussed our presence during the Swedish match hearings and what we learned from that. Look, I think one takeaway is that the preparation really matters, and I thought that the teams were outstanding in that regard. I thought that they had complete mastery of the subject matter, they answered every question, I thought, very fully, but you can see the rigor that\u2019s going to be applied. That\u2019s probably the second insight, which is it is in the statute that these products should be approved. I continue to believe they are going to be approved, but there\u2019s no question that the applicant has to carry that burden, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re preparing our applications because we want to get the products approved.","I think it\u2019s also useful to observe that there are TPSAC members and then the FDA itself, which will ultimately make the decision about whether it should be approved. I think that\u2019s another insight about the meeting dynamic that one can learn from, because after all it is FDA that\u2019s going to decide. But I think those are the insights, which is you need to have the science work done, you need to have a really good team that\u2019s going to present it, you need to anticipate the questions that will come, and then you really have to make the case for your product. I continue to believe that\u2019s going to happen, and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re working towards.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, thanks Marty. One question just on the PM USA business, and you may have already said your piece on this, but I understand the comparative factors and the competitive dynamics that weighed on overall cigarette volumes, but I\u2019m still just trying to understand the balance between the volume declines and the pricing realization during the quarter, the fact that promotional expenses were down, pricing was quite high. Is that--I understand that that\u2019s one quarter in time, but it\u2019s an unusual delivery of top line for you to have 78% price mix realization and volumes being down that much. Is there anything else you can add to why you chose to pull back on promotional expenses and felt that that was the right approach to the business in Q4?","Martin Barrington","Well, it\u2019s really the reallocation, I would say, rather than pulling back. Matt, it really is true that these things flow in and out of quarters and it\u2019s really hard to extrapolate from that, but I\u2019ll try to help you by referring to the full year numbers.","So when I look at the smokable business, which again had the share challenge, we\u2019ve got income growing at about 7%, above $8.5 billion. We\u2019ve got good margin expansion of 3 percentage points to 51%. The volume hit us because obviously with a 4% industry decline and the share challenge, we took more of a volume decline than we would have liked, and we\u2019ve already talked about Marlboro. So I\u2019ve got net pricing for the year at about 5.9%. I would say that\u2019s within the range, but it\u2019s probably at the higher end of the range.","The other thing I\u2019d say about \u201918, which may help, is PM USA has one more shipping day in \u201918 than we had in \u201917, so that\u2019s how we look at it. I think they had a terrific year - not without its challenges, but in a segment that you run for income, I thought that they really did a good job.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, thanks for the color. ","Martin Barrington","Thanks Matt. Good to hear from you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","Thank you, and Marty, congrats to you. You\u2019ll be missed.","Martin Barrington","Thanks Michael.","Michael Lavery","Just wanted to touch back on the promotion side. I think one thing noticeably absent from your list of investments for 2018 is price, which I think investors would be encouraged by. But just in terms of some of the flexibility that you have there, can you touch on maybe how you\u2019re thinking about your positioning for Marlboro Ice? Will that have promotional spend or an introductory price, similar to how, say, Special Blend or Black first came onto the market?","Martin Barrington","No, it\u2019s going to have a mainline price, although we obviously will have offers to try to incent trial from competitive smokers.","Michael Lavery","Okay, great. Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. Then as you touch on some of the color on the next couple years, I realize you don\u2019t want to guide anything there, but if iQOS is approved for marketing authorization this year and it gets into the market, it would presumably have a growing footprint over the next couple years. Would some of the ability to moderate the spending over that same period be because a lot of the science costs come upfront and it\u2019s more 2018-heavy? Is that the right way to think about it? ","Martin Barrington","Well, I think there will be puts and takes. We have scenarios that we\u2019ve built depending upon what happens in the lead market. Obviously if iQOS is a big hit, as we believe and hope it will be, we will expand it and scale it up and there will be costs associated with doing that. Most of the science work, I guess, would have been done on the PMTA under that scenario, but to the extent that further work needs to be done on the MRTP, we\u2019ll just have to see how that goes.","This is the dilemma for us - we try to help you all with your modeling, but for us to tell you all the puts and takes would be to tell you something that we don\u2019t know until we see the year, so I\u2019m trying to be careful about that. ","Michael Lavery","Fair enough, understood. Thank you very much.","Martin Barrington","Okay Michael, thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. ","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Thank you for the question. Marty, congratulations on the retirement. Billy, I was wondering if we could just get some thoughts from you around how you\u2019re thinking about your debt profile going forward. You have a couple of really chunky high coupon maturities this year and next year. Given some of the tax law changes, how should we think about your prioritization of paying those down versus refinancing those in the debt market? Thank you.","William Gifford","Thanks for the question. As you know, when we look at the debt, you\u2019ve seen us take advantage of marketplace conditions in the past. It\u2019s all marketplace contingent. We have to assess the marketplace and decide what we\u2019re going to do. If not, then we reach the maturity date and we go ahead and pay those off, so it really is marketplace dependent and I\u2019m not going to get ahead of ourselves on that.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Thank you.","Operator","Again if you would like to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Again, that\u2019s star, one to ask a question.","You do have a follow-up question from Adam Spielman with Citi.","Adam Spielman","Thank you very much for the follow-up. ","Martin Barrington","Welcome back.","Adam Spielman","Well, thank you! Thinking more about Marlboro, but I\u2019d just like to return to the smokeless. If you think about Skoal and Cope sort of together, obviously your market share was down for the full year 90 basis points, partly due to the recall. It was down a bit more than that in 4Q, and you said--for Marlboro, you said the first order was to stabilize market share, but if we think of these two brands together, Cope and Skoal, how in broad terms do you think we should think about it playing out, because I guess there will also be some equity investments in those if I\u2019m not wrong.","Martin Barrington","Correct. We\u2019re always investing in the equity of those brands, that\u2019s right. I think the way to think about it--","Adam Spielman","So how--sorry, go ahead, please. ","Martin Barrington","That\u2019s all right. I think I have the thrust of your question, but if I don\u2019t, ask me again. I think what you\u2019re really asking is what\u2019s the portfolio strategy there, and we\u2019ve spoken about this in the past and it hasn\u2019t changed. What we\u2019re trying to do is to unleash Copenhagen because it wants to grow, it\u2019s a terrific brand, and it\u2019s the aspirational brand in the category. We do have a brand that has large share in Skoal, and it has a role to play in the portfolio particularly with respect to appealing to adult smokers who may want to come into dipping, and that\u2019s why it has snus, for example, and blends. But what we\u2019re trying to do is to increase the profitability of the overall portfolio, and we are doing that by changing the promotional mix on Skoal. So when you put those two constituent parts together, that\u2019s why you produce a year, for example, where you have income growth of greater than 11%. It\u2019s because Copenhagen is growing and because Skoal is more profitable.","Adam Spielman","But when I look at the 4Q market share for Cope, I mean, I understand the point about Skoal, but it was flat, and presumably you\u2019d like it to grow, not be flat. ","Martin Barrington","It did - it grew half a share point for the year, so that\u2019s why we try not to get too bound up in the quarter. ","Adam Spielman","Okay, thank you.","Martin Barrington","All right, thanks for calling back.","Operator","Thank you, and at this time I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Marshall for closing comments.","Bill Marshall","Thank you all for joining our call this morning.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Paige Magness, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead ma'am.","Paige Magness","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We're here this morning with Howard Willard, Altria's CEO; and Billy Gifford, our CFO to discuss Altria's 2019 first quarter business results and related matters.","Earlier today, we issued a press release providing these results. We're also including slides to accompany our remarks. And all of this information is available on our website at altria.com and through the Altria Investor App.","During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2018. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors.","Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S., Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both the reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. ","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Howard.","Howard Willard","Thanks, Paige, and good morning everyone. After taking steps to position Altria for long-term success at the end of 2018, we entered 2019 with an evolved business platform that includes our strong core tobacco businesses and new strategic investments with tremendous potential for growth. We believe we've made significant progress in the first quarter on key initiatives to realize the potential of this evolved business platform. This morning I'll focus my remarks on some of the key drivers of our business performance, progress against priorities for our new investments and our perspective on the current regulatory environment.","Altria's adjusted diluted EPS declined 5.3% in line with our guidance for a mid single-digit decline in the first quarter. We incurred a higher interest expense as a result of our recently-issued debt without the full benefit of savings from our cost reduction program, which began to ramp up at the end of the quarter. And in March we closed our investment in Cronos. Altria now owns a 45% equity interest in the company and we're excited to support of the talented Cronos team in pursuing its growth strategies.","Let's now move to our core tobacco businesses and start with the dynamics affecting U.S. cigarette category volumes. We estimate that when adjusted for trade inventory movements and one fewer shipping day, cigarette industry volumes declined by approximately 5% in the first quarter. We believe first quarter cigarette industry volumes reflect both the secular decline including adult smoker movement between categories and e-vapor in particular and historic price elasticity.","We also believe macroeconomic factors specifically gas prices affected cigarette volumes in the quarter. Gas prices increased by nearly 20% from the end of January through March. We believe rapid and significant increases in gas prices can cause adult smokers to reevaluate their short-term purchasing decisions and we believe this negatively impacted the decline rate in the quarter as we saw monthly sequential acceleration in volumes and volume declines over the three months of the quarter.","We continue to closely monitor the category mindful that trends typically play out over a longer period. However, because gas prices did not become a tailwind as we thought they might earlier this year, we've revised our 2019 cigarette industry volume decline rate estimate to 4% to 5%. If we de-compose the cigarette industry volume performance for the most recent 12 months ending March 31, we estimate that volumes declined approximately 4.5%, reflecting an elevated secular decline rate due to increased movement by adult smokers to e-vapor.","We've previously cited a secular decline rate within a 2% to 3% range. This range typically includes one percentage point of adult smoker movement to other tobacco products. And in total for this trailing 12-month period, we estimate adult consumer shifts to e-vapor accounted for the historic one percentage point component plus an additional 0.4.","We believe macroeconomic factors specifically gas prices accounted for about 0.3 of a percentage point additional headwind on cigarette volumes. We also believe the price elasticity component of the decline rate remains consistent with our long-term estimate of negative 0.3. We continue to believe that cigarette volumes will decline at an average annual rate of 4% to 5% over the next five years.","Moving now to our smokeable products segment cigarette volumes. Reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 14.3% in the first quarter, reflecting year-over-year trade inventory dynamics and one fewer shipping day. When adjusted for these factors, our cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 7%. Let me comment in a bit more detail on the first quarter trade inventory movements, which negatively impacted year-over-year reported volume comparisons by approximately 1.7 billion units or almost six percentage points.","Over the course of the quarter, wholesalers depleted PM USA inventories by an estimated 400 million units compared to a build of 1.3 billion units in the year-ago quarter. And the trade ended the first quarter with significantly lower cigarette inventories than it did last year. While there can be volatility quarter-to-quarter, industry movements typically smooth out over time.","Despite this volume performance, the smokeable segment's adjusted operating company's income was essentially unchanged from the prior year as PM USA continues to execute its strategy of maximizing profitability, while maintaining momentum on Marlboro over time. PM USA's efforts resulted in smokeable products segment net price realization of more than 8% and adjusted operating company's income margin expansion of more than three percentage points. We remain quite pleased with the performance of Marlboro, and its continued stabilization since the fourth quarter of 2017 following the disruptive California SET increase earlier that year.","Investments in retail trade programs, product expansions like Marlboro Ice and brand equity like the Marlboro rewards program continued to show encouraging results with retail share up or down 0.1 sequentially over the past five quarters.","While Marlboro retail share has remained stable over the last five quarters, L&M has ceded share to deep discount offerings, which negatively impacted PM USA's overall retail share. We continue to believe the growth of deep discount reflects the churn between branded discount and deep discount and not interactions with premium brands.","We remain quite pleased with the role L&M has played in PM USA's portfolio over the past six years, growing share and increasing profitability without affecting Marlboro. In smokeless, USSTC is similarly focused on maximizing income, while maintaining momentum on Copenhagen over time. USSTC delivered strong adjusted operating company's income growth, despite slowing category volumes and one less shipping Monday during the quarter.","Copenhagen the fastest-growing brand in four of the last five quarters grew its share by 0.7 share points to 35%. Additionally, in early February USSTC presented a compelling case supporting its MRTP filing for Copenhagen snuff to the FDA's Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee that communicating accurate and scientifically grounded information to adult smokers about the relative risks of smokeless tobacco is important for harm reduction. The committee overwhelmingly agreed that our modified risk claim is fully supported by scientific evidence and voted accordingly. We'll continue to engage with FDA on this application.","We also remain very excited about the opportunity to market PMI's iQOS heat-not-burn product in the U.S. We are fully committed to this platform and have strong commercialization plans to support its launch. We're ready and continue to learn from the momentum of iQOS's success in overseas markets. As you are aware, it's been two years since PMI submitted the iQOS PMTA and recent comments from leadership at the Center for Tobacco Products suggested decision is forthcoming this year. We believe the science is compelling and supportive of a market authorization and we're ready and excited to help convert adult smokers to iQOS once that authorization is received.","Turning now to e-vapor. In December, we announced that our investment in Juul would allow us to participate meaningfully in the e-vapor category and also to support and even accelerate adult smoker transition to non-combustible alternative products.","Over the past few years as products in the market have improved led by Juul, we've seen a significant re-acceleration in the number of adult vapors in the category. Annual 12-month moving data shows, an increase in the number of adult vapors from 9 million in 2016 to 13 million in February 2019. And when looking at three-month data ended in February, there were more than 15 million adult vapors compared to the 12 million in the year earlier period. We believe this data reflects higher product satisfaction and conversion by adult smokers and is supportive of harm reduction potential of the category.","In the first quarter, we estimate that e-vapor category volume grew by approximately 40% year-over-year across open and close systems and all trade classes. Juul reported to us that its shipment volume grew approximately 175% to over $175 million refill kit pods. And we estimate, Juul now represents more than 40% of the overall e-vapor category in the first quarter. Sequentially, the e-vapor category and Juul's growth slowed in light of Juul's unilateral decision to stop shipping non-traditional flavored pods to retail in November.","As we've previously noted, we accept any short-term slowdown resulting from actions to address youth e-vapor use in an effort to preserve the long term e-vapor opportunity for adults. Internationally, Juul continues to see promising results and is making progress on its commercial expansion. Though still early days, let's update the two examples we first highlighted in our year-end call in January.","In Canada, while distribution is limited Juul reports that retail takeaway at the end of February grew to more than 80% dollar share in stores selling their products from slightly more than 60% dollar share at the beginning of December.","In the Sainsbury chain in the U.K., Juul tells us that it remains the number one e-vapor brand in the chain increasing its dollar share to more than 27% by the end of March from 23% in late January. Juul now operates in nine countries outside of the U.S. having most recently launched in Spain, with additional country launches expected by the end of 2019.","By mid-March Juul products were available in over 8,500 stores throughout Switzerland, Germany, France and Italy. Juul also plans to test next-generation products in limited international markets this year including a Bluetooth-enabled device. This device will test a variety of features including access restrictions at the user level.","On the HSR review process for the Juul transaction, we announced earlier this month that we received a request for additional information from the Federal Trade Commission related to the HSR notification we filed during the first quarter. We are cooperating with the FTC, and we'll work to provide answers to the outstanding questions promptly. We continue to believe that our investment in the services we have agreed to provide Juul will promote competition and have a long-term benefits for adult smokers.","Turning to the FDA, with the arrival of the new interim FDA Commissioner, we are focused on continuing to work productively with the staff at the Center for Tobacco Products. We are committed to a shared belief in a continuum of risk for tobacco products and that adults who need or want nicotine should have access to nicotine through less harmful non-combustible products.","As of February, on a 12-month moving basis, 13 million adults have already chosen to use e-vapor products, clearly suggesting that this vision can be realized. We know however, that the epidemic of youth e-vapor usage threatens the opportunity for harm reduction for adult smokers. That's why we are fully engaged along with Juul in thoughtful solutions in taking action.","We believe the single most impactful step we can take today is to continue our advocacy for raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at both the federal and state levels. In just a few short months, we're beginning to see the impact of the full force of our government affairs advocacy. Year-to-date, governors in six states have signed legislation to increase the legal age of purchase to 21, bringing the total number of states to 12. Two additional states have already passed legislation that awaits the governor's signature.","With these additional bills approximately 38% of the U.S. population will be covered by a state-wide legal age of purchase at 21. 19 additional states are actively considering similar legislation and bipartisan legislation is being introduced at the federal level. This intensive effort has the endorsement of many in the public health sector and our full support.","We expect the actions taken by Altria and Juul will take some time to result in a leveling off and ultimately reduction of the current youth usage trends, but we believe these actions are essential and that now is the time. In addition, during the first quarter, the FDA published draft guidance, proposing a potential revision to its compliance policy for both e-vapor products and cigars. For flavored e-vapor products, other than tobacco, mint and menthol, it would move the deadline for filing pre-market applications for these products from August 2022 to August 2021.","It would also impose restrictions on sales of such tobacco products at in-person locations and online in order to reduce underage access. And it would take enforcement action against those that target underage users and\/or promote underage use of e-vapor and similar tobacco products. We believe the draft guidance for e-vapor products is an important step toward addressing youth e-vapor use.","For cigars, the draft guidance could result in the removal of all flavored cigars from the market 30 days after issuance of final guidance, except for grandfathered products and products that have received authorization from the FDA to remain on the market. This draft guidance raises several concerns in terms of process and the lack of science and evidence supporting the proposed policy. We will detail our concerns in our comments which will be available on altria.com.","In summary, this is a dynamic time period in a changing tobacco category. Consumer preferences and regulatory actions are driving rapid change. We believe that our diverse income streams with our evolved platform of strong core tobacco businesses and investments in Juul, Cronos and AB InBev have positioned Altria best among our peers for long-term growth and leadership across a variety of future scenarios. Our 2019 plans are on track. We reaffirmed our guidance to deliver full year 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.27. This range represents a growth rate of 4% to 7% from a 2018 adjusted diluted EPS base of $3.99.","I'll now turn it over to Billy to provide more detail on our first quarter results.","Billy Gifford","Thanks Howard and good morning everyone. Although our recent investments have been the subject of significant focus, our smokeable and smokeless tobacco businesses still delivered most of our earnings. Despite headwinds in the first quarter, these businesses are performing well and we expect them to deliver strong income growth into the future.","Here are some highlights from the quarter. In the smokeable products segment, adjusted OCI was essentially flat at nearly $2 billion and adjusted OCI margins increased 3.6 percentage points to 53.3%. Adjusted OCI results were driven by lower cigarette volume, offset by higher pricing lower promotional investments and lower costs.","Turning to Marlboro. The brand's retail share declined 0.2 percentage point year-over-year. However, it remains unchanged sequentially from its fourth quarter 2018 share. Several initiatives are helping Marlboro stay strong and relevant. First, PM USA introduced the reseal pack technology last year, representing our most significant cigarette packaging innovation since the flip-top box.","The consumer response to the introduction was overwhelmingly positive and the brand continues to expand this innovation. PM USA is excited to announce plans to expand Marlboro Smooth Ice, a fresh crisp menthol cigarette in the resale pack nationally with distribution to over 110000 stores beginning this month. Similarly, Marlboro Rewards continues to exceed our expectations, bringing new adult smokers 21-plus to marlboro.com and increasing digital engagement.","In only 2.5 months, more than 1.6 million adult smokers 21-plus, enrolled in the program and entered over 30 million pack codes. We've seen a nearly 140% increase in new registrants to marlboro.com in the first quarter. We are encouraged that Marlboro smokers are reinvesting their rewards points back into the brand as mobile coupons remain the number one redeemed item.","In the super-premium tobacco and water segment, Nat Sherman continues to perform well following the regional expansion of Nat's across the Western U.S. in mid-2018. In the first quarter, Nat's represented a 0.3 of a share point of the cigarette category in states selling the product. Based on these strong results, Nat's is expanding nationally to the remaining 37 states this month.","In the smokeless products segment, USSTC generated adjusted OCI growth of 7.9% in the first quarter as higher pricing and lower cost were partially offset by lower volumes. We continue to believe that the smokeless industry volume is being affected by adult tobacco consumer movement between tobacco categories and higher pricing.","Copenhagen continues to be the growth engine behind the success of USSTC. In the first quarter, Copenhagen grew 0.7 retail share points to 35%. Next month, USSTC will open the Original Snuff Shop, a premium a flagship store in the heart of downtown Nashville. The store is designed to reinforce Copenhagen's leading equity among adult dippers and its 100% American craftsmanship positioning.","Turning to our alcohol assets. In wine, Ste. Michelle's adjusted OCI decreased $2 million, primarily due to higher costs and higher promotional investments, partially offset by higher shipment volume. In beer, adjusted earnings from our equity investment in AB InBev were $200 million in the first quarter, which reflects Altria's share of AB InBev's fourth quarter results.","And, of course, we continue to reward shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. We remain fully committed to our dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS. We repurchased 2.7 million shares in the first quarter at an average share price of $56.34 for a total cost of $151 million. This leaves $195 million remaining in the current $2 billion repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of the second quarter.","We were also active in the credit markets in the quarter. We issued $16.3 billion in debt in the European and U.S. markets at a combined weighted average coupon of approximately 4.1%. We subsequently used these proceeds to repay the term loan we used to fund the Juul investment and to fund the Cronos investment. The balance will be used for other general corporate purposes, which may include future debt maturities.","Finally, our cost reduction program remains on track to deliver approximately $575 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2019. As a reminder, the program includes savings from workforce reductions, third-party spending reductions and closure of our Nu Mark operations.","In the first quarter, savings were primarily driven by workforce reductions, most of which occurred at the end of February, as well as discontinuation of e-vapor operations. We continue to expect the remaining savings from this program to ramp up throughout the year and to achieve full run rate by year-end.","I'd also like to provide color on reported earnings. Since we will be reporting Cronos-related financial instruments at fair value each quarter, there may be significant reported earnings volatility primarily driven by quarterly adjustments related to movement in Cronos' stock price. Any fair value adjustments is non-cash and will be reported as a special item. With that, we'll wrap up and Howard and I will be happy to take your questions.","While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've posted our usual quarterly metrics which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.","With that, I'll open the question-and-answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?","Howard Willard","Before we do that operator, Paige has just reported out to me that I misspoke on one number that I'll correct now. I think I explained that by mid-March Juul products were available in a number of stores in Switzerland, Germany, France and Italy and that number of stores is 8,500 stores.","So with that, operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi. Good morning.","Howard Willard","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Growe","I want to ask around the volume performance in the cigarette category this quarter. You talked about sequential weakness through the quarter, obviously gas prices being a main driver of that. Can you talk about where it ended the quarter? And do you see that continue into the second quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense of the performance you expect as we kind of move here in the interim in 2019.","Howard Willard","Yes. I will comment on the second quarter performance, but it did step up a little bit in March. And ultimately the total quarterly performance was down 5%. But of course, we've taken all that into account, as we've looked at our estimate for the full year and we continue to believe full year decline is likely to be 4% to 5%.","Chris Growe","And that 4% to 5% decline rate, is it category growth rate? Obviously, a lot of your market share weakness in the quarter occurred in the discount segment. Marlboro is performing well. Would what -- looking to persistent outperformance for L&M cause you to lose market share for the year? Is that part of your expectation for 2019?","Howard Willard","I don't know that we're at all troubled by the discount performance in the first quarter. As we stated, there's been a trend for quite some time for some modest share churn between branded discount and the deep discount products.","We are focused on programs within L&M to moderate that. But I don't feel like we \u2013 we feel like that puts our plans for the year at all at risk. And it is a continuation of a moderate trend. And I pointed out, I think in the past, that if you go back five years on an L&M it is still modestly ahead in its share and has had significant profit improvement. And so, I think, we're quite pleased there.","And as you point out, our primary focus in the cigarette category is on Marlboro and I think that we're pleased with the performance of the Marlboro brand. We're pleased with the stability of the premium category. And I think that causes us to not be interested in getting too active in spending a lot of money in discount.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you for that and just a quick follow-up if I could on menthol. You indicated that your market share was down a little bit in menthol in the quarter, which I found surprising, because you have a lot of new products there as well. Is that category more competitive? Or any unique that would have caused your market share performance to not be up in the quarter? And any color you have there would be helpful. Thank you.","Billy Gifford","Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. I think it's important to remember, over a shorter period things will fluctuate. There was nothing there from a competitive standpoint that would show that we have concern about. Of course, the tobacco category is always competitive. But if I put it in a band, I'd put it kind of at the midpoint of our band, and so nothing of concern.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.","Pamela Kaufman","Good morning. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to follow-up on Chris's question on volumes in the quarter, and better understand why wholesalers are depleting inventory levels to this degree. You mentioned that this is something you expect to reverse throughout the year. But is this a reflection at all on their view of the health of the category? And how transitory is this dynamic?","Billy Gifford","Yeah. I think when you think about wholesale inventory, it's always important to put it over a long period of time. You'll see fluctuations in a short period, and what we refer to is that they tend to balance out over the longer period. I think when you think about wholesale inventory and trade inventories in total, you'll see the number of different reasons why the inventories fluctuate based on how they manage their inventories. Sometimes it's seasonality. Sometimes it's when their year-end occurs. And the other is around price increases. And so when you look at the price increase that took place our price increase this year, it took place earlier in the quarter than last year. And so you'll typically see that wholesale inventory tends to de-load after a price increase. Well, because it happened earlier this year, they were able to -- what we anticipated is that they were able to de-load their inventory all within the quarter where last year it lapped first and second quarter.","Pamela Kaufman","Thank you. And also, I just wanted to hear a little bit more about your perspective on the leadership changes at the FDA. Do you believe that any of these changes impact the FDA's goals on menthol or nicotine reduction? Or it has impact timing for iQOS approval?","Howard Willard","Sure. Yeah. I don't think we've gotten any indication that directly as a result of the leadership change that there is going to be significant change in the issues and the view of FDA on those issues. I think that the nicotine issue and the menthol issue, I think from my expectation, are expected to be resolved and with us for quite some time period of years. And so I think we're in early days on that, and I wouldn't expect this change is going to have a big change there.","I would be surprised given where we are in the iQOS application process, which is I think we're near the end, if there were any changes that occurred there. And then, I think that this is favorable in my view. I think there's been pretty clear communication that under the new acting FDA Commissioner, there's going to be a focus driving down youth use of e-vapor products, and I think that's a positive.","Pamela Kaufman","Thanks. And sorry, last question. Have you started to offer any of the services to Juul as part of your services agreement? And can you elaborate at all on the nature of the questions related to the antitrust review?","Howard Willard","Sure. With regard to the services that we provide Juul, we are in the early stages of that, although we did provide some in the first quarter. I think you'll see that pick up pace more in the second and third quarter of this year. Probably the service that is most highly visible that we offered in the first quarter, we had established innovative tobacco products space in a number of retailers across the country that we were going to use for our MarkTen e-vapor products.","Typically that is space that is visible by the consumer. Oftentimes it includes the header position. And we transferred that space that we were going to use for MarkTen over to Juul. And already in March, there were thousands of stores that were converting that space to the Juul product, and I would expect that will continue into the second quarter.","With regard to questions around HSR, I don't know that -- there's any specific questions that I would call out. I just think that as is typical in these cases, we address the number of questions in the first round. They had some follow-up questions, and that just means that we end up in a longer period of time for them to make their decision. As I indicated in the remarks, we continue to be confident about its ultimate approval.","Pamela Kaufman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","Good morning. Thank you.","Howard Willard","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lavery","As you expand the Smooth Ice and Nat's nationally, can you give us a sense of what those are replacing on the back bar? And with Juul you just touched on the MarkTen swap out obviously, but are there any cases where that may replace anything other than MarkTen's space?","Billy Gifford","Yeah. From a standpoint in the first in Marlboro, Smooth Ice and Nat's, they really aren't replacing anything on the back-bar. We have a great sales force that knows what's relevant to the consumers in their area, and so they really work with the retailers in our display space to display those brands that those consumers are interested in. As far as the innovative space, it's really limited to the removal of our brands in the marketplace in e-vapor and the replacement of that by Juul in those stores where they bought that space from us.","Michael Lavery","Okay. Thank you. And a little bit related, how much have you seen if any the momentum in vapor have an impact on trade inventories? Now, especially with your relationship with Juul, do you have some better visibility on their sort of situation in the store, and how that may or may not be influencing retail trade inventories?","Billy Gifford","I think when you think about it Michael, across inventories, they really do look at it through time and think about the various categories individually. I think we have seen a benefit to out of stocks on Juul product with some of our services we provided. So I would say better inventory practices in the e-vapor space related to Juul, but no material impact from the other categories.","Michael Lavery","Okay, thank you. And then just one more. We saw the Canopy acreage deal, obviously, recently and your stake with Cronos is significant and could flip above 50% with the warrants. Do you work with them on strategic evaluation of opportunities in the U.S.? And is the acreage playbook one that you might see replicated from with them as a partner?","Howard Willard","Sure. As you know we recently closed the deal with Cronos. And through our board representation, we are significantly exposed to their ideas and obviously provide them with ideas on how to further grow their business in the future. And I think you are right to point out the fact that the cannabis space is quite lively these days with a variety of companies that are making strategic moves.","And we've, obviously, been thinking quite proactively on our own and are now thinking with Cronos, which strategic moves make sense over the next year. I don't have anything to talk about today but our intention in making the investment into Cronos and capitalizing them quite competitively versus the other cannabis companies in this space was really designed to enable them to make the moves that are necessary to build out our leadership position. And I imagine over the next year or two we'll have more to say about that.","Michael Lavery","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.","Owen Bennett","Good morning, guys. And just a couple of related questions on Juul and the services you're providing there, so whether it be the shelf space or as you understand what you were saying previously about advertising the Juul inside your Marlboro packs.","I'm just wondering firstly, could you talk about the dynamics you're seeing between Marlboro and Juul now? And have you seen any increase rate of switching? And then secondly if IQOS get approved and how would you make the decision between switching Marlboro smokers to IQOS or switching them over to Juul? Thank you.","Howard Willard","Sure. I think we have not detected any specific impact of Juul on Marlboro. I would say that Juul's growth continues to be more broadly from the cigarette category generally and we haven't seen any specific impact on our brands.","And then I would say that with regard to IQOS versus Juul, I think we ultimately believe that the consumer is going to decide, which product most appeals to them. It would not surprise me if some consumers actually engage in trial of both products and then ultimately make a choice between the two or whether or not they want to stay within the cigarette category.","And I think our real focus in providing assistance to Juul and also in representing the IQOS brand once it's approved by FDA is to make sure that consumers are aware of the products and the product benefits that the products are distributed in stores where adult cigarette consumer shop, they're aware of the brand that it's in stock to make up promotional offers on it. And then I think ultimately the consumers are going to make their product choice.","Owen Bennett","Okay. Thank you very much.","Howard Willard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","All right, thank you. Good morning.","Howard Willard","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi. I guess, my first question is more of a big picture one. I guess, I want to ask can your model work. Meaning can you guys still hit your EPS guidance in the context of an environment where cig volumes are decelerating faster. Just really want to hear from you what gives you the confidence in this. I'm thinking about this in the context that the key headwinds such that you do own a stake in Juul, but you aren't yet seeing a benefit of that and you might not until next year. Pricing is going up to offset the greater volume pressure, but is this pricing really sticking?","And then finally cig volumes realistically could decline more rapidly. So I guess in the context of all of that, is it realistic to assume that you're going to be able to deliver on your EPS guidance? And then more importantly your long-term algorithm? Thanks.","Howard Willard","Sure. I think to start off; we continue to strongly believe that we can deliver on our EPS guidance this year of 4% to 7% EPS growth. And we continue to be confident about our ability to deliver over the long-term against our 7% to 9% adjusted EPS growth.","And I think we communicated on the call here, our expectation for the range of industry cigarette volume declines. I think you're asking a hypothetical question, which is related to well if it turns out that there are conditions in the marketplace because our estimate for category declines to be lower than actually occurs, do we feel -- still feel confident in our 7% to 9% EPS growth.","And I have to say that while we continue to believe that our estimate is our best view on what the next five years will bring, if there is further movement around in the category that drives cigarettes' volume declined higher, I'd still have confidence that we can deliver against our 7% to 9% EPS growth over the long-term.","You are right to point out that in this year; we don't have an income stream of any significance coming from Juul. But given the growth we expect in the e-vapor category and the growth we expect from Juul this year, I would expect that by next year and the year after if in fact there is any acceleration in the cigarette category decline rates that we will have an income offset to any impact that would have on us related to income coming from Juul.","That was part of the logic of the investments, because while we think we have a pretty good handle on what's going to happen over the next five years, if there was any variation in that we felt strongly that we wanted to have a position in the leading fast growing and in the near future highly profitable e-vapor player in the U.S.","And I have to tell you, I also believe that we have a very resilient profit generator in the cigarette and smokeless businesses that we have and we have a number of additional levers to pull to help drive EPS growth. So we continue to be \u2013 frankly, we continue to believe that the year -- the next five years is unfolding much the way we expected when we put together our analysis three or four months ago. And if there were changes in the future, we feel like our platform gives us a number of options to continue to deliver both our 7% to 9% long-term EPS growth and the 80% of that cash back for the shareholders in the form of dividends.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. That's really helpful, Howard. I appreciate the color on that. And I do want to just clarify something about the Juul closing and when you could see the equity income falling through the P&L? Just to be clear, I mean, is there any potential that that could happen this calendar year? Or is it really going to be a 2020 event?","Billy Gifford","So Bonnie, the equity income would really be triggered by HSR approval.","Bonnie Herzog","Right.","Billy Gifford","That is when our shares move from economic or nonvoting to voting. And remember, we talked about with the Juul, we would be a one quarter lag similar to the way we are with AB InBev. So taking that into consideration it'll depend on when HSR approval comes through.","Bonnie Herzog","Understood. But then that's what I was curious about is there any update on the timing of when that is expected?","Howard Willard","Yes. I think it's hard to predict how long this HSR process might take. And I think that given that it's going to be some time that we'll be interacting with them to answer your questions and given the fact that we're going to be on a one-quarter lag. I think there's a question is to whether that would start to flow this year or whether it's likely to flow in early next year.","Bonnie Herzog","Got it.","Howard Willard","But we'll certainly keep you up-to-date on our discussions with the FTC.","Bonnie Herzog","And then just to be clear so your guidance assumes none of that flows in this year?","Howard Willard","Yes. That was our original assumptions and we communicated that at the beginning of the year that our guidance for this year really didn't include any material income contribution from either Cronos or Juul.","Bonnie Herzog","Right.","Howard Willard","And that was the assumption in our guidance and of course it turns out that -- because of the regulatory action that's highly likely to be the outcome.","Bonnie Herzog ","Okay. Then maybe one final question from me if I may just on your margins. Your smokeable margins expanded really sharply in the quarter. So hoping you could just drill down a little bit further on some of the key buckets because I think this does highlight some of the levers you have to pull. I mean, I guess, I'm assuming the earlier and larger-than-expected price increase was probably one of the key drivers there and you already touched on some of the severance agreement payments which I think also could be a nice boost to margins. But are there any other considerations? And maybe thinking about that as the year progresses, especially, as you realize more of the cost savings that you've highlighted? Thanks.","Billy Gifford","Yes. I think you touched on it the two most important especially on the short-term period like a quarter. But certainly as we progress through the year and the cost reductions ramp-up the savings associated with those certainly cost will be a factor as well.","Bonnie Herzog ","Okay. Thank you.","Billy Gifford","Thank you. ","Howard Willard","Thank you, Bonnie.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer","Thank you. Good morning. ","Howard Willard","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer","So I wanted to double back on that -- your industry volume expectations, please. Very helpful disclosure on slide 6 as you unpack the drivers. I'm looking specifically at the additional cost category movement and the evolution of that drag because 40 basis points in 2018 but 50 basis points on a trailing 12-month basis which would if my math is right imply that the -- like the one -- the first quarter drag was actually much more meaningful 70 basis points to 80 basis points am I thinking about that math right?","Billy Gifford","I think you are but I wouldn't go to a short-term period Vivien. You remember as were progressing through 2018 e-vapor was ramping-up throughout the year. And so whenever you take off the -- in a trailing 12-month, whenever you take off the first three months of course the all of those months that it's increasing through carry a heavier weight. But I think the logic you're applying to it is correct.","Vivien Azer","So that's fair Billy. But with that in mind then given that that more meaningful impact coincided with an actual sequential softening in Juul's results given the elimination of not just this brick-and-mortar retail. But how are you guys thinking about that for the full year? Because to my mind it does call into question a little bit the achievability of even the minus 4 for the category?","Billy Gifford","Yes. I tried to follow exactly what you were saying there Vivien. I think when you think about it this trailing 12-month is really just designed to kind of say look we did a long period of data to be able to break it down to these specific buckets. Then when you take out those first three months, which would have been the first quarter of the previous year when volume is ramping through the year as we talked about previously the 15% to 20% e-vapor growth across that 5-year period on the CAGR of course it's going to grow faster in the earlier period because the base is strong. So just math would say that it's -- from a CAGR standpoint it'll slow down in the later years just because the base is growing.","We feel like with the 4% to 5% it's important to remember you've got to look over in the long period. I think sometimes we tend to get wrapped up in the quarter. So just for instance last year right, first quarter cigarette industry volume is down 5.5% and we ended the year at 4.5%. So sometimes we take a quarter and try to project it out as if that's the exact way that whole year is going to play out versus allowing time to pass.","Vivien Azer","Okay. That's fair. So then can you articulate what is embedded in the 4% to 5% outlook for the full year? Is it a 50 basis point drag from cross category movement? Or is it worse than that?","Billy Gifford","Remember Vivien, when we put out a range, it's going -- each one of these is going to have a magnitude of range around it. And so we are trying to provide and be as transparent as we can in the 4% to 5%. I hate to start now saying, let's take the pieces and give the guidance on the pieces, I'd rather stick to the 4% to 5%. But know that each of these pieces have a range around them that are incorporated in the total 4% to 5% that we're providing.","Vivien Azer","Okay. That's fair. Thank you very much.","Billy Gifford","Thanks Vivien.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Howard Willard","Good morning Steve.","Steve Powers","Hey. So I guess pick up on some of the prior questions related to the FDA and the FTC. Obviously, there were some public concerns put forth by the FDA and the FDA Commissioner following the announcement of your transaction with Juul, could you expand at all on how your more recent conversations with the FDA have gone with respect to Juul? And then do those discussions have any impact at all on how the FTC may be reviewing your filing for HSR approval?","Howard Willard","Sure. I think based on our dialogue with our advisers, I think the FTC tends to make a decision based on its own analysis and apply it against the rules that its focus is on discharging. So I don't find that there's a whole lot of influence from one agency to the other. And I think ultimately, we're going to answer the questions for the FTC, and we expect them to act based on the rules that they normally use.","With regard to our dialogue with FDA, I would say that most of the dialogue we've had with FDA, and most of the interaction with FDA around Juul really starting in October has really been focused on FDA is concerned about youth usage of e-vapor products, and their encouragement of us in Juul to take actions that might help reduce youth usage of e-vapor products.","And I have to tell you that, we feel like we've taken significant actions, and frankly that Juul and I have been on the leading edge of really proactively addressing that issue. In the case of Juul, they removed their flavored products for mainstream retail outlets and you saw some impact, I think of that action in the first quarter because there was a sequential slowdown in growth overall of the category.","And I think that that is going to take I think some of the pressure off on youth usage of the products just because the category slowdown is likely to have an impact there. And I think in the short run, it is prudent to take steps even though they may impact adult cigarette smokers, if that can really help have a positive impact on driving down youth rates.","And then we also talked about what I think has been quite a gratifying pick-up in the pace moving the minimum age to purchase to 21. When we first had a dialogue with the FDA in October of last year, we expressed to them that we were committed to raising the minimum age to purchase to 21 at the Federal level. We continue to always believe that Federal activity on something like that makes it easier for retailers to manage that enforce that.","But following further communication from the FDA, we concluded that doing at it both the Federal and State level was going to get quicker action. And that was accurate, we've already had a number of bills passed. And then I'm also pleased to see that not only is it moving in a number of States, but it's now moving at the Federal level.","So I have to tell you, I'm quite gratified that we could see significantly more action, and significantly more population centers in the U.S. towards raising that age to 21. And we think that's probably the most important thing combined with effective enforcement to drive down youth usage of e-vapor products and really all tobacco products.","Steve Powers","Great. Thank you. And then secondly, I wanted to pick up on smokeless if I could. At least versus our expectations that the price and the margin realization in that business this quarter was frankly exceptional. So, anything to call out there versus your own internal expectations? And then related, I guess, any update on how you're seeing that industry segment evolve in terms of its interplay with e-vapor? Thanks so much.","Billy Gifford","Yes. I can't think of anything that I would call out. I would agree with you it's certainly an exceptional quarter for the -- that segment, and then specifically our business. I think we tried to highlight in the remarks that Copenhagen is the growth engine there. The dippers really like Copenhagen and they want to engage with that brand, and we're doing everything to reinforce that with them.","Howard Willard","Yes. I might point out that while it's certainly a good first quarter for smokeless, the profit growth is quite similar to the full year performance last year. And so I think that that's a business that they will be able to generate the kind of profit growth on a pretty regular basis.","I think with regard to interaction between smokeless and e-vapor, I think the relationship is a little bit complicated and that you will recall five years or six years ago, you had an e-vapor category that was not growing much at all, and you had a smokeless category that was growing in volume terms 5% a year. I think that was really driven by the fact that at that time smokeless was the primary place at that a lot of cigarette smokers were moving when looking to an alternative to cigarettes.","I think the step-down in the growth in the smokeless category is not so much driven by smokeless consumers switching to e-vapor, it's driven by the fact that a lot of the cigarette smokers that were switching to smokeless and driving its growth have stopped switching to smokeless. And they're more attracted to e-vapor. And that is resulted in the last two or three years of a category that's more flat to slightly down.","And at least until we see some change in cigarette smoker interest in e-vapor, I think we think this is probably a range the smokeless category will be in. Although, it's -- you're right to point out the fact that even with that kind of volume performance, it has high profit growth.","Steve Powers","All right. Great. Thanks again, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.","Gaurav Jain","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So, there's a lot of investor interest in the modern oral category. The nicotine pouch without tobacco category and here ZIN [ph] has gained a lot of share and is expanding nationally, BAT is also planning its own launch. How are you planning to pursue this opportunity?","Howard Willard","Sure. You are right to point that out. While the modern oral category is small in the U.S. today, it has certainly generated a lot of interests and I know there is further product expansion that is planned. While we are the leader in the smokeless tobacco category, we do not currently have a product in the market that participates in that modern oral. But the potential there is not lost on us. And that's an area that we've got some work underway. I don't have anything to share with you today, but I do think if you think over the next five or 10 years that could be an interesting sector.","Gaurav Jain","Again, concerning you cannot introduce new products, because of Deeming Regulations, how exactly will you go about pursuing that opportunity?","Howard Willard","Sure. I'm not going to comment further on that.","Gaurav Jain","Okay. Sure. So my next question is on cigars. Sir, can you just share what percentage of your cigar business would be impacted by the proposed flavor cigar ban if it were to go ahead? Was some part of your portfolio grandfathered? And on some others you have applications and your marketing orders as well. So any estimate of what part of your portfolio might be impacted?","Billy Gifford","Yeah. I don't have a specific answer for you as far as a percentage. I think if you think about a lot of our products similar to -- the way we treated cigarettes and smokeless a significant amount of our SKU is currently in the marketplace are not grandfathered. Meaning, we had made changes however, they are considered more of the transitional products.","So we're evaluating that bases on the proposed rules and you can certainly see all the remarks we made related to the current proposed rule. And so we'll have to see how -- if the FDA moves forward and how they move forward and any changes to the rule. And then we'll have a more specific percentage for you.","Gaurav Jain","Okay. And then \u2026","Howard Willard","I think for clarity from FDA on exactly which cigars would be impacted by the action they've propose in the preliminary rule. And I expect that based on the high volume of comments they're going to get they'll provide that greater clarity as they think about moving on to the final rule.","Gaurav Jain","Sure. Thank you. And my last question is on Juul and iQOS. So there's a theory that Juul works in high nicotine markets like the U.S. and iQOS works in low nicotine markets like Japan. Now you have interest in both these products and you are going to invest capital behind iQOS. So how do you view this theory?","Howard Willard","I would not subscribe to the theory that Juul is a better fit for some markets and that iQOS is a better fit for others. I have to tell you that we believe that both Juul and iQOS can generate quite nice consumer interest here in the U.S. And I also believe that the iQOS product is quite satisfying on both the nicotine and the taste basis for a large number of consumers that smoke traditional U.S. cigarettes.","I think that the difference between a consumer picking a Juul or an iQOS is more likely to be related to other factors that differentiate the products whether it's the form factor whether it's the taste. And I think ultimately there's room for both products to be quite successful here in the U.S.","Gaurav Jain","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Howard Willard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC.","Nik Modi","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. So just a question on price realization. Billy, Howard, maybe if you can give some context. I mean, it's been a lot higher over the last few quarters than I think has been normally the case. And so I guess there's kind of two pieces to this. One is, should we be thinking about price realization being a bigger part of the contributor to the algorithm going forward? Or is it that the loyalty rewards program that you guys are launching nationally is helping you kind of become more efficient with your promotional spend? Any clarity you can give on that will be helpful.","Howard Willard","Sure. You are right that if you go back over the last five years, price realization has typically been between 4% and 6%. And I wouldn't draw any conclusion for the year based on the first quarter, but certainly last year it was on the higher end and above that range.","I think that part of the way I might explain that is I don't know that we have not we don't have a specific target in any given year on price realization, but we are guided by the fact that we're trying to maximize profitability in our cigarette business. And beyond list price in a favorable economic environment with much better tools for tuning the effectiveness of our promotions, I think we are getting better and better every year at how to effectively spend our promotional dollars to effectively get into the consumers that need it.","And frankly to trim it with consumers that don't. And we're getting more precise at doing that on a per packing basis at below the state level and certainly on a one-to-one basis. So you have not only list prices, but you have promotional efficiency.","And then, of course, you're also pointing out that with a program like Marlboro Rewards where we're strengthening the equity and maybe without using price as a tool increasing consumer loyalty, I think that gives us more flexibility on driving profitability across the brand. So, I would say that the tools we have to manage the profitability of that brand have gotten much more sophisticated over the last three or four years.","Sunil Modi","Great. And then I guess one final question from me is can you recount how volumes kind of behaved or moved when you had several retailers kind of exit the cigarette category right? Because we're having similar situations occur across certain retailers right now. And so maybe you could just give us kind of a case study on what happened I think when CBS exited the cigarette or tobacco category a couple of years ago?","Howard Willard","Yes, I can certainly do that. What we found was that there was really no disruption in product availability for consumers. And I think it's really driven by the fact that most tobacco consumers already have a number of places that they shop where they can purchase their tobacco products and if they have a primary place that ultimately stops providing those tobacco products, they very easily shift to either another store they're ready going to or to a store down the street or around the corner.","And what we found in the last phase was that -- and I know it's the same in this period, it is not like the availability of tobacco products is such that if you have a chain that pulls out, somebody's got to drive a great distance, the availability is quite significant and people just adjust.","I will say the benefit is that you may be aware that convenience stores have been going there share of tobacco sales quite nicely up until a couple of years ago when some of that growth in the convenience store trade slowed down a bit I think partially through the advent of dollar stores.","And frankly as some trade classes and some retailers have pulled out, it's actually brought a bit of a return to growing share to the retailers that are committed to the category and I know that it's a benefit for them.","Sunil Modi","Great. Thanks Howard.","Howard Willard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Howard Willard","Hi Judy.","Judy Hong","Hi, good morning. So, I guess I wanted to go back to the industry volume questions Howard. And I guess I'm just trying to kind of reconcile a couple of things. One is on one hand you are pretty comfortable with the long-term consumption declines staying within this 4% to 5%?","On the other hand you did tick this year down albeit a little bit after one quarter. So, do you think there's just a lot of volatility and just existing -- just industry volume decline now with a lot of e-vapor issue and as the pricing strategy does maybe evolving? And if that's the case I mean how do you sort of get comfortable with that 4% to 5% long-term decline forecast for the industry?","Howard Willard","Sure. Based on the data we have available to us today, we're comfortable with our 4% to 5% forecast for this year and over the next five years. But you are right to point out that there are a number of other variables that are influencing the decline rate in the cigarette category today compared to three or four years ago.","And frankly that is why we took the step at the end of last year in providing you with both guidance and more detail on how we get to that guidance for the decline rate because it is a -- I believe it's going to be a noisier environment for measuring that.","And I think our commitment to our investors is that as we get new information we will apply that to our forecast methodology and to the approaches that we've used to forecast and if there's any adjustments we will make them.","I will raise one that I don't think causes us to -- need to make an adjustment over the long-term decline rate forecast we made of 4% to 5%. But that if we get more experience with it and if we continue to make progress, it could be something we'll be discussing probably next year which is the impact of the increased age to purchase to 21.","And as I hopefully will we end up with the federal statute that essentially raises it nationwide, there is 2% of cigarette volume today that is in that legal age to 20 segment.","I don't think there's evidence yet that we're going to get to a uniform national standard that ought to be factored in. But if we make progress on that, I do imagine we'll be talking about what impact that might have. And we don't have a lot of experience with that.","I don't think that it's going to suddenly just happen in one quarter, but it could be an influence over two years or three years. And I think as we learn about that, we would obviously make any adjustments. I have to tell you that 4% to 5% decline over a period of five years gives us a lot of opportunity to absorb that. But it is clearly a time when there are more variables that we're moving around a bit more.","Judy Hong","Yes, Got it. Appreciate that. My last question is on Juul performance. So, sequentially obviously some full interest given the flavor restrictions can you just put that performance in the context of what you expect it to be put the restriction took place? Do you think this is a bit of just a temporary situation? And do you or Juul have any kind of a forecast for how this plays out for the full year 2019 just from a Juul's line growth perspective?","Howard Willard","Yes, I don't think that the results we got in the first quarter were much of a surprise to us. I think that the withdrawal of flavors I think we knew was going to have an impact. And frankly I think that we do think that it's likely to have some help on driving down youth vaping, so I think we thought that impact was worth it.","Frankly, I wasn't surprised by the results. And I was quite -- I think I was quite pleased by the fact that the Juul in the first quarter even though the category growth slowed down that it helped share. And I think it's performing quite nicely.","Judy Hong","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Howard Willard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam Spielman","Thank you. Good morning.","Howard Willard","Hi Adam.","Adam Spielman","Hi. So several of my other questions have been asked already and I think you've already just mentioned just to clarify something I think you said rather at the end of Judy's question of succession but that -- in the first quarter, on slide 18, you've got Juul growing sequentially 3%.","And I think you said it helps to drive so it implies the whole e-vapor category was growing only about 3% in Q1 is that correct?","Howard Willard","Yeah. I think you're referring to our chart right?","Adam Spielman","Yes. And what I'm really trying to guess that is, you've given us a sequential growth for Juul and I thank you for that. But if you look to the category and when I say category of e-vapor overall, would it show the same pattern roughly? Or how we thought about?","Howard Willard","I mean, I think the -- if you're referring to chart 18, where we show you from \u2026","Adam Spielman","Yeah.","Howard Willard","\u2026first quarter of 2018 to first quarter of 2019. And we've got the volume for the overall e-vapor category we colored in Juul's performance.","Adam Spielman","Yeah.","Howard Willard","But the sequential quarterly growth numbers are actually for the total e-vapor category. And so...","Adam Spielman","Oh! I misunderstood that. Of course I thought that\u2026","Howard Willard","Yeah. The category overall on a year-over-year basis has had quite nice growth. But it has slowed down. You'll notice the slowdown really started in the fourth quarter which is when flavors were first withdrawn.","And then, it slowed down even more in the first quarter. And we don't -- we didn't provide a specific number on Juul. But as you can see from the chart Juul continued to perform quite nicely and really represented on a year-over-year basis the growth of the category.","Adam Spielman","And just to be clear the 0.44 refers to the whole category not just to Juul?","Howard Willard","That's right.","Adam Spielman","Okay. So I misunderstood it. Okay, thank you. That's very clear. And I may have missed this, but am I right, because under the service agreement you -- Juul will be able to access your database -- or markets somehow through your database and put inserts and onserts into your packs. But do you have any sense of when that's going to begin, because my impression is it hasn't yet?","Howard Willard","Yes. We -- So I think the way I would phrase it is that Juul like the other operating companies at Altria can access -- or can provide offers to customers that are on the adult tobacco consumer database.","The actual planning of those offers and the sequencing of them across our companies including Juul and the execution of them comes through Altria personnel that are in our marketing services organization.","But you are right, that that marketing services organization has added Juul to the roster of companies that can procure those services from them. And it is both direct-mail communication and it's also onserts.","You are also right, that there's been relatively light activity in the first quarter and I would expect to see more activity in quarters two, three and four and that will be both direct-mail drops and inserts in the product.","And of course we always manage, particularly with regard to the database we always manage the sequencing and the amount of mail that we send to consumers on the database. So Juul will be sequenced and with offers from our other tobacco brands.","Adam Spielman","That's really very helpful. And just one final question, can you actually -- did Juul tell you what that their plans and expectations are for the -- going forward? Or is it simply they report to you what they've done after the quarter ends?","Howard Willard","Yeah. I would say, through our Board observer, our Board observer has access to the communications that they share with the Board members.

That is driven by the fact that we haven't got an HSR approval and it probably wouldn't be appropriate.","Adam Spielman","Yeah. So that's very clear. So the follow-up question to that is, is it right to believe that the Juul's board expects, Juul volumes to accelerate in the rest of 2019?","Howard Willard","Yeah.

We are in the midst of a remarkable transformation within the tobacco industry. Once predictable the industry has become increasingly dynamic and complex and while this evolution may pose short-term challenges we believe tobacco harm reduction is a significant opportunity for the industry and adult tobacco consumers. We believe that in the next decade, non-combustible products can surpass combustibles as the preferred choice among adult tobacco consumers. We intend to lead this historic transformation with our unmatched portfolio of non-combustible products and investments. Before moving to our strong third quarter performance I'd like to provide you with our perspective on Altria's strategy and the key non combustible platforms.","Over the last two years we believe we built a business platform with the ability to deliver strong long-term results across a variety of future industry scenarios. We understood that no single product would likely satisfy all adult smokers looking for alternatives and that the regulatory environment for non-combustible products would continue to evolve.","We assessed our portfolio and believe that we have addressed gaps with investments in e-vapor and oral nicotine pouches as well as an adjacent investment in cannabis. Today we believe we have the strongest portfolio across multiple tobacco platforms and are well positioned for future growth in a rapidly evolving U.S. tobacco industry.","Turning to the key non-combustible platforms the e-vapor category faces a critical inflection point. We must address underage use while also preserving options for the more than 20 million adult smokers who are interested in less harmful tobacco products. We continue to believe that raising the legal minimum age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the Federal and state levels is the most effective action to reverse the rise in youth vaping.","Today, more than 50% of the U.S. population is governed by Tobacco 21 Laws. And while there is strong momentum behind this change, more activity is required from the federal government and remaining states to enact Tobacco 21 Laws nationally. We also want swift action from the FDA and other public health authorities to take the appropriate actions regarding flavored e-vapor products and to identify the sources of the recent vaping injuries. We believe that these actions could reset the course for the e-vapor category and preserve its long-term potential for harm reduction. We are also excited about the opportunity that heated tobacco presents to adult smokers.","Based on third-party research, approximately 40% of U.S. adult smokers have tried, but ultimately rejected e-vapor products. We believe heated tobacco could be an appealing alternative for these adult smokers. Unlike e-vapor products, these systems contain real tobacco and offer a sensorial experience closer to that of traditional cigarettes.","The IQOS Heated Tobacco System is the first and only heated tobacco product that's received pre-market authorization from the FDA and it also has a pending MRTP application. We believe that heated tobacco systems and IQOS specifically are well positioned to meet the preferences of adult smokers who are looking for, but had not found a satisfying alternative to cigarettes.","Finally, we believe that oral tobacco can provide a compelling alternative for adult smokers. In moist smokeless tobacco, we filed a modified risk application with the FDA for Copenhagen snuff based on decades of available science. Additionally, we have invested in the rapidly growing oral nicotine pouch segment which offers adult tobacco consumers convenient nicotine satisfaction. Ultimately, the adult tobacco consumer and the regulatory framework will dictate which categories grow and at what pace. We believe our broad portfolio, investments and leading capabilities position us to win in multiple future scenarios.","Turning to third quarter performance, Altria continued to deliver excellent results driven by our core tobacco businesses. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share over 10% in the third quarter with both of our core tobacco segments delivering double-digit adjusted operating company's income growth. Expanding their adjusted operating companies income margins and maintaining momentum on their leading premium brands.","The smokeable products segment delivered another remarkable quarter growing its third quarter adjusted operating companies income 12.6% and increasing its year-to-date adjusted operating companies income growth to 8.1%. Higher pricing and the impact of our cost reduction efforts more than offset lower cigarette volumes to drive income growth in both the third quarter and in the first nine months.","PM USA is pleased with Marlboro's performance with eight consecutive quarters of stability, since the end of 2017. In discount, L&M is performing in line with expectations and we are pleased with its increased profitability over time. We believe discount category dynamics continue to primarily reflect a churn between branded discount and deep discount offerings. Overall discount category retail share was flat sequentially in the quarter at 24.2% and remains in line with historical share levels.","We estimate that U.S. cigarette industry volumes declined by 5.5% in the third quarter and first nine months when adjusted for trade inventory movements, calendar differences and other factors. We continue to believe that increased adult smoker movement to e-vapor and high levels of exclusive e-vapor category usage were the primary drivers of the accelerated decline rate over the past year.","Based on our 12-month moving data, we estimate there are now 12.6 million adult vapers 21-plus as of September 2019, up from 10.3 million at the end of 2018. Importantly that growth trend coincides with the trend toward more exclusive usage in the category. According to our adult consumer tracking data, we estimate that 6 million adults 21-plus vape and do not smoke as of September 2019, which is the highest number of exclusive users since our study began in 2014.","Adult tobacco consumer movement across tobacco spaces remains highly dynamic and we will continue to monitor these trends. Over the past 12 months, U.S. cigarette industry volumes declined by an estimated 5.5% when adjusted for trade inventory movements, calendar differences, and other factors. We reaffirm our full-year 2019 U.S. cigarette industry adjusted volume decline estimates of 5% to 6%. We also maintain our 4% to 6% adjusted decline rate estimates through 2023 until more information is known about how adult tobacco consumers will respond to e-vapor category dynamics, including regulation and legislative developments.","Turning to our smokeless product segment results, USSTC is successfully executing against its strategy of maximizing income while maintaining momentum on Copenhagen over time. The smokeless product segment continued its strong 2019 performance, growing its adjusted operating companies income by 10.2% in the third quarter and 9.7% for the first nine months of 2019. Copenhagen's category-leading retail share was 24.7% for the third quarter, up one-tenth sequentially and up two-tenth versus the year ago quarter.","USSTC's smokeless volumes decreased an estimated 3% in the first nine months of the year when adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences. In the last six months smokeless industry volume decreased by an estimated 1.5%. We believe these declines reflect increasing adult tobacco consumer interests in both e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches.","In e-vapor, we participate in the category through our 35% economic investment in JUUL. We made the investment based on our belief that JUUL's product development strength, early signs of brand equity and potential to convert adult smokers set it apart from all other e-vapor products in the market. We also believe that the investment would enhance Altria's growing portfolio of noncombustible product offering.","Given the dramatic shifts in the current e-vapor regulatory and marketplace environments, we have revised our transaction assumptions. In preparing our financials this quarter, we performed a valuation analysis on our JUUL investment, which considered multiple regulatory and marketplace scenarios. In aggregate, we're now projecting lower e-vapor category volumes in the U.S. versus our original estimates, which resulted in a third quarter non-cash impairment charge of $4.5 billion related to our JUUL investment. Also factoring into this determination where other changes to our original assumptions. For example, we expect it may take longer for JUUL to realize the strong margin performance that we previously communicated.","We've also revised our estimates of JUUL's international business due to recent market development. Despite this impairment charge, we remain committed to JUUL's success. We are pleased with the recent decisions by JUUL to change leadership and we are optimistic about JUUL's focus and prioritization in key areas such as establishing industry-leading responsible practices and pursuing regulatory authorization of their products. Finally, regarding antitrust clearance, we've certified substantial compliance with the FTC's second request and we expect a resolution in the first quarter of next year.","Turning to the heated tobacco, PM USA is executing a robust marketing strategy for IQOS in the Atlanta lead market. The first US IQOS store opened in September, and has since been supplemented by additional retail touch points, including a mobile pop up unit and IQOS Corners located within select stores. We've also recently opened a second IQOS boutique in the Mall of Georgia.","Of course responsible marketing is the foundation for all our consumer interactions. IQOS is intended only for adult smokers and IQOS boutique entrants must be 21 or older. The performance of IQOS in Atlanta and other lead markets will be an important input to our future commercialization plan for the brand. The primary goals of the lead markets are to determine how best to communicate with adult smokers and how to scale our efforts. PMI's MRTP application for IQOS remains pending with the FDA and we are optimistic about the prospects of IQOS receiving this modified risk authorization. Additionally, we are encouraged that the FDA's draft PMTA rules, include a special pathway for technological changes to previously authorized products, which could support bringing newer versions of the IQOS device market.","Finally, we are excited to announce that IQOS will be expanding to Richmond, Virginia beginning next month. With an IQOS store opening in the Carytown district. Altria has a sizable employee base enrichment and deep connections with the community that could accelerate early adoption of IQOS. We also anticipate distributing heat sticks to approximately 150 retail outlets within the area and deploying a similar marketing strategy as the Atlanta lead market.","We are pleased to expand IQOS availability as an alternative to adult smokers and look forward to sharing more details in the future. In oral nicotine pouches, we are pleased to announce that the on! transaction closed during the third quarter. Now that the transaction is complete, we'd like to update you on our plans to pursue leadership in this new and fast growing category. We are focused on engaging adult tobacco consumers through both traditional retail and digital experiences. We launched a premium branded website for on! where age restricted adult tobacco consumers can explore the brand and will soon be able to purchase the product online.","We expect to begin production of on! in our Richmond manufacturing center beginning first quarter next year. In 2020, we are targeting annualized capacity of 50 million cans by mid-year and 75 million cans by year-end with additional capacity available if necessary. In addition, our strong regulatory affairs team is preparing PMTAs for the on! portfolio for the May 2020 deadline.","As a reminder, Altria owns 80% of the Helix Innovations joint venture that will commercialize on! globally. On! has a product portfolio consisting of 35 unique SKUs; seven flavor varieties across five nicotine strengths. We believe the breadth of nicotine strengths and flavors is a tremendous competitive advantage as both adult smokers and dippers can find satisfying options within the on! portfolio.","As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we continue to believe the evolution of the tobacco industry represents a significant opportunity for Altria. We marked major milestones in our transformation journey this year, including launching IQOS and completing the on! transaction. We believe that with current adult smoker trends and e-vapor disruption it's an opportune time to expand the availability of these options.","We believe that incremental investment behind our noncombustible portfolio will best position Altria for long-term industry leadership. In light of these considerations, we are replacing our long-term adjusted diluted EPS growth aspiration of 7% to 9% with a compounded annual adjusted diluted EPS growth objective of 5% to 8% for the years 2020 through 2022.","We believe this new growth objective provides us the flexibility to make investments in noncombustible offerings for the long term, generate sustainable income growth in our core tobacco businesses and return cash to shareholders through a strong dividend. We also expect to maintain our dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS during this period. We will provide specific full-year 2020 adjusted diluted EPS guidance in January when we announce our fourth quarter 2019 results.","Turning to 2019 earnings, we reaffirm our guidance for full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be in a range of $4.19 to $4.27, representing a growth rate of 5% to 7% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $3.99 in 2018. Altria's 2019 success to date can be attributed to our resilient core tobacco businesses and our talented employees. Our employee base has embraced industry disruption with focus and dedication. Our business results show what I see every day that our people propel our success and I thank them for that.","I'll now turn it over to Billy to provide more detail on our performance and other investments.","Billy Gifford","Thanks, Howard, and good morning everyone. We'll begin with additional color on our smokeable products segment. Reported domestic cigarette volume decreased 6.6% in the third quarter, primarily due to the industry's rate of decline, retail share losses and trade inventory movements, partially offset by one extra shipping day. When adjusted for calendar differences, trade inventory movements, and other factors, smokeable products segment cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 7% for the third quarter and 7.5% for the first nine months.","In the third quarter, the smokeable products segment expanded adjusted OCI margins by 4.9 percentage points to 55.3%, driven by higher pricing and lower controllable costs. In the smokeable products segment, excellent price realization reflects both pricing actions and greater efficiency and use of promotional resources, thanks to investments made in trade programs, data analytics and consumer data.","Net price realization was 9.6% in the third quarter and 8.4% for the first nine months of 2019. Marlboro's performance continues to be supported by its leading brand equity bolstered by investments in product expansion, packaging innovation, digital loyalty and trade programs. Specifically, the Marlboro's rewards program continues to resonate well with adult smokers and drive visits to Marlboro.com. Enrollment continue to grow in the third quarter and the program now has 2.5 million participants and 150 million pack codes have been entered since the program launched in January.","In cigars, volume grew 4.1% in the third quarter, outpacing the industry and Black & Mild continued its strength in the premium tip cigar segment. In the smokeless products segment, adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.5 percentage points to 71.9% in the third quarter, primarily driven by higher pricing, lower promotional investments and lower controllable costs. USSTC's third quarter retail share was 53.9%, up 0.1% sequentially and down 0.4% versus the prior year.","Turning to our alcohol assets, in wine, the premium segment continues to be highly competitive. Ste. Michelle delivered adjusted operating companies income of $16 million, down nearly 45% in the third quarter, primarily due to higher promotional investments and lower shipment volume. And in beer, adjusted earnings from our equity investment in ABI were $238 million in the third quarter, up more than 6% year-over-year, reflecting Altria's share of ABI's second quarter results.","The cannabis space remains very active and Cronos is making progress and executing against its growth strategy. Cronos closed on its acquisition of Redwood Holdings during the third quarter, which provides Cronos with a leading U.S. hemp-based products platform. Redwood manufactures and sells hemp-derived CBD and few skincare and other consumer products under the Lord Jones luxury brand name. We believe the acquisition fits well into Cronos' strategy of building differentiated brands and disruptive intellectual property. We're very excited about the future prospects of the cannabis industry and the opportunity for Cronos to position itself for long-term leadership.","Moving to our capital allocation, we continue to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. In August, we marked a 50th year of dividend increases. We are proud of our dividend growth history and remain focused on providing long-term value to shareholders through dividends. With the recent increase Altria's current annualized dividend rate is $3.36 per share, which represents an annual dividend yield of 7.3% as of October 28, 2019.","We paid $1.5 billion in dividends in the third quarter, and we still expect to complete our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of 2020. Altria's businesses generate significant cash flow. In fact, we've generally produced about $1 billion of cash annually in excess of our dividend payments, which provides flexibility to repurchase shares, finance debt maturities, and invest strategically in the business.","Our cost reduction program remains on track and we still expect to realize approximately $575 million and annualized cost savings by the end of 2019. Our savings continue to build from the second quarter into the third. And as the year progresses this offering is more -- this is offsetting more of the incremental interest expense we incurred in connection with our investments in Cronos and JUUL. As a reminder, the program includes savings from workforce reductions, third-party spending reductions, and closure of our Nu Mark operations.","With that we'll wrap up. And Howard and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available in Altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.","With that, I'll open up the question-and-answer period. Operator, do we have any questions? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take questions from the investment community first. our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Howard Willard","Hi Chris. ","Chris Growe","Hi. I just wanted to lead out with a question in relation to your new medium-term, if I can call that EPS growth outlook, and I just wanted to better understand the basis for that change and you gave some color on the call. I guess, I would just ask is your -- I assume does your 4% to 6% volume growth outlook remains the same? And then embedded within that EPS growth outlook, how much of this is about -- obviously it's become a pretty fast-changing environment in this category, a lot of new products, obviously the IQOS and on! How much of it's about investment as opposed to some varying outlook in volume or that kind of thing for your business?","Howard Willard","Sure. I think first of all, our current mid-term cigarette volume decline estimate remains the same at 4% to 6%. Although certainly, as we indicated before, if the environment changes our view of that we would update you on that in the future. I think there are a variety of reasons why we replaced our 7% to 9% EPS growth with a 5% to 8% EPS growth through 2022.","Two, that I think are worthy of calling out. First of all, I think it gives us flexibility to increase our investments over the next couple of years in expanding both IQOS and on! at a time that I think that adult tobacco consumers would be particularly interested in those products, and we could build a strong business that would contribute to EPS growth over the long term.","The second thing is that while we don't yet have the final FDA guidance on e-vapor there is certainly the possibility that the e-vapor category could see its growth rate significantly slowed down or even see the category contract in relation to that FDA guidance. And the 5% to 8% EPS growth gives us the opportunity, if necessary, to push out some of the contributions from JUUL that we expected on our equity income line beyond next year.","Chris Growe","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you for that. And then, just another question in relation to IQOS, obviously you're adding Richmond, should we expect you to continue to just methodically add new locations, or is there an idea that you have to establish some learnings in these markets and then think about expanding this to other markets. I'm just trying to get an idea of the phasing, I know we can't get exactly, but the phasing how to think about incremental locations for IQOS?","Billy Gifford","Yes, it's a great question, Chris. The way we're thinking about IQOS as we certainly want to get the learnings of the U.S. consumer and their interaction, what really resonates with them as far as the learning the product and engaging with the product. We are excited about the launch that we had in Atlanta.","We're excited about being able to expand it to Richmond. I think the pace will really matter from a standpoint of, we want to go as quick as we can. But we want to be disciplined about it and we want to garner those learning so that we're efficient when we have future expansions.","Chris Growe","Okay, thanks so much for your time.","Howard Willard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett with Jefferies.","Owen Bennett","Good morning, guys.","Howard Willard","Good morning.","Owen Bennett","And yes, just a couple of questions please. First one, I was just wondering on your volume guidance industry wise for this year, it seems as we've seen a slowdown in industry vapor volumes recently, I was just wondering, why you've not upgraded the industry guidance? And then secondly, you mentioned that you've revised some of your international growth expectations around JUUL. I was just hoping you could give a few more specifics on what has changed in terms of your international outlook for JUUL exactly? Thank you.","Howard Willard","Sure, I'll take the first question and then I'll ask Billy to comment on the second one. Our expectations for cigarette industry volume declines this year are between 5% and 6% and we're right at the midpoint of that nine months through the year. So we remain confident that the decline rate will fall within that range. I think as you pointed out the year-over-year growth rate of the e-vapor category in the third quarter slowed down a bit from the second quarter, but we don't think any impact that might have on the cigarette category is going to move us outside that range. Billy you wanted to comment on JUUL.","Billy Gifford","Sure. When you think about the international markets, I think you've seen that several countries take action on e-vapor based on what they were seeing take place in the U.S. and so we make sure we -- we make sure we factored that into the scenarios, as we were looking at the revising the assumptions.","Owen Bennett","Okay, thanks very much guys. I appreciate it.","Howard Willard","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Pam Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.","Pam Kaufman","Hi, good morning.","Howard Willard","Good morning Pam.","Pam Kaufman","Earlier this year you laid out key assumptions around JUUL's five-year outlook. Can you elaborate on how these assumptions have changed? I mean, previously, we believe that the return would exceed your 8% lock within five years. So how long do you think it will now take for JUUL to exceed this hurdle? And when do you think that JUUL can approach U.S. and international cigarette margins, and is this still a realistic target?","Billy Gifford","Yes, I think, Pamela, it's too early to update those. I think we tried to revise the assumptions. Remember, we ran a range of scenarios because we're still waiting on the FDA to issue final guidance. You'll recall that JUUL took unilateral action in the marketplace, but all of these products are still available.","So we're waiting to see what that final guidance is and see what -- how the consumer is going to be playing and what restrictions around product availability there will be, and then we can refresh those. So what we did is we ran a range of scenarios, so that we would make sure that we had accounted for the various assumptions and changes in those assumptions that could take place across a range of outcomes.","Howard Willard","And Pam, the primary drivers of the change in value of our investment in JUUL, as we laid out in the release was that we reduced our expectations for overall e-vapor category volume growth over the next several years. And obviously that impacted JUUL's volume. And we also expect that that JUUL response to slowing volume in the e-vapor category and the likely impact of the FDA final guidance, it could push out a year or two their ability to achieve the kind of margins that we talked about here in the U.S.. I think probably the most important next set of information we're looking for is to see the FDA's final guidance and how consumers react to that.","Pam Kaufman","And how do you feel about having to so materially reduce your estimate of such a large investment so quickly after being completed, and how will this experience impact your future approach to M&A versus internal investment?","Howard Willard","Sure of course, we're not pleased to have to take an impairment charge on JUUL investment. And certainly while we had a range of scenarios when we made our investment in JUUL, we did not anticipate this dramatic a change in the e-vapor category. Certainly the lung injury I think was something we had not predicted, and in the pretty dramatic potential regulatory change that may occur next year, I think it was on the extreme end of what we might have expected.","However, all that said, in the third quarter JUUL had a [48%] [ph] share of the e-vapor category in the U.S., the category, at least through the nine months to this year was growing quite dramatically with JUUL as the primary driver of that growth. And so we continue to believe, first of all, that bold action to address usage of e-vapor products is appropriate. And we encouraged bold action by FDA. But we also believe that JUUL is set up in the longer term to continue to be the winner in e-vapor.","And because of that we continue to be supportive of JUUL's business and look forward to them working through the changes in the e-vapor category and being a contributor to our equity income line going forward.","Pam Kaufman","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.","Nik Modi","Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Howard Willard","Good morning Nik.","Nik Modi","Two questions from -- good morning, Howard. Two questions. First, when you talk about the 2020 to 2022 earnings CAGR, can you help us understand the kind of the puts and takes in terms of how consistent that number will be like? Should we expect some really heavy investment period in the upfront as you kind of invest behind on! and IQOS national expansion. So any clarity around that. I'm not asking for 2020 guidance. I'm just trying to get a better sense of kind of how you think about it philosophically.","And then the second question is really helping to understand the Marlboro franchise and my understanding is that the non-promoted portion of Marlboro is actually doing very well, helped by that rewards program. So I was just hoping you can give us some context around how the Marlboro trademark is performing.","Howard Willard","Sure. Let me first answer the question around the expected consistency we would have for our annual EPS growth between 2020 and 2022. When we replaced our long-term objective with this three year objective, you'll notice we widened the range of EPS growth a bit and I think that was by design. When we established our 7% to 9% EPS growth objective it was at a time when volumes across the various tobacco categories in the U.S. were quite predictable. And there wasn't as much movement between categories and it was also at a time when our SABMiller investment didn't have near the volatility that we have with the ABI Investment.","And so I think we really felt better having a 3% range for that mid-term EPS growth objective. And I would also say that I think many of you that have invested for a long time know that we had a 7% to 9% growth aspiration, but we tended to deliver about 8% each year. I think that we purposely, I think, want the flexibility to make higher or lower investments over each of the three years based on market conditions in the U.S. market. So you might see a little bit more movement within that range and we were really looking to create that level of flexibility. I'll turn it over to Billy for the Marlboro question.","Billy Gifford","Yes. Nick. We appreciate you recognizing the strength of the Marlboro brand. First, I would applaud both the Marlboro team and data analytics team. The Marlboro team put together a great Marlboro rewards program really based on analyzing the data we have on our consumer to drive higher interaction of our Marlboro consumer with at the brand itself. And what that has allowed is with the data that we're capturing in the data analytics to be much more efficient around the use of -- and targeted with the use of promotions in the marketplace.","Nik Modi","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Gaurav Jain with Barclays.","Gaurav Jain","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Yes, I had a couple of questions, one was on the recent discussions with Philip Morris and why they were called off. And in particular, the value of your core tobacco business was around eight times PE, which would suggest that the business is on decline. So, can you help us triangulate the multiple that you put on your own tobacco business and the growth outlook that you are now offering, which is still quite a healthy growth outlook? Thank you.","Howard Willard","Thank you. I'll comment first on our breaking off negotiations for a merger with PMI. I think as we communicated at the time we thought that merger between PMI and Altria had the potential to generate significant revenue and cost synergies under the right terms. We did negotiate to try and come to terms and ultimately we were unsuccessful. And so as we communicated recently we're now very focused on our stand-alone business prospects and continue to have a partnership with PMI that we're very excited about to commercialize IQOS in the U.S.","With regard to the multiple that we ascribe to our core tobacco business, certainly people on the call are aware that the multiple that the stock prices ascribe to our overall business has come down quite dramatically over the last three years, I think partially driven by concern about the regulatory pressures here in the U.S.","We continue to believe that that our stock is undervalued. And when we look at -- when we look at the 5% to 8% mid-term EPS growth guidance, the ability to build a strong platform of noncombustible tobacco products to continue to generate income over the long term and our strong core combustible and smokeless tobacco business. We think that the stock price has significant upside. Thank you.","Gaurav Jain","Sure. And a follow-up on that. So you have valuable stakes, and particularly in ABI, which are probably not accurately reflected in the current stock price. So this discrepancy were to persist. Would you think of taking any actions to unlock the value?","Billy Gifford","Yes, thank you for the question. I think you recall, as part of that transaction, we had a lock-up. That was a five year lock up that would expire in 2021. And then after that you can expect us to go through the same analysis we did with SAB, which is to look at that capital that's allocated toward the investment, make sure it's the right choice to keep it locked up in that investment and then make decisions, the appropriate decisions at the time.","Our position on the ABI investment is that it was a great investment. It put two powerhouse breweries together. It's the first really global platform for beer in the world and we feel good about the investment, but you can expect us to go through the analysis when the lock-up expires.","Howard Willard","One thing I might add here -- one thing I might add to that is back when we were debating what to do with the SABMiller stake, one of the concerns we had was the given its low tax basis any sale at that time would have resulted in quite a significant tax bill. And as you may recall with the federal tax reform here in the U.S., I think that while we still continue to have a relatively low basis on that asset, I think that we're facing a much lower tax rate, if we ever did decide to sell that in the future.","Gaurav Jain","That's very helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen. ","Vivien Azer","Hi, good morning. ","Howard Willard","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer","So Howard, I was hoping that we could just revisit the cigarette volume outlook for the U.S. please. While I appreciate that year-to-date you're at the midpoint of your 2019 guidance, the year-to-date trends are skewing toward the more unfavorable end of your longer-term guidance. And when I look at slide 13, very helpful in your presentation. And look at the fact that the cross category movement impact has increased 5x in less than 12 months. Holding of 4% to 6% outlook suggests that not only does that not get worse, in theory, it gets a little bit better. Is that how you guys are thinking about it? Any color there would be very helpful? Thank you.","Billy Gifford","Yes, thank you for the question, Vivien. I think when you look at that, that's certainly a 12-month moving and you'll recall that when you look at the e-vapor category going from second to third, it's virtually flat. And then we have the proposed regulation that's going to hit the marketplace. So at this point, we still feel very comfortable with the 4% to 6% on that mid-term volume. And so we will certainly monitor it and keep track of it as we move forward. But this period that we're showing you on slide 13 is the period that you saw the huge growth in the e-vapor category.","Howard Willard","And Vivien, this is Howard. What I might add is that certainly we don't have the final FDA guidance and its impact on e-vapor, but I think that there is a reasonable possibility that that's going to cause a slowdown in the e-vapor category growth. And of course that will cause some of the adult cigarette smokers that otherwise might have gone to e-vapor to evaluate that decision probably differently.","We'd like to have quite robust offerings on IQOS and on! available for them. But certainly that could have an impact on the historical decline rate for cigarettes. And then I would also point out that we've had quite rapid growth in the e-vapor category starting in the third and fourth quarter of last year and through the first three quarters of this year. But that growth rate, on a year-over-year basis, had been slowing down. And I think given that there are not new e-vapor products coming into the marketplace, at least until FDA authorizations take place. We would expect that there would be a natural slowing down in the growth of e-vapor here over the next year or two. And certainly that's what happened when IQOS was introduced in Japan, and so I think you also have to factor that into the calculation.","Vivien Azer","Okay, that's helpful. Certainly the slowdown is apparent in the scanner data as well. May I -- second question is on IQOS. So have you guys established a target on when you might achieve profitability on that platform in the U.S. And the second question to that. In the near term it seems like the promotional spending is aggressive, perhaps appropriately. So, given the bundle is priced at $80, it would imply that the device itself is going for about $25. Are you guys funding that promotional investment independently? Thanks.","Speaker","Sure. So we have not communicated a timeline for when IQOS would be profit positive. And we really feel like at this point, it's a bit premature. I think we are going to learn a lot about the most efficient way to scale IQOS in markets across the country. And I think based on that learning we'll have a much better understanding of what the cost structure would be going forward.","And I would say that you are right that our level of spending in the Atlanta market is probably higher than it will be on a market basis going forward, but Atlanta is really designed for us to try a broad spectrum of tools to create awareness trial and purchase of IQOS. And then based on that learnings, we will design a more efficient less costly plan to expand it around the country. And I think that that means that it may take us few more months to start expanding it, but we think that the benefit will get an efficiency and ability to scale winning platform is well worth it.","Vivien Azer","Terrific. Thanks very much. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","Good morning.","Howard Willard","Hi Michael.","Michael Lavery","Can you just talk about your approach to how you think about the IQOS rollout? And obviously, now you've already announced a second city. But as you look ahead, how much did your learnings from Atlanta and now Richmond determine how you might adjust or update the tactics and the go-to-market approach, or does it all subscribe your thinking on the magnitude and timing of the push that you might like?","Howard Willard","Yes, I think the primary driver of our ultimate national rollout strategy and the tactics we use to cost effectively drive consumer trial awareness and purchase. The primary driver of that is going to be the results in Atlanta and now Richmond. We had enough time to revisit revised and improve the Atlanta promotional plan several times. So we feel quite good about it.","But we have no doubt that we're going to learn things in Atlanta that allow us to be much more efficient as we roll out nationally. But I would say also that given the likelihood that there is going to be some disruption in the e-vapor market we also wanted to step up the speed with which we would expand IQOS. So while we are going to learn how to best expand it nationally, we have also set aside the resources now with our 5% to 8% EPS guidance to ramp that up much more quickly on a national basis once we do learn from Atlanta.","Michael Lavery","That's helpful. And on the outlook for next year just at a very high level in broad strokes, is there some uncertainty around the speed of traction, just given that it's so earlier on the IQOS launch such that you might have several scenarios potentially in mind for how next year unfolds and could the guidance for next year possibly even be wider than your growth objective?","Howard Willard","Yes, I won't get ahead of ourselves on guidance for next year. Certainly, as I said, I think that our learnings in the Atlanta test market are going to inform the plan we have for expanding IQOS and we'll have similar learnings on which will also inform it. Although I have to tell you that that we think that the new mid-term EPS growth guidance range gives us a lot of flexibility for a variety of scenarios. But ultimately I'll leave that for January.","I do want to follow-up. I think I failed to answer one part of your question earlier, Michael, which is you are right that in Atlanta in order to encourage adult cigarette smokers to purchase the device, we are offering quite a competitive price on a bundle that includes the device and heat sticks. And that is a promotion that we're incurring the cost for. But when you look at somebody who purchases that bundle and then converts to IQOS over the course of the year, it's a relatively small investment for the significant income stream that creates.","Michael Lavery","That's helpful. Thank you. And just one last one on obviously your smokeless segment operating margins are extremely high. How does this compare and how do you see it evolving over time, if it's different already today.","Howard Willard","Yes, one of the real benefits of our participation in the nicotine pouch category with on! is that we think after a period of initial investment to build the business we think that the margins on! are likely to be similar to the kind of margins we have in the smokeless tobacco business. It shares many of the same manufacturing characteristics that we've developed on smokeless tobacco, so that could be a very high profit business going forward.","Michael Lavery","Okay. Thank you very much.","Howard Willard","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Robert Rampton with UBS. ","Robert Rampton","Good morning. Probably just three questions from me. Sorry to just labor a point, but just to be clear, when you say a 5% to 8% CAGR over three years, do you mean in any given year 5% is the floor?","Howard Willard","So our intention with that is that the base year would be 2019. And the CAGR between 2019 and 2022 would be between 5% and 8%.","Robert Rampton","Okay, that's very clear. Thank you. And then, sorry, my second question. Could you give me more color on how that underlying 5.5% evolved over the course of the quarter. Obviously the press around FDA in terms was more toward the tail-end. But we are interested to hear that how that evolved.","Howard Willard","Sure. I won't get into the details within the quarter, but I think, as you looked at that trend, obviously we had a 5.5% cigarette category decline rate, down from 6% in the second quarter. And certainly when you look at the sequential growth of e-vapor instead of picking up sequentially in the third quarter, it was largely flat from the second quarter. So I think, we'll see what happens in the fourth quarter, but I think the fourth quarter impact on e-vapor which might have some impact on cigarettes is likely to be based on what happens in the regulatory environment.","Robert Rampton","Very clear thank you. I'm sorry, my final question is so certain states have taken action on flavors earlier than [indiscernible] by the FDA. Any early indications about what that's doing to cigarette volumes and so on and so forth?","Howard Willard","I think it's fairly early days on some of those state actions and some of them I think had been held up with court challenges. So I think we'll have a much better read on that in the fourth quarter.","Robert Rampton","All right. Thank you very much.","Speaker","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi. ","Adam Spielman","Hello. Thank you. ","Howard Willard","Hi Adam.","Adam Spielman","Hi. So you said that you've already revised some of your marketing strategies in Atlanta for IQOS. I think, clearly you've already got some learnings there. And I was just wondering if you could, at a very high level, share what you have learned so far and what those changes have been in your marketing strategy? Thank you.","Howard Willard","Sure. When I referenced the fact that we had changed and improved our IQOS marketing strategy, I was really referring to the fact that we were ready to launch more than a year ago. And because the authorization of the product took longer than we had expected, our marketing team had been meeting with PMI and learning from their experiences overseas and making adjustments to improve the marketing plan. I would say that we really haven't made significant changes versus our original launch plan since the product was placed in the market.","Adam Spielman","Okay, thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry to have misunderstood, but I guess following from that when we get to the 4Q results, will you be able to give us I guess what PM has always done, which is some indication of market share for IQOS in the relevant geography. And any discussion about what you're learning. I'm quite intrigued about whether I'd like you to be able to say that you will update us on frankly how it's going in Atlanta?","Howard Willard","Certainly we're going to provide what we think is appropriate to fill you in on how we think it's improving and where we're going to go from there. We'll decide what those appropriate metrics are as we move along, but certainly we're going to give you some insight into how it's performing.","Billy Gifford","I think probably our biggest focus for the next three months or so is to measure our ability to drive awareness of the product in Atlanta to drive trial and then ultimately to deliver purchase and conversion. I think at this stage we're less focused on market share and we're more focused on some of those earlier precursors to generating market share in the market.","Adam Spielman","In a year\u2019s time what sort of market share would you say will represents a success for IQOS in Atlanta? Talking about December 2020, what would you hope to achieve by that?","Howard Willard","Yes, I'm going to hesitate to comment on that. I think that's really what we're interested in learning from the Atlanta market. What I would say is that certainly the biggest success that IQOS has had is in Japan, and I don't expect that we will achieve those levels, although that's what we're going to try and learn in Atlanta. But I do believe that when you compare to some of the PMI experiences in Western Europe, I do think we have an advantage in that we have fairly large convenience stores with modern retail and it really provides a platform to billboard the product. And we also have quite good database resources to reach out to adult tobacco consumers. So, I would say we are optimistic about the progress we can make in the U.S. versus some of PMI's markets but I'll hesitate to make a speculation.","Adam Spielman","And one final question from me and changing the subject completely, coming back to your comments about JUUL overseas, outside the U.S., you said one of the reasons you took down your assumptions overseas because -- is because some markets, let's say, India have just said we're not going to allow e-vapor. But I was wondering also if there was any evidence that in the markets where JUUL is being available, let's say Western Europe, Korea. The sales performance had been as good as you'd hoped or worse than you had sort of originally hoped, or better than you had hoped. And whether that performance in the markets where it's actually been launched affected your assumptions about -- or scenarios for international rollout of JUUL.","Howard Willard","Sure. The primary driver of the adjustment we made in the JUUL international business valuation was more driven by the overall e-vapor category situation in various countries. It was not related to individual country performance based on JUUL's early launch results. And I have to say that it's now in many, many countries, but I would say it's still quite early to assess which countries it's going to have a real success in. So it was more driven by the overall e-vapor category environment than it was specific to JUUL's performance.","Adam Spielman","Thank you very much. Thank you for my answering all my questions.","Howard Willard","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Hey, good morning. Thanks. Howard, I just wanted to take a moment and maybe revisit your opening comments surrounding the notion that the industry used to be predictable but now has become more dynamic and complex. I think we all realize that there has been significant volatility, especially in the last couple of years and that similar rate of volatility is likely to continue for some time, but is long term predictability no longer Altria's base case to the degree it might have ones been? And then how is that changing your approach to the market and the company's strategic considerations going forward? Maybe you could just elaborate a bit on that, that'll be helpful.","Howard Willard","Sure. If you go back 10 years and think about the first five-year period of the last 10 years, we had very predictable and quite high EPS growth. And the primary driver of that was with strong operating companies income growth from our MST business and from our combustible cigarette business. And the volume decline rates in cigarettes was quite consistent and while we were making some investments in other categories, they really weren't having much of an impact on the decline rate of cigarettes and that generated quite a predictable and quite a satisfying level of EPS growth.","I think that we believe that at least over the next three or four years, you could have some variability in the decline rate of the cigarette category as some of these non-combustible tobacco-product categories are launched, are invested in and start to build a larger base business. And it could take over the next three years it could take some time for the volume switching between categories to become more predictable.","And certainly, we saw an accelerated decline in the cigarette category this year. But I would point out that it was the step up in that decline was almost wholly driven by more rapid e-vapor category growth. So the good news for the long-term success of the cigarette industry in the U.S. is consumers in the U.S. are still interested in satisfying nicotine products, they are just finding a variety of different ways to satisfy -- their desire for satisfying nicotine products.","I do believe that we will enter probably a more predictable phase here, maybe in the later part of the next 10 years because I do think eventually we're going to get to the point where you've got larger and pretty well marketed on non-combustible tobacco product platforms that would include heated tobacco. I think e-vapor will get through this short-term disruption and return to a more predictable path. And then of course, oral tobacco including oral tobacco drive nicotine pouches are likely to also end up with a larger base business.","So we think in the long term, the predictability and the profit growth that was provided largely by combustible cigarettes, that can be provided in the future, but it's likely to be from a portfolio products that provide nicotine satisfaction and we believe we've built a very compelling set of brands in each of those key categories that should generate nice EPS growth over the longer term.","Steve Powers","Okay, great, thank you for that. Maybe sort of related and maybe to build on some of the earlier questions as e-vapor has come under increasing public scrutiny these past few months, I think everyone is looking for a noticeable change in trend in adjacent categories, and you've spoken a bit about that regarding smokeable demand, but do you anticipate any potential impact on smokeless as well as we think about what may or may not transpire over the next couple of quarters?","Howard Willard","Sure. I think if changes in the e-vapor growth rate are going to have an impact on other categories. I think we're more likely to see it probably in the first quarter or second quarter of next year. And I think you are right to point out that there is that growth rate changes or if the category goes through a decline next year, I would expect to see it potentially reflected in change in growth rates in combustible cigarettes, also moist smokeless tobacco.","And you might also see a more favorable volume trend for IQOS and tobacco drive nicotine pouches, are driven by two things. If there is some e-vapor consumers that find their product of choice is no longer available, they may look to other product alternatives, and then a big driver of the growth of e-vapor this year was cigarette -- adult cigarette smokers, dual using and then moving to that category. If they're not moving to vapor anymore, they're likely stay in cigarettes or move somewhere else.","Steve Powers","Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.","Howard Willard","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Petros Voulgaris with Goldman Sachs.","Petros Voulgaris","Good morning, everyone.","Howard Willard","Good morning.","Petros Voulgaris","Two questions from me. Can you give some color into how you think about the continuum of risk with respect to how you weigh the differences and the probability of removal of menthol in e-cigs versus the probability of removal of menthol in cigarettes? And I guess as a follow up, could you shed a little light into what cohorts in terms of demographics might be exhibiting a slower rate of decline with respect to cigarette shipment volumes?","Howard Willard","Sure. Let me try and address your first question, and I'll have Billy comment on your second one. I think that our expectation is that the FDA is going to provide further information on their final guidance in the e-vapor category. And I think our expectation is that that is going to impact flavored products in the e-vapor category.","We don't have any indication that that FDA is going to communicate in the near term here any further perspective on removing menthol cigarettes from the market and that would require a completely different process. It's really not under way at this point in order to support that. I really think our expectation is that in the next couple of months we're going to hear really about flavors in e-vapor.","Billy Gifford","Could I ask you to just clarify the second part of the question? I'm not sure, I completely understood it.","Petros Voulgaris","Yes, I mean I know you look at the market at 21 and over. I don't know if there is like the age group from 20 to 30 is exhibiting a different rate of decline with respect to some of the older cohorts, or how you cut it. I was wondering if you could just shed a little light into the demographics and how like there is changing dynamics within the -- and how that's impacting cigarette shipment volumes?","Billy Gifford","Yes, I don't think there is any significant skew in age cohorts for cigarette shipment volume. You'll recall, as we talk about the e-vapor category, it has certainly been more attractive to that younger age cohort, call it 21 to 39. So they are more interested in the alternative product categories to a little bit higher extent than the older adult smoker above that 39 age group. But as far as overall decline, absent and moving to other categories, we don't see any significant skew by age cohort.","Operator","Ladies and gentleman, we will now invite the media to participate in questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Angelica LaVito with CNBC.","Angelica LaVito","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask have you considered the possibility that the FDA does not authorize JUUL's PMTA?","Howard Willard","Sure. I think that with the filing date for the PMTAs moved from 2022 to May of next year, I think that creates a more challenging situation on both filing and -- filing approvable applications for all the e-vapor companies. However, I believe that JUUL is highly likely to end up filing a successful application and ultimately having their products authorized because they have a significant amount of resources applied against that task.","And I think that one of the benefits they have going for them is that within the e-vapor category the JUUL product, I think, is distinguished itself compared to other e-vapor products as having quite a significant success at convincing adult cigarette smokers to convert ultimately to exclusive use of e-vapor. And I think that's one of the things that the FDA is going to consider in debating whether or not to approve an application.","Operator","And your final question is from the line of Jennifer Maloney with Wall Street Journal.","Jennifer Maloney","Good morning. I wonder if you could share your understanding of JUUL consumers' willingness to switch flavors. The company did get to observe on how consumers reacted when they pulled many of their flavors out of retail stores last year, a lot of people switched from Mango to mint. So, based on those observations and others, what is your best projection of what may happen if their flavors are limited to tobacco only.","Howard Willard","Jennifer, thanks for the question. I have to tell you that I'm probably the wrong person to answer that question. I'm aware of the same trends that you referenced when some of their flavors, other than tobacco, menthol and mint were restricted in the marketplace. But given that we don't operate the JUUL business, I don't really have access to that kind of research. That's probably best directed toward JUUL management.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for closing comments.","Howard Willard","Thank you. To close, we believe we are the best positioned company to successfully navigate through the current tobacco environment. We have excellent profit growth and cash generation from our core tobacco businesses and we have built a diversified business platform of noncombustible products that can satisfy adult tobacco consumers and provide future profitability under many different future marketplace scenarios.

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Altria's Management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brendan McCormick, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.","Brendan McCormick","Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. I am joined this morning by Marty Barrington, Altria's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Willard, Altria's Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we will only be discussing Altria's 2013 business results for the first quarter and will not be discussing the status of tobacco litigation.  Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results, and I'll direct your attention to the forward looking and cautionary statements section at the end of our earnings release for the review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. For a detailed review of Altria's business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website, altria.com.","Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings press release, and are available on our website, in addition, comparisons discussed in this conference call are to the same prior-year period, unless otherwise stated.","As previously announced, effective January 1, 2013, Altria's reportable segments are smokable products, smokeless products and wine. In connection with this revision, results of the financial services business and the alternative products business are combined in an all other category. Prior period segment data have been recast to conform to the current period segment presentation. It gives me great pleasure to introduce Marty Barrington.","Martin J. Barrington","Thanks, Brendan. Good morning, everyone. Altria's diverse business model delivered strong financial results for the first quarter, as the company increased its adjusted diluted earnings per share by 10.2%. Higher pricing contributed to adjusted operating companies income and margin growth in all 3 of our reportable segments. Higher earnings from our equity investment in SABMiller and lower interest expense also drove adjusted EPS growth.  In the smokeable products segment, PM USA grew adjusted operating companies income and margins, while increasing retail share for both Marlboro and PM USA. PM USA continued to support Marlboro's new brand architecture, with brand-building activities that contributed to Marlboro's retail share gains for the first quarter. Earlier this year, PM USA expanded distribution of Marlboro's Southern Cut nationally. Marlboro's Southern Cut, part of the Marlboro Gold family, has a uniquely rich and smooth flavor. Each of Marlboro's product families has exciting activities planned for the year to enhance the brand's strength.","Earlier this month, PM USA received a $483 million credit against its master settlement agreement payment to the states as a result of the settlement of NPM adjustment disputes with certain states. The credit increased the smokeable products segment's reported operating companies income, but we excluded it from adjusted operating companies income.","Middleton's volume and retail share of large machine-made cigars decreased for the first quarter. The quarter was marked by heightened competitive activity, including high levels of low-priced imported machine-made cigars.","In the smokeless products segment, USSTC and PM USA increased adjusted operating companies income and margins, while growing Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share and volume. USSTC is supporting both Copenhagen and Skoal with equity building initiatives. In the first quarter, USSTC expanded Copenhagen's Southern Blend into additional states. In February, Skoal began to refresh its packaging to better reflect the brand's contemporary, premium qualities and differentiate its product offerings.","In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered strong operating companies income and margin growth by expanding distribution of its premium wines. As we've explained in the past, our tobacco operating companies remain very focused on understanding the evolving preferences of adult tobacco consumers and creating superior new products for them, and our 4 tobacco businesses: PM USA, USSTC and Middleton are making disciplined investments in innovation to expand the reach of their premium products to segments in which they are underrepresented. We applied the same disciplined approach to developing innovative tobacco products for adult consumers who are interested in alternatives to traditional tobacco products. Today, we're pleased to announce another step in our efforts to address these changing preferences.","In the second half of this year, Altria's subsidiary, Nu Mark, plans to introduce an electronic cigarette into elite market. As you know, awareness and trial of e-cigarettes have increased over the last year, a subject to which we have been devoting attention and product development resources. We believe that Nu Mark should now enter the eBay per category, and we expect to provide more detail on these plans at our Investor Day in June. Altria remains focused on cost management. Our current cost reduction program remains on track, and is expected to deliver $400 million in annualized savings versus previously planned spending by the end of 2013.","During the first quarter, Altria paid $886 million in dividends and purchased shares valued at $57 million. We're also pleased to share with you today that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $300 million share repurchase program that we expect to complete by the end of 2013.","We're pleased with Altria's results for the first quarter. Altria reaffirms that it expects its 2013 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share to increased by 6% to 9% to a range of $2.35 to $2.41 from an adjusted diluted base of $2.21 per share in 2012. Howard will now discuss Altria's business result in more detail.","Howard A. Willard","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. In the smokeable products segment, first quarter reported operating companies income increased 33.4%, largely due to PM USA's settlement of the NPM adjustment disputes with certain states and higher pricing, partially offset by lower reported shipment volume. Excluding special items, first quarter adjusted operating companies income for the smokeable products segment increased by 1.3% to $1.4 billion. Adjusted operating companies income margins increased 0.9 percentage points to 41.9%. PM USA's reported cigarette shipments decreased 5.2% for the first quarter, primarily due to the industry's rate of decline and one less shipping day, partially offset by retail share gains and changes in trade inventories. PM USA believes that the trade depleted less inventory during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. When adjusted for 1 less shipping day in trade inventories, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume was down approximately 4% for the first quarter of 2013 compared to the prior-year period. PM USA estimates that the total cigarette categories adjusted volume declined approximately 4.5% in the first quarter.","PM USA's first quarter retail share increased 0.5 share points versus the prior year as measured by its new tracking service. Marlboro grew its retail share by 0.2 percentage points and L&M drove a 0.5 percentage points share gain in discount for the first quarter. These gains were partially offset by a 0.2 percentage point share loss on other premium brands.","Cigar shipment volume decreased 16.8% for the first quarter, primarily due to retail share losses and changes in wholesale inventories. Black & Mild's retail share, as measured by its new tracking service, decreased 3.1 share points, primarily due to heightened competitive activity, including high levels of low-priced imported machined-made large cigars.","Turning to smokeless products. Reported operating companies income for this segment increased 15.6% to $222 million for the first quarter due primarily to restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2012 related to the cost-reduction program and higher pricing in volume. These factors were partially offset by higher promotional investments and unfavorable mix due to growth in products introduced in recent years at a lower popular price. Adjusted operating companies income increased 5.2% to $222 million.","USSTC and PM USA's combined reported smokeless products shipment volume increased 3.4% in the first quarter. Strong volume gains for Copenhagen were partially offset by declines for other portfolio brands. USSTC grew Copenhagen and Skoal's combined volume by 4.9%. USSTC and PM USA estimate that the smokeless products category grew by approximately 5% over the 12 months ended March 31, 2013. Adjusted smokeless products volume is difficult to estimate on a quarterly basis. However, after adjusting for changes in trade inventories in year-over-year calendar differences, USSTC and PM USA estimate that their combined 2013 first quarter adjusted smokeless products shipment volume grew to rates slightly below the 12-month category growth rate. USSTC and PM USA's combined first quarter retail share of the smokeless products category decreased 0.4 share points as measured by the new smokeless tracking service.","Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined retail share by 0.5 share points. Retail share for other brands decreased 0.9 share points. Copenhagen grew its retail share by 1.3 share points, as products introduced by Copenhagen in recent years continued to have a positive impact on the brand's retail share. Skoal's retail share declined 0.8 share points, as the brand was negatively impacted by competitive activity and Copenhagen's strong performance, partially offset by share gains for Skoal X-tra.","Ste. Michelle's reported and adjusted operating companies income of $20 million was up 33% for the first quarter, driven primarily by higher shipment volume and higher pricing. Ste. Michelle's reported shipment volume increased 9.5% for the first quarter, driven primarily by the growth of certain premium brands and the timing of the Easter holiday.","Marty and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let us cover a few housekeeping items. Keep in mind that the tobacco product pricing and retail share figures are from the new tracking services. We'll also provide you with restated figures from the first quarter of 2012 so you will be able to compare the periods. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 34% in the first quarter of 2013. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarettes was 35% in the first quarter of 2012. Marlboro's net pack price in the first quarter of 2013 was $5.79, while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.32. In the first quarter of 2012, Marlboro's net pack price was $5.71, while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.24. The cigarette discount categories retail share was 25.5% for the first quarter of 2013, unchanged versus the first quarter of 2012. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the first quarter was $1.42 per pack, up $0.01 versus the fourth quarter and up $0.05 versus the first quarter of last year.","Copenhagen's first quarter retail price was $4.07 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 37% in the first quarter of 2013. In the first quarter of 2012, Copenhagen's retail price was $4.07 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 42%. CapEx was $15 million for the first quarter, and we estimate capital expenditures for the full year will be in the range of $125 million to $150 million. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $54 million for the first quarter, and we estimate depreciation and amortization will be approximately $215 million for the full year. Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first good comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, so just in terms of the industry consumption decline in the quarter, so I think your competitors have commented on some of the factors that may have caused a little bit of a softness in terms of the industry volume. So if you could just comment on what you think is kind of driving a bit of a moderation in terms of the overall cigarette industry shipments.","Martin J. Barrington","Yes, thanks for the question. I guess I'd begin by observing, Judy, that this is best seen over time. I think to take one quarter's worth of data and to try to extrapolate too much is probably a bit dangerous. If you look over time, you'll see that the cigarette decline rate has been about 3% to 4%. Our estimate on an adjusted basis for the quarter is about 4.5%, although PM USA was less than that at about 4%, and we saw in 2012, it was about 3%. When you look at it, we don't see any big drivers in the first quarter that would argue for a sustained kind of acceleration in the volume decline. I mean, folks have pointed out various factors in quarter: the end of the payroll tax holiday, summary [ph] for the gasoline prices and other factors. So I think we'll have to see is the answer, but again, we're informed,  I think, generally, by the fact that the historical decline rate has been in that 3% to 4% zone.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of your decision to launch your own e-cigarette brand in the second half, I know we will get more details at your meeting. But just in terms of kind of why now, are you more comfortable with the potential regulatory environment for e-cigarettes? Do you think that the category is starting to have a bit more of an impact on the cigarette consumption? Or do you think that you've got kind of the product that you're really ready to go in with a differentiated positioning, just kind of rationale for why now?","Martin J. Barrington","Sure, I mean, we've observed previously that we were monitoring the category carefully, of course. It's obviously are relevant to consumers that we know quite a lot about. We have devoted significant product development work to it, and we think that for all those factors, the reason that we're announcing that will be out in the second half is we have a product and we have plans that I think will allow us to compete effectively in this area that's emerging. It's small, of course, relative to traditional tobacco products, but there's no denying that adult tobacco consumers have shown some interest in it. And so for us at Altria, that's spot-on our mission. We're about providing adult tobacco and wine consumers superior branded products, and that's our intention here, and we'll learn our way in smartly.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just lastly on pricing, so if we look that smokable, your pricing was up pretty nicely both kind of year-over-year and sequentially. So maybe if you could talk about kind of your promotional activity in the first quarter versus the year ago or the fourth quarter. And then is there any impact in terms of the cigarette -- sorry, the cigar either pricing or the volume decline that's causing the smokable pricing to be up more? Or is this really consistent with more of the cigarette pricing?","Martin J. Barrington","Yes, I mean, if you look at smokable, if you look at net effective pricing, actually, was quite nice. It was in, call it, I don't know, 4.5%, give or take, but we had a significant volume decline year-over-year for the reasons that you've asked about and pointed out and others have pointed out. So basically, it's driven by the volume. The cigar numbers, if you look at cigar shipments, obviously, year-over-year, they were distorted a bit by trade inventory factors, and we've got pretty highly competitive dynamic in the cigar space with people with bringing in kind of low-priced offshore-made product. In terms of the cigarette competitive space, I would say it's pretty much in line with what we've seen before. It's competitive out there, but it's been competitive for some time. We didn't see any particular change in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, let me ask you about your cigarette promotional activity during the quarter. Was that recalibrated at all because of the weaker volumes?","Martin J. Barrington","No, I think in line with I just said that there -- our plans, as you know, in the smokable segment, we're trying to maximize income while making sure that we're getting modest share momentum on Marlboro, and I think that's what you see play out in the quarter. If you look at Marlboro's share growth year-over-year, it's about 2\/10, and so I think we stuck pretty much to our plan, which is what we intend to do.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and then on e-cigarettes, I think it's sort of a philosophical question. It's certainly legal to advertise those products much more broadly than other tobacco products or tobacco-deprived products, including television and some of the leading brands in that category are on TV. Is that something in the current regulatory environment you'd be willing to do?","Martin J. Barrington","We're looking at all of that now is the honest answer, David. That's why we'll have more on that in June. Our intention is to do this, to do it responsibly. And of course, as you well know and everyone else who follows us knows, a lot of that will be defined by what the FDA has to say about how they intend to regulate these products. So our intention is to compete and to compete effectively. We'll work through all of those particulars","[Audio Gap]","[Technical Difficulty]","Martin J. Barrington","David, I apologize for that. We had a technical difficulty that apparently caused the line to dropout. Apologies to everyone.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No, no. No problem. I hope it wasn't something I said.","Martin J. Barrington","No. I was just about to say to you, it was nothing you said at all. I'm not quite sure where we're dropped. So let me know what you heard, and I'll try to pick back up without repeating unduly.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No, no, let me go on to a different question. I was able to hear your response with respect to e-cigarettes. The only other thing I wanted to ask was about your management of the -- your product mix within the smokeless tobacco business. Both this quarter and really all of last year, revenue growth's been pretty much in line with volume growth. You've taken list price increases, but the mix within the portfolio has really offset the net pricing, and I'm wondering is that what you envisioned and hoped for? Or can you do a little bit better? Is that -- are you overdoing some of the price positioning of your line extensions? Or is that just a function of the competitive reality in that market?","Martin J. Barrington","Yes, I wouldn't be too concerned about that. If you look at the mix of the products in smokable, they're overwhelmingly premium. We've discussed previously having to manage a brand in the size and scale of Marlboro and having some price points for people during a tough economy, so I won't repeat all of that. But the overwhelming amount of the products in the smokeless segment are premium, and that's our intention because we're trying to maximize income. I'm sorry if I said smokeless, I misspoke, I meant to say smokable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Citi.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just go back on cigarette industry volume trends. I mean, I hear you loud and clear on an unadjusted basis. It's not the end of the world, they're down 4.5%, but can you comment on the sequential trends that you saw intra-quarter, kind of month-to-month?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, again, I guess I'd go back -- I just hate to suggest that one quarter's worth of data really provide us with a lot of insight. I can tell you, Vivien, that there was a slow start in the quarter and then it got stronger as we went through the quarter for the first quarter. We obviously don't comment on intra-quarter, so that's not intended to be a comment on the second quarter. But again, it's just a cautionary note about trying to read too much into one quarter's worth of data on this.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. And do you guys have an estimate, perhaps, on potential volume impact from e-cigarette consumption in the quarter?","Martin J. Barrington","No, I think it's too small to read. It's probably -- we know there's some interest so it's probably having some effect, but it's really too small to read and extrapolate from at this time.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. And lastly, could you comment on your outlook for both state excise taxes and federal excise taxes?","Martin J. Barrington","Yes. Let's take it one at a time. In terms of state excise taxes, Howard gave you the numbers year-over-year. We're watchful, of course. There's a fair amount of activity. This is the peak time, as you know, during this period of the year when state legislatures are in. We have some activity in Massachusetts and Minnesota. There's been a proposal in California. We and others are obviously doing our best advocacy to try to persuade legislatures that that's not the way to go, as consumers are already very heavily taxed in this area. But there is a fair amount of activity in the states, and we'll have to see how she goes. If we switch to the federal excise tax, as you know, the President raised this issue in his budget proposal. We are strongly opposed to that. As you know, federal excise tax was raised 158% just a few years ago. It's incredibly disruptive. These taxes are regressive. They're unfair. And to the extent that programs are proposed that are for the benefit of everyone, we think that there are better ways to finance them than to put it on the back of adult tobacco consumers. So we'll see how it goes. It's dynamic in Washington, but we're hopeful that, that won't come to pass and we're certainly advocating against it.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And do you have a specific number in terms of your outlook for the weighted average state excise tax increase for the full year?","Martin J. Barrington","No, we don't forecast that.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have a question on your decision to enter the e-cig category. I was hoping you could give us a little more color on the process you undertook to evaluate your options for entering. And then what other options do you consider? And then could you give us some color on any test markets you've had or focus groups you've conducted for your e-cig?","Martin J. Barrington","You just don't want to wait for June, do you, Bonnie? You want me to...","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I don't. I do not...","Martin J. Barrington","I can understand and I appreciate your interest. Well, look, it always starts with the consumer, and that's where we began. Our mission, as I've just mentioned a moment ago, was to provide adult tobacco consumers with superior branded products. So we wanted to make sure we understood the consumer dynamic. And as we've discussed previously, there is some interest out there. There is some trial. The awareness is high. So we started by trying to understand those dynamics and to understand them well. And of course, you have to do product development to try to find products that are interesting to them, that are going to have interest to them, that will work in the marketplace, and that's the basic process that we follow. We have a robust center for research and development. We have robust product development capability. We have good insight into this consumer. We have great brand building capability, and so that's the process that we followed. And when we have something that meets those standards, we'll put it into a test or elite market to see if the consumer reacts to it the way we predict he or she will, and that's what we're about to do in the second half. So that's a bit of an overview, and I know it's at a high-level, but we can talk about that some more when we're ready to say more about our plans.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No, I understand. That's was really helpful, I appreciate it. And then I'd love to hear your thoughts and reaction to some of the comments made recently by Mitch Zeller while he was on a panel at the NATO show, specifically as it relates to 3 priorities: menthol, substantial equivalence and then deeming regulation on e-cig. And then I'd be curious to hear if you've had much dialogue recently with Mr. Zeller.","Martin J. Barrington","Well, we engage with the FDA regularly up-and-down the agency at the Center for Tobacco Products, and that includes at the director level, as well as with all of the staff and the various groups that work at, our strategy has been and continues to be in full compliance with the regulations that govern our businesses, as well as to engage and to try to be thoughtful and constructive about the issues that face the industry, and we did that before and we'll do that again. I wasn't particularly surprised about the topics that Mr. Zeller referred to as being his priorities because, as we all know, these are the topics that have been the subject to some discussion. The agency had said, for some time, that it was working on deeming. So I'm not surprised that he will continue to work on deeming. Substantial equivalence has been much discussed and the agency, I think, is working hard to try to move those along. So I think those are the topics we would expect, and we would expect to -- for Mr. Zeller to come in and do a professional job in accordance with the statute as did his predecessor.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then my final question is on your Marlboro Special Blend. I was hoping you could talk further about your progress you've made to narrow the relative price gap between your Special Blend line and then regular Marlboros. And as you're lowering promos on MSB, what has been the consumer reaction and then the retention?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, we won't break it out at that level of detail, but I would remind everyone what our strategy is here. Overall, for the smokable segment, because we're trying to maximize income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro, we've deployed Special Blends for the purpose of making sure we have a price point for some price-sensitive consumers in the franchise. They want to be in the Marlboro franchise. They like Marlboro, but the consumer macro economy has been hard on them. So we want to make sure that we have a place for them. You correctly referred to our strategy of -- I'll begin, I guess, with list price, reminding everyone that Marlboro sells for the same list price everywhere, and then we have different promotional platforms within the franchise and we reduced the promotions for Special Blend over time as we've been able to do that. So overall, I think we're pretty happy with how that's come together. You see continued margin growth in the smokable segment. So all in all, we're pretty happy with that. I think we've also discussed previously if and when the economy really begins to improve and get some traction and adult tobacco customers are feeling better and we have higher consumer confidence, those promotional platforms can be further modified.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had 2 questions for you. The first one, and forgive me if I missed this, but just in -- and there were some questions around promotional spending. I'm just curious, sequentially in the cigarette business if your -- if you could talk about promotional spending. Does that actually tick down in Q1 from Q4?","Martin J. Barrington","I think I'll refer to what I've said before, Chris, which is in terms of the competitive environment in the smokable segment, it's about kind of where we've been. It's competitive out there. It's been competitive and our plans take all that into account.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then I was also curious on a year-over-year comparison basis. You had a lot of new product activity in the year-ago period and heightened promotional levels. Is that at all a factor in your volume performance in the first quarter, especially with Marlboro Black launching a year ago at this time?","Martin J. Barrington","No. I don't think that's the way to see it. It looks to us like it's the industry volume performance and again, you can see that PM USA actually performed better on an adjusted basis against that volume than did the industry.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I could just ask one more and -- just there was a recent update by the FDA, the congress on -- and had some mentions and obviously discussions of modified risk tobacco products. Is that something that -- obviously, it's an opportunity for the industry. There's been no applications for an MRTP. Do you have any plans or anything you could speak about in that regard or any update on modified risk tobacco products and how PM USA or other businesses may foresee that?","Martin J. Barrington","I could certainly comment on why we supported the FDA, which included this protocol to get modified risk tobacco products approved, and we've advocated to the agency as we have for some time now. And you can see these papers on altria.com that we believe that's an important policy issue for FDA. We believe that the role of manufacturers, like ourselves, are to try to develop these products to make the case about why they should be considered for modified risk if the science and evidence supports it. And it's the agency's role to consider those applications and then communicate accurately to consumers if the case is made. And we're actually pleased that there's all this activity at FDA. It's an important component of its mission to regulate tobacco products, so we support that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philippe Buson [ph] at Mitsubishi Securities.","Unknown Analyst","2 questions if I may. The first one, you have about $1.4 billion in debt coming due on November. I'm going to assume that you will refinance that. Given the current rate environment, might you also be taking advantage to refinance some of your higher coupon debt? Or the premium at which those bond rate is just too high that you're not willing to take the hit on the P&L?","Howard A. Willard","Yes, I'd rather not talk about our future plans for that debt. Certainly, when you look at our historical pattern, in some cases, we've -- when our debt is matured, we've issued new debt, and we did do a tender refinancing last year. But I'm not in the position to share kind of what our plans are through the end of this year.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then just a follow-up on Bonnie's question with regard to e-cigarettes. As you know, one of your competitors yesterday kind of estimated that the impact of e-cigarettes on volumes for cigarettes may have been somewhere around 1%. I understand it's very early on. It's a small category. But more holistically, my question is the way that you see the category potentially evolve over time, what do you see the margin potential to be? And how do you make sure that you're going to protect the profit pool from the traditional cigarettes as there could be more cannibalization down the road?","Martin J. Barrington","Yes, I understand your question. It's just so early to make any predictions about that. I don't think I'd be giving you any help. I have replied in response to a question a bit earlier about -- it's very hard to even understand at these small numbers, the volume impact or not. So to be predicting about future rates and margins and cannibalization is just a bit ahead of where we are.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Just looking at your share repurchase pacing, you've had comfortably over $1 billion each of the last couple of years and now you've got $300 million authorization for this year plus a little bit from Q1. With the NPM cash coming in, what -- it seems like you'd be in a position to certainly do more comfortably. Is there other strategic priorities that might be on your radar instead? Or how are you thinking about the capital allocation?","Howard A. Willard","Sure. I think as you pointed out, we've done over $2 billion since 2011. And certainly, we feel good about the new $300 million program. I think to start off with how we thought about this year, obviously, the primary way we return cash to shareholders is through dividends, and the dividend was increased last August. And I think each year, we look at kind of our various cash needs and decide what the appropriate amount of share repurchase is. And I think at this point, we feel comfortable with the $300 million, but certainly, we'll keep an eye on that as the year evolves.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just looking at e-cigarettes, does today's announcement imply or suggest that you wouldn't do -- that you're only moving organically? Or would you still consider an acquisition in that space as well?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, our announcement today is that we have developed a product that we intend to launch in the second half, and we don't comment on acquisitions.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Well, okay, fair enough. And then just -- I realize you'll obviously give us a lot better detailing in June, but is that something you would consider using the Marlboro brand for? Or would it be a separate brand that you'd go to market with?","Martin J. Barrington","I know it's tempting, Michael. I'm just going to ask everybody to hold on until we roll out our plans. Good try.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to switch to cigars. I wonder if you could comment a little bit about your strategy for the cigar business. Is there a need for innovation, repositioning the brand? Can you comment on the loss at retail? Can you just give us an update on cigars?","Martin J. Barrington","Yes, it's pretty competitive out there in the cigars space. You have our strategy, which is we're trying to -- just as we are with cigarettes, we're trying to maximize income there. We have, as you know, Ann, a large percentage of the tipped segment there, and the profitability there remains pretty good. It's in the cigarillo space where we're seeing lots of competition with low-priced entries, some of which is being facilitated by these imports that Harry and I mentioned in our remarks. And so we would like to have greater exposure in the cigarillo space, but we're also mindful of trying to maximize our profitability there, and that's what the brand people are trying to work through right now. If you've been at retail and you've seen this, it's just mighty competitive on price, and we're, of course, prefer to compete on equity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Marty, you mentioned a minute ago that if the economy improves, you might consider your promotional activities. Is there any particular number that you look at when you judge the economy? Is it unemployment? Is it consumer sentiment? Or is it more a gut feeling by management how the economy is doing?","Martin J. Barrington","I would say it's a combination of a number of factors that we track closely. We certainly track unemployment. We're mindful of underemployment. I'll remind people that the labor participation rate continues to drop, which, really, if it were -- if the unemployment rate were corrected for that, unemployment would be even higher than it's -- being what's reported. Thilo, we watch housing starts pretty carefully, and that's actually a bit of an encouragement, isn't it, that housing starts are doing better than they were a year ago. We've got a number of those factors that we watch. And then, of course, we try to manage the brands to the gaps as best we can based on all those data.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then the other question I had for you, for 5 of the last 6 quarters, at least in my math, the retail price increase for Marlboro, when you exclude the impact of state excise taxes has been below the price increase that I calculate when I look at the reported numbers that you have in your income statement. Can you help me understand philosophically how this continues to -- this retail price underperformance continues to drag on like this?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, again, I'd go back to if we start with manufacturers' pricing, our pricing picked up really quite nicely. At retail, there are a number of factors that influence the average retail pack price. Some of them are our trade programs. Some of them are retailers, strategies about how they choose to compete at the C store. And what you've seen, I think during the period, that you've referenced is a number of those strategies coming to bear in the retail market. So as you know, we offer a variety of Marlboro programs, MLP, Flex, Margin Option, Orcher [ph], intended to offer retailers the opportunity to align their strategies as best they think they can with Marlboro, and I think that's -- those are the dynamics you see. Retailers have different strategies for different platforms. Indeed, for different stores, our goal is to try to offer programs that give them choices to make with respect to our business.","Operator","We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up real quick on the buyback question. I know you said $300 million is the number and you're comfortable with it. But can you just give a little color as to why you're comfortable with it? Because I think you recognize the question, which is you had a lot of buyback, you have more cash coming in and now the buyback projection's lower. So any color you can give on why would be fantastic.","Howard A. Willard","Sure. I think I hesitate to give forecasts on what we're going to use our cash flow through throughout the rest of the year, but I think it's something that we look at pretty carefully. And certainly, when you look at an 80% dividend pay out ratio, most of the cash is going out on a pre-regular basis. And I think for now, we feel that the $300 million number is the right number. Certainly, there'll be greater color as to the cash usage as the year progresses.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Citi.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to circle back on the question that Michael asked. Can you just clarify from a regulatory standpoint, is there anything that would preclude you from using an existing cigarette brand name on novel new tobacco products?","Martin J. Barrington","Well, that's a bit of a complex topic. What I was trying to convey to Michael was as we're thinking about the product that we intend to launch in the second half, Vivien, that we'll have our plans rolled out as they become more final. If -- maybe that's best handled offline. I can get Brendan or someone to walk you through the complexities of using cigarette brands in various spaces.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Brendan McCormick for closing comments.","Brendan McCormick","Thanks, everyone, for your interest in Altria.

Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's release, which is available on our website and via the Altria investor app.","Now I'll turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Altria is off to an excellent start in 2016, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 14.3% despite a tough 2015 comparison. Both the smokeable and smokeless product segments saw robust, adjusted operating companies income growth and expanded margins. Altria paid over $1.1 billion in dividends. So once again, our first quarter results illustrate the strength of our core tobacco businesses and our focus on execution.","Here are the highlights from the quarter. The smokeable products segment continued its outstanding performance with contributions across the brand portfolio. In the quarter, adjusted operating companies income grew 9.2%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, higher volume, and lower SG&A and manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher resolution expense. Cigarette industry volume declines were moderate in the quarter, supported by lower gas prices and employment and wage growth, which continued to benefit adult tobacco consumers.","PM USA's volume did even better than the industry decline rate due to modest share gains, though the growth was flattered a bit by an additional shipping day and trade inventory movements. For the quarter, PM USA's total retail share was 51.4%, up 0.3 of a percentage point. Marlboro's retail share remained at 44%, and L&M gained share in discount.","In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the more profitable tipped cigar segment continued to produce strong results. Middleton's volumes were up 8.3%. So we are very pleased with the smokeable segment's performance. PM USA's investments to maintain a vibrant Marlboro franchise and our long-term approach to the business continue to pay off.","Turning to the smokeless product segment, USSTC continues to execute against its strategies, and that produced a strong quarter. Adjusted operating companies income grew 16.7%, driven by higher net pricing and higher volume, which benefited from the national expansion of Copenhagen Mint and modest overall share gains. Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined retail share by half of a share point. Once again, Copenhagen was both the fastest-growing smokeless brand and the largest, growing its retail share by 1.1 percentage points to 32.4%.","In mid-March, USSTC expanded Copenhagen Mint nationally with a strong awareness and trial generating plan. Copenhagen Mint is rooted in Copenhagen's essence of authenticity, masculinity, and craftsmanship and allows the brand to compete in all major smokeless flavor categories. Our sales force quickly gained strong distribution, and we are receiving positive response from our trade partners.","In innovative tobacco products, Altria continues to invest in developing a leading portfolio of products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences. In e-vapor, Nu Mark continued to expand distribution of MarkTen XL as early marketplace results have been encouraging in lead markets. On the heated tobacco platform, our work with Philip Morris International on an FDA application for a modified-risk tobacco product claim remains on plan. And our teams are making excellent progress on branding and go-to-market strategies for the U.S.","Turning to beer, AB InBev and SABMiller report that they are targeting the second half of 2016 to obtain the necessary approvals needed to complete the transaction. We remain excited about the transaction and look forward to supporting the combination of these two great companies. Internally, our teams are preparing to transition our investment from SABMiller to the new combined entity, and we look forward to sharing more details about that at the appropriate time.","In late January, Altria announced a $300 million productivity initiative designed to maintain its operating companies' leadership and cost competitiveness. We've made significant progress on the program. In particular, we have completed the design and realignment of our organization.","So in summary, we are off to a strong start. We are reaffirming our guidance for 2016 full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $3.00 to $3.05, representing growth of 7% to 9% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80.","As a reminder, this guidance does not include any impact from the proposed AB InBev and SABMiller business combination, as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined.","Now I'll turn things over to Billy for more details on our performance.","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. As Marty mentioned, we saw great results across our core tobacco businesses, led by our smokeable products segment. The smokeable products segment increased adjusted OCI margins by 1.7 percentage points in the first quarter to 48.1%, due primarily to higher net pricing, higher volume, and lower SG&A and manufacturing cost, partially offset by higher resolution expense.","For the quarter, PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume increased 1.2%. After adjusting for an extra shipping day, trade inventory changes, and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume decreased approximately 0.5%. PM USA estimates that total industry cigarette volumes decreased approximately 1% in the first quarter.","In the smokeless product segment, adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.4 percentage points to 65.5%, driven principally by higher net pricing. For the quarter, USSTC reported shipment volumes grew 7.8%. After adjusting for trade inventory changes, including Copenhagen Mint pipeline volume and other factors, USSTC estimates its smokeless volume increased approximately 3%.","Both Copenhagen and Skoal grew volumes, which were partially offset by declines in other brands. USSTC estimates that smokeless industry volume grew at approximately 2.5% over the past six months.","In wine, net revenues grew 8.2%, driven by solid volume growth of 8.1%. Volume growth was primarily driven by strong performance among its core premium brands and the timing of the early Easter holiday. Ste. Michelle's operating companies income grew 3.7%, while segment margin contracted 0.9 of a percentage point to 20% due to increased costs.","In beer, Altria recorded reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $66 million, down from $134 million last year. This decrease is due to Altria's share of SABMiller pre-tax special items, primarily reflecting asset impairment charges.","Finally, we continue to make returning cash to shareholders a priority, paying over $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing $168 million in shares. As of March 31, Altria had approximately $797 million remaining in the current $1 billion share repurchase program. We continue to expect to complete the program by the end of 2016.","An important part of our strategy is to manage our strong balance sheet to deliver consistent financial performance. We are pleased to report that last month, Moody's and Standard & Poor's both upgraded Altria's long-term corporate credit rating one notch, to A3 and A-, respectively, reflecting our solid balance sheet, strong business fundamentals and the leading market positions of our businesses.","That wraps up our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference we've posted a list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items. Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the questions.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I just had two. First, with 14% EPS growth this quarter \u2013 and, Marty, I think you characterized it as a relatively tough comp versus last year, and a continuation of the volume and pricing trends that we saw last year still carrying through, did you consider taking up full year guidance, or taking up the low end of the range at all? And, what are the arguments against getting a bit more optimistic at this point in the year?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, we are 12 weeks in, I guess is the honest answer. It's a great start. The businesses are in good shape, Matt. We're very pleased with the performance. I want to congratulate the teams at Altria for the work they've done. But we're 12 weeks in, and we are always careful as we start out the year. Remember, we've also got some state excise tax threats that remain out there that we are working our way through. And so that's how I would recommend that we think about that right at this moment.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Marty. And from a legislative standpoint, there continues to be a fair amount of activity around efforts to raise the smoking age to 21 in a few states. There was a bill that didn't make it through in New Jersey, and now there's another bill in Massachusetts this week. I know it's difficult to predict how and whether these things actually go forward, but I'm just curious if you could give us a sense of what, if anything, you think the practical impact might be if a 21-plus law goes into effect in a state. Is there a tangible impact on volumes? And,is there anything underlying from a regulatory standpoint that you think is contributing to this higher level of legislative momentum?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Good question. Let me try to take, maybe, it in two pieces. One is what should be happening, and then what is happening. What should be happening, I think, is that the FDA statutes should be observed. We are all in favor of minimum age. We're the company, I've pointed out, that led the efforts to get minimum age laws in place where they weren't. But the reference point has historically been 18 years. There are a few differences in a few states. But if we look at the Master Settlement Agreement or the FDA bill itself or other reference points, it's been 18 years.","I think we can all remember that when the statute was passed by FDA, what was supposed to happen was the question was supposed to have been studied by FDA, a report filed with Congress, and then you could have a debate about whether it should be raised or not. And so that's what should happen, and we support that process as we supported the FDA bill.","Unfortunately, what's happening is we have states and localities, with all respect, that are not observing that approach. And so there are these efforts. And the efforts have taken a bit of an uptick. To dimensionalize the volume and the population, I think the population of that cohort, say 18 years to 20 years, is roughly \u2013 I don't know \u2013 call it 3% or 4%, Matt. The volume estimate, I think that I've seen one published, it's about 2.5%. So that assumes that it all happens and it all comes in at once. So obviously the impacts would be more muted over time. But I think the most important thing would be to encourage people to allow an informed debate based on science and evidence over at the Congress. And that's what our position is on it.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks for calling in, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Good morning. So, obviously, strong volumes this quarter across the board. But drilling down into smokeable and smokeless, what do you think accounts for the sequential volume acceleration versus where you were in Q4, even on the more difficult year-over-year comparisons? And how do you think your shipments compare to sell-through? In other words, was there any degree of catch-up from last quarter or any degree of selling ahead of demand in Q1? Maybe I'll just start there.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks for the questions, both. Let me separate out the categories, I think, which might be helpful for precision. Let's start with smokeable. So on a \u2013 if we look back at full year of 2015, PM USA actually grew its volume, right, by roughly 0.5%, if memory serves. And then in this quarter, Steve, what we've got is on an adjusted basis down actually 0.5%. So it's obviously well below the historical trends of 3% to 4%, but actually on a sequential basis in cigarettes, the decline has picked up a little bit, but just a little bit. I think that's the way we'd think about smokeable.","The smokeless volumes, our industry estimate is, on a six-month trailing basis, we estimate about 2.5%. That's actually relatively consistent with our estimate, I think, for the last two years if you look at it on an average basis. Our shipments were flattered a little bit, obviously, because we had the launch of Copenhagen Mint. So that's how we look at the volume. I guess what I would say is the volumes continue to be strong on both segments, and that's good for our business.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. If I shift gears a little bit \u2013 and you alluded to it in your opening prepared remarks, but there's obviously a lot of chatter and excitement around iQOS and heat-not-burn generally. Based on what you're seeing in other markets around the world and the progress that you've made yourselves here, could you just update us in a little more detail on your thinking about that platform and what a launch in the U.S. will sort of ultimately look like in terms of its cadence over time? Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks for those questions. We continue to be excited about iQOS. As you know, we will have the exclusive rights to that product in the United States. We are working on two tracks. We mentioned this, I think, in our remarks. We are working closely with PMI on the FDA application to get it approved in the United States, and hopefully approved as a reduced-harm claim. And that's an important strategic development for the category generally and certainly for Altria.","The other thing that we're doing is we're working on our branding plans and our go-to-market plans and how we intend to commercialize it in the United States. And I don't want to get ahead of the work, because we haven't announced anything yet, but I continue to be very excited about what I see. I think it's important to bring these kinds of products to the adult tobacco consumers. And I think it represents a major opportunity for FDA to work with the industry on harm reduction. So we're excited about all that.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you, Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Steve. Thanks for calling in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I just had a quick follow-on question on your guidance. Other than the potential for state excise tax increases that you mentioned, are there other factors or possible drags you're anticipating in your business over the next three quarters that you could highlight for us, since your guidance implies slower EPS growth of around 6.5% for the remainder of the year at the midpoint of your range?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure I have much to add to what I said earlier, Bonnie, which is \u2013 you know, there's no question we are off to a very good start. We're very pleased about that. The businesses are all in very good shape. We're just 12 weeks in, that's all. And we're trying to be prudent about that. That's the sum total of it, if you want to know the truth.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. No, that helps, that there's no other big headwinds that you're foreseeing. It's just being prudent at this point.","And then in terms of Marlboro, I was hoping you could give us a sense of what Marlboro volume was during the quarter, adjusted for the extra shipping day and inventory fluctuations. And I'd love to hear more color on your Marlboro app and where you're at with the rollout, as well as any incremental learnings you have gleaned from this new app in terms of consumer behavior, for instance.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. So we give reported numbers, as you know, for the brands, which are in the tables in the release. And then we try to do an adjustment at the category level. That's about all I can help you with on that.","On a more positive note, we continue to do really good work in the digital space. The Marlboro app has been very well received. We had very good cooperation with a number of our trade partners, who I'd like to thank for that. We now have the Marlboro couponing app, for example, on their platform in many places. The Marlboro coupons are being accepted in more than 100,000 retail locations. It covers about 70% of industry volume. Marlboro.com, the digital platform for age-verified adult smokers, is really doing great things. We had several promotions over on the Marlboro.com side that had some of the biggest interest that we've had in a very long time.","So everybody is working in the space. We are very proud of the teams that are doing the work on this. I think it's a terrific and a responsible way to connect with both our Marlboro smokers and competitive adult smokers. So we're very pleased about how digital is going.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one final, if I may. I was just hoping you could share your thoughts or views on the recently released Royal College of Physician report out of the UK which recommends the widespread promotion of electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation. And then it also states that e-cigs are likely to be beneficial to UK public health. So, Marty, I don't know if you've had a chance to kind of look at that, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on it if you have.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I was getting ready to take your questions this morning, Bonnie, so I did read the headline. I saw the headline. I think I'm going to read the report when I have some time later today. The headline does seem to be consistent with what many in public health are saying, which is these innovative products hold promise. And they have to be done responsibly, of course, but they do hold promise for helping adult smokers migrate to less harmful products. But I'd like to \u2013 if you can allow me, I'd like to read the report in full.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, fair. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Good to talk to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Just back on iQOS, a couple things. Could you just talk a little bit about \u2013 I know at one point, if I'm not wrong, you were talking about thinking you might have the FDA application in maybe a little earlier this year. Now it's later in the year. Are you able to work with the FDA offline ahead of that? Or can you just give some color on how the preparations look and what might be driving some of the timing?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me separate out for purposes my answer this application, then the process generally. I think that's probably the way to do it.","We remain \u2013 I think you've seen PMI say this \u2013 that I think the schedule remains for late third quarter, perhaps fourth quarter of this year, to file the application, which is consistent with, I think, what we've said before. These applications are quite voluminous. There's a lot of science and clinical \u2013 I'm sure you've been briefed on that; it's a lot of work.","I don't want to comment about talking to FDA about this application, but generally speaking, I can tell you how it works, which is when you want to have applications like this, you want to partner with FDA. And so we communicate with FDA regularly on our issues and try to get feedback from them. I think in the pharmaceutical side, for example, it's well-known that if you're going to design clinical trials, you want to go in and talk to your regulator and show them your trial protocols and get feedback on that before you go to that time and expense. So I would say generally it's working about the same way. And that's what you would expect if you're going to have a good relationship with your regulators, which is what we see.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just to follow up on that on iQOS if and when it does get into the market, would that be subject to MSA payments? And could it depend on how you brand it?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think there are some questions to be worked through there. I think at a very high level, without getting ahead of ourselves, I think if it's characterized as a cigarette, which, as you know, there's the device, and then the cigarette which is warmed, the cigarettes would be covered by the MSA. I think that's the thinking.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just one last one on the cost savings. You've got the $300 million productivity restructuring initiative. Can you give any sense of the pacing of that? You talked about how the reorganization was complete in, I think, March. Would that mean that the bulk of the savings that you expect are now on track to be realized the rest of the year?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me just start and then I'll hand it to Billy for a word of detail. Remember, the productivity initiative consists of a couple of pieces, one of which is the organizational realignment. I think that is largely completed and our organization is now really in place and going. And then there are other SG&A savings. And, Billy, you may want to say a word about that.","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Michael. We had a little bit of those savings in the first quarter, but you are correct in thinking that the majority of those savings would be progressing as we move through the year. And that was all incorporated in the guidance.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","All right, good. Perfect. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for calling, Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So on the cigarette industry, just from a competitive standpoint, it seems like the environment hasn't really changed all that much since all of the deals have happened. So just wanted to get your color on how you'd characterize the competitive environment today after all of the new contracts from your competitors have been implemented. And then, in that context, how would you characterize Marlboro's share performance? I know you look at it on a longer-term basis, but it looks like Marlboro's share has been relatively stable over the last six or seven quarters. So can you just talk to that situation?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let's start with the competitive environment. It's always competitive, and it continues to be competitive. But I think you're right that there hasn't been a marked change in that regard subsequent to some owners getting new brands. They're executing the strategies that I think they said they would execute. They are the strategies that we would expect for them to execute. And as you might expect, we have very good plans in place.","At a very high level what I would say is we have been the market leader for decades. There's a reason for that, through thick and thin, which is we have very good people, we have the leading brands and the leading positions. And so while we respect our competition, I assure you that our people are ready to compete in this new environment. We haven't seen anything that's markedly different there.","With respect to Marlboro, I'm tempted but I won't reprise the presentation that we put on in CAGNY just a few months ago about all the many strengths of Marlboro. You're right, Judy. It's modest share momentum over time, and a quarter is not over time. I think when we were talking about this several weeks ago, we looked back, and Marlboro has actually grown about two full share points if you look back from the period, call it, 2007-2008 to-date, which is terrific share performance for a brand that's as big as that.","One way to look at the competitive environment is how PM USA did in the quarter. So just to call out again a few of the highlights. It grew its income more than 9% over a tough comp. It expanded its margins. It had net pricing realization in line with the long-term trends. So it's a terrific performance despite the fact that we have a transaction and there are some new owners of new brands out there. I think that's how we'd look at it.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Billy, just a quick question on your MSA settlement cost in the quarter. It looks like it went up something like 9% on an absolute dollar basis, and your volume was up 1.2%. So it looks like per-unit costs went up more than I would have anticipated. So is that sort of the run rate number we should be using for the rest of the year? Was there anything unusual about the Q1 expense?","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks for the question, Judy. Nothing significantly unusual in that. You hit the first point, which was volume was up, so that drove it up higher. And then every year we have the inflation factor that gets topped on for the MSA. So those are the two major drivers of MSA for the quarter. But thanks for your question.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","See you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you so much for taking the question. Given your recent upgrade to A3\/A-, is there any change in your philosophy around balance sheet management and shareholder returns?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Billy?","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks for your question. No, no change in strategy or philosophy. Look, we want to maintain our investment-grade credit rating, and that's what we strive to do. We are pleased with the upgrades because we think it's recognition of the strong balance sheet that we have and the strength of the businesses. But yeah, no change in the underlying strategy.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you so much.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Chwatko of Goldman Sachs.","Gregory Chwatko - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much for the question. Maybe just following up on the credit questions. In terms of use of cash, or of the prospect of paying down some of the high coupon debt given the recent upgrade \u2013 I know you've done that previously. How are you thinking about your maturities and, in particular, the potential for enacting another tender for some of the higher coupon debt?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks for your question. Here's the way we think about it. We feel very comfortable where we're at. We always monitor market conditions and try to take advantage of market conditions. So I'm not going to commit to any future actions one way or the other, but that's the way we think about it. We are comfortable where we're at, but we do monitor the market conditions.","Gregory Chwatko - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, guys.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","A couple questions. The extra selling day, any way you can just give us the impact it had on volume et cetera?","And then the other two question is L&M, just curious, it looks it picked up some market share. Just curious if there was any discrete initiatives going on that's driving that.","And then the last question for you, Marty, is Mitch Zeller was speaking at a conference recently. Looked like he made some pretty constructive comments regarding relative risk and risk continuum. And just wanted to get your reaction and thoughts on that now that he's being a lot more vocal about the positioning of the FDA on that.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks for those, Nik. Look, we did have an extra shipping day for PM USA, so it obviously flattered the volume a little bit. We have one fewer in the fourth quarter. So, on the yearly basis, which is how we think about it, it will wash itself out.","On L&M, I would say that it's doing exactly what we want it to do. We want to have L&M participate in the declining discount segment. That industry segment continues to decline as the premium effect in the category obtains. But L&M is doing a very good job there, but we don't want to grow the discount category. And L&M is doing exactly that.","I read with interest and listened to the reports about Director Zeller. I've seen his presentation. We continue to be encouraged and optimistic that the FDA will adopt the continuum of risk with respect to products. It's the right thing for consumers. I think it's the right public policy, and it should promote innovation. This is a category in which the FDA, in our opinion, should be promoting innovation to bring new products to smokers in particular. And I thought it was great that Director Zeller went out and shared his views at the conference.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for calling, Nik.","Operator","Media representatives are now invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. Thank you.

Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release.","Now I'll turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you, Bill (01:59). Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that Altria delivered excellent performance in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2016. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.3% in the third quarter and 10.3% for the first nine months. Our core tobacco businesses delivered another quarter of strong income growth on the strength of their leading premium brands.","Marlboro maintained retail share near record levels, and Copenhagen and Skoal combined delivered yet another quarter of good volume growth and strong retail share growth. We also continue to simplify business processes, streamline infrastructure and invest in important growth initiatives.","In August, our Board raised our dividend per share by 8%, marking the fiftieth increase in the past 47 years. And in September, we further strengthened our balance sheet by tendering for high coupon debt and refinancing it with lower coupon, longer maturity debt. Most recently, with Altria's support of Anheuser-Busch InBev's landmark business combination with SABMiller, we've maximized the value of our SABMiller investment, rewarded our shareholders with an expanded and extended share repurchase program, and enhanced our position in the global brewing profit pool.","So with that backdrop, let's look at some of the operating highlights from the quarter and first nine months. The smokeable products segment produced solid third quarter results despite difficult year-over-year comparisons. The segment grew adjusted operating companies income 4.2% in the third quarter and 5.8% for the first nine months of 2016. For comparison, you'll remember that in 2015 adjusted OCI grew 11% in the third quarter and over 13% for the first nine months. The strong year-ago results were driven by several factors including the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments.","In the third quarter and for the first nine months of this year, PM USA's total retail share was 51.4%. This represents a one-tenth of a share point increase for both periods. Marlboro maintained its industry leading retail share of 44%, up one-tenth of a share point in the quarter and stable on a year-to-date basis in line with PM USA's long-term strategy to maximize income, while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro.","The smokeless products segment is executing very well against its long-term strategy to grow volume at or ahead of the category growth rate, while maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. The Smokeless Product segment grew adjusted OCI by 9.4% in the third quarter and 13.2% for the first nine months. Further, USSTC grew Copenhagen and Skoal combined retail share by 1.2 share points in the third quarter to 52.6%. It's the highest level since we acquired USSTC.","Copenhagen fueled this growth with a retail share increase of 2.7 points in the quarter, due in large part to strong consumer response to Copenhagen Mint. For the first nine months, Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share grew 1 share point to 52.2%.","In e-vapor, Nu Mark continued its disciplined rollout of MarkTen XL, optimizing its distribution while maximizing marketplace learning. As you know, FDA's final deeming regulations became effective on August 8, about which we'll say more in a moment. Nu Mark has been focused on preparing for deeming and positioning itself to succeed in the new regulatory environment. It has a pipeline of promising e-vapor products and it continues to enhance its infrastructure and systems to move those products through the required regulatory approval processes.","In the heated tobacco space, we continue to partner with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications for PMI recently announced that it remains on track to submit a modified risk tobacco product application to the FDA by the end of this year, with a pre-market tobacco product application following early next year. At Altria, we continue to make progress on our commercialization strategies for the U.S. market. We're excited about this opportunity and are working closely with PMI to incorporate insights from other iQOS markets.","Speaking of the FDA, a word of color might be useful now that the August effective date of the deeming regulations has passed. First, we're pleased to report that John Middleton and Nu Mark have taken the necessary steps to comply with the regulations, and we believe they are well-positioned to move forward with their strategies in the new environment. More generally, all tobacco products are now FDA regulated. For us and others in the industry, this means greater regulatory complexity and more resource commitment. For the agency, this also means more work and the need to make progress on the existing backlog of substantial equivalents in new product applications, particularly as it prepares for a large volume of applications for newly deemed products.","To that end, the agency now appears to be resourced and staffed, which we're seeing reflected in the increased pace of its work across all regulated segments. Our strategy continues to be to focus on complying with the requirements of the act, while engaging constructively with the FDA to urge sensible interpretations consistent with the act. We also are encouraging FDA to promote good public policy like harm reduction, and to create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation. Through this approach, we aim to maintain a constructive relationship with FDA while protecting the rights of adult tobacco consumers and other important stakeholders.","In other areas, we remain focused on simplification and cost management to improve our core businesses and invest in future growth initiatives. Today we announced plans to consolidate certain of our operating companies' manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. John Middleton will transfer its Limerick, Pennsylvania, operations to the Manufacturing Center site in Richmond, Virginia. USSTC will transfer its Franklin Park, Illinois operations to its existing factory in Nashville, Tennessee and to the Manufacturing Center site in Richmond.","Employees affected by the consolidation will be offered the opportunity to transfer into available positions, and our hope is that many of them will want to do so. For employees who do not transfer, they will be eligible for enhanced severance and benefits. We expect to complete the consolidation by the first quarter of 2018, and to deliver approximately $50 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2018 over and above the previously announced productivity initiative.","Finally, let's touch briefly on our beer investment. We are very excited that on October 10, Anheuser-Busch InBev completed its business combination with SABMiller. Following the transaction, the new combined grouped retained the name AB InBev. In connection with the closing, Altria received roughly 185 million restricted shares of AB InBev, representing a 9.6% ownership of the first truly global beer company and one of the world's largest consumer packaged goods companies. We also received approximately $5.3 billion in pre-tax cash, resulting from the terms of the partial share alternative including proration, and proceeds from the currency derivatives we entered into to hedge our British pound exposure.","As you saw, we also announced our Board's decision to expand and extend our previous $1 billion share repurchase program to $3 billion, which we expect to complete by the end of the second quarter of 2018, and Billy will say more about our investment in the combined AB InBev in a moment. As to guidance, we reaffirm this morning our 2016 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.04, representing a growth rate of 6.5% to 8.5% from a 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. Long-term, our financial goals remain unchanged.","So in summary, we had an excellent third quarter and first nine months and firmly believe that we are on track to achieve our full-year financial goals.","So with that, I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the smokeable products segment. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 1% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, partially offset by trade inventory movements. After adjusting for trade inventory movements, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined 3% in the third quarter, in line with PM USA's estimate for total industry decline rate.","For the first nine months, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined 2%, in line with the industry. As you know, we have seen a moderation in cigarette industry volume declines over the last 18 months or so, as positive macroeconomic factors have benefited the adult tobacco consumer. While some of these factors are still present, the decline rate appears to be gradually reverting back to long-term historical norms as we expected.","Smokeable segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by seven-tenths in the third quarter to 47.7%. The margin expansion was driven by higher net pricing and lower manufacturing cost, partially offset by higher resolution expenses and higher SG&A cost as a result of valid initiative spending. For the first nine months, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 1.6 percentage points to 48.6%, driven by the same factors.","Marlboro continues to innovate to maintain the brands vibrancy and relevance. Adult smokers and retailers are responding enthusiastically to Marlboro's digital engagement efforts, as Marlboro mobile coupon redemptions continue to increase in line with expectations. And recently, PM USA announced the national expansion of Marlboro Slate, a bold menthol product in the Marlboro Black family, with innovative packaging featuring soft touch ink. In cigars, Black & Mild remained the overwhelming leader in the profitable tipped segment though it lost some share overall. Middleton grew Black & Mild's reported volume by 5% in the quarter and 6.7% for the first nine months, contributing to the smokeable segment's income growth.","In the smokeless products segment, reported shipment volume increased 5.6% in the third quarter and 5.9% for the first nine months of the year. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its shipment volume grew by approximately 6% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first nine months. This growth outpaced the estimated industry volume growth of approximately 3% over the past six months.","Smokeless segment adjusted OCI margins declined slightly in the quarter, down three-tenths to 63.5%, due primarily to higher manufacturing costs and valid initiative spending. For the first nine months, adjusted OCI margins expanded 1.6 percentage points to 66.1%, primarily driven by higher net pricing partially offset by mix and higher marketing investments.","In wine, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by 8.6% in the quarter and 6.2% for the first nine months. Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volume grew 6.3% in the third quarter and 5.8% for the first nine months.","Now for a bit more detail about our beer investment. Altria's investment in SABMiller contributed $299 million in equity earnings in the third quarter and $564 million for the first nine months. After the closing of the transaction and through October 24, we used a portion of the cash proceeds to purchase approximately 12 million ordinary shares of AB InBev for a total cost of approximately $1.6 billion. Including these shares, Altria now has approximately 10.2% ownership of AB InBev. For ownership levels at or above 10%, Altria is entitled to foreign tax credits available in connection with the dividends we receive from AB InBev as we were with SABMiller previously.","As a reminder, we will use the equity method of accounting for our investment in AB InBev and we'll report Altria's share of AB InBev's results using a one quarter lag because AB InBev's results will not be available in time to record them in the concurrent period. Previously, Altria recorded results for its SABMiller investment concurrently with Altria's reporting calendar. As we wrap up our results, let me provide a few additional thoughts as we move forward.","In the fourth quarter, PM USA will have one fewer shipping day and Altria will, of course, have the impact of the AB InBev accounting lag. Beyond the fourth quarter, state excise tax increases remain an ongoing challenge. We are closely watching four ballot initiatives that will go to vote in November, including a proposed $2 per pack tax increase in California. We're actively engaged on this issue and are preparing for all potential outcomes.","That wraps up our results. Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we've posted, for your reference, a usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.","Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Investors, analysts and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Your first question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","So, I guess, just to start, even with the one quarter lag in ABI's contribution to earnings this year, your current guidance is within your long-term 7% to 9% target range. But as we look forward, I guess the question that I'm getting a lot of is, is the goal to make up for that lag as we think about fiscal 2017 and over deliver on the long-term algorithm next year, or do you want investors to think more about discontinuing 7% to 9% off the reported fiscal 2016 base? Because I think acknowledging some of the excise tax uncertainty, et cetera, smokeable trends seem very solid, both price and volume. Smokeless and wine appear strong and you seem to have a little bit more flexibility than might be usual when we think about your productivity programs and the excess cash that you have to deploy post the ABI. So can you just help us weigh those puts and takes as we think about the next 12 months to 15 months?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Steve. I can help you some and we'll be able to help you more when it's time for guidance. Listen, our long-term financial goals haven't changed. As you know, we're trying to grow long-term, 7% to 9%. That's not a guidant. That's a long-term growth aspiration. You see we've been able to do that pretty consistently about 8% over the last several years. That's basically what the model has been producing. And then as we get into each year, we look at all of the factors that we put into our guidance for a given year, and you've pointed out some factors that we're going to have to put into the guidance for 2017 given the transaction.","What I would like to communicate to investors as opposed to getting ahead of guidance before it's due is how well the businesses are performing. You're right to point out that the businesses are strong and we're doing well, but there are some puts and takes every year when you do your guidance, and we'll do that when we release our guidance in January. So that's how I would encourage investors to think about it. We'll have more to say about that in a little while.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's very fair. And then just if I zoom in on the quarter-to-quarter dynamics, especially in the smokeable segment, it looks like you finished Q3 with trade inventories a bit elevated versus what might even be considered normal alongside industry decline normalization. So I guess in that context, is it fair to assume that shipment declines, as we think about Q4, will be at least in line with consumption declines, and maybe even a bit more severe than consumption trends given those inventories and the one less selling day?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, we don't give volume guidance forward on the quarter but there was a trade inventory build in the third quarter. If you look at the housekeeping items especially, Steve, you can see that there was a bigger build there than there was for the year-ago period. And Billy's already pointed out, I think that there's going to be one fewer trade \u2013 shipping day for PM USA, so that's how I think probably about the volume for the quarter without getting into numbers.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last one if I could, and this is actually on e-vapor. And I guess it's a longer term question about how far away you may be from moving towards more automated manufacturing versus hand assembly in brands like MarkTen, and how might sort of deeming in that context impacted your path towards achieving better scale and better profitability on e-vapor over time? Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, that's an interesting question. The long-term desire, of course, is to be as efficient as you can in manufacturing, and that would include our desire to have automation for the e-vapor products that are appropriate for that. You have to get the product right before you can scale to automation. But there's no question, we've been working very hard on our cost base for the e-vapor products, and automation ultimately would help us to do that. We've got some more investing to do so I probably wouldn't expect that in the short-term but it's on our list of things to think about for sure.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes for the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So another good quarter for Marlboro in terms of your long-term aspirations from a market share perspective, but the price gap is about as low as I've seen it going back through my model, and the retail pricing growth of 1.9% was a little bit lower than we've seen over the last few quarters. So I was hoping can you just comment on some of the activity that's ongoing in retail, number one, and number two, your level of comfort with Marlboro's price gap? Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for those questions. Well I guess I'd start out by saying that it's always competitive out there and it continues to be competitive, but I don't think there's anything particularly material to call out that's different than what we've talked about already in the year. And with respect to Marlboro, we're very happy with how Marlboro is performing. We've pointed out, I think, in the remarks we just made that it's up a tenth through the third quarter and it's hovering at near record share for the year.","Our strategy in this category is to increase our income while maintaining modest share momentum. And actually, if you look at Marlboro from a share perspective, pick one period, say from 2011 forward, we've grown two share points. We look at it over time. It's doing its job and I would say it's doing its job especially well in light of the fact that we had a transaction last year and some owners got new the brands and they've obviously been working hard in the marketplace to try to advance them. So we're very happy with how Marlboro is doing.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you for that. On the ballot initiatives that you called out, obviously you guys are actively working to affect a favorable outcome, but to the extent that perhaps the California ballot measure does pass, can you give us a sense of how you think that would impact 2017 industry volumes? Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, I'm reluctant to predict that, I guess. I guess what I should say about the ballot initiatives, California's not the only one. As you know, Vivien, we're working really hard on them. We're engaging with people to try to persuade them that, that's not the right approach to do because our consumers are already very heavily taxed. There's a fair amount of volume in California, obviously, and you know the elasticities and so I think that you can work out what that would be. We remain hopeful in California but it's a challenging environment.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's fair. Thanks. And last one for me, if you could just remind us of your expectations around the timing of the iQOS submissions to the FDA? Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, they remain on track. I think we've pointed out in our release this morning, as well as in our remarks, I think that they remain on track as PMI has previously outlined, and that's the last that we have on that. And it looks just like it's go.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hey, Michael.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Just following up on iQOS. Actually, I wanted to see if you could help us understand. You say you're putting in the modified risk application first and then the PMTA. The PMTA seems a little bit \u2013 if I understand it right, maybe more straightforward or almost like a predecessor to the modified risk one. Can you help us understand how you think about the timing there?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. I actually would direct you to PMI because they're \u2013 obviously, it's their application, Michael. But I can help you a little bit which is \u2013 I think it's simply the volume of work that has to go into those two applications. As you know, they're quite voluminous in terms of the documentation and I think the sense is, if the MRTP application is ready given the timelines on those, that the thinking is to go ahead and to get it in and then swiftly follow up with the PMTA. But I think it's just the volume of work to get the two applications in. I'm not sure I would read anything particularly into that, but you could follow-up with PMI.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","No. That's helpful. That does help. And then just related to iQOS and the consolidation of the manufacturing announcement that you made. Obviously, approval is needed before you even commercialize the product, and only then, I think, would it probably make sense for you to think about production. But assuming at some point you're interested in production here in the U.S. for iQOS, do you have any sense of whether that also still has room in Richmond, or might that be a separate facility? Or is it too early to say, or just how you're thinking about how you might look ahead a little bit on that?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. It is too early to say, but I can give you a high-level strategic viewpoint which is, what we're trying to do, obviously, is to make the best use of our manufacturing footprint that we can. We have a world-class manufacturing facility here in Richmond with the MC, as you know. And to the extent that those facilities can be used for other purposes, we've been mindful of that, particularly as cigarette volume goes down.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess my first question is about your smokeless margins, which were down in the quarter. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what some of the drivers of the 30 bps decline were, especially, I guess, given the strength you had with Copenhagen, and really how you're balancing those share gains with your profitability in the business?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, Bonnie. This is Billy. I'll take that one. When you look at a shorter-term period, you can be affected by timing of spending. So I pointed out in the remarks the manufacturing cost. If you look at manufacturing costs on a year-to-date basis in the smokeless category, it's virtually flat. Again, if you look at the margins through the first nine months, they're up 1.6 percentage points. So again, in a shorter time period, you can be affected by the timing of the spending. Thanks for the question.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. And then I have another quick question for you I guess on your wine business. I was hoping you guys could drill down a little further on some of the things that are going well in that business and then maybe not so well, and then an update on your plans for this business over the next several years in terms of further investments, and if you guys plan to increase your investments whether that be organically or via acquisitions.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, thanks for the question about the wine business, which is really a terrific business and so it gives us an opportunity to call that out for our colleagues in the wine business. You've seen the numbers. It performs extremely well, they have tremendous brands and they've been growing their adjusted operating company income strongly over time. We have previously said that it is not our strategic intent to be a consolidator of the wine industry, which is, as you know, a highly fractured business.","But what we do is we provide sufficient capital to the wine company from time to time so that if they want to make a small acquisition in order to improve their business or to invest in their sales force, or to help their distribution capability and the like, we do that. And they're a very nice, if small, contributor to Altria. So I want to commend the work they do, they do a terrific job but I wouldn't want to leave anyone with the idea that we're trying to be a big consolidator in wine because we are not.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling, Bonnie.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So Marty, I guess the big elephant in the room here is the potential consolidation of rentals or the full ownership of BAT of rentals. So I know it's a little bit early and there's a lot of different scenarios that can play out but what do you think are sort of the implications for you guys as you think about both the smokeable and the e-vapor business?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. Listen, I'm sure you can appreciate. We're just not going to comment on that. It's just been announced that there's been an approach and we make a policy of not commenting on other folks' transactions. So I hope you forgive me but I'm not going to say nothing more about that.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. I forgive you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then I guess maybe switching to your cash balance. So Billy, can you just clarify the net proceeds that you've gotten as it relates to the ABI deal?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. So as Marty mentioned, with the ABI deal and the closing of the hedged positions, we got $5.3 billion in pre-tax. We'll pay the full tax burden on that, so approximately $3.5 billion net cash proceeds after-tax from the transaction.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then post the deal, you've bought another $1.6 billion additional shares. So I guess if I sort of work through the cash balance, you're probably somewhere around $4 billion, $4.5 billion at this point?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","That's correct. And then we have the tax burden that'll come out of that.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So I guess, first my question is just, I mean, it seems like it's a pretty sizable amount even considering the stepped-up buyback program that from a timing standpoint actually extends to 2018 anyway. So can you just help us frame sort of other potential uses of cash as you think about your pretty sizable cash balance that you have currently, and then obviously the cash generation that will continue to step up as you go forward?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. It's a good question, Judy, and I would just step back from that and kind of remind you how we think about capital allocation and cash follows them. So you know, we \u2013 first and foremost is the 80% dividend target payout ratio. And then after that we put that excess cash to use. You've seen us in the past do debt tenders, you saw us do a debt tender refi even this year. At times we look at our pension plan and fund it. Marty mentioned small tack-on acquisitions from time to time such as Green Smoke or small wins in wine.","So we try to put that money to use to the best use for our shareholders. In the most current period, you saw us put some of that to use managing the diverse income streams and buying additional shares in ABI. So that's the way we think about it and that's the way we put it to use.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just one clarification, the treatment of the \u2013 so the impact on the cash flow from the ABI investment, so I guess, obviously, the equity income is more from a P&L perspective but you'll get the cash benefit from the dividend. And so the treatment of the tax on that dividend, can you just help clarify the ownership threshold and how that impacts the actual cash proceeds from the dividend?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure, Judy. As you mentioned, the dividends will be unaffected. The lag that I mentioned is an accounting lag based on the recognition of the equity income. As far as the dividends received, if you own over 10% of the company, you are entitled to any foreign taxes that they paid associated with those dividends and you can take a credit for those. So being about the 10% allows us the opportunity to use foreign tax credit against those available dividends.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So it's pretty straightforward. You take the 10.2% of the dividend and then that flows completely through the P&L \u2013 to the cash flow?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Whatever dividend they declare against our share, so it's a rate per share, that's the dividends we will receive when they declare dividends. As far as foreign tax credits, it's based on what's available to be applied against the dividends that we receive.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Judy.","Operator","Our next question comes for the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi. Thank you for taking my question.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","I'd like to go back to the elephant, if I may. And I appreciate that you don't talk about other companies, but one of the things BAT said was there were benefits from being an integrated global company. And so I'm wondering just from talking about Altria, not talking about them, can you talk about the positives and also the negatives that would be involved if you were to somehow be combined with a big international tobacco company?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Adam, I very much appreciate your invitation to get me comment on it through another means, but I'm afraid I'm not going to do it. It's just not appropriate at this time. You have to indulge me, I'm sorry.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","It was about you not them, but would you \u2013 I mean, do you see any synergies in operating with another company?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Listen, those are so fact specific as to any transaction that might ever be proposed that it would just be wrong for me to start hypothesizing about that.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Fair enough. Talking about Middleton, I know it's a very small part of your business. Volumes were up quite nicely in the quarter, but you also lost a little bit of share. I was just wondering if you could talk in more detail about trends you're seeing in the large cigar market, obviously large machine-made cigar market?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I can tell you exactly how we've been thinking about it, which is at the highest level there's essentially two segments in that category, Adam. There's the tipped segment and then there's an untipped segment. And in the tipped segment, which is where the bulk of the profitability is, we are the overwhelming leader there both in terms of share and in terms of the profit pool. The untipped has been, for several years now, following a federal excise tax increase subject to very, very heavily promotions and the profit pool has been diminishing there. So our strategy is to be the leader where the profit pool is and that's in the tipped segment. So you can see that the overall share goes down a little bit, but actually in terms of our share of the profit pool, it's in the tipped segment, where we're doing great.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I just had a couple questions. First off, maybe a question to Billy. When you adjusted your EPS guidance for the accounting change in the ABI-SAB transaction, that's roughly $0.03 change that occurred, it was less than expected. I was just curious if there's anything unique that may \u2013 are you going to have several days in the quarter where you report some profit, but you won't have a full quarter's worth of profit? Is there anything unique to that calculation or the amount of profit you'll show? And if I could just add to that, I'm more interested in just how it may affect the going forward? Is there anything that would maybe take away from something in the first quarter if it helps you here in the fourth quarter, if that makes sense?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, Chris. Nothing particularly unique but you mentioned a period that we'd still own SAB in the fourth quarter. That is a true statement and we would recognize that the way we used to recognize SAB earnings. The remaining part of the quarter will be a lag, and that'll be recognized in the first quarter. But yeah, that's what we adjust the guidance for. That was what was included in there.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay. And I had a question on \u2013 as you think about the applications from Philip Morris into the FDA for iQOS or heat not burn products, and I'm just curious how you're sharing maybe in the duties, if you will, the costs associated with that? And will your costs that you bear for the eventual launch of those products, will those really pick up as the applications go into place? Are you getting quite involved in those and therefore your costs could accelerate say in Q4 and Q1?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Well, I won't get into the costs necessarily, Chris, but you're right to point out that we're working together on it. It's PMI's application, but obviously we have substantial expertise with the FDA and the FDA processes. And I would say that the teams are working together very, very nicely on the work, and there's a great deal of collaboration.","And then of course on the Altria side, what we have is our plans with respect to commercialization and branding and go-to-market and the like. And again, the collaboration between us and PMI has been very high including, as I think we've pointed out in our remarks, getting the benefits of the various learnings and their markets. And so the teams are working well together but I'm not \u2013 you'll forgive me, I just don't want to get into the cost at this time.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Sure. Thank you. And then just one quick one if I could, there was a little bit of \u2013 and if you just look at like the ending inventory for this quarter versus the period a year ago, a little bit of increase in inventory year-over-year. My question relates to \u2013 I know that always can vary, but is there anything related to these potential excise tax increases? Is that too early to be showing any inventory build that may occur prior to excise tax increases?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","I don't think there's anything remarkable to call out there. As you know, it does vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. It just looks like the trade built more inventory in the third quarter than they did in the year ago. So you've got that comparison of that I think is the honest answer.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the time.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes to the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So a couple of quick questions for you guys. Is it conceivable that we will even see iQOS in the U.S. in 2017 just given the application process? That's the first question and then I have two more.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. I guess anything's conceivable but the applications do take time, Nik. It's probably more likely to be after that.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Perfect. And then, Marty, can you remind us what happened with the California ballot initiative the last couple of times? I mean, I recall that the margins were pretty tight in terms of the vote and the ballot. Just give us a little case study on what happened the last two times if you remember?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I can do the last one for you for sure which is that you always start out behind in these things so you ask people if you want to raise cigarette taxes. Because many people don't use the products, it sounds like a good idea. You wait your campaign and what happened last time, Nik, was that the margins closed over time and it was very close. I can't remember what the exact percentage was but I believe it was less than 1 percentage point last time. And the no votes basically, I think, crossed that line late probably like the last week.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. And then the final question, I never thought I'd ask this question but just given what's going on globally and things that \u2013 almost like we're going back in history with the globalization of the tobacco industry. But philosophically, like how do you guys think about getting into non-tobacco businesses? Like I'm not talking about wine because you've made that very clear, but I'm just thinking about some of the core capabilities and competencies that you have, your expanse of distribution, footprint in C-stores. I'm just trying to get a sense, have you ever considered or do you consider ever kind of diversifying out of tobacco into other fast-moving goods?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I can tell you the model we use which is the adjacency model. You're right to point out core competencies. Our history is that this is a company that owned a lot of different businesses over time, food businesses and other businesses. And I think what we learned over time was that while we have terrific people and lots of resources, we're very, very good at the tobacco business and we know how to run it. That doesn't mean that it's the only business we could run, but you have to be disciplined about what you have to bring to the party so that you can run a business better than somebody else can run the business. So that's the model we used. We're also mindful, of course, of the margins we have and how you're going to deploy capital if you get into other businesses. So we have a highly developed model. Our business development team is consistently running scans to look for what might work, but we have to be pretty disciplined about it.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Very clear, Marty.

We're here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria's CEO and Billy Gifford, Altria's CFO to discuss Altria's 2015 third quarter and nine month business result.","Earlier today, we issued a press release regarding these results. For a detailed review, please see the earnings release on our website at altria.com or through the Altria investor app. During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2014.","Our remarks contain certain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors. Altria reports its results in accordance with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release, which is available on our website and via the Altria investor app. Now I'll turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report yet another strong quarter for Altria Group. We delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2015. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share 8.7% in the quarter and 11.5% for the year-to-date. Each of our reporting segments has contributed to our strong earnings performance, especially the smokeable product segment led by the terrific Marlboro brand.","So, let's begin there. The smokeable product segment grew adjusted operating company's income more than 11% in the third quarter and over 13% for the first 9 months. For the year-to-date, solid net price realization, the benefit from the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments and higher volume continue to support double-digit adjusted OCI growth and good margin expansion.","The industry continued to benefit from near-term moderation in cigarette volume declines, which combined with PM USA share gains, resulted in strong volume results for PM USA. Reported cigarette shipment volume for the quarter was up one-tenth of a percent. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume was unchanged in the third quarter. For the year-to-date, reported cigarette shipment volume grew 1.5%, and PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume increased approximately five-tenths of a percent versus the year-ago period. In line with strategy, Marlboro gained one-tenth of retail share in the third quarter and two-tenths for the year-to-date. So our investments in the Marlboro architecture continue to pay off, and by all key measures \u2013 OCI, margin, price realization, volume and share \u2013 our smokeable segment is performing very well.","Turning to the smokeless product segment, USSTC delivered income growth and combined retail share growth on Copenhagen and Skoal. The smokeless product segment grew adjusted OCI 2.5% in the third quarter and almost 4% for the first nine months, primarily through higher pricing, partially offset by higher promotional investments and SG&A expenses.","The iconic Copenhagen brand remained the fastest-growing brand in the category with eight-tenths of retail share growth for the first nine months of 2015. And thanks to investments in Skoal's equity and overall value equation, the brand's retail share declines continued to moderate. Our objective remains to seek combined share momentum on these two brands in this competitive category.","The wine business continued its strong performance. Ste. Michelle grew OCI almost 13% in the third quarter and nearly 20% for the year to-date, primarily through increased volume and improved premium mix. In innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continues pursuing disciplined innovation in e-vapor. We've seen encouraging trial on MarkTen XL, allowing us to expand our lead market presence. Nu Mark also continues its in-store evaluation of Green Smoke's retail positioning. We focused first on getting the product right, and we're learning a great deal about the adult tobacco consumer response. We are optimistic about these brands as we move forward.","And of course, Altria continued to return cash to shareholders. We paid approximately $3 billion in dividends in the first nine months of 2015. Additionally we raised our quarterly dividend by 8.7% in August to an annualized rate of $2.26 per share, marking our 49th dividend increase in 46 years. We remain focused on our target dividend payout ratio of 80% of adjusted diluted EPS.","So our year-to-date results have been very strong and we are happy with our progress against our full-year plans. Thus, we reaffirm that we expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $2.76 to $2.81, representing growth of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57.","This guidance reflects expected moderated EPS results in the fourth quarter as compared to last year due to several factors we've discussed previously, including lapping the benefit from the expiration of federal tobacco quota buyout payments, lapping some of the effects of a stronger economy and lower gasoline prices and a higher effective tax rate on operations. Additionally, trade inventories for cigarettes may moderate going forward and unfavorable foreign currency translation could affect prior-year comparisons of earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller.","Finally, let us provide you with a word on the proposed AB InBev combination with SABMiller. We know there is a great deal of interest in this transaction and we look forward to providing the details for us at the appropriate time. But as I hope you can appreciate, we have to wait until final terms have been reached before doing so. But until then, here's a brief update and some background on this transaction.","Earlier this month, AB InBev and SABMiller announced an agreement in principle on key terms regarding a possible transaction between the two companies. Yesterday, AB InBev and SABMiller jointly announced that the U.K. takeover panel has extended the relevant deadline until November 4, 2015. We are pleased to see this transaction moving forward and that the parties are reporting progress has been made, including AB InBev's completion of confirmatory due diligence of SABMiller, reconfirming the financial and other terms of the possible offer, and confirming the availability of financing facilities. The extension gives AB InBev and SABMiller additional time to finalize the details necessary for AB InBev to announce a firm intention to make an offer for SABMiller.","As you know, Altria has been a shareholder of SABMiller since 2002. Indeed its largest shareholder. The SABMiller stake has provided us with access to the global brewing profit pool, diversified our business, contributed nicely to our long-term earnings growth and strengthened our balance sheet. Of course, the approach we have always taken is to manage that asset for the best interest of Altria's shareholders. We believe that combining the largely complementary businesses of SAB and AB InBev to create the world's largest brewer is a compelling opportunity. So we are excited about the proposed transaction and are working constructively with the parties to complete the transaction.","And with that I'll turn things over to Billy.","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. As Marty mentioned, stronger volume in the smokeable product segment helped deliver adjusted OCI growth for the first nine months. When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that industry cigarette volume was down 1% in the third quarter, and five tenths of a percent for the first nine months.","In addition to retail share gains on Marlboro, L&M also gained share allowing PM USA's total retail share to hit 51.3% for both the quarter and first nine months. This represents an increase of four tenths of retail sharepoint and half a retail sharepoint respectively from the year-ago periods.","Cigar volume growth also contributed to the smokeable product segment's results. Middleton's reported shipment volume increased just over 1% in the third quarter and nearly 4% for the first nine months. And contributions from Black and Mild Jazz and Casino, helped Black and Mild grow its leading position in the high margin cigar segment. In fact, Black and Mild Casino was recently recognized by CSP magazine as the 2015 retailer's choice best new product in the cigar category.","In total, the smokeable product segment increases adjusted OCI margins by 2.7 points in the third quarter to 47%. For the year-to-date, adjusted OCI margins in the smokeable product segment expanded 2.8 points.","In the smokeless product segment, USSTC reported shipments increased approximately 1% in the third quarter and 2% for the first nine months. We estimate that smokeless industry volume has grown approximately 2.5% over the past six months. In both the third quarter and for the first nine months, Copenhagen and Skoal grew their retail share on a combined basis. In the third quarter, higher pricing was partially offset by higher promotional investments and SG&A expenses resulting in adjusted OCI margins contracting 1.1 percentage points to 63.8%. For the year-to-date, adjusted OCI margins narrowed one tenth of a percentage point to 64.5%.","In the wine segment, reported shipment volumes have remained robust growing at nearly 9% in the third quarter and over 6% for the first 9 months. OCI margins expanded eight tenths of a percentage point to 21.7% in the third quarter and over two points to 21.7% for the year-to-date.","Additionally, Altria reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $187 million in the third quarter, and $546 million for the year-to-date. And finally, you'll remember we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program early in the third quarter, and that our board authorized a new $1 billion program which we expect to complete by the end of 2016.","That wraps up our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to Altria.com.","Along with today's earnings release, for your reference we posted a list of quarterly metrics to include pricing, inventory and other items.","Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.","Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I have a two-part question on Marlboro. First, could you talk a little bit more about your new Marlboro line extension, Marlboro Midnight, and then how that brand will be positioned relative to the rest of the Marlboro portfolio? And then second, I'd be curious to hear more about your Marlboro app and your goals for this new technology?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for those questions. I think they both represent good examples of how Marlboro is innovating at the core of our business. We talk about innovation in the innovative product side, but it's important to remember that innovation is everywhere and boy, at Marlboro you see it all the time. So Marlboro Midnight is the latest innovation under the architecture; it will come out in the Black family. It is a unique and a bold menthol for Marlboro and should help Marlboro participate in the growing menthol category, has a very differentiated and unique pack. It's going to be supported with beautiful POS to raise awareness among adult smokers. And we'll position it as a new and exciting product in the Marlboro family, particularly for menthol smokers. So we are excited about Midnight, and I think it is off to a good start. I think it's going to hit wholesale, if I recall Bonnie, in mid-November and it'll be retail a couple of weeks after that. So you will be seeing it there.","And on the digital side, we continue to see strong innovation as well. We now have mobile couponing, as you know, that coupons can be delivered to adult smokers' smartphones. It's a tremendous step forward in terms of efficiency and meeting adult smokers where they are. That is now available nationally, and we have launched a Marlboro app. It's available on the two large app platforms, it's responsibly done, age-verified. And it will be a place for the brand to connect again with adult smokers in a very innovative way in the digital space. So we are excited about both those innovations.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, that makes a lot of sense. And then just to clarify on the app, I mean, is the goal there to increase customer engagement? And then could we also see more efficient promos and maybe a reduction in expenses because of this app rollout?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All of the above. What we are trying to do is connect the brand to its adult smokers, and the app obviously gives us another way of doing that in addition to all of the other marketing tools that the Marlboro team is doing such a good job with.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then I have a question on your smokeless business. You generated higher pricing in the business and then Copenhagen volume was strong, but margins were down a bit. So could you talk about some of the dynamics at play here, and then how sustainable this better pricing is with share gains for Copenhagen? And then Skoal still seems to be quite weak and underperforming, so any updated plans to turn this around?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me mention one or two things and then I'll ask Billy to maybe comment on the cost side. Actually, we are pretty spot-on strategy in the smokeless business, I would say. You know, our strategy there is to grow our income by growing volume in line or better, if we can, with the category, and of course the category volume has picked back up again we estimate about 2.5%. And actually you see Copenhagen and Skoal combined doing a little bit better than that at about 2.9%. Copenhagen is growing, you're right, and Skoal doesn't grow share. But I would point out that I think we've begun to moderate the share. If you look at it sequentially, it's at 19.8 share points, I think, if you look at the year-to-date number, Bonnie. And boy, I'll tell you, we're glad to have 20 share points of Skoal business in this category that has 65% operating margins.","So, Skoal can always work harder. It's got to compete with both Copenhagen and its principle competitor. But we are pretty pleased. I think they are having a solid performance over there, and maybe Billy can comment on your cost question.","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Bonnie. When you look at it, if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, you can see margins are basically flat, as Marty mentioned, right around the 65% margin base. When you look at a quarter-to-quarter comparison or a shorter period of time, you can see fluctuations based on the timing of expenses flowing through. So again, I think if you look at it on a year-to-date, the margins are very high compared to other consumer products categories and virtually flat.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, everyone.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for calling in, Bonnie.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.","Michael S. Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Michael, good morning.","Michael S. Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Could you just talk about your market share momentum a little bit? You're still getting the modest momentum on Marlboro but also a very strong lift from discount. Just how do you prioritize that or balance that? Obviously you don't want to turn away discount share, but certainly your focus has always been on Marlboro.","So, what are some of the priorities there and have you seen any sort of changes? This is the first full quarter since the competitor's transaction closed. Are you seeing any different competitive landscape? Obviously it looks like L&M is still going quite strong.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure, good questions. We have not seen any changes, to take the last part first. We do want to modestly keep momentum on Marlboro. You've heard us say this before, Michael, call it a tenth or two-tenths maybe a year, and you can see that year-to-date that is exactly where we are in Marlboro. Our focus is on premium, 90% of those shipments for PM USA are premium. But L&M has a role to play, and what it does is it competes nicely in the discount space without growing it. The industry as a whole is moving more towards premium and so what you see is that L&M is basically consolidating share out of the other discount players, so it works spot-on strategy for PM USA. That's been the strategy and that's how we are still thinking about it.","Michael S. Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on Bonnie's question about Midnight. Could you just maybe give a sense of magnitude or how maybe it compares to something like Rich Blue, which was another new extension in the menthol segment but seems to have been a little more limited in scale? Does this have any -- I think Rich Blue had a geographical like a regional focus. Is this national, or does it have any geographical focus? And is it priced similar to the rest of Black at the introductory level or does it have a different price point?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's going to be national and we'll do some special price promotions to go along with the POS so that we can promote trial. Again, in this category, where you don't have a lot of the traditional marketing tools the place where you have to meet adult smokers to let them try new products is at retail. So we'll have some price promotions there.","But basically Michael it will be the same strategy. We want them to try the brand, we want them to be aware of it, and then obviously as these brands get traction we can dial back the promotions so as to pursue our strategy of maximizing the income out of this category.","Michael S. Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","And then just in terms of scale, would this likely be a bigger opportunity than something like a Rich Blue, or can you put any context around what you might expect from it?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I won't get ahead of our skis on that except to tell you that we are very excited about the brand. I think it's a terrific product. I think the package looks fabulous, and I think it's going to be very exciting for adult menthol smokers to try, and we are hopeful of getting conversion from competitive smokers.","Michael S. Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen & Company.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","I wanted to also follow-up on the new Marlboro line extension; sorry to belabor the issue. I was just curious given that one of your competitors had to pull a couple of SKUs out of the market because the FDA did not deem them to be substantially equivalent. Whether this is innovation that is already grandfathered in or was marketed as a different Marlboro variant and is being transitioned from a tracking perspective?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I don't want to get too tactical how we bring our products to market under the FDA regime, but we are confident that we are fully qualified to bring that product to market.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, fair enough. On the inventory levels, obviously like the market share momentum has been good and easing industry volumes are certainly, I think, helping, but as I look across your wholesale inventories they've been growing sequentially for about five quarters now. So I'm just curious to hear your thoughts on kind of what the right level of wholesale inventories is as we think about the central unwind in the fourth-quarter.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well they go up and down over the course of the year. They usually smooth out for us over the course of the year for PM USA. We do have this trend this year of course where the volume declines have not been proceeding at the same pace as before, so there has been probably a little bit of disruption there. You know Vivien, if you look at the quarterly comparisons in Q3 there is not much to say about that. They look to have about the same effect. But you're right, they are a little bit higher at the end of Q3 than they were at the end of Q3 last year. So that is why we've called out in our release and also in our script that they may moderate in the fourth-quarter.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thank you. And Billy just one for you. I recognize currency has been a challenge for a lot of multinationals for quite some time. So as I look at the SABMiller numbers this quarter, in isolation I appreciate the drag from currency, but as I look across prior quarters, it feels like kind of there was like a currency catch-up or \u2013 I'm just having a hard time understanding why there was such a big hit this quarter than we hadn't been seeing given where the dollar has been trending for over a year now.","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Thanks for the question Vivien. I think you have to step back first and just put in context the overall Altria enterprise. When you think about the earning streams we have, we have very limited impact to foreign currency exposure. Specific to SAB, you're right, the primary driver there is foreign currency, and it is really the strengthening of the dollar against their various emerging market currencies as well as currencies around the world. That is something that we have experienced year-to-date as well as in the third quarter, and I think it is very reminiscence of what you're seeing with other global companies.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","But nothing in particular to call out in 3Q for SABMiller?","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","Nothing in particular, no.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett with Nomura.","Owen M. Bennett - Nomura International Plc","Good morning, guys.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Owen.","Owen M. Bennett - Nomura International Plc","Hey, I just wanted to get your views on the cigarette industry volumes for the year. Obviously, a bit of a slowdown into the second half which you said was to be expected, but I was just wondering your views on how you see volumes for the full year now?","And then also you noted the stabilization in smokeless industry volumes, now which is encouraging. I was just wondering how you see the smokeless category trending from here.","Thanks a lot.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks for the questions. So year-to-date our estimate of industry volume decline is down a half. That obviously is a difference from what the historical trend has been of somewhere between 3% to 4%, and we'll just have to see going forward what the effect is going to be. But historically, the long-term trend is more like 3% to 4% on the smokeable side.","On the smokeless side, several years ago, they were growing at, the industry volume was growing at 5-ish%. Then it fell basically to nothing and now we're trending back up, where our estimate for the latest six months is about 2.5%.","So it's good news that the volume has come back into the category. And probably the principle driver there is that tobacco consumers continue to try different tobacco products throughout the categories. That probably explains the greatest part of the change in the volume trend there. But we're glad that the volumes are back.","Owen M. Bennett - Nomura International Plc","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the call, Owen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Judy. Welcome.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, Billy, I actually do want to go back to Vivien's questions about the equity income because I still can't reconcile why the third quarter was down so much more than what we had been seeing in the first half of the year. So, it just doesn't seem to kind of jive with the first half. You were down I think in the low single digits on a year-over-year basis, and then in the third quarter that drop-off was much more significant. So I know there is a little bit of a sensitivity around what you can say about that performance, but just anything that we should be aware of just in terms of the third quarter impact?","William F. Gifford - Chief Financial Officer","No, Judy. I basically would reiterate what I said to Vivien. I think when you look at it, it really is primarily driven by the currency impacts that you see in other global companies. Any time you look at a short-term period, you're going to see those fluctuations through time. I think if you look at it over the long term it is very similar to what you're seeing with other global companies with currency impacts. But thanks for the question.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then maybe just in terms of fourth quarter guidance, and I know you talked about the comparison getting a little bit tougher. Obviously the FX it sounds like it's going to be another drag in terms of the fourth quarter. If I just looked at your smokeable segment in the fourth quarter last year, though, it doesn't look like the profitability comparisons are that much tougher. So, is this really more of an FX issue? Are any other investments that we should be thinking about in the fourth quarter, if you do get some volume upside that potentially you're looking to reinvest back the upside into any of those initiatives?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I wouldn't read that into what we said. Honestly, the factors that we think are going to cause the moderation are called out in the release and in our remarks this morning. We are lapping a very significant effect from the quota, and we believe that even though the adult tobacco consumer is doing much better we are lapping the period where they got the effect towards the back end of last year in terms of gasoline prices and the like. So it's nothing more than that.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Matt.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. So two questions. First, I wanted to come back to smokeless. And I guess the level of net pricing was a bit higher than what we have seen recently, both in absolute terms and on a year-on-year basis. And this sort of comes against the backdrop of still somewhat choppy category growth, and we've talked in the past about the factors playing into that. I'm fishing a little bit here, but has there been any shift in the way you're thinking about that balance between volume and pricing realization in that business over the near term?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, the strategy remains the same. When I look at the pricing, it's up on a per-can basis about 3% call it for the quarter. But actually if you look at it year-to-date, Matt, it's about 2%, 1.9% or something. So naturally we're happy to have the pricing there but with a category with 65% operating margins and where we've got more than 50% of the share, we are trying to grow income principally through volume gains.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Marty. And two questions on vapor. One, we've seen more volatility in e-cigarette category growth, at least in measured channels recently, and I know it's hard to gauge. But do you have a sense of the level of growth that we're seeing in the overall vapor category to the extent you can track that? And then -","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","\u2013 and then secondly just on deeming. Have you had any dialogue with the FDA recently to get a sense of \u2013 not so much on timing, but any shift in their thinking as they are working toward a final rule on the deeming of other tobacco products?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks for the questions, good ones both. The answer to the first question is e-vapor growth has slowed down this year. So we had triple-digit gains year-over-year a couple of years ago, and then 50-ish% last year and it's obvious that while the category continues to grow it's not growing at anywhere near that rate.","With respect to deeming, we know that the reg, as you know, has gone to OMB, but we do not have any insight into what they took onboard. I know there were lots of comments including ours that were filed in respect of the proposed deeming regulation, but we don't have any insight into what they have sent over.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for calling.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I just had two questions if I could. First question, and I know you had mentioned that you've seen very little change in the competitive dynamic in the category, but you have you two competitors going through and selling in new retail contracts and a lot of that comes to fruition here in the fourth quarter. I was just curious if you've seen any change at the retail level from that? Are you seeing retailers potentially making some significant change in the shelf space, and that kind of thing? Any opportunity then for Altria is what I'm trying to get to.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. The answer is, we really haven't. But just to frame this out, this isn't the first time there have been changes in the industry, and naturally everybody competes really hard at retail, Chris, so everybody has got a lot of experience with their trade programs. We have evolved our trade programs for 2016. We've obviously anticipated that there might be changes and I think we are well positioned to compete there. But we haven't observed a lot yet to answer your question directly.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then I had just a follow-up to Matt's question on vapor. Kind of two-pronged question. One being that MarkTen XL is expanding beyond its lead categories. Does that mean it's going national, will we see this across the country? Or is it just a slow methodical build from here?","And maybe related to that then, how your promotional tactic has changed in the category just given the category slowed and we're lapping the initial launch of the product last year. Are you changing your promotional tactic now, and maybe focusing more so on profitability than on pure trial of the product?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The answer to both questions, the word I would use is disciplined. The way that we are going, we are very happy with how MarkTen XL is performing. We were in lead markets as you know, and then we've had a terrific consumer response there. So what we are going to do is with discipline, we are going to roll it out into some additional lead markets through select accounts and learn more and try to get wider awareness and distribution of MarkTen XL. We are very encouraged about the consumer response to MarkTen. So we'll do that in a disciplined way.","I would say in promotions it's the same thing. We have to get the product right. You have to listen to the consumer. You want to build awareness and trial. But you certainly don't want to overspend particularly, I might note, in a category where the growth has slowed. So we'll be very disciplined how we do that, but it's a place where we want to play. Our aspiration is ultimately for leadership. But this is emerging, an emerging product category, and we want to do it with a lot of financial discipline.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for calling, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. Quick question for you on the balance sheet. I've noticed your debt has been going down the last couple of years and your leverage is in really good shape, one-and-a-half times. But it is also declining. Can you talk about, are you wanting additional capacity on the balance sheet for something like share buyback or acquisitions? Or is this a change in financial policy in just deciding to operate at a lower leverage level?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks for the question. When we look at the balance sheet and kind of our debt levels we feel like we are in a good range currently where we are at, but we are always assessing the financing needs of the enterprise. Then when we make that decision that we want to go to the market, we look at market conditions and other factors to decide when we'll go. But no, there is no change in our financial strategies there, or policies, and we feel good about where we are at.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then I guess just related to the Anheuser-Busch SAB transaction. I think that you would be due some cash in the door from that transaction? Any ideas as to potentially use of those proceeds?","Martin J. Barrington - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it is too early for us to be talking about that. As I mentioned in our remarks I just don't want to get ahead of a deal that has not been announced as to its final terms.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Paige Magness, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead ma'am.","Paige Magness","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We're here this morning with Howard Willard, Altria's CEO; and Billy Gifford, our CFO to discuss Altria's 2019 second quarter and first half business results.","Earlier today, we issued a press release providing these results. We're also including slides to accompany our remarks. And all of this information is available on our website at altria.com and through the Altria Investor App.","During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2018. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. Share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors.","Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S., Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both the reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Howard.","Howard Willard","Thanks, Paige, and good morning everyone. Altria delivered excellent second quarter results driven by the performance of our core tobacco businesses. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share nearly 9% in the second quarter, with each of our core tobacco segments delivering double-digit adjusted operating companies income growth, expanding their already impressive adjusted operating companies income margins, and maintaining momentum on their leading premium brands.","The strong second quarter was a big step-up from the first as the negative smokable inventory impact in the first quarter reversed to a benefit in the second. The second quarter also saw the benefits of our cost-reduction program ramp-up and we expect these will continue to build through the year.","In the second quarter, we made important progress further enhancing our business platform in non-combustible product offerings for adult tobacco consumers. In April, FDA authorized PMI's IQOS product for U.S. commercialization in the heated tobacco category. And in June, we signed an agreement to acquire 80% ownership of the companies that will globally commercialize on!, a leading product in the rapidly growing oral nicotine pouch category.","We also saw an acceleration of consumer trends that we believe further validate the strategic actions that we've taken over the years. We believe that with our leading premium brands \u2013 with our leading premium tobacco brands U.S. commercialization rights to IQOS the leading global heated tobacco product our investment in Juul and pending transaction for on!. We're best positioned with a strong and resilient combustible business and the best noncombustible portfolio in the U.S. tobacco market.","Let's turn first to our smokeable products segment. The smokeable products segment generated strong adjusted operating companies\u2019 income growth of 11% in the second quarter, primarily driven by the benefit of higher pricing and the impact of our cost-reduction efforts.","For the first half, the smokable segment delivered 5.7% adjusted operating company's income growth. PM USA is pleased with the Marlboro's continued stability with retail share of 43.3% unchanged versus the year-ago quarter and up 0.2 sequentially. Marlboro's performance continues to be supported by its leading brand equity bolstered by investments in product expansions, packaging innovation, and digital loyalty, and trade programs.","In discount, L&M is performing in line with expectations and we are pleased with its increased profitability over time. We believe discount category dynamics continue to primarily reflect a churn between branded discount and deep discount offerings. The overall discount category grew 0.1 sequentially in the quarter to 24.2% and the discount category remains essentially line with historical share.","Turning to cigarette volumes. The first half of 2019 saw large inventory fluctuations. Wholesalers depleted PM USA inventories by 400 million units in the first quarter and rebuilt inventories by 500 million units in the second quarter. The net result being a 100 million-unit benefit to reported volumes in the first half compared to a 400 million-unit depletion in the first half of 2018. We estimate that the adjusted industry decline rate in the second quarter was 6% up from 5% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019. Over the first half the adjusted cigarette industry decline rate was an estimated 5.5%.","Let me provide you with some perspective on the factors driving category volume declines. Over the past 12 months, U.S. cigarette industry volumes declined by an estimated 5%. This represents a 0.5% increase versus the 12 months ended in the first quarter of 2019, which we estimate as primarily due to increased adult smoker movement to the e-vapor category. We believe this reflects both increased availability of satisfying e-vapor products that began midyear 2018 and higher levels of exclusive e-vapor use.","After considering the latest information, we are revising our 2019 estimate of U.S. cigarette industry volume decline rate to 5% to 6% from a range of 4% to 5%. We have also considered the combined effects of the current acceleration in adult smoker movement across categories and the recent strong national momentum behind raising the legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21, and our estimated cigarette declines through 2023. Specifically, we expand our five-year compounded annual average rate of category decline estimate to 4% to 6% from our previous range of 4% to 5%.","It's informative to compare smokable business results versus historic category volume declines. In the first half, adjusted category volumes were down 5.5% and the smokable segment grew adjusted operating companies income 5.7%. By comparison over the past four years, adjusted category volumes declined approximately 3% on a compounded annual basis and the smokable segment grew adjusted operating companies income 5.2%. We believe this demonstrates how our strong and resilient smokable platform can deliver profit growth in the current volume decline environment.","Solid profit growth is also demonstrated in our smokeless product segment results. USSTC is successfully executing against its strategy of maximizing income while maintaining momentum on Copenhagen over time. USSTC is one of the most profitable non-combustible tobacco businesses in the world and offers a portfolio of satisfying products with the potential for harm reduction.","USSTC grew its adjusted operating companies income by 10.8% in the second quarter and 9.4% for the first half reflecting consistently strong results so far this year. And Copenhagen's category-leading retail share grew by 0.3 to 34.6% in the second quarter. USSTC's smokeless volume decreased an estimated 2% in the first half when adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movement.","USSTC estimates that smokeless industry volume decreased 1.5% in the last six months. We believe these declines reflect increasing adult tobacco consumer interest in both e-vapor and oral nicotine pouches. In June, we announced an agreement to acquire 80% ownership of the companies that will commercialize On! oral nicotine pouches through Helix innovations, a newly-formed operating company.","On! offers a total of 35 SKUs representing the broadest oral nicotine pouch portfolio in the U.S. market today. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year. In advance of closing Altria Group Distribution Company began expanding availability of the On! portfolio to select retailers this month.","Upon closing our focus for On! will include further expanding retail distribution and visibility, building U.S. production capacity, building the On! brand through adult tobacco consumer engagement and preparing PMTAs for the On! portfolio. We're excited about adding On! to our business platform and pursuing a leadership position in this new and rapidly growing category.","Also in non-combustibles IQOS has shown to be a leading product internationally. We're pleased to have access to an inhalable alternative that represents to the first next-generation tobacco product to receive FDA premarket authorization. We're ready to begin commercializing IQOS in the U.S. and are committed to its success. We expect the first IQOS store to open in Atlanta in September along with the other retail touch points including mobile retail units and retail kiosks all restricted to adult smokers.","We plan to have the IQOS website live in August where adult smokers will be able to preorder their IQOS devices for pickup at the IQOS Atlanta store. Initially, we expect HeatStick distribution to be in approximately 500 Atlanta area stores. We are very excited to bring IQOS to adult smokers in the U.S. and intend to capitalize on this first-mover advantage.","Turning the e-vapor. The category continues to grow as adult smokers increasingly find satisfying options in the category. We of course participate in the e-vapor category through our investment in Juul. After initial trial and experimentation with e-vapor adult vapor participation in the category declined from 2014 to 2016. The number of adult vapors reaccelerated upon the availability of more satisfying pod-based products.","Based on our 12-month moving data, we estimate there are now 13.8 million adult vapors as of June 2019 up from 12.2 million at the end of 2018. Importantly that growth trend coincides with a trend towards more exclusive use in the category. According to our adult consumer tracking data, we estimate more than 7 million adults vape and do not smoke as of June 2019.","In the first half of 2019, we estimate that e-vapor category volume grew by approximately 40% year-over-year across open and closed systems at all trade classes. Since 2017 and even considering more recent competitive product expansions, our data indicates that Juul has driven nearly all of the category growth.","Juul share of the category across both open and closed systems grew to 48% in Q2 up from 44% in the first quarter and its full year 2018 share of 33%. Juul continues to be the category leader despite the removal of certain flavors at retail that caused the first quarter sequential volume slowdown. While competitors have responded by increasing the availability of non-traditional flavors we believe their tactics will ultimately be addressed with full implementation of FDA's ENDS guidance later this year.","Internationally Juul continues to make progress expanding to additional markets. Since April Juul launched in several new markets which include Ireland, South Korea, Austria and the Philippines. Juul plans to launch additional markets by the end of this year, it's still early days for Juul international distribution. However, we are working to establish a measurement system that appropriately captures trade channels in overseas markets and provides a more complete view on consumer takeaway.","Providing thoughtful solutions to address youth e-vapor use is a top priority. We know that the future viability of these products is at risk unless more is done to reverse the underage e-vapor use trend. We strongly believe that raising the legal age nationwide to purchase all tobacco products to 21 is one important step toward addressing this issue.","So far our advocacy has helped drive significant progress at both the federal and state levels. Earlier this month, Ohio became the 18th state to make 21 the legal age of purchase. And now over half of the U.S. population is covered by legislation requiring 21 as the minimum age.","Bipartisan federal legislation has also been introduced with broad support so the effort has strong momentum. We believe it is critical to preserve e-vapor products as an option for the more than 13 million adults who use them and the millions more adult smokers who are interested in non-combustible alternatives.","Earlier this month in the case pending against FDA and federal court in Maryland, the court revised PMTA deadlines for new tobacco products on the market as of August 8, 2016 to be May 2020. According to the court order, new products for which applications have not been filed within this period will be subject to FDA enforcement discretion. We expect the new time lines to present a challenge for all companies impacted by the court's ruling. Juul has invested significant resources in preparing their applications and we are offering regulatory consulting services.","In summary, our 2019 plans remain on track. We're operating at a rapidly changing industry. We've long anticipated consumer adoption of new types of products with potentially lower risk. This is one of the main reasons we supported FDA regulation many years ago to facilitate this change and it's why we've invested in the leading noncombustible products. The dynamics during the first half of the year further validate our strategy.","With increasing success migrating adult smokers to noncombustible products, we're pleased that our strong core businesses are well positioned to provide profit growth through this transition. We continue to believe that we're building a business platform that enhances our ability to deliver solid performance and returns to shareholders over time and across a variety of scenarios. We reaffirm our guidance to deliver full year 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.27. This range represents a growth rate of 4% to 7% from a 2018 adjusted diluted EPS base of $3.99.","I'll now turn it over to Billy to provide more detail on our performance and other investments.","Billy Gifford","Thanks, Howard, and good morning everyone. We'll begin with additional color on our smokeable products segment. Reported domestic cigarette volume increased 0.3% in the second quarter as trade inventory dynamics more than offset the industry rate of decline and year-over-year retail share declines. And adjusted for inventory movements and other factors, smokeable products segment cigarette volume declined by an estimated 7% for both the second quarter and first half.","In the second quarter, the smokable products segment expanded OCI margins by 1.8 percentage points to 54.4%, driven by higher pricing and lower controllable cost, partially offset by higher resolution cost. In the smokeable products, segment strong price realization reflects both pricing actions and greater efficiency and use of promotional resources, thanks to investments made in trade programs, data analytics and consumer data.","Net price realization was 7% in the second quarter and 7.7% for the first half. The mobile rewards program, continue to resonate with adult smokers and drive visits to mobile.com. In July, PM USA hit a terrific milestone with over two million enrollees and more than 100 million pack codes entered since the program launched in January.","Beginning in April, PM USA expanded Marlboro Smooth Ice in the resale pack nationally which is now distributed in over 113,000 retail stores. Marlboro Smooth Ice continues to receive positive feedback from adult smokers and the trade. Between July and September, adult smokers can earn up to three times their rewards points for every pack of Marlboro Smooth Ice entered. We expect this offer to encourage trial of Marlboro Smooth Ice and drive repeat purchase among adult smokers.","Building on its early success in the Western U.S., Nat Sherman expanded Nat's to all 50 states in the second quarter. Nat's competes in the super-premium segment and offers adult smokers a unique cigarette proposition of simply tobacco and water. And in cigars, volume grew 2.6% in the second quarter and Black & Mild continued its strength in the premium tip cigar segment.","On the legislative front, we continue to monitor cigarette state excise tax increases. On July 1, SET increases in two states. Illinois and New Mexico went into effect, bringing the weighted average SET as of July 1 to $1.82 per pack, up $0.03 from $1.79 per pack when compared to both year-end 2018 and the first half of 2019.","In smokeless, USSTC expanded adjusted OCI margins by 4.1 percentage points to a remarkable 74% in the second quarter, driven by higher pricing and lower costs. USSTC's retail share declined 0.2 in the second quarter to 53.9%. Copenhagen's retail share grew 0.3 share point to 34.6% and Skoal's retail share declined 0.6 share point to 15.8%. In May, USSTC opened the Original Snuff Shop in downtown Nashville. The Original Snuff Shop allows adult dippers to immerse themselves in Copenhagen's rich 200-year heritage and reinforces the brand's already strong equity among adult dippers.","Turning to our alcohol assets. In wine, the premium segment continues to be highly competitive. Ste. Michelle delivered adjusted operated companies income of $19 million down 29.6% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher costs and unfavorable premium mix. To help reinvigorate its portfolio, Ste. Michelle is making investments to modernize its marketing approach through digital and packaging innovation, including the first quarter launch of 14 Hands and aluminum cans.","In beer, adjusted earnings from our equity investment in ABI were $212 million in the second quarter, up more than 35% year-over-year, reflecting Altria's share of ABI's first quarter results.","I'll turn briefly to our investment in cannabis. With its well-capitalized balance sheet, we believe Cronos is making good progress in executing against its growth strategy. Cronos continues to focus on augmenting its management with top talent and investing in intellectual property and differentiated brands.","Cronos also recently announced its agreement to purchase a state-of-the-art production facility in Canada to advance its partnership with Ginkgo Bioworks and ultimately support large-scale cannabinoid production and efficiency. We continue to be excited about the global potential of the rapidly growing cannabis category and believe that U.S. federal legalization is inevitable. We also believe Altria's capabilities will help Cronos establish a leadership position in such scenario.","Moving to our capital allocation. We continue to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. In the second quarter, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and have a highly attractive dividend yield. Altria's current annualized dividend rate of $3.20 per share represents an annual dividend yield of 6.4% as of July 26, 2019.","In the second quarter, we also repurchased 3.7 million shares for a total cost of $195 million, which concluded our $2 billion share repurchase program. Yesterday, the Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of 2020. Our previously announced cost-reduction program remains on track and we still expect to realize $575 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2019. The program includes savings from workforce reductions, third-party spending reductions and closure of our Nu Mark operations. Workforce reductions were largely completed in the first quarter, so our second quarter results reflect cost savings offsetting more of the incremental interest expense we incurred related to our transactions in the fourth quarter of last year.","With that, we'll wrap up and Howard and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available in altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing inventory and other housekeeping items.","With that, I'll open up the question-and-answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Good morning. So Howard, I guess I had a question around the cost category movement that seems to be accelerating which is driving your reduced volume forecast for the cigarette industry. If you look at, I guess a lot of the movement last year, a lot of that came at the back half of the year. So I guess comparisons are probably getting a little bit easier just from that perspective. So are you expecting kind of that run rate 1.3% negative category cost movement on the cigarette volume to stay constant? Why do you think that that number doesn't necessarily fade, if you're kind of comping against a tougher comparison in the back half of the year?","Howard Willard","Yes. I think you make a good point. When you look at the growth that's occurred in the e-vapor category, it really started to grow strongly at the beginning of 2018. And certainly, you had a much larger base in the second half of 2018 that will compare against in the second half of 2019. So it certainly could result in a slowdown in the percentage growth of the category. And frankly, that's why when we look at our annual estimate for the decline rate of the cigarette category, it's a range, because I think it would take that into account.","Judy Hong","And then can you just provide a bit more color just in terms of taking down kind of the medium-term guidance down 4% to 6%, and your level of confidence that that range is comfortable enough just given that that projection has come down in the last two quarters?","Howard Willard","Sure. I think that we originally had a five-year compound annual decline rate of the cigarette category of 4% to 5% and we provided that at the end of last year. And our thinking was that we knew that there was an acceleration in the growth rate of the e-vapor category, but we also knew from experience both overseas and in the U.S. that typically an acceleration of the growth rate of a category driven by newly available or more broadly available products tends to run its course in a year or two, and so we felt fairly good at that point given the activity in the marketplace at 4% to 5%.","In the second quarter of this year, a couple of things have happened that caused us to increase the top end of that decline range. First of all, IQOS was approved. And I think that IQOS is going to be on a nice growth trajectory as it expands nationwide over the next couple of years. So that's an additional influence on the cigarette category decline rate. And we also made our investment in on!. We think it's got a very strong portfolio of nicotine-containing pouches and of course you will have access to our infrastructure.","And then on top of that, we've also had increased momentum behind increasing the minimum age to purchase to 21. We've now got 50% of U.S. population in jurisdictions where the minimum age to purchase to 21. So we thought given that range of changes that it made sense to broaden the decline range for the cigarette category over the next five years.","Judy Hong","Okay. And then my last question Howard just on Juul. So in December -- or I guess in February, you laid out your key transaction assumptions around Juul both U.S. and internationally. So now that you obviously have invested in the business for seven months or so, can you provide us with some color on how those assumptions have changed if at all and whether the PMTA deadline being pulled forward impact some of those assumptions going forward?","Howard Willard","Sure. I think if you looked at our assumptions, I think we expected that Juul would have a quite strong revenue growth following our investment. And I think we also had a belief that there was quite an attractive opportunity at the gross margin line as well. I have to say in the first half of this year Juul has performed quite strongly against both of those assumptions and we feel very good about their performance there.","With regard to developing operating companies income both domestically and overseas, I think it's -- we're not yet at a stage where we've got the information necessary to judge that. There's still a bit investment spending mode both domestically and overseas. And I think it's simply too soon to make a judgment on the progress they're making overseas that's more of early days there.","With regard to your question about the change in the filing date for their PMTA, there is no question that the due date for filing a PMTA and all the e-vapor products being moved to May of next year represents a significant challenge for all the companies that are impacted by it. And certainly, Juul is very focused on continuing to work on that, continuing to ramp up their resource investment and we're providing them with consulting resources in the regulatory space as well. But that certainly raised the pressure on I think all the companies in the e-vapor space.","With that said, I think the way that Juul's performance has evolved here over the last several months they should have a very strong case to make in their PMTA. If you look at their response to the increase in youth usage, Juul took very aggressive action in the third quarter of last year by removing their nontraditional flavored products from retail. They are really the only major player to have done that and I think that was a big step forward in demonstrating their responsibility and their concern for the issue.","In addition they have also been very supportive of raising the minimum age to purchase to 21. And a lot of those laws kicked in July 1st and so we're going to start to see the impact of that going forward. And so I think that when you compare them to other players in the e-vapor category, they've been more aggressive in addressing the youth issue.","Secondly, I think they are also the primary driver of increased switching of adult cigarette smokers to the e-vapor category. And of course that's something that the FDA is going to consider in looking into PMTA as whether or not the company who's filing for the PMTA is having a significant impact on moving people down the continuum of harm.","So, I think they have a very good science and evidence to support their application, but there is no doubt that the shortened timeline represents an increased challenge for everybody.","Judy Hong","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen and Co.","Vivien Azer","Hi, good morning.","Howard Willard","Good morning Vivien.","Vivien Azer","So, my first question is on the cigarette volume outlook as well. I just wanted to be entirely clear Howard. As you guys have revised to down 5% to 6%, what does that assume in terms of the evolution of cross-category conversion?","Howard Willard","Well, I think given that the range is 5% to 6% and for the first half we are at a 5.5% decline rate, it actually covers quite a broad range of scenarios in the back half of the year. It would still be supportive even if the volume in the back half of the year for the cigarette category declined at a lower rate. And certainly that could happen it was raised earlier on the call that there is certainly a tougher comp for the e-vapor category in the back half of last year. So, it certainly allows for a slowdown in the decline rate of the cigarette category.","And it also allows for a continuation of the strong growth in e-vapor. I have to say that I don't believe we're going to have a significant impact in the second half of this year from iQOS because it's going to be in a limited geography that's probably more of a future year impact. But the benefit of having a 5% to 6% range covers quite a broad set of scenarios for the second half of the year.","Vivien Azer","Okay, that's helpful. But suffice it to say then if the first half is down 5.5% at the midpoint of your now revised full year guidance, it does not contemplate a meaningful step function or in terms of the cross-category movement like you're not expecting cross-category movement to become an even bigger headwind in the back half is that fair?","Howard Willard","Yes, I think that's largely fair. And I think that given the much larger second half last year number of e-vapors and the larger volume of e-vapor in the back half of last year, I think we thought that was prudent.","Vivien Azer","Okay. Yes. I agree with that for sure. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just my other question is on the moist smokeless tobacco category. So, we've seen category volumes decline for six consecutive quarters now. You called out the impact of both e-vapor as well as other oral tobacco products. So, can you just offer some color on how you're thinking about that category through the rest of the year? And perhaps on a five-year basis could seemingly the outlook for moist smokeless tobacco has changed in line with cigarettes? Thanks.","Howard Willard","Yes. I mean I think the change in growth trajectory of the smokeless tobacco category has largely occurred over the last four or five years. We'll remember back four or five years ago the smokeless tobacco category was growing 4% to 5% a year. And I think the reason for that was that it was the primary recipient of adult cigarette smokers that were looking for an alternative and they were moving to moist smokeless tobacco.","I think with the increased availability and attractiveness of e-vapor products and certainly also now most recently these nicotine-containing pouches I think that folks that used to go to the moist smokeless tobacco category and drive nice growth there are primarily going to the e-vapor category and I think in the future will have an additional option in nicotine-containing pouches.","And so I think that we expect that the category is going to remain kind of at a small decline rate going forward although we haven't made a precise projection.","I would point out that even given the slowdown in the growth rate of the category, it's still generating quite nice profit growth.","Vivien Azer","Absolutely, that's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi, thank you. Good morning. I actually wanted to ask about your model again in the context of your weaker outlook for the industry cig volumes. Just trying to think about this if anything has changed with your model in terms of your ability to deliver profit growth over the long-term? And maybe you could touch further on the different levers you have to pull to offset the ongoing cig volume pressure such as pricing.","And Howard also I'm not sure, but I don't think you mentioned price increases negatively impacting your outlook for industry volume, but I imagine that's a factor too?","Howard Willard","Sure. I think as we look at the opportunity to deliver against our long-term aspiration of 7% to 9% EPS growth, we continue to feel good about the tools we have at our disposal to deliver that over the long-term. And I think it starts off with we think quite a healthy and resilient combustible business.","I think you saw in the first half of this year how the profit growth was quite strong in that business despite the fact that there was a stepped-up decline in the overall industry volume.","And of course the two contributors of that -- to that nice profit growth were price increases coming from both list price and improved promotional efficiency and cost reduction in the category.","And I think we have long believed that that business is quite resilient and can deliver nice profit growth even in an environment where the industry volume declines step up a bit.","Now of course in addition to the profit growth opportunity we have with our core businesses, we also expect once we get HSR approval to have equity income from Juul. And given Juul's strong revenue and volume growth this year, we would expect that going forward in addition to having now the profit growth from our core tobacco businesses, we'd get an equity income contribution from Juul. And we think that the sum of the growth from our combustible tobacco business plus the 35% contribution to our equity income from Juul, we think that that sets us up very well to deliver in the future.","And then of course, as their international business develops, that is a further incremental opportunity for profit growth as a 35% economic interest brings that to our equity income line as well. So I don't know that we feel that our model has really changed on how we would deliver, although, I have to acknowledge we've widened the range a bit, but we still feel very comfortable about our long-term 7% to 9% EPS aspiration.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. That's helpful. And then speaking of Juul, is there anything you can share with us in terms of the improvements maybe you've been seeing in Juul's business either sequentially or year-over-year? And you touched on their expansion internationally and that seems to be going quite well, but they have been investing quite a bit to build that growth. So just how should we think about Juul's model, I guess over the long-term? Obviously, we don't have a lot of visibility yet, but maybe you could shed a little bit of light on that for us, please?","Howard Willard","Sure. I think there's been quite a bit of change in the marketplace in the e-vapor space in the U.S. for the first half of the year. So Juul withdrew their flavors. There was a slowdown in their volume growth in the first quarter, although, they went back to strong volume growth in the second quarter. So I think that's the first thing I would say is that despite their withdrawal of non-traditional flavors from retail, they still seem to have a healthy growth profile, which I think it's a positive.","And that's occurring despite the fact that the other major pod-based manufacturers have not decided to withdraw their flavors from retail. As a matter of fact, they've increased availability and they've been growing the flavored volume that they have at retail. So certainly that has an impact on Juul, but they still had a nice healthy growth rate in the first half of the year despite that.","And I would expect that Juul will have a benefit when the FDA finalizes their ENDS guidance and those other players have to join Juul in restricting the availability of flavors at retail. So I think that's another a positive that\u2019s likely to come in the second half of the year.","So I think overall in the U.S. market, I think it's been a strong performance for vapor overall and certainly for Juul. I think overseas, it's still early days. And I think, it's probably going to take another year to really get the same kind of positive assessment that we're able to get for the U.S. market today, but certainly, their expansion is going well and I think with the passage of time, we'll see how they do overseas.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Thank you.","Howard Willard","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","Good morning.","Howard Willard","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lavery","Can you just touch on what if anything you have included for on! in guidance in the second half?","Billy Gifford","Yeah, I think it's important to remember Michael that we expected to close in the second half. So from a standpoint of anything material, we don't expect anything material this year from on!.","Michael Lavery","And any more specific on the timing? Is that imminent later in the second half? Do you have a sense of when that might happen?","Billy Gifford","No. We're working with the other side, but we expect to close in the second half.","Michael Lavery","Okay.","Howard Willard","I would put down Michael though that we have agreed in advance of closing that AGDC is going to provide distribution services to expand the product availability at retail that started this month. So we are getting the benefit of starting to expand its availability in the marketplace in advance of closing, which I think is a real plus.","Michael Lavery","And does that have service revenues related to it, or is it just position the brand to be in -- does it just set up the brand to be in a better position once it closes?","Howard Willard","Yeah. I wouldn't think the service revenues is being at all material, it's really -- the real benefit is that the business is going to get a chance to ramp up, so that it is much better positioned to compete with other players post closing.","Michael Lavery","And then just looking at Cronos, do you have any involvement in helping partner to shape their plans, or as far as that contribution to your equity income, is it just sort of you're left with whatever you get?","Howard Willard","No, I think we have quite a bit of influence on their strategy going forward. We have the majority of the seats on the Board and we work very closely through our Board representatives at helping Cronos think through their plans going forward. And I think we invested in them, because we thought they had an excellent management team and a good strategy to begin with. And I have to say we work very well together and I think we're making real progress. Although, we acknowledge in the cannabis space overall it's early days.","Michael Lavery","No. It sounds like good line of thought. That's nice. And then just on your medium term now 4% to 6% decline outlook for the cigarette category. You mentioned the revision having some consideration for things like IQOS being approved and your expansion of distribution for on! and of course, the vapor momentum we're seeing. Is it fair to assume that if IQOS had stronger momentum than in some markets more something like Japan perhaps clearly that would be a very different number? At the moment you have -- it seems like a pretty modest -- conservative expectation for that will do. How are you thinking about the five-year view for that?","Howard Willard","Yeah. I think I would say that that provides an opportunity for kind of a midrange performance on IQOS. I can tell you if we had a Japan like performance we would be delighted. And at some point we might be considering whether or not to step up the decline rate again.","We feel like there's a fair amount of opportunity for IQOS to grow even within that 4% to 6% decline range, because our assumption is that given the rapid growth rate we've seen in e-vapor in 2018 and in the first half of 2019, we think that the e-vapor products are broadly available throughout retail and have been for over a year.","And at some point, we think that you're going to reach a saturation point on e-vapor. And you might even see an impact from the shakeout of many of the e-vapor products coming out of the market next year. So, I wouldn't necessarily draw a straight line for growth on the e-vapor category, and I think that leaves plenty of opportunity for a strong growth on iQOS.","And I think oral nicotine pouches their overall impact is likely to be smaller than either e-vapor or heat-not-burn. But we do believe that these clean white oral nicotine pouches are likely to appeal first and foremost to MST users, but I think are also a good alternative for adult cigarette smokers. And they are much more approachable than traditional moist smokeless tobacco pouches or even snus pouches.","Michael Lavery","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Howard Willard","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Paula Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.","Pam Kaufman","Hi. Good morning. It's Pam Kaufman. I just wanted to follow-up on the questions about your updated long-term rate of decline of 4% to 6%. If we assume that your volumes will decline at 5% annually, which is the midpoint of your outlook for the industry through 2023, your volumes would be about 20% to 25% below where they are today. What gives you confidence that you can sustain your long-term growth algorithm and generate -- continue to generate pricing growth in excess of those volume declines? And I guess based on the frequent rate of downward revisions, recently for the industry for this year, what should give investors confidence that your outlook for the mid-term won't go lower?","Howard Willard","Sure. I think, the confidence we have that we can continue to generate nice profit growth out of our combustible segment is driven by the experience we've had in driving profit growth in that business through both pricing and cost management. And certainly, when we've seen in prior periods a step-up in the decline rate of the volume, typically we've had the opportunity to continue to drive similar profit growth by utilizing those tools slightly differently going forward.","But, certainly in the event that we see a modest slowdown in our ability to grow profit in the combustible segment because of a higher rate of volume decline, we would have a further offset to that to further accelerate profit growth of our EPS coming from the equity income contribution from Juul. And we feel strongly that the sum of our combustible profit growth add it to the equity income we get from Juul that, that ought to compare favorably to our ability to grow profit in the past.","With regard to your question about how comfortable are we with 4% to 6% as a five-year compound annual growth rate of cigarette volume declines, we feel like that's a wide range that covers a whole variety of scenarios, and at this point we feel quite comfortable giving conditions in the marketplace.","But I would point out that one of the reasons that we've worked so hard to build the leading portfolio of non-combustible tobacco products is that our belief is that it's hard to predict with precision, the pace at which adult cigarette smokers may switch to non-combustible tobacco products in the future.","And so, what we've done is we've essentially built the product portfolio of non-combustible tobacco products such that if the movement of adult cigarette smokers out of cigarettes into these other product categories accelerates, we have the opportunity to benefit from that movement with profitable products that lead their categories.","And essentially, if there's a step-down in our ability to grow profitability in the combustible business, we would expect to make it up either in -- with iQOS and heat-not-burn with on, and oral nicotine pouches or through our equity income from Juul.","So, we think we've hedged that opportunity. Although, I have no reason to believe that that 4% to 6% range is inadequate based on the current market conditions and our understanding of what the future is going to bring.","Pam Kaufman","Thanks. Also it seems like there maybe a number of regulatory developments coming up this fall. What do you expect from the next wave of the National Youth Tobacco Survey? And would you expect this to impact Juul's PMTA approval prospects?","And then separately the FDA indicated that it plans to publish a proposed nicotine rule later this year. Do you believe that they'll all stick to this target?","Howard Willard","Sure. You're right, we do expect probably in the third quarter to get another update on youth usage of e-vapor products. I think it's hard to determine what exactly those figures will show, but it would not surprise me, if you saw youth use of e-vapor products continue at the prior year level or even take a step-up, because there's been a number of actions taken to drive down youth use of e-vapor products. But I don't know that we've had the time that is passed to get the impact of that.","Even the FDA's ENDS guidance on restricting flavors to -- at retail, hasn't been finalized yet. And while there's been a benefit from Juul withdrawing their flavors, the other manufacturers have expanded the availability of flavors. So, I think you're going to have to wait until FDA finalizes that guidance and enforces against the other players to get the impact.","There's been good progress on raising the minimum age to purchase to 21, but I would say the bulk of that impact is at July 1 and moving forward kind of impact, so that's going to take a while. So, I think the expectation is that a lot of the actions that -- and frankly the FDA has expanded their advertising campaign to discourage youth from using e-vapor products.","So there's a lot going on. I just think that the expectation would be that it's going to have a significant impact going forward. I just don't know that I would expect that it's been a long enough period of time for those actions to see it in the September numbers.","With regard to FDA issuing further guidance on their nicotine regulation, they had indicated that they may publish something later this year. Given the past track record, I think that means that it may or may not come out.","But I think we've communicated before, we think that ultimately any implementation of a nicotine ceiling on cigarette products we think is a very long-term action and it would take quite some time for FDA to finalize that regulation and implement it. And of course, we don't think that what they have proposed in the past is feasible today and we don't think it's supported by the science. So we may expect to see some short-term progress there, but we think it's a long-term impact.","Pam Kaufman","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi good morning.","Billy Gifford","Hi Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. I just had two sort of follow-up questions. I guess first, have you given any kind of update on receiving FTC approval for your Juul investment? And I know that your guidance incorporates, you said some modest profit contribution from your investments this year. It would seem like you have some profit built in for the year. Is that presumably in the fourth quarter because we don't have an update yet from -- on this FTC approval?","Billy Gifford","Yes. Chris on the FTC, we still expect the approval latter part of this year beginning of next. And I think what we had said previously about both Cronos and Juul is we had no material impact in our guidance.","Chris Growe","Okay. And then in relation to iQOS, it launched in September. I just want to get a sense of the -- is there is a step-up of investment that occurs in the quarter to accommodate the launch of the product because we're thinking about the phasing of earnings, or are is -- a lot of those expenses already been sort of realized or undertaken as part of the P&L?","Billy Gifford","Yes. When we issued guidance we said we incorporated the iQOS lead market. Certainly there are always puts and takes, but we run various scenarios when we have that range of guidance and that's all incorporated.","Chris Growe","Okay. Just one final question which is in relation to the June price increase that occurred in combustible, are there -- do you believe inventories are the right level today, or was there any kind of build, given that came a bit of a surprise that occurred around that pricing they might have to work through in the third quarter?","Howard Willard","Yes. I think it's informative to look at where the inventories ended the second quarter. Compare that to historical levels and they're essentially in line with historical levels of inventory.","Chris Growe","I agree, okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Owen Bennett of Jefferies.","Owen Bennett","Good morning guys. Hope all well. Just one question from me, I just -- if I saw that right on the slide, you said that Juul is basically driving all the additional adult and vapor use.","I mean that seems kind of very impressive, but I was just wondering in the context, I mean those competition that haven't removed all their flavors competition as well spending a lot of money, doing TV adverts et-cetera. What do you think is actually just driving that success of Juul and actually being a contributor to a lot of additional growth?","Howard Willard","You're right. I think Juul has had an impressive first half and they've had some challenges that they've taken on that the other participants haven't. And frankly, I think it's further evidence of the fact that amongst adult tobacco consumers, I think Juul has real brand equity and I think it has a superior product.","And I think that as more and more adult tobacco consumers are exposed to the product I think increasingly folks are adding Juul to their tobacco product use. And as you saw from the numbers that they're setting down their cigarettes and moving over exclusively to e-vapor, I think in increasing numbers as well.","So I've been very pleased by it. Certainly there's a high level of competitive activity in the marketplace, but I think that Juul has performed quite admirably in the first half of this year despite all that activity.","Owen Bennett","Okay. And just one more follow-up in terms of you said there's a likely continued increase in youth usage and I'd imagine obviously that's going to be a key focus over PMTA.","So all the players will need to go grasp it potentially how much of their volumes are coming from youth? So I mean obviously Juul driving all the additional adult use if youth usage is going to increase, I mean have you got any sort of idea of how much share of that Juul is taken or whether that's dropping off now?","Howard Willard","Yes. I really don't and I don't know that I'm in a position to be able to forecast what the youth numbers are going to show in the third quarter, when they come out. I just know from experience back in the late '90s, when you had a step-up in youth use of cigarettes, a similar very comprehensive effort was put in place to drive down youth usage of cigarettes.","It was ultimately quite successful. But the impact of all that activity, it didn't happen in a quarter or two, it happened over the following one to three or four years. And so I think I just steeled myself to the fact that despite all the progress that's been made including raising the minimum age to purchase to 21 and jurisdictions with over half the population in progress at the federal level, I sort of just looked at the past. And I've steeled myself to the fact that even if we're winning that battle it may take a bit of time for the results to materialize.","Owen Bennett","Okay. And has that been a risk even kind of, we need to see in part by or May next year when the PMTAs got in? So three to four years is not really kind of what's needed in this instance?","Howard Willard","Yes. Certainly really all the e-vapor companies that are now going to be filing in May of next year they're going to have less time will have passed to allow youth e-vapor rates to decline. So I think that's a risk really across the category for people to file.","But I would point out that FDA, I think, has indicated that they appreciate the impact that the e-vapor category is having on converting adult cigarette smokers down the continuum of harm. Clearly that switching, and particularly the switching to e-vapor use without continuing to use cigarettes is accelerating.","So I think ultimately FDA is going to have to balance that favorable adult movement down the continuum of harm which is quite strong and quite favorable against the fact that youth e-vapor rates have not yet stepped down.","But I think FDA certainly has access to a lot of expertise and I think they can certainly assess whether or not the step-down is coming and consider that as they review those PMTAs.","Owen Bennett","Thank you very much. Much appreciate it.","Howard Willard","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam Spielman","Thank you very much. I've got two questions, if I can. The first one concerns down trading in the existing cigarette business. So one of the things that clearly you're doing is you're taking prices up and price gaps are widening.","But at the same time, you presented data and it's not the first time. But so, it's really there's very little down trading. That's mainly churn at the bottom end.","And I'm really intrigued by that. Because, I don't think, it's the historic pattern. I sort of wonder why it is. Is it maybe that actually within, let's say Marlboro, there are more people buying cheaper variants, or is there somewhat of an explanation about why there isn't down trading? So that's the first question.","Howard Willard","Sure. I think you are right that the, the strength of the premium category in the U.S. has been persistently strong really since 2011, when we launched the new Marlboro architecture. And as a matter of fact since 2011, the overall discount category is down, more than a share point.","So, the U.S. market has been quite strong in that regard. In the premium category, it's much larger in the U.S. market than it is in many markets overseas. So I wouldn't say that this phenomenon that is occurring today is unusual, compared to the last six or seven years, I think it's actually more the pattern.","The price gap over the last year or two has gone from 29% to 31%. So it's had a small increase. But I would say that's not a material increase. And I think that, I think that the strong equity of the premium brands in the category, I think has an impact on consumers deciding. They'd rather pay a bit more to get their brand of choice rather than move down into discount.","So I think it's a sign of a very healthy premium category. Now with regard to whether or not there's movement within the Marlboro portfolio. Certainly, in the period during the great recession and shortly thereafter, there was an increased movement between both premium price part of the Marlboro portfolio and the special blend.","But given the strength of the economy today, there's really not an appreciable movement into that part of the portfolio. And of course the pricing that we share each year, takes into account the change in the weighted average price across the Marlboro portfolio. So that's factored into the numbers.","Adam Spielman","Okay. Thank you very much. And I just wanted to follow-up briefly on, an answer you gave to other in the call. So you said that in 2Q, this is a question about Juul. That you said in 2Q, that Juul was growing very, very nicely.","But I was wondering, I know you're not going to quantify that to the last decimal place. But I was wondering is it relative to the run rates in the second half of last year?","Are we sort of talking volumes up 20%, up 50%, up 100%? Any sort of ballpark in that direction, or 10%? Are you able to give some sort of ballpark figure for that sort of growth?","Howard Willard","Sure. In the first half of 2019, the category growth was 40% for the overall e-vapor category. And it was 195% for Juul. And that's on Slide 18. And of course, we also referenced Juul's share growth on the second quarter compared to the first quarter and the full year 2018. Their share growth was 48% in Q2, up from 44% in Q1, and up from 33% in full year 2018.","Adam Spielman","Thank you.","Howard Willard","Thank you.","Adam Spielman","That\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Hey, great thanks\u2026","Howard Willard","Hi, Steve.","Steve Powers","Hey, hey. So following up on, your comments related to the PMTA process and the need for filers and the FDA to balance youth usage against the efficacy of e-vapor to convert adult smokers.","I guess, I'm looking for a little bit more color on how that factors in, to how you may consult Juul specifically in its PMTA application process. Because on the one hand it's leading that adult conversion, so that's a positive.","Yet on the other hand, it's -- their current product is clearly associated with underage usage. And the potential lack of data on the efficacy of their steps to reduce that usage.","Just being in hand by the time approval needs to be granted, it just seems a potential liability. So what's your perspective on those dynamics as it relates to Juul? And how that might impact? How they apply or their application in general?","Howard Willard","Yeah. I don't know that I have more to say on that topic. I think the youth usage of e-vapor products is a challenge that every filer is going to have to deal with. And I think ultimately FDA is going to have to take all of that onboard.","I think we have the benefit though, that the FDA can approve a product through the PMTA process. And then, require the filer to do post-market surveillance. And if they find that, the favorable outcomes they expected to come from that product, don't materialize in the years that follow. They can withdraw their approval.","So I think that, in a situation like we're faced here with e-vapor, where there's very strong conversion of adult cigarette smokers. But we don't yet know whether or not youth rates are going to go down quite rapidly and what the timing will be.","That might very well be a situation where post-market surveillance was frankly designed for that situation. And FDA can approve certain products, require post-market surveillance to essentially change their view based on what happens in the years that follow.","Steve Powers","Okay. That's very helpful. Yeah. That's clear. Thank you very much. I guess the second question, I have is just another follow-up on Juul and your comments earlier. I know you said, that Juul has been performing impressively and quite strongly against your going-in expectations year-to-date.","But just to be clear, is it fair to say it's running above expectations, at least as it relates with the U.S. because I'm just trying to triangulate between, the lowering of your smokable volume outlook. And the primary role that e-vapor is playing in that. And presumably the role that Juul is playing in that conversion.","So you just either -- it either suggested Juul is trending above expectations your own expectations. Or that you've seen better-than-expected performance from some of the other e-vapor brands? So just maybe can you clarify those dynamics please?","Howard Willard","Yeah. I would say that, in the first half of the year Juul is generally performing in line with our expectations. I know we had a range of expectations. So I don't know that it's substantially exceeding those expectations.","I would say that, one factor that did occur particularly in the first half of this year, that I think probably has an impact on the cigarette category decline rate, is that not only did we see the number of adult vapers increase, as we expected it to going to 13.8 million compared to 12.2 million from June to the end of last year.","We also saw a pretty good step-up in the number of adult vapors that are no longer smoking. And certainly if somebody goes from smoking to dual using cigarettes and e-vapor then moves all the way to exclusive e-vapor use that could have a modest step-up on the cigarette decline rate. So certainly that happened in the first half. I don't know that we had a hardened past view on what would happen there, but certainly it stepped up. And compared to history it's at a higher level than it's been since 2014.","Steve Powers","Okay. So just to clarify so it sounds like Juul and the industry performing at the higher end of your going-in expectations plus maybe a bit more full conversion full cessation of smoking than was implied in the baseline is that a good summary?","Howard Willard","Yes, I think that's right.","Steve Powers","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Howard Willard","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Gaurav Jain of Barclays.","Gaurav Jain","Thank you. Good morning. So I have a question on your smokeless tobacco business where margins are 74%, EBITDA north of $2. So could just expand on there is a risk that you cannibalize your own smokeless business unless the margins are on the scale out similar to your current smokeless business? So how do we think about that dichotomy?","Billy Gifford","Yes. You're exactly right. We're very pleased with the high margins that we're able to achieve in the smokeless category. From a standpoint of On! we think through time they will achieve tobacco-like margins.","Gaurav Jain","So by tobacco you mean smokeless-like margins?","Billy Gifford","That is correct.","Gaurav Jain","Sure. Now coming to cigars I'm aware that it's a very small part of your business. But in a FDA clearly as three-pronged approach here to flavored cigars. They will finalize the draft guidance by October 2019. There will be a PMTA by May 2020. And then there's a rule-making process as well. So how should we think about the cigar business long-term?","Howard Willard","Sure. I think, we feel good about our cigar business. You are right that the FDA has said they're going to finalize some guidance on flavors in cigars later this year. I think we along with others in industry have stated that we don't think they have very good signs and evidence base to restrict the availability of flavored cigars. So we think ultimately that is going to be challenged and we feel that there's a very strong case to challenge that. Secondly, you're right that for products that don't already have a market order because they are grandfathered or have received an SE they're going to have to file PMTAs on this new accelerated deadline of May of next year.","So for some cigar companies that could pose a significant issue for them and they may lose the ability to sell some of their cigar products. By and large that doesn't apply to us. The vast majority of our cigar products have market orders either because they're grandfathered or have received FDA notices. And then of course with regard to any rule-making they might make in the longer term relating to flavors or other things again they're going to have the obligation to support that with science and evidence. And we feel good about our ability to make case that our cigar products in any case are responsibly participating in the marketplace.","Gaurav Jain","Sure. Thank you. And if I can ask one last question. So on cigarettes -- what we have seen this year is that pricing has gone up above expectations and volumes have come in below expectations and that substitute product which is e-cigarettes they aren't really taking any pricing and they haven't taken any pricing for two years. So as we look out does the e-cigarette cannibalization increase over time as price gaps keep widening? And what has been your experience over the last two years?","Howard Willard","Yes. I'm not going to speculate on future pricing. I think that consumers are moving into e-vapor because of significant benefits that those products have unrelated to price and I'm not going to speculate on future pricing. Thank you. ","Gaurav Jain","Sure. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Petros Voulgaris of Goldman Sachs.","Petros Voulgaris","Good morning, everybody.","Howard Willard","Good morning. ","Petros Voulgaris","We've discussed IQOS's inclusion in MSA before and how that operates as a tax. But I'm wondering with respect to how IQOS is counted towards the MSA will one HeatStick be equivalent to one cigarette or will there be some other measurement? And as a follow-up are there ways through different product iterations or some other modification for IQOS not to be included in the MSA?","Billy Gifford","Yes. I think when you think about it one HeatStick would be the equivalent of one cigarette because the definition incorporates it that way. And I'm not going to speculate on what future product iterations could be inside or outside of the MSA.","Petros Voulgaris","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Jennifer Maloney of Wall Street Journal.","Jennifer Maloney","Hi good morning.","Howard Willard","Hi Jennifer","Jennifer Maloney","I wonder if you can give us an update on direct mailings to your cigarette consumers and onserts or inserts in cigarette packs on behalf of Juul. How many have you sent out? And what are the redemption rates looking like?","Howard Willard","Yes. We don't share level of that detail. Both direct mailings and onserts to date have occurred. And I know that there is further activity that's planned between now and the end of the year communicating about the benefits of Juul, but we haven't shared numbers or fine details on that.","Jennifer Maloney","Broadly speaking, have the results of those changed your estimates for sort of what cannibalization you expect to see specifically on your brands from Juul?","Howard Willard","No it hasn't.","Jennifer Maloney","Okay.","Howard Willard","I don't think we've seen anything that caused us to change our views on Juul's growth rate or the cannibalization of our products.","Jennifer Maloney","Okay. Thanks.","Howard Willard","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Robert Rampton of UBS.","Robert Rampton","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just to follow up on that cannibalization question. So, could you give us some more color on what is the cannibalization rate of e-cigarettes? Say for every 100 puffs, how many are coming from cigarettes? One of your peers put that number at 25%. Would you be -- would you disagree with that?","Howard Willard","Yes, I don't know that I've got a precise point of view on that. I think, we think about it more along the lines of how the category growth rate in e-vapor is developing and then we take into account all the impacts on the overall cigarette category. I don't know that we've kind of looked at it that way and I don't know that I have any greater precision to share with you.","Robert Rampton","Okay. Fair enough. So second question, just on IQOS, your earlier comments seem to further -- your expected range is between zero and Japan at 20 and you're at the midpoint, so I'm guessing around 10%. Can you give us some color on what your expectations for IQOS in the U.S. are based off?","Howard Willard","Yes. I don't know that we've firmed up an expectation for IQOS. I think our belief -- certainly, we know the experience in a variety of markets overseas. I think our belief is that that's one of the key things we're going to learn in going into the Atlanta test market. And I think, we'll know probably in the next six to nine months kind of what the U.S. experience is with IQOS. And of course, we're going to put significant resources and significant activity behind it in order to drive it towards the high end of what it can do in the U.S. But I don't know that we've got a precise answer as to how we think it's going to compare in the U.S. to overseas, but we do know that we're going to put the resources behind it to make sure that it does as well in the U.S. as is humanly possible.","Robert Rampton","Fair enough. Thank you, very much.","Howard Willard","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Howard Willard","Thank you, Christie. To close, we're on track to deliver against our 2019 earnings guidance. We believe Altria is well positioned through the combination of excellent profit growth from our core tobacco businesses and strategic positions in key noncombustible product categories to lead our industry through a period of evolution just as we have in the past.

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brendan McCormick, Vice President Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.","Brendan McCormick","Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. I'm joined this morning by Mike Szymanczyk, Altria's Chairman and CEO; and Howard Willard, Altria's Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we will only be discussing Altria's 2012 business results for the first quarter, and will not be discussing the status of tobacco litigation. ","Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of our earnings release for the review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. For a detailed review of Altria's business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website, altria.com.","Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and on an adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings press release and are available on our website. ","In addition, comparisons discussed in this conference call are to the same prior year period unless otherwise stated. As part of Altria's cost reduction program, on January 1, 2012, John Middleton became a subsidiary of PM USA, reflecting management's goal to achieve efficiencies in the management of these businesses. Beginning this quarter, we are reporting the financial results for the new smokable products segment, which includes cigarettes and cigars. ","Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Mike Szymanczyk.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Thanks, Brendan, and good morning to everyone. Altria delivered strong financial results in the first quarter, growing its adjusted diluted earnings per share by 11.4%. Behind the strength of our diverse business platform, our business model generates income streams from the largest and most profitable tobacco categories, as well as from our alcohol assets and financial services business. ","Our smokable and smokeless products segments grew their adjusted operating companies income and margins behind the strong performance of our tobacco companies' premium brands and effective cost management. All of our tobacco companies grew retail share of the categories in which they compete. ","PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are pursuing initiatives to build their premium brands for the long term. As we discussed at the CAGNY conference in February, PM USA has evolved Marlboro's brand architecture to support its future growth. This new architecture is focused on 4 product families: Red, gold, green and a new product family, black. ","In the first quarter, PM USA made investments in Marlboro Black, which builds on Marlboro's rich heritage of adventure and ruggedness. Marlboro's cigarette retail share benefited from the investment in this new architecture. Marlboro delivered strong 2012 first quarter sequential share growth of 0.7 of a share point versus the fourth quarter of 2011 and grew its year-over-year share by 0.1 of a share point. ","We launched non-menthol and menthol versions of Marlboro Black last year in bold modern packaging, fitting with the personality of the Marlboro Black family and are pleased with its first quarter results. The Marlboro Black family is off to a great start, has generated trial among competitive adult smokers as intended and gained retail share. However, some of Marlboro Black's retail share gains were driven by trial-generating activities that are likely to moderate in 2013. ","Marlboro will continue to focus on the introduction of its new brand architecture throughout 2012 and plans a number of brand-building and equity-enhancing products and programs across all 4 of Marlboro's brand families during this year and 2013. ","In the second quarter, PM USA is introducing Marlboro EIGHTY-THREES Box that provides the Classic Marlboro flavor in modern updated packaging in the red family. ","Black & Mild delivered strong retail share gains for the first quarter, driven by its continued leadership in tip cigarillos and the success of new untipped cigarillos introduced in 2011. Our smokeless products segment continued to deliver strong adjusted operating companies income growth behind Copenhagen and Skoal. These brands grew their combined first quarter adjusted volume and retail share versus the prior year, as Copenhagen continued to show strong momentum. ","Skoal's retail share was stable on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011. Skoal's year-over-year retail share losses, including those attributable to the 7 SKUs delisted last year, were partially offset by share gains for Skoal X-tra, which was introduced at the end of the first quarter of 2011. ","In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered strong volume growth as it continued to expand distribution of its premium wines. Adjusted operating companies income was flat for the first quarter, as Ste. Michelle had a higher cost in certain wine vintages investments to build its sales force and other items. ","Gains on asset sales by PMCC and earnings from our equity investment in SABMiller also contributed to Altria's strong adjusted earnings per share growth. Altria continued to return cash to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. In the first quarter, Altria paid more than $835 million in dividends and bought back 9.9 million shares at a total cost of $294 million. Subject to the discretion of the board, the company plans to repurchase additional shares worth $378 million by the end of 2012, representing the balance remaining under the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by the board in October of 2011. ","We are pleased with Altria's financial results for the first quarter, which were consistent with our expectations. Altria reaffirms that it expects its 2012 adjusted diluted EPS will increase by 6% to 9% to a range of $2.17 to $2.23 from an adjusted basis of $2.05 to -- per share in 2011. Altria anticipates more modest adjusted diluted EPS growth through the middle quarters of the year. ","Finally, I am happy to report that our Chairman and CEO transition is proceeding smoothly. Marty Barrington will succeed me when I retire as Chairman and CEO, following Altria's annual meeting with shareholders on May 17. And Dave Brand will become President and Chief Operating Officer. Marty will join Howard Willard for our second quarter earnings conference call in July. ","As this is my final earnings conference call as Chairman and CEO of Altria, I want to thank our shareholders and analysts for your interest in our company. I have appreciated the support and confidence that many of you have offered as we have transformed Altria following the spin off of Philip Morris International. ","I believe that Altria has many strengths that position our company to continue increasing value for shareholders. These include the strong premium brands of our tobacco operating companies, which hold leading positions in the largest and most profitable tobacco segments. A deep knowledge of adult tobacco consumers and a focus on innovation, growing alcohol assets, well-developed capabilities to manage external challenges and a strong balance sheet that supports superior cash returns to shareholders. ","As I prepare to retire, I am excited about Altria's prospects for the future and have great confidence in the leaders that will guide the company to its next phase of growth. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Howard Willard, who will discuss Altria's business results in more detail.","Howard A. Willard","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. In the smokable products segment, first quarter reported operating companies income grew by 5.1%, primarily due to higher list prices and effective cost management. These factors were partially offset by lower reported shipment volume and higher promotional spending to support Marlboro's brand-building and equity-enhancing products and programs. ","Excluding the special items, first quarter adjusted operating companies income for the smokable products segment increased by 3.9% to $1.4 billion, behind higher pricing and cost savings. Adjusted operating companies income margins increased 1.5 percentage points to 41%, driven by Marlboro. ","PM USA's reported cigarette shipments decreased 2.6% for the first quarter, primarily due to trade inventory dynamics. Trade inventories were lower in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth and first quarters of 2011. The impact of lower trade inventories was partially offset by retail share gains on L&M and Marlboro and one additional shipping day. ","When adjusted for trade inventories and one extra shipping day, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume was essentially flat for the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year period. PM USA estimates that the total cigarette categories adjusted volume declined approximately 2.5% in the first quarter, which is consistent with historical price elasticity and the secular rate of decline. ","On a sequential basis, PM USA had strong 2012 first quarter retail share results, increasing 0.6 of a share point versus the fourth quarter of 2011 to 49.4%. This sequential share gain was driven by Marlboro, which grew 0.7 of a share point, partially offset by a 0.1 of a share point loss on other premium brands. Our discount portfolio was unchanged on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011. ","PM USA's first quarter retail share on a year-over-year basis increased 0.4 of a share point to 49.4%, as Marlboro share was up 0.1 of a share point to 42.3% and discount share gains on L&M more than offset share losses for other portfolio brands. ","Cigar shipment volume increased 14.3% for the first quarter, driven primarily by retail share gains, changes in wholesale trade inventories and one extra shipping day. ","Black & Mild's retail share increased 1.4 share points to 30.7%, driven by the success of its Classic, Sweets and wine untipped cigarillos and continued strength in its core tipped cigarillos. ","Turning to smokeless products. Reported operating companies income for this segment decreased 0.5% to $192 million for the first quarter, due primarily to higher restructuring charges and lower reported volume, mostly offset by higher pricing and lower cost. ","When adjusted for restructuring charges, operating companies income increased 8.8% to $211 million. ","Reported smokeless products shipment volume decreased 7.5% in the first quarter of 2012. Volume gains for Copenhagen were more than offset by declines for Skoal and other brands, which both faced difficult comparisons versus the prior year. ","In the first quarter of 2011, Marlboro and Skoal each introduced 2 new Snus products, and Skoal introduced 8 new Skoal X-tra products late in the quarter. Skoal's volume was also impacted by the delisting of 7 SKUs in the second quarter of 2011. ","Our adjusted smokeless volume is difficult to estimate on a quarterly basis. USSTC and PM USA believe that their combined 2012 first quarter adjusted smokeless products volume grew more than the recent category trends due to strong retail share gains. USSTC and PM USA estimates that the smokeless products category grew by 5% over the 12 months ended March 2012. ","USSTC and PM USA's retail share of the smokeless products category increased 1 share point to 55.5%. New products introduced by Copenhagen in the recent years continued to have a positive impact on the brand's retail share. Copenhagen's first quarter retail share grew by a strong 2.7 share points to 27.8%. ","Skoal's share declined 0.4 of a share point to 22.1% as share losses, including those related to last year's delisting of 7 Skoal SKUs, were partially offset by gains on Skoal X-tra that was introduced last year. ","Ste. Michelle's reported operating companies income of $15 million was up 25% for the first quarter, but adjusted operating companies income was flat, excluding the impact of restructuring costs in 2011. Ste. Michelle has made investments in its sales force to support its goal of expanding distribution of its premium brands. These investments, along with higher costs for certain wine vintages in the first quarter of 2012, offset the impact of revenue gains from higher volume. ","Ste. Michelle's shipment volume increased 6.6% for the first quarter, driven by the growth in certain premium brands. The financial services segment's reported operating companies income increased by more than 100% to $52 million for the first quarter, driven by gains from asset sales. Our 2011 cost management program remains on track, and we have recorded net pretax charges of $228 million over the past 2 quarters. We expect to incur approximately $70 million in pretax restructuring charges in the balance of 2012 related to this program. These 2012 restructuring charges are reflected in our full year diluted EPS guidance that we've reaffirmed today. ","Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro's price GAAP versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 35% in the first quarter. Marlboro's net pack price in the first quarter was $5.71, while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.23. The cigarette discount category's retail share was 27.5% for the first quarter. ","The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the first quarter was $1.37 per pack, unchanged from the fourth quarter and up $0.01 versus the first quarter of last year. ","Copenhagen's first quarter retail price was $4.10 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand is approximately 41% in the quarter. ","CapEx was $16 million for the first quarter. We estimate capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $150 million. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $56 million for the first quarter. ","On April 16, PM USA made its annual MSA payment for 2011 of approximately $3.5 billion. This amount includes approximately $206 million that was paid into the MSA's disputed payment account, reflecting the amount that PM USA disputes those as a result of 2009 non-participating manufacturer adjustment. ","Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nik Modi of UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A quick question I had. First is just curious on your thoughts on the e-cigarette category just in lieu of what Lorillard announced yesterday, that's question number one. And the second question is if I understand the architectural correctly, it's going to be fully implemented at retail by the end of the second quarter. And I'm just curious if you've tested this and kind of if you have what some of the early context you got from those test markets? Those 2 questions, any context will be helpful.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I'm not sure what the first question was, Nick, relative to e-cigarettes. Is there a specific question?","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Just curious on your thoughts on the category. I mean is this something you think Altria should get involved in? Is it a category you think is viable? I mean certainly, there's a lot of different viewpoints on Snus. I'm just curious on your views on the category.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well look, we pay attention to all of these, I guess, emerging segments and watch what's going on and do some research. And so we've been monitoring this one for some time. It's been around for a while. There's a pretty high awareness, but it represents still a pretty small business proposition. And so we're mindful of it. We pay attention to it. And that's about all I can say about it. And then relative to your second question, what was it?","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, just on the architecture. I guess it's going to be helpful if...","Michael E. Szymanczyk","On the architecture. Well, we did some very specific consumer research relative to this architecture. It's not the kind of thing that you would market test because it would be pretty hard to read it among all the noise that exists in the market. But you really rely more on the consumer research relative to communication around the segments and the particular audiences that each segment's designed to appeal to. And yes, we did research that before we decided to move to this architecture. I hope that answers your question.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivien Azer of Citi.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Curious about the share gains from Marlboro Black. Could you quantify the contribution from that line extension to the quarterly share gain from Marlboro?","Howard A. Willard","Well no, we haven't. We don't usually break out the individual segments of Marlboro. But as I said in my remarks, we're pretty pleased with Marlboro Black so far. We recognize that some of that was driven by introductory support. But that's okay, that's part of introducing a new product. And we're pretty pleased with the rest of the franchise as well.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Absolutely. And then in terms of the introductory support that you're offering for Marlboro Black, on a percentage basis, is it roughly in line, the kind of level of discounting your promotion that you're putting behind that line extension? Is it in line with the prior Marlboro line extensions?","Howard A. Willard","I don't know if I'd quantify it, but I would say there's nothing unusual about it, okay? It's not an abnormally high level. I mean, we have a promotion level and we have trial events for adult smokers that are more limited in terms of their quantity and duration. So both of those things are typical as part of a new product launch. So there's nothing really I would say that's exceptional or meaningfully different about Marlboro Black's introductory plan from things that we've done in the past.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. And lastly, could you just comment on inventory levels at wholesale? That was certainty a big topic of discussion over the last 2 days and where you guys feel like settle down at the end of the quarter?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, there were some inventory movement downward -- wholesale inventory movement and a little bit of retail inventory movement downward in the first quarter; not wholly unexpected. So we kind of, I think, said at the end of the year in the fourth quarter that our inventory levels for the fourth quarter of '11 were pretty much in line with where they were in the prior year. And then they've dropped a bit as we've gone to the first quarter. You expect some permanent inventory loss relative to the cigarette business because the business has a decline rate associated with it that's ongoing. And then there are movements in inventory that are driven by various wholesaler activities and needs that are less predictable. It's hard to quantify how much of this is permanent and how much is kind of sporadic movement. But I think most of it's probably sporadic movement. I don't think we're expecting to see any real changes in wholesale inventory levels beyond what you predict just from the normal industry change.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So thinking about the cadence of, I guess, the quarterly flow of Marlboro Black, can we think about Special Blend as, I guess, a good model for that, right, where you come out in the first couple the full quarters out there you kind of peak and then you see it kind of move off. And I guess I ask in the context of some of the stuff you said around expecting a moderation into 2013 on some of the trial-building stuff. I guess can you just talk about how that flow might be relative to market share, how you'd expect it to go?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I think that's kind of competitively sensitive information. So I could be somewhat reluctant to talk about that in any detail. We will -- because Marlboro Black is 1 of the 4 core segments for Marlboro going forward, we have initiatives and activities planned for it. So that will be ongoing. We won't run introductory trial levels on the product at the same level we've done early on as a continuum. But the objective will be to build that franchise over time. So we will have ongoing activities there and we'll have activities in the other 3 segments as well, so all the focus won\u2019t be on Black. Part of the limit to this architecture is it really allows each one of these areas to pursue the consumer group that it matches up to best in its own way. So you can expect to see ongoing activity on Marlboro Black.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And as a follow-up, I guess, to one of the other questions. You're saying there was nothing unusual at all in the promo. I mean, you didn't run introductory levels spending any longer from Black in duration than you did for previous launches. Is that fair?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","We're not finished with Black yet. So I can't speak to some finality on Black. We're still in the introductory phase of Marlboro Black. And we'll have activities going on in Marlboro Black all year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess maybe if you could talk a little bit more about the promotional environment. Obviously, your competitors sort of called out a pretty intense promotional activity that they saw in Q1. And it looks like if I look at Marlboro's pricing per pack, perhaps down sequentially from Q4 by a couple of pennies? So is that really sort of that trial-driven initiative that you put in into the marketplace? It looks like L&M also gained share. So just sort of talk about the competitive landscape and your spending to see some of the share gains and how we should think about sort of your ability to balance share and profit as we stand today?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Yes. Well, I didn't think that we saw a real meaningfully different competitive environment in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. And I also don't think we saw any dynamic change in key segments in the category. I mean, the discount segment declined a little bit in favor of the premium segment. But all 3 of the major premium brands grew some shares, so you would expect to see a little bit of that. There was continued interplay in the discount level as pricing changed on various brands and retailers had activities focused in the discount area where there's less equity and the shifting between brands is more driven by price. Most of L&M's year-over-year share gain occurred in 2011 at a modest share increase, the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, and that continues to really represent some recovery from basic share that we lost. So I just can't tell you that we saw lots of dynamic change. Now look, we're installing a major equity initiative on Marlboro that will continue for a while. And it's established some of the new architecture. The launching of an element of that architecture. And so we made some investment relative to that, which is to be expected. That's part of what we've said all along is the way we'll run the business. And I'll remind you of what our goals are here. We've said we want to maximize income and maintain modest share momentum over time. And I think we've been pretty explicit about saying we really don't want to chase share with pricing. We want to spend money to build long-term equity initiatives. And so the architecture on Marlboro and Marlboro Black, those things are long-term equity initiatives and they're worthy of investment because that's the way we'll be able to accrue increased revenue over time from the brand and grow overall profitability. So that's kind of the way we see it. I don't see it as a particularly unusual thing, nor do I see the kinds of introductory activity or the way we're approaching it to be in any way out of sorts versus what you'd expect in the packaged goods business on big brands and the way they're run.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so then on pricing, so I know you don't break out PM USA anymore, but can you give us any color just in terms of cigarettes revenue per unit kind of year-over-year change?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","No, I'm not going to give out those specific numbers. But once again, I think if you look at the overall smokable business what you're going to see, Judy, is that hey, we had some nice margin expansion in that business. And we had what we would say for a period of time where we had inventory depletions and we had investment behind new brand architecture, we had nice income growth. And I think that's really what we're looking at.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then at the industry level, for the rate of decline 2.5% adjusted for inventory, so certainly a much better number that we've seen in the last couple of years. So anything that you think is driving that improvement? And do you think that's sort of now a run rate that we should think about for the foreseeable future for the industry as a whole?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I don't know. We can't predict the future and this stuff ebbs and flows based on market conditions and based on taxes and all kinds of things like that. So there's also some, I think, interplay between the smokable segment and the smokeless segment. And so we're seeing a little more moderate growth rate in the smokable segment. At the same time, we've seen more modest declines in the smokable segments, so all of that seems to tie together pretty well. I don't think there's much that's new here relative to the behaviors among consumers related to these tobacco segments.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And good luck, Mike.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christina McGlone-Hahn of Deutsche Bank.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just following on the previous question, if we think about Marlboro and the Black introduction and then follow up with EIGHTY-THREE and, I guess, introductions in the brand families over the next 2 years, I guess I wanted to get a sense what -- to what extent are these activities added to brand equity so that when promotion is pulled back, share will still be up versus 2011.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, we do audit them as part of our brand equity study, and I think we shared with you in February at CAGNY that when you look at Special Blend as an example, it actually gets higher equity scores than the already high scores that the Marlboro franchise gets. So we pay pretty close attention to those things, because ultimately, our objective is going to be have the whole platform be able to continue to grow and have value over time. So we do keep a pretty close eye on that.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And as promotional spending is pulled back when you're past the introductory phase, you think -- I mean all this activity, to what extent can we be confident that it really augments total Marlboro share?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, you get with any of these things you get some slippage. So you're going to get some incremental share growth just like we got behind special blend, and then you're going to have some of it that is simply promotion sensitive consumers that shift around between promotional products that are available on our brands and on competitor brands. And so that slippage kind of will go away. But net out of that is we typically get a gain in both share and revenue and profit growth when we do these kinds of things.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the competitive response, given the promotion on each of the Black launch, which is typical, but the pricing, which we estimate about 2%, was kind of the lowest rate of growth since '08. And we're just curious what you've seen in terms of competitive response or what you anticipate to see.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I can't anticipate what the competitors are going to do, but I think that the market remains competitive. But you may recall we showed you a chart at the CAGNY presentation that showed net effective price and the relationship between Marlboro and its key competitors, including some key discount competitors. And I can tell you that through the first quarter, those relationships didn't change at all. So that factors in all promotion, and there just wasn't any movement there in terms of the relationship between those products.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And on smokeless, we saw pricing much better than we expected, but volume lower. And as we lap fiscal X-tra the delisting -- I'm sorry, the Skoal delisting, in the second quarter, should we expect to see volume rebound in the second half, or is there something else that needs to be done on Skoal to help with volume?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, volume in the first quarter is a little bit difficult to read because there are several factors that affected the quarterly volumes. So I wouldn't get too caught up in it. When we look at it on an adjusted basis, we think that the volumes were on a little bit ahead of the industry volume or the industry growth rate for the smokeless business. Just a word about Copenhagen and Skoal; we look at these 2 brands together. And I think over time, both of these brands are going to be successful. They -- actually having 2 of them with some significant scale gives us some good opportunities from a competitive point of view to strategically approach the marketplace. But we're looking at the total between these 2 brands. And I think you can expect over time to see one or the other being more active and growing more because we will be doing things on these brands differently over time. And they won't necessarily both grow at even rates. And in the end, it will be the total that will be most interested and that's the way we're looking at the business. Skoal has been pretty stable here and it's still facing headwinds from the discontinuation of some SKUs. And I think Copenhagen is growing really quite nicely, and Skoal is having to compete with that, but Skoal's time is going to come as well and I think the collective performance of these 2 brands is going to be quite good.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two things I wanted to ask you. First, given the efforts in the spending on Marlboro Black in the quarter, did you hope for or plan or expect more than 10 basis points of year-on-year share growth for Marlboro?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","No, I don't think so. I think we felt like Marlboro performed pretty well in the first quarter. It was up. I mean, you have to really look at where it landed for the year and it was in pretty good position relative to that. After the launch period of Marlboro Black and this architecture activity is just getting started really in terms of playing out with the consumer. So I think we feel pretty good about Marlboro and where we're headed with it. I mean remember, the goal here is to maximize income and get modest share momentum over time. So we're not looking for huge share gains in short periods of time on this brand. And as I mentioned a minute ago, it's difficult to launch things and go into the marketplace without having some slippage due to spinning in the marketplace and getting some business that really isn't going to be long-term business. But that's part of what you have to do in order to build a franchise for the long-term. So we accept that we've got some of that going on. I feel few pretty good about Marlboro, and I think we're just getting started with our architecture. I think we're very optimistic about Marlboro's prospects for the future.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And I wanted to ask a financial question on the remaining of the residual potential SILO\/LILO income tax exposure. Given what must be a fairly high statutory rate of interest that you would ultimately have to pay, how keen are you on trying to quickly resolve the remaining issue?","Howard A. Willard","Well as you know, that's been an issue that's ongoing. But if you look of the impact of our financial statements, really the impact of the charge was really reflected in the second quarter of last year. And through the end of this quarter, we estimate that the future cash outflow for that is about $600 million. With regard to the timing, obviously we've got a lot of activity going on with regard to that litigation. I think the timing of that cash outflow is going to depend on a number of future activities.","Operator","At this time, we would like to invite the media to join the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Could you give us a little bit more background on Marlboro EIGHTY-THREES? How are they different from this regular king-sized Marlboro Red?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, they're 83 millimeters.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So 1 millimeter difference?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","No, no, no. Marlboro Red is not 80 millimeters, okay? So it's a different sized cigarette.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And I understand it comes in different packaging?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","It does.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So what gives you confidence that this won't be a massive cannibalization of Marlboro Red?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, we obviously research these things and Marlboro Red has a very loyal franchise that likes that product. So we wouldn't anticipate that we're going to get a large amount of cannibalization.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I assume there will be introductory project for EIGHTY-THREES as well?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, we got an introductory program for EIGHTY-THREES, it's a bit different. I'm not going to describe it because I'd rather -- my competitors have to figure it out. But it's a bit different than, for example, the Black launch.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last question on pricing. I'm just following up on a question that Judy asked. You've introduced or you announced price increases of $0.15 over the last 12 months, yet the retail price from Marlboro moved by $0.01. Was it driven by increased promotions, was it driven by more retail spending on Marlboro? Can you elaborate on that a little?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I think it's a lot factors. I think what retailers decided to do from a pricing point of view is certainly a factor. The competitive marketplace is a factor. So I think that it's influenced by a number of things.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Has Special Blends role changed at all with the new Marlboro architecture, or is that basically the same?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, in the context of the Marlboro architecture, there are -- there's a Special Blend in the Red line, there's a Special Blend in the Gold line of this proposition. So if you look at these 4 families in the Marlboro architecture, Special Blend exists within those families as a part of the architecture. It doesn't exist as a singular line of products.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And have you thought about the pricing any differently? I know you said you've got these higher than the base equity scores. Have you been able to price that up since the introduction?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Yes, absolutely. Marlboro Special Blend has been subject to the same list price increases that everything else in the Marlboro line.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","I'm sorry, I guess I mean on like a net pricing, like have you been able to promote it less? I mean, what kind of trajectory has the promotions been on that?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, the answer to that question is the answer I just gave you. We're taking these price increases and we always realize part of those price increases to the company's profitability.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","That's helpful. And then on your corporate unallocated cost, they were roughly flat year-over-year. Have any -- should we expect to see any of the restructuring savings coming through that line or is it just in the operating segments? How should we think about that one?","Howard A. Willard","Yes. I think you'll see some of the savings flow through that line, but a lot of the savings are really going to flow through the costs that are allocated to the various tobacco businesses, particularly the smokable business because that's where a lot of the activity is focused. And that will unfold as the year progresses.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Yes, that's what I was going to -- and so you've realized some of that, but there's still more of those savings you would expect to be coming?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Yes. Some of that has come through in the first quarter in a number of the different cost elements in selling, general and administrative. But you should expect to see more as the year unfolds.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just have a couple of questions for you, a bit of a follow-up. I wanted to ask a question regarding Marlboro, regarding the MLP program and some of the variations. So that changed a little bit earlier in the year, as I understand. Just to be clear on how that is playing out at retail and how that could be a factor or is that a factor in the retail price change year-over-year. I guess the question being, are you seeing that program lead to lower retail prices for Marlboro at retail?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I think what we see our trade programs do is they certainly have many retailers competing aggressively using Marlboro as a vehicle to compete with. And sometimes, that has some bearing on pricing.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I wanted to ask also relative to the level of discount growth in the quarter, and particularly the performance of L&M. Was that a function of increased promotional spending and\/or, I guess, an increase in distribution, geographic push for that brand? I'm just curious what's driving that growth.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","It's really kind of lacking what occurred in 2011 where we had some distribution expansion of L&M throughout the year of 2011, as we were kind of replacing some of the lost basic shares. So it built out a pretty good level by the -- into the fourth quarter, and it picked up a 0.10 in the first quarter. But not with any real change in anything that we were doing.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my last question is relative to the smokeless category and just what you expect in terms of growth for the category for the year. Should we expect the sort of 5% increase in volume for the year? Is that a good run rate you believe for the category?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, that's what it's running at. I mean, we can't predict the future. But this category has kind of run in 5% to 6% range and you're always estimating these things will dip, and there's some interplay between it in the smokable segment. But that seems to be a reasonable range to think about, I guess.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I wish you all the best, Mike, in your retirement.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about within the Marlboro family, are you seeing consumers move from the discount category into the Marlboro family under the new architecture? And if so, is that movement in line with expectations?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I think that we see some competitive consumers that have some interest in Marlboro that may have been buying competitive products, not necessarily discount products, but competitive other premium brands. Finding some of these SKU expansions that we've done to be products that they like and that's how we sustain share growth on the brand. That's one of the reasons why we've articulated this past -- in the past, why we think some of the SKU work that we've done over time is important to the brand because it allows us to reach out to a broader universe of adult tobacco consumers. Because essentially, your mainline products get of sufficient size and have had broad base trial and some consumers are not buying them because they don't like those particular products. And so maybe they like the Marlboro franchise, they just don't like that set of products and so you try and reach out to them with something that they find more appealing.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then with regards -- you all had a nice quarter, double-digit volume growth, some of that due to trade inventory movement. Can you help me with how I should think about volumes for the cigar business for the year?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I don't know how to predict just going forward in the future what it's going to be. So it's kind of something I would hesitate to try to comment on.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Fair to say it should grow there?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","We hope it does.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] Alexander of Basel Associates [ph].","Unknown Attendee","As you look at the smokeless category, can you give us any feel as to your profitability trend over the next few years? I know you had a lot of restructuring, you've had a lot of positioning. Is there -- can you give us any feel as how much the operating profit margins can increase or what you'd like to have happen?","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Well, I think our objective is we've said before is to have volume growth in this growing category that's slightly ahead of the category and that will be driven by modest share growth and we already have very nice margins in this category. And so if you put all that together, what you should expect is to see, we'd like to see income growth in the category that is kind of running a bit ahead of the overall category growth rate. And so far, we feel pretty good about what we've been able to achieve in this business. And I think sometimes, it's difficult for people outside it to understand this, but we've gotten really substantial synergy to have in this business and that has benefited our other businesses. And we also have substantial R&D opportunities related to this business that we believe long term also will add growth to the company. So I think that we look very favorably on the prospects and contributions from our smokeless business.","Unknown Attendee","Good luck on your retirement and have fun.","Michael E. Szymanczyk","Thank you very much.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Brendan McCormick for closing comments.","Brendan McCormick","Thank you, everyone, for joining our call this morning.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.","Bill Marshall - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you, Laurie. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're here this morning with Howard Willard, Altria's CEO; and Billy Gifford, Altria's CFO, to discuss Altria's 2018 third quarter and first nine months business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing these results, which is available on our website at altria.com and through the Altria Investor app.","During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2017. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements, and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.","Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Howard.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Altria delivered excellent third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 20% and continued to return large amounts of cash to our shareholders. Our tobacco businesses are successfully executing against their strategies, while making strategic investments to drive long-term success. Before moving to our third quarter results, I'd like to address recent FDA activity.","In September, the FDA asked several companies, including Altria, to provide plans to address underage use of e-vapor products. We welcomed FDA's action and we agreed that the reported rise in underage use of e-vapor products is alarming and immediate action should be taken. We're also concerned that use of e-vapor products may jeopardize the harm reduction opportunity for e-vapor. We recently met with Commissioner Gottlieb to discuss steps that could be taken to address underage access and use.","Consistent with our discussion with the FDA and because we believe in the long-term promise of e-vapor products and harm reduction, we're taking immediate action to address this complex situation. First, Nu Mark will remove from the market MarkTen Elite and Apex by MarkTen pod-based products until these products receive a market order from the FDA or the youth issue is otherwise addressed.","Second, for our remaining MarkTen and Green Smoke cig-a-like products, Nu Mark will sell only tobacco, menthol and mint varieties. Nu Mark will discontinue the sale of all other flavor variants of our cig-a-like products until these products receive a market order from the FDA or the youth issue is otherwise addressed. Although we don't believe we have a current issue with youth access or use of our e-vapor products, we are taking this action because we don't want to risk contributing to the issue.","Additionally, we will support federal legislation to establish 21 as the minimum age to purchase any tobacco product. We think it makes sense to accomplish this through a phased-in approach. For context, we estimate that approximately 5% of adult tobacco consumers are legal age through 20, and that this age demographic represents approximately 2% of cigarette (4:24) industry volumes, 4% of smokeless industry volumes and 15% of e-vapor industry volumes.","We, of course, recognize the impacts these decisions will have on our consumers, trade partners, suppliers and others. We believe these actions are essential to addressing the youth e-vapor epidemic and preserving the long-term harm reduction opportunity for e-vapor products. We support adult tobacco consumer choice and the promise of tobacco harm reduction, and we fully intend to operate compelling portfolio of e-vapor products for adult smokers and vapors.","Through the FDA's product review pathways or when underage use of e-vapor is addressed. After removing Nu Mark's pod-based products and cig-a-like flavor variants, approximately 80% of Nu Mark's e-vapor volume in the third quarter of 2018 will remain on the market. These actions are outlined in our written response to the FDA, which was posted earlier this morning to altria.com.","With that, let's move now to our operating results. The smokeable products segment performed in line with our expectations, while adjusted operating companies income in the third quarter was essentially flat from the prior year, PM USA continues to make progress stabilizing Marlboro share through investments in the brand's equity. Marlboro's retail share decreased 0.1 of a share point in the third quarter to 43.1%, but is unchanged from its fourth quarter 2017 share. Billy will provide additional detail on our brand equity investments in a minute.","Next, the smokeless products segment delivered adjusted operating companies income growth of 7% in the third quarter, largely driven by strong net price realization. USSTC's total smokeless share grew 0.1 of a share point in the third quarter to 54.1%. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal share was unchanged in the third quarter at 50.7%, and was up 0.30 of a share point (06:40) from the fourth quarter of 2017. In heated tobacco, PM USA's initial lead market plans for IQOS are ready and we remain hopeful for FDA authorization by year-end.","So in summary, we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term value to shareholders by maximizing our core tobacco businesses, pursuing innovative reduced risk products and responsibly leading our industry forward through tobacco harm reduction. We believe our year-to-date performance positions us well to deliver on our full year plans. As a result, we are tightening our guidance, raising the lower end of our full-year 2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $3.95 for a revised range of $3.95 to $4.03, representing a growth rate of 16.5% to 19% from the 2017 base.","I'll now turn it over to Billy to provide more detail on our quarterly performance.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Howard, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the smokeable products segment. In the third quarter, smokeable adjusted OCI was essentially unchanged from the prior year as higher resolution expenses, lower cigarette volume and higher cost, including strategic business investments, were offset by higher pricing.","Smokeable adjusted OCI margins declined 1.4 percentage points to 50.4%. The smokeable products segment's reported cigarette shipment volume declined by 3.7% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline and retail share losses, partially offset by trade inventory movements. After adjusting for trade inventory movements, cigarette volumes declined an estimated 5% in the quarter and an estimated 5.5% in the first nine months.","We estimate that cigarette industry volumes declined approximately 4.5% in both the third quarter and for the first nine months. While the economic environment remains positive for the adult tobacco consumer, we believe increased gas prices, continued movement by adult smokers among tobacco categories, including e-vapor, and state excise taxes affected cigarette volumes in the quarter. We estimate the state excise tax increases on July 1 in Kentucky and Oklahoma had an impact to cigarette industry volumes of just under 0.5%.","As Howard mentioned earlier, PM USA's investments have helped stabilize share for Marlboro. Marlboro's limited time rewards program in Texas, Points West, exceeded PM USA's expectations in creating excitement for the brand by increasing Marlboro's digital engagement with adult smokers. During the nine month enrollment period, over 150,000 adult smokers, 21 and older, in Texas enrolled in the program and entered nearly two million pack codes. And the frequency of engagement on Marlboro.com increased by over 45% in Texas.","Building up the success of Points West in Texas, which ended in the third quarter, PM USA plans to launch Marlboro Rewards nationally in January of 2019. PM USA's excited to offer Marlboro Rewards to adult smokers 21 and older, with the goal of increasing its digital leadership, brand engagement and Marlboro's already strong brand equity and loyalty.","On the product side, Marlboro Ice has performed well since its national expansion in the first quarter with adult consumers responding favorably to the innovative reseal pack. And this quarter, PM USA is expanding this packaging technology to other offerings, including Marlboro Smooth, a unique menthol offering. PM USA continues to pursue opportunities to use this innovative packaging in the future.","In the super-premium tobacco and water segment, Nat Sherman has delivered solid performance following the regional expansion of Nat's across the Western United States earlier this year. And the team is evaluating further expansion opportunities. The cigar business continued to perform well, growing reported shipment volume nearly 7% in the third quarter and more than 4% for the first nine months. As a reminder for the fourth quarter, the smokeable products segment will have an extra shipping day compared to the prior year.","Turning to our smokeless products segment, adjusted OCI grew 7% in the third quarter, primarily driven by higher pricing partially offset by higher cost. Smokeless products segment adjusted shipment volume declined an estimated 0.5% for the first nine months. Smokeless industry volume declined an estimated 1% over the past six months. We continue to believe that smokeless industry volume is being affected by higher pricing in the category and adult tobacco consumer movement among tobacco products, including e-vapor products.","During the third quarter, USSTC announced plans to expand Copenhagen's Smooth Wintergreen to 22 states. This offering provides a balanced wintergreen flavor for adult dippers seeking a differentiated less intense wintergreen flavor. In September, the FDA accepted and filed, versus standard scientific review, USSTC's modified risk tobacco product application for Copenhagen Snuff. The FDA will now begin this review process, which includes opportunities for public comment. We are looking forward to engaging with FDA on this application.","Turning to our alcohol assets. Ste. Michelle's adjusted OCI decreased $7 million in the third quarter primarily driven by higher marketing and sales expenses and lower shipment volume, partially offset by favorable mix. In beer, adjusted earnings from our equity investment in AB InBev were $224 million in the third quarter, which reflects Altria's share of AB InBev's second quarter results.","We continue to return cash to shareholders, paying out over $3.9 billion in dividends through the first nine months of 2018. And in August, we increased our dividend by 14.3%, the second increase this year resulting in an overall quarterly dividend rate increase of 21.2% since the beginning of the year.","Altria's current annualized dividend rate of $3.20 per share represents an annual dividend yield of 5.2% as of October 19, 2018. We also repurchased approximately $367 million of shares in the third quarter and over $1.3 billion for the first nine months. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $700 million remaining in the current share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of the second quarter of 2019.","With that, we'll wrap up and Howard and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available in altria.com.","We've posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items. We've also included some historical data on the discount category dynamics, we discussed last quarter. Specifically, the churn between deep discount and branded discount. The chart shows that the overall discount category retail share has been relatively stable over time and that deep discount retail share, while experiencing recent growth, has been at even higher levels in the past than currently.","With that, I'll open the question-and-answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Michael.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Your stance with the FDA and this proactive approach, I think, reinforces the leadership role you've had with regulatory stuff. But can you just elaborate a little bit on your thinking on the pods versus cig-a-likes, and what some of the distinctions between the two might be that you're thinking about as you make this announcement?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes. I mean, I think the way we thought about this was that we believe e-vapor has a lot of opportunity to convert adult cigarette smokers in the short, medium and long term. But clearly, the significant increase in youth usage of the products puts that at risk, and we think rapid and significant action is necessary.","And I think as we looked at the data that is available and some of the remarks from the FDA, I think we concluded that the driver of the recent increase, we think, is pod-based products and flavored products. And so we thought that the two actions that we took addressed the drivers of the increased usage here in the short run. And then of course, our decision to support a minimum age to purchase going forward at the federal level of 21, we think, also can help address this issue. Because the data we've seen from the past study shows that the primary source of youth access to these e-vapor products is social access, and we think if the minimum age to purchase is raised to 21 should have a significant impact on that.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's helpful. Thank you. And then just one more as you look at some of the brand reinvestments you've been making this year, could you just give a little more color, elaborate some, I know you touched on Points West and the expansion of Marlboro Rewards, can you just give a little more color on what those involved or just maybe bring that to life a little bit and help us understand some of what those programs look like?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure, Michael. I think if you would look at the overall brand equity that we've spent on (17:36) as well as product launches. So, from a standpoint of sort of the SKU launches that we had in the beginning part of the year through the third quarter, when you launch something like that, you want to make sure you have the right support in the marketplace and the right call out to consumers. So we have Marlboro Ice, we had Copenhagen Smooth, we had the expansion of Nat's, and so those are product launches that occurred through the first nine months of the year.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","And Michael, specifically on Points West, which I know was only available in Texas so you might not have seen it, essentially, it's a program that drives up engagement between Marlboro consumers and our digital resources, where they can scan or enter unique codes on their pack in order to earn rewards. And we found that it significantly increased consumer engagement with Marlboro.com. And of course, we're going to broaden that to national availability next year, which we think is a big step forward for the engagement with our digital assets.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","And I know that branded merchandise isn't part the rewards program the way I believe it had been long ago, but what are the kind of rewards that the program includes?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","You're exactly right. It's not branded merchandise the way it might have been a couple of decades ago. It includes \u2013 we'll make charitable contributions on the behalf of the consumer or they can get a variety of digital rewards, whether it's digital cards or movie passes or those kinds of things. It's a much lower cost way to do it if you use more of a digital approach.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Chris.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Just had a question for you if I could. Just to understand as you enter the year and you had the tax savings, you're spending quite aggressively behind the business this year, seeing some good success behind Marlboro. I had two questions related to that. One would be that part of your spending plans for the year did include IQOS that obviously has not occurred yet, we're hoping it happens by year end, obviously, is that pushing your spending to (19:55) 2019, I guess is question number one.","And then related to that, Marlboro's showing some progress and stabilizing its share, are you satisfied with that performance or would you like to spend more behind that to try and accelerate that rate of market share growth?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'll take the first part of that Chris. From the standpoint of the investment spending, you're right, we had tax money and investment related to IQOS. We have made some of that investment to be fully prepared for when that's approved by the FDA so that we're ready to launch.","From a standpoint of IQOS, you're right, if we don't spend it this year, it certainly pushes into next year and we're excited to spend that money behind the brand and the launch of that. From a standpoint of the impact to the year, I think we've incorporated that in the guidance. We always have a list of investments that we want to make. So you point out one in IQOS, that's a favorable that allowed us to invest in other parts of the business.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","And if I address your question on how we feel about Marlboro performance in the cigarette category, and I would tell you that we are very pleased with the performance across our portfolio in the cigarette category. And I think that we feel that our investments have generated quite nice outcomes this year. And I might refer you to kind of the long-term performance in the PM USA portfolio and I'll take you back to 2011 before the launch of the Marlboro architecture and compare it to the first nine months of 2018.","Marlboro's up 0.40 of a share point, the Altria Group share in the discount category is up 1.5 share points, and the total discount category is down 0.60 of a share point. And of course, both Marlboro and our discount brand, L&M, are at much higher margins in 2018 than they were in 2011. So even though there's a little bit of movement a 0.10 or 0.20 (21:47) this year compared to last year, we tend to manage for the long term and feel very good about the performance of the cigarette business.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And if I could just ask one quick one in relation to these pod-based products, is that something that you're prepared to seek approval for \u2013 to going through the PMTA process to the FDA, or will you wait to do that? Just curious kind of where you stand and your ability to seek that approval.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes. I think you're right. What we announced is that we're going to withdraw those products either until we file a PMTA or until FDA takes other action to address youth usage. And that means that one path to get those products or new pod-based products on the market for us is to file a PMTA. I don't know that we're in a position to announce when we expect to file that today, but we really feel like in light of this dramatic increase in youth usage, withdrawing those products until the PMTA is filed is one path forward.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Unknown Speaker","Hi everyone. This is Jack (23:01) on the line for Judy. So I have a couple of questions just to start off, I was wondering if you could dig a little bit more into your underlying performance of minus 5% versus industry of minus 4.5%, is that slight share loss from down trading, or maybe is that all we're seeing from Kentucky and Oklahoma? So if you could just generally give some color there, that'd be great.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. You're right, the adjusted cigarette industry volume on a year-over-year basis was down 4.5% and our adjusted cigarette volumes were down 5%. I think that is literally just a little bit further decline because on a year-over-year basis, our share was down a bit. But I would point out that our share has been stable since fourth quarter of this year, and we really feel now that we've lapped the impact of the California state excise tax increase that Marlboro's performance is stable and quite satisfying.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then briefly just on the ABI dividend cut, like given the volatility in their results and now there's less cash flowing through, how do you assess your investment in ABI going forward, as well as what their payout policy, based on net income, might mean for your share of the dividend going forward?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think when you look at that, we still think it's a great investment for the long term. From a standpoint of the actual dividend cut that they rebased that they announced today, if you think about where we were last year, the dividends received, 50% of that, it really has no significant impact to our liquidity, our earnings stream or our dividend policy.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, got you. And then if I could just sneak one more in there. What are your thoughts on margin flow-through this quarter? Is there anything you'd call out in terms of where those expenses were going and what might we expect for the balance of the year on that?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think when you look at that from a standpoint of where those are going, it's the business investments we've been calling out all year. So you'll recall, we were investing around R&D capabilities and applications that we filed. It's around the product launches and the reinvestment in the brands that have taken place through the first three quarters. As far as the fourth quarter, I can point you to the overall guidance, but we don't guide to margins looking forward.","Unknown Speaker","All right, great. Thank you so much.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. So I also wanted to talk about volumes. I totally appreciate the incremental headwind from tax and from gas, but if I think back prior to 2010, because we've obviously been kind of in a benign state excise tax environment for much of the last decade, and that's changing and reverting back to kind of normal course. But prior to 2010, state excise taxes, if I recall correctly on a weighted-average basis, used to go up like 8% to 12% a year, and the cigarette industry volume declines were down 3% to 4%, and so that was kind of embedded in the underlying price elasticity.","So the thing I'm having a hard time reconciling is your commentary over the past year, the price elasticities are generally holding up, but these incremental excise taxes are driving cigarette volume declines outside of the historical range. So any color you can offer would be helpful there. Thanks.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I think that we continue to have ample evidence that price elasticities have not changed. And you are right that with the exception of the California excise tax increase, which was significant, even the more recent state excise tax increases have not been out of line with the excise tax increases we had in the deep history. So I think it is less \u2013 again, setting aside California, it is less increased price elasticity action that is causing the 4.5% decline in the category. And I think it's really \u2013 it's a bit of a tick up in the secular decline here over the last quarter, and I think it's related partially to movement into the e-vapor category.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, that makes sense. Thank you for that. And have you gotten any color from the FDA on how your competitors are perhaps thinking about action in the e-cigarette category?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","We have not. We met with them last week. And we really spent our time talking about our perspective on how to address the issue, and we briefed them on the actions that, at that time, we were considering. And since then, we firmed them up and announced them this morning. We really don't have any visibility into competitor actions or, frankly, what the FDA will ultimately decide to do, ultimately.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thanks very much.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you. Good morning.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. My first question is on Marlboro. I guess, I want to hear, in your opinion, would you characterize Marlboro as now stabilized as you set out to achieve or what more would you like to see with the brand?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","I would characterize it as stable. I mean, if you look at it, it has been stabilizing since the third quarter of last year. And I wouldn't draw any alarm from the fact that it was down 0.1 of a share point (28:49) on a sequential basis. I think that the share trend is stabilized and we feel good about the investments we're going to make with the brand going forward.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And so given those investments, is it fair to assume that acceleration behind Marlboro is something that you're expecting to see? I guess I would answer yes, given you're going to increase investments behind the brand. So we should see Marlboro accelerate in the future. Would that be correct?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. I don't know that I would agree with that. I think that \u2013 we've been pretty happy with stable performance, and in a business where we're trying to maximize our profitability, I think we're pretty comfortable with stability. And I don't think that we're trying to significantly grow Marlboro share going forward. And, frankly, I think that we did have a bit of a stepped-up investment in Marlboro, among many other things, particularly on the equity side, but we don't feel like an increase in Marlboro investment going forward is necessary to retain that stability.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's actually really helpful. And then I have a question on a completely different topic. On cannabis, you've recently commented that you guys might be exploring this category, so maybe first confirm this. And then second, could you share for us why you see this as a potentially interesting opportunity, and then how you might approach the category, what competitive advantages you might have?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think I can confirm what we said at the Barclays conference, which is that we are exploring opportunities in the category. And we acknowledge that it is currently federally illegal in the U.S., but I think we think it's worth exploring the category because that might change in the future. And I'll hold back on explaining, in more detail, kind of how we view the category because we're relatively early in our exploration.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's fair. And then one final question for me, if I may, it's on your wine business. Constellation has made some comments recently about the state of the industry, noted a lot of challenges especially at the value end of the spectrum, and it's causing them to rethink their strategy and rationalize that into their business.","So I'd like to hear from you guys what trends you're seeing in wine broadly, and then how you're positioning yourself to maybe take advantage of ongoing (31:26) trends? And then just comment for us what your outlook is for this business. And in terms of your \u2013 or the (31:34) potential for you to add brands to your portfolio, really essentially, what's your long-term strategy there? Thanks.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I think you are right that, I would say, over the last two years, the wine business has gone through some choppy water. First of all, what had been a nice long-term growth rate slowed down. And then secondly, there had been very nice growth in the premium end of the wine business, which was $7 and above, which was where Ste. Michelle had a strong position.","And essentially, the strong growth rates actually moved from $7 and above to $10 and above. And as a result of that, I think not only our business, but many of the other wine businesses, are investing to reposition their portfolios to respond to that consumer activity. And that's part of what drove weaker performance this year than we've had in the long term past.","We are confident that the wine team is increasing investment and innovation in the $10 and above category, so we think we'll get the performance strengthened next year. But it is clearly not the same favorable category dynamics that we saw two or three years ago. I would also tell you that with regard to the wine business, it's a nice business for us. Historically, it's been a nice contributor to our growth, but we do view it as a non-core business where we're not going to make significant investments to add to that portfolio.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Just...","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","...a quick question on \u2013 good morning, Howard \u2013 just a quick question on your commentary regarding IQOS that you made in your prepared remarks, you suggested that you're expecting to get approved by the end of the year. And I'm just curious on, in your meetings with FDA, was there something specifically said? Because we've been waiting for quite some time for this approval to happen, so just wanted to get some more clarity around that.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","I think what I said was I was hopeful that it would be approved by the end of the year. I have to tell you that, as you know, I've been rather patient knowing that the FDA is reviewing this heated tobacco application in a category that's relatively new to them, but I really feel like, given the strength of the PMI application and the passage of time, that the answer should be due here in the near term.","But of course, as you know, we're already beyond sort of the guidance the FDA gave on how quickly they'd respond. So I think it's really hard to pin down exactly when that would come out. But it wouldn't surprise me at all if it came out between now and the end of the year. I think that the passage of time says that it's got to be getting ready to get an answer.","We have not gotten any specific information from the FDA that something would come out in the near term, but I wouldn't necessarily expect that. Normally, when FDA is getting ready to act, you'd hear about it because they tell you the definitive response.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Very helpful, Howard. And then the other question just on the category growth \u2013 or decline rates, you have a situation where it's a little bit above the normalized trend, but the pricing realization that's been taken in the industry is also higher than what we've normally seen over the last, let's call it, 18 months. So I was wondering if maybe you can comment on that. Do you think there's some increasing kind of deceleration in the category just because the pricing has been higher than normal?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. That probably has a small impact given the price elasticity impact of pricing. But I think it's probably a short-term elevation of the secular decline rate that's probably the bigger driver of it being 4.5% rather than the 3% to 4%. But I think you do point out something that I think is \u2013 that I believe, which is that I think we have a number of levers to pull in order to continue to drive nice business performance from PM USA even if this elevated decline rate of the category persists for a few more quarters or into the future.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, Howard.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi. Steve.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Hello. I guess, as we think more about the voluntary actions you took today, just based on your conversations \u2013 and I know you don't know \u2013 but do you see this conceivably as a kind of template that the FDA itself might follow in terms of incremental regulation on the e-vapor market, as we think about the next few months?","And then secondarily, related, do you see it at all as conceivable that the FDA might also consider pulling forward the revised product application deadline timeframe for e-vapor products from now, it is August 2022, to an earlier date? And if they did that, would you be in a position to comply?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I have to tell you, we had a good meeting with the FDA last week, and I think we spent quite a bit of time talking about the actions that we were thinking about taking. But I don't know that we have any deeper perspective on what the FDA is ultimately going to do, then I think the rest of the community has been listening to pretty significant comments that FDA has made. So I don't know that we know exactly what actions they're going to take.","I would tell you that I am convinced that they are going to take action to address the increase in youth usage and drive it down. I'm not sure exactly how, but I think they're committed to doing that. And frankly, the actions we took were the actions that we thought we could take that would have the biggest impact on addressing the increased use of e-vapor products by youth. Because we think that the long-term opportunity that e-vapor products present to converting adult cigarette smokers is potentially at risk if we don't address this youth issue. And we wanted to make a significant contribution to addressing the issue, and I think FDA is going to help address it as well.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I guess, maybe following up a little bit, the incremental step up in the secular decline rate that you just called out earlier being driven by e-vapor, maybe around about 1 point or so, which is something we agree with. As you look forward, do you think this is more \u2013 do you consider this more of a one-time step up? Maybe even it sounds like perhaps even a temporary step up, the way you're talking about it. But do you see that as more transient or fixed in nature? Or do you see that as something that continues to accelerate negatively if e-vapor penetration amongst adult tobacco consumers continues to grow?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. I don't think I gave an estimate of the actual numerical contribution of increased growth of e-vapor to the decline rate in cigarettes. But I would agree with you that I think that as you look at the decline rate of 4.5%, which is outside the 3% to 4% long-term range, I do think that probably two of the drivers of that are cigarette smokers increasingly trying e-vapor and now, I think also probably the increasing gas prices, most recently, is probably another contributor.","I think it's hard to tell how long it's going to persist. What we do know is that the stepped-up growth in e-vapor has been with us for the last, at least, four quarters, and over those four quarters, the rate of decline has been about 4.5%. But we also know that both gas prices and growth in e-vapor has been with us before, and then it significantly moderated, and I think that's had impact on the decline rate of the cigarette category. So I think we're going to have to wait and see what happens with both gas prices on a relative basis and whether or not the growth rate of e-vapor slows down.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. If I could squeeze in one more. The incremental data you provided today and the earlier comments you made on the discount portion of the category was definitely useful. I guess, my question around that is do we take that data and your comments as glass half full or glass half empty? In other words, by noting that, especially deep discount share of the category overall has been higher in the past, is that more to say that you think it's relatively stable and sort of the risk of discount proliferation is contained? Or is it more to be read that you're saying there's a precedent for it to go higher and it likely will? Just want to make sure I understand what you're trying to communicate.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. We shared the data we did on the discount category because it's been the subject of a lot of discussion over the last three or four months. And I felt like some of our investors felt like there was something to be alarmed about. I have to tell you, we don't feel there's anything to be alarmed about and we provided this data to reinforce that belief.","And I would just point out that over the last three periods, 2016, 2017 and 2018 year-to-date, the overall discount category has been stable, and it's much lower than it has been for the last five or six or seven years. When you think about a consumer packaged goods category that has those kinds of discount fundamentals, that's a really good trend, in my opinion.","Now I know it's a little bit complicated because you've seen the deep discount portion of that up maybe a little more than 1 share point since 2011, 2012. And I think that was causing a bit of alarm from some folks. But I have to tell you, when you look at the fact that gas prices are back above year-ago levels, and I don't think that given the strong economy that most adult cigarette consumers are at all impacted in their brand choice because of that. But there is a relatively small group of consumers that when it costs them $10 more to gas up their car, they may be very well be deciding to go in and save by buying deep discount rather than branded discount.","And given the nice margin expansion we've had on branded discount and the fact that discount doesn't seem to be interacting with premium, we think that's a natural outcome of the environment. And we don't find it alarming, and we don't feel a need to invest to try and address it.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, good morning. This is Rose (43:12) on for Pam. Appreciate the detail you've given with regard to the volume levels, even after removing the pod-based products and then discontinuing some flavors. If you could just give us a sense for how much of an impact you anticipate on revenue and profitability from removing these products.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes, go ahead, Billy.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think from a standpoint of the actual impact, I think it's clearly immaterial, I'm not going to quote numbers here. When you think about the standpoint of the pod-based, we were in the launch of those products, and Apex was available through e-commerce. We think the way \u2013 taking the proactive approach, allows us to sell through those products in the marketplace and have an orderly transition with withdrawal of those products from the marketplace.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, thanks. And just to clarify, is this sort of removal of all flavored products in e-vapor or is it strictly the cig-a-likes?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes. Our action results in us removing, for our pod products, we're going to remove the whole branded pod business. With regard to our cig-a-like products, most of our volume is in tobacco flavored menthol or mint products, which we think are particularly appealing to adult cigarette smokers that are moving into our cig-a-like e-vapor products, those will stay on the market. And then we had other flavors that were not brown or green, I guess, you would say, that we're going to remove pending a PMTA or other action to addresses the youth increase in e-vapor.","Unknown Speaker","That's really helpful, thank you. And if I can just sneak one more in there. You talked about wanting to be proactive about addressing the youth issue, just how much of this decision was driven by the FDA's request versus your actions to proactively volunteer to take these products off the market?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes. Our announcement is a set of actions that we came into the FDA contemplating. And I think when we met with FDA, when we emerged from the meeting, we were more certain that this was the right thing to do. But I think if there's any further action on the part of the FDA, we'll certainly take a look at whether or not there's more we should do, but we felt like this was a good first step.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you very much. I have a couple of questions. First of all, in answer to Bonnie Herzog, you said on Marlboro, you didn't feel you needed to increase investment to maintain share. I suppose the other question is if you were to cut your equity investment in Marlboro, do you think that would result in a decrease in market share, or do you think the equity is sufficiently strong you could do that cutting (46:32) within reason and still hold share? So that's my first question.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. I don't know that I think about it that way. I think we feel \u2013 we make a variety of decisions around promotional investments, pricing and equity investments at any given year, and I think that our focus is on always maintaining four elements with regard to Marlboro. We want to make sure we have stable overall share, we want to make sure we continue to have a strong equity, we want to make sure that we have good demographics, and we want to grow the profitability.","And we feel like we're having success against those four things next year and we think we're well equipped to do that in the future. I think the question about brand equity, I think you can always cut brand equity in the short run to save money, but in the long run, it catches up with you. So we feel like the long-term approach we've had with Marlboro makes sense and we feel like it's well positioned to be able to deliver against that in the future.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you very much. And then I've got a question on your non-Marlboro portfolio. Now I know sequentially, quarter-on-quarter, it was flat this quarter, which I was quite impressed a bit by because this has been declining, I think, for previous three quarters. And at the same time it's interesting that deep discount also grew. So, on the one hand, you got deep discount growing 20 bps this quarter. But on the other hand, your portfolio was stable. And I was just wondering if you've taken any action to allow you to move from a declining trend to a flat trend.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's tough to call it a trend, Adam, in the short term, when you're looking at sequential quarter-to-quarter. I think to call it a trend, we would look over a longer period of time but certainly, we've become more effective and efficient with the way we allocate our resources across those other brands. And you recall as well that we launched Nat's in the smokeable segment and expanded that to basically the western part of the U.S. So we think we're seeing the benefit of that as well.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","And can you just be a little bit more specific on the other actions? I get the Nat's thing that you might have taken again, and you said you're a little bit efficient on your portfolio recently.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think we sharpened our tools from a standpoint of allocating resources to where they have the greatest impact and became more efficient with those resources around those other portfolio brands including L&M. And so with those tools and the sharp end of the (49:14) analytics around that, we're able to have a greater impact with even the same resources or less.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","I would also tell you, Adam, that when you look at, for instance, some of our other premium brands, like Virginia Slims or Parliament, I think we are at the stage where we have a very loyal core smoker base that chooses those brands. And I think that's part of the reason why you might see a moderation in the decline rate.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you. And then my final question is, coming back to this long-term chart you gave us on the deep discounts and branded discounts, and you said you were very comfortable with where things are now, it's not causing you really much concern. Is there any level of deep discount that would start to concern you? I mean, if you got to back to 9%, would that be an issue for you, do you think?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, I have to tell you that we are primarily focused on our premium portfolio, and I think that what would concern us would be a dramatic increase in growth of the overall discount category that would impact our premium brands. I think if the trend growth of deep discount continued to grow a bit more, I think as long as our Marlboro portfolio is performing well and we were getting the kind of profit growth we wanted, I don't think that would be particularly alarming.","In the past, we have had quite nice business performance at PM USA with a discount share that's significantly lower than today. So we know that formula works. Although I have to tell you that I'm delighted \u2013 and this is a shout-out to the L&M brand management team, I'm delighted with the success we've had with L&M over the last five or six years, it's got strong equity. But one of the reasons I'm delighted about it is not only has it grown its share and grown its margin, but it's done it, in my opinion, without taking share away from Marlboro.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. I have just two quick ones. I know the approval from the FDA hasn't come yet, but the HeatSticks would have Marlboro branding, if it is approved and gets into the market, how do you think about your Marlboro share objectives and HeatSticks, would that be considered a part of it?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","I think the way we'll measure it is, is we will distinguish between our cigarette volumes and cigarette share versus our HeatStick volume and share. So we'll provide clarity as to which is heated tobacco products versus traditional cigarettes.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. And again, I'm recognizing it's not approved yet, but looking ahead just a bit, if you got the approval, it would be on an earlier generation of the device. Can you just speak to the FDA process and what you would have to do to be able to get a newer device subsequently launched? Is the SE application process an option that's available there, or does it even entirely new PMTA?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","No, I don't think it needs an entirely new PMTA. I think we believe that we can bridge the information in the original application to the new product, particularly given that some of the changes between the current device and HeatSticks versus the one that we filed on, they don't tend to change the vapor, it's just a better piece of hardware. And we are working with PMI on doing that bridging work and we'll file that when we get that done.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Maloney of The Wall Street Journal.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Jennifer.","Jennifer Maloney - The Wall Street Journal","Hi. How are you?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Good.","Jennifer Maloney - The Wall Street Journal","I'm wondering if you could clarify what you mean in your letter to the FDA when you support user fees for e-vapor products?","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. The products in the tobacco category that are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration require the manufacturers of certain products to make payments to fund the cost of FDA regulation. And I think because the initial set of products was on the minds (53:59) when the legislation was passed, even though there are now significant numbers of e-vapor products on the market, they do not pay into the FDA to support the cost of regulation. And we think as long as we're opening up the legislation, it's time to update that and have everybody pay their fair share.","Jennifer Maloney - The Wall Street Journal","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Also wonder what you think of Commissioner Gottlieb's indications over the past couple of weeks that he may support restricting online sales of e-cigarettes or restricting sales of e-cigarettes through vape shops, in other words, banning their sale in convenience stores and gas stations.","Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah. I would tell you that I know that whatever action the FDA takes is going to be based on science and evidence and data, and it was not intuitive to me when he talked about taking the products out of convenience stores, but I'm reserving judgment here until we understand what data he has. And I think there's been a lot said and from that I have concluded that the FDA is going to take action to address this youth epidemic, but I think we're going to have to wait until they communicate their comprehensive plan to really understand exactly what they're going to do.","Jennifer Maloney - The Wall Street Journal","Okay.

Please go ahead, sir.","Brendan McCormick","","Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I am joined this morning by Marty Barrington, Altria\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Howard Willard, Altria\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This morning we will only be discussing Altria\u2019s business results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 and will not be discussing the status of tobacco litigation.","Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of our earnings release for the review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. For a detailed review of Altria\u2019s business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website, altria.com.","Altria reports its financial results in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Today\u2019s call will contain various operating results on both a reported and on an adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results.

In addition, comparisons discussed in this conference call are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated.","Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Marty Barrington.","Marty Barrington","Thanks Brendan. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. Altria delivered solid financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 while taking steps to strengthen its ability to create shareholder value in the future. Our tobacco businesses grew their adjusted operating companies\u2019 income and expanded their margins for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2012.","Each of our tobacco companies also grew their retail share for the same time periods while investing to develop their brands for the long-term. Products introduced in recent years continued to support these income and retail share gains. Our tobacco companies remain focused on developing and commercializing innovative new products to meet the volume preferences with all tobacco consumers.","The business performance of our operating companies enabled us to increase our already strong cash returns to shareholders. Altria increased its dividend by 7.3% in the third quarter, our 46th dividend increase in the last 43 years. We also returned cash to shareholders by repurchasing over $260 million of our stock during the quarter. Earlier today, we announced a $500 million expansion of our current $1 billion share repurchase program.","We also took steps to enhance our capital structure during the quarter. We purchased high coupon debt and issued new lower cost debt. These actions reduced our 2018 and 2019 debt maturity tariffs, lowered our future interest expense and reduced our weighted average coupon rate.","Altria grew its 2012 adjusted diluted EPS by 3.6% for the third quarter and 7.8% for the nine months. These results were consistent with our expectations and include the negative impact of an increase in Altria\u2019s 2012 full-year effective tax rate on operations related to the debt tender offer.","Smokeable Products segment delivered solid adjusted OCI growth and adjusted OCI margin expansion for the third quarter and nine months through higher list prices and effective cost management. We coupled this solid OCI growth with retail share gains on Marlboro.","Marlboro\u2019s new brand architecture has contributed to the brand\u2019s results. Marlboro\u2019s brand building initiatives across our four product families have included a successful expansion of new products, equity building promotions that engage millions of adult smokers and promotional offers intended to generate trial and conversion by adult competitive smokers.","In addition, PM USA expanded Marlboro NXT, a product in Marlboro Black family into 27 states at the end of third quarter. Marlboro NXT contains capsule technology that allows adult smokers to switch from non-menthol to menthol taste. Marlboro\u2019s growth was complemented by retail share gains by L&M in the Discount segment.","PM USA strong shipment volume outperformed the industry and its principal competitors on both a reported and on adjusted basis. Black & Mild also delivered strong retail share growth for the third quarter and nine months behind products that were introduced in recent years. Black & Mild\u2019s results also benefited from the 2012 third quarter introduction of Black & Mild Jazz into select geographies and its seasonal offering Summer Blend.","In smokeless tobacco, USSTC\u2019s objective is to increase its income through volume growth primarily by focusing on Copenhagen and Skoal. USSTC aims to maximize the combined performance of these two leading premium brands by focusing on strengths of each brand.","Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined reported shipment volume and retail share for both the third quarter and the first nine months. This performance helps the Smokeless Product segment growth it\u2019s quarter and nine month adjusted OCI and adjusted OCI margins.","Copenhagen continue to be the primary driver of volume and retail share growth as it benefited from new products introduced in recent years including the recent expansion of Copenhagen Southern Blend. Skoal\u2019s volume and retail share comparisons were impacted by competitive activity and Copenhagen\u2019s strong performance. Skoal\u2019s nine month comparisons were also impacted by last year\u2019s SKU delisting and the introduction of Skoal X-TRA.","USSTC is taking steps to improve Skoal\u2019s performance and recently announced fourth quarter expansion of Skoal ReadyCut into over 20 states. Skoal ReadyCut offers adult tippers and easier to control long cut product.","In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered strong adjusted OCI results for the third quarter and nine months through higher pricing, higher shipment volume and improved premium mix.","We are pleased with our business results through the first nine months of 2012 and reaffirm and we expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 9% for the full year, representing a range of $2.19 to $2.23 per share. We also expect to deliver full year reported diluted EPS between $2.03 and $2.07 per share.","I will now turn things over to Howard, who will discuss our business results in more detail.","Howard Willard","Thank you, Marty. Good morning everyone. In the Smokeable Products segment third quarter reported operating company's income grew by 3.9%, primarily due to higher list prices, effective cost management and higher reported shipment volume. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher promotional investments behind Marlboro\u2019s new brand architecture, increased resolution expense and unfavorable mix due to L&Ms volume growth in Discount.","For the first nine months reported operating companies income increased 4.2% primarily due to higher list prices, effective cost management and lower charges related to tobacco and health judgments. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher promotional investments behind Marlboro, increased resolution expense, unfavorable mix due to L&Ms volume growth and lower reported shipment volume. ","Excluding special items identified in our earnings press release, 2012 adjusted operating companies income for the Smokeable Products segment increased by 4.3% to $1.6 billion for the third quarter and 3.7% to $4.7 billion for the first nine months.","Adjusted operating companies income margin income margin from 0.4 percentage point to 42.4% for the third quarter, an increased 0.8 percentage point to 41.6% for the first nine months. PM USA\u2019s reported cigarette shipment volume increased 1.2% for the third quarter, primarily due to retail share gains and changes in trade inventories; partially offset by the industry\u2019s rate of decline and one less shipping day. ","PM USA believes the trade depleted less inventory during the third quarter of 2012, versus the prior year period benefiting comparisons of reported shipments. For the first nine months of 2012, reported cigarette shipment volume declined 0.4 of a percent, primarily due to the industry\u2019s rate of growth partially offset by volume growth as a result of retail share gains. ","When adjusted for trade inventory dynamics and other factors PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette shipment volume was down approximately 1% for the third quarter and 0.5% for the first nine months. Total cigarette category volume was estimated to be down 3.5% for the third quarter and 3% for the nine months. ","PM USA increased its retail share by 1.2 share points to 49.9% for the third quarter and by 0.8 of a share points to 49.8% for the first nine months of 2012. Marlboro gained a share point to deliver a 42.7% retail share for the third quarter and was up 0.5 a share point to 42.6% for the first nine months. ","For the third quarter and the first nine months PM USA\u2019s discount portfolio increased its retail share by 0.6 of a share point to 3.9% and 3.8% respectively, as L&M share gains were partially offset by basic share losses. ","Reported cigar shipment volume was down 14% for the third quarter, primarily due to the timing of promotional shipments and other changes in trade inventories and one less shipping day, partially offset by volume growth from retail share gains. ","Middleton believes the trade built inventory in the third quarter of last year prior to Middleton\u2019s December 2011 price increase announcement, which impacted volume comparisons. For the first nine months Middleton\u2019s reported cigar shipment volume declined 0.6 of a percent primarily due to changes in trade inventory, partially offset by retail share gains. ","Black & Mild retail share increased to 0.8 of a share point to 29.9% for the third quarter, and was up 1 share point to 30.1% for the nine months primarily driven by the success of its Classic, Sweets, Wine and Jazz untipped cigarillos. ","Turning to smokeless products, third quarter reported operating company's income was up slightly to $246 million and grew 2.7% to $678 million for the first nine months of 2012, primarily due to higher pricing, higher volume and effective cost management. These favorable factors were partially offset by growth in products introduced in recent years at a lower popular price, higher restructuring charges related to our cost reduction program and higher promotional investments. ","When adjusted for special items, primarily related to restructuring charges the smokeless products segment operating company's income increased 3.3% to $254 million for the third quarter and 6.2% to $705 million for the first nine months of 2012.","USSTC and PM USA\u2019s reported smokeless product shipment volume increased 5.9% for the third quarter, driven by Copenhagen strong 12.1% volume growth as well as Skoal\u2019s 2.8% volume gain.","Partially offset by volume declines in the balance of the portfolio. Shipment volume for the first nine months of 2012 increased 1.9% as volume growth on Copenhagen was partially offset by volume declines in the balance of the portfolio.","When adjusted for changes in train inventories and other factors, USSTC and PM USA estimated that their combined 2012 third quarter adjusted smokeless products volume grew approximately 5%. USSTC and PM USA further estimate that the smokeless product category grew by approximately 5% over the 12 months ended September 2012.","USSTC and PM USA\u2019s retail share of the smokeless products category increased 0.4 of a share point to 55.5% for the third quarter and 0.5 a share point to 55.4% for the first nine months of 2012.","Copenhagen and Skoal delivered strong combined retail share growth of 1.6 share points for the third quarter and 1.8 share points for the nine months. ","Copenhagen grew its retail share by 2.3 share points for the third quarter and 2.4 share points for the nine months.","Skoal\u2019s retail share declined 0.7 of a share point for the third quarter and 0.6 of a share point for the nine months as comparisons were impacted by the factors mentioned earlier","In the wine segment, St. Michelle grew its third quarter reported operating company income by 13% to $26 million. When adjusted for the impact of 2011 costs related to the UST acquisition, third quarter operating company\u2019s income increased 8.3%. ","For the first nine months of 2012 reported operating company\u2019s income grew 16.7% and adjusted operating company\u2019s income increased 8.6%, excluding acquisition related costs from last year. St. Michelle shipment volume increased 3.7% for the third quarter and 4% for the nine months.","The financial services segments third quarter reported an adjusted operating company\u2019s income decreased 4.8% to $79 million, primarily due to a $35 million decrease in the allowance for losses that favorably impacted operating company\u2019s income in 2011. This factor was partially offset by 2012 third quarter recoveries related to PMCC\u2019s leased investment with American Airlines which filed for bankruptcy in November 2011.","For the first nine months of the year, the financial services segment\u2019s reported operating company\u2019s income increased by more than 100%, primarily due to PMCC\u2019s leverage lease related charge of $490 million in the second quarter of last year higher gains and asset sales, recoveries related to America Airlines and a decrease in the allowance for losses that favorably impacted operating company\u2019s income earlier this year. ","These favorable factors were partially offset by lower lease revenues in 2012 and a 2011 decrease in the allowance for losses that favorably impacted operating company\u2019s income last year. Excluding the leverage lease charges the financial services segment\u2019s adjusted operating company\u2019s income grew by 32.1% to $173 million for the nine months. ","PMCC allowance for losses at the end of the third quarter was $99 million versus the $188 million at the end of the second quarter of 2012. This reduction reflects write-offs related to the American Airlines bankruptcy.","Altria repurchased 7.7 million shares of its common stock in the third quarter, for a total cost of $262 million. Earlier this week Altria\u2019s Board authorized the expansion of our current share repurchase program by $500 million to $1.5 billion. Altria has $550 million remaining in this expanded program that it intends to complete by the end of the second quarter of 2013. This program remains subject to the discussion of the Board and market conditions. ","During the third quarter UST repaid $600 million of debt the matured in July. Altria also purchased $2 billion of notes during 2018 and 2019 with coupons of 9.7% and 9.25 respectively.","In connection with the debt tender offered, the company issued $1.9 billion in new 10 year notes with the coupon rate of 2.85% and $900 million in new 30 year notes with a coupon rate of 4.25%. Our current cost management program remains on track and we have recorded net pretax charges of $264 million over the past four quarters.","We expect to incur the remaining pretax restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2012. Charges related to this program is reflected in full year diluted EPS guidance. Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled let me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro\u2019s price GAAP versus the lowest effective price cigarettes was 36% in the third quarter. Marlboro\u2019s net pack price in the third quarter was $5.79 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.24. The cigarette discount category\u2019s retail share was 27.4% for the third quarter. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax as of the end of September was $1.41 per pack, an increase of $0.04 per pack versus the prior year. ","Copenhagen\u2019s third quarter retail price was $4.08 and its price GAAP versus the leading discount brand was approximately 37% in the quarter. CapEx was $38 million for the third quarter and $77 million for the first nine months of 2012. ","We estimate that our 2012 full year CapEx will be between $100 million and $125 million. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $56 million for the third quarter. We estimate that 2012 full year ongoing depreciation and amortization will be approximately $230 million. ","Operator, do we have any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Marty you saw in the last couple of days you know obviously we've heard from your competitors about the promotional environment and so their view that you as a price leader is pressuring the pricing environment and basically putting pressure on the overall industry profit pool. So maybe just if you can just give us your perspective on your promotional strategy and how would you sort of defend against those comments from your competitors?","Marty Barrington","Listen I'm not going to comment on what other folks are saying. I will tell what we are trying to do. What we are trying to do in this multiple segments is to maximize income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro; that has been the strategy for some time that strategy remains constant. We have I think a good plan in place for 2012 to execute against that strategy and that's what you see playing out in the marketplace. We are implementing a new Marlboro architecture which is part of our investment in Marlboro. What I would say is that, it\u2019s a competitive industry, it\u2019s always been competitive, it\u2019s competitive today, likely to be competitive as we go forward. I don't see anything that particularly unique about it. Marlboro is investing in its new architecture and that's a wise thing to do because Marlboro has been the engine of income growth in this multiple segment for Altria Group. So that's how we look at it and we are pretty happy with how that's playing out this year.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay and if I sort of look at your income growth this year on this multiple segment, so you are sort of down kind of 0.5% to 1% volume. You are getting pricing sort of 2% to 3%. Your operating profit up 4% to 5% and then if you look at the last couple of years you had volume down sort of 4% to 5%, pricing up 5% to 6%, getting to a similar operating profit growth of sort of 4% to 5% pricing up 5% to 6%, getting to a similar operating profit growth of sort of 4% to 5%. So if you kind of take us through your thought process and one versus the other in more price driven strategy as opposed to more share and volume driven strategy. From your perspective, kind of how you think about which is maybe the more appropriate strategy either in the near or longer-term basis?","Marty Barrington","I just want to return to what I said is that the strategy is to maximize income while maintaining moderate share momentum on Marlboro. It's not a question of choosing different strategies as much as it is. There are ways to grow income. We talked about cigarette pricing. Pricing is of course important in cigarette category. It has been important, it will remain important but of course you can grow your income through other ways and we\u2019ve spoken about this previously. We're trying to manage our cost structure as efficiently as we can. You saw the PM USA took a higher list, took list prices up in the middle of the year. We reduced our promotions actually, our promotion allowances on Marlboro as we\u2019ve gone through the year."," We will recall that on Marlboro special blend, we had geographies where it was promoted at $0.75, other geographies where it began at the dollar and within the year those allowances have come down not once but twice, first to $0.90 and then to $0.85. We've spoken about Marlboro Black. We had promotional allowances to generate trial and conversion among adult competitive smokers. We produced those allowances as well similarly to Marlboro special blend.","So for us, and we\u2019ve talked about this previously, it's a balance between maximizing income while never taking your eye off of Marlboro which is after all the driver of that success from time to time and we don\u2019t look at this necessarily quarter-to-quarter as much as we look at it overtime because if you look how Marlboro has grown overtime that\u2019s how its happen whether it was Marlboro Red in the 50s or Menthol in the 60s or Gold in the 70s or now Black, we grow it overtime that\u2019s how we think about it overtime and guess what it\u2019s been a great contributor to the growth in adjusted EPS that it\u2019s our long-term goal. ","So that\u2019s kind of how we think about it Judy and I guess the last thing I would say on it for context is the macro environment is a factor right, we continue to be in an environment out of the great recession where the recovery has been modest at best. Consumers remained under pressure, tobacco consumers remain under pressure. We have to meet the consumers where they are and so in that environment it\u2019s hardly surprising that pricing may be a bit more restrained than in periods where housing is booming and unemployment is low and everybody is feeling good and consumer confidence is high that is not the situation the data tell us otherwise so that\u2019s not to be discouraged about it and there are some signs that it may be improving and we sure hope so, but that\u2019s how we have been thinking about it which is trying to be sensible in that environment following our strategy, maximizing income and keeping Marlboro healthy.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","I also wanted to ask you a couple of pricing based questions in the cigarette category I probably doesn\u2019t surprise you.","Marty Barrington","Glad to have your question in any event David.","","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Whether it\u2019s the economy or the competitive stat or the equity of Marlboro, do you think there is a practical matter you are in a position where if you take more pricing than the category Marlboro share doesn\u2019t grow like last year or if you take less pricing than the category Marlboro share does grow which is this year?","Marty Barrington","Well, I think it\u2019s our job to manage that balance honestly David, that's the short answer which is, if you are trying to maximize income like we are, we want to of course try to do that as best we can. At the same time, you want to make sure that Marlboro is healthy. Marlboro is one fantastic brand right, it\u2019s got high equity, it can command premium pricing, it has high loyalty but it\u2019s not the only brand in the marketplace. And we try to be cognizant of both the macro environment and the competitive environment and our job is to balance that equation.","If you look at it, it\u2019s tempting again to look at a sort of within the quarter. But if you look at Marlboro share growth what do we see sure its up in the third quarter, but actually for the nine months what should up, it\u2019s up five-tenths. If you look at it over a longer period of time, but you look at it say from, well I don't know, let's call the end of the third quarter of 2008 to the end of the third quarter of 2012, Marlboro shares up eight-tenths. So eight-tenths over four years, I think we would characterize that as moderate share momentum and I think it shows in the equity and the brand, there shouldn\u2019t be any mistake that pricing is important and it will continue to be important but it is a balance and we are trying to be sensible about how we will do it, I think that's how we think about it.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay, and there is a follow-up question. Marty both with Marlboro but also Copenhagen and Skoal, if you look at the smokeless business, the growth and the brand initiatives have been principally at price points below the traditional full price premium brand, whether it\u2019s Copenhagen Wintergreen or Skoal X-TRA or bulk of the Marlboro line extensions and clearly you have manage that from a price mix perspective and a profit delivery perspective, but the question I wanted to ask you in that context is, what's the risk of that two years from now or three years from now that those efforts have in effect eroded the premium brand equities; you do account for a lot now of those brands respective market shares?","Marty Barrington","Yeah, I think we are quite confident in the equity of those brands David and there's good reason to be confident in those brands. If you look at Marlboro again, just to take Marlboro before we go to smokeless, remember Marlboro all sells at the same list price, right. So what you see in the marketplace so is the implementation of different promotional allowances to achieve different aims. And we've spoken about this previously with you and others on the calls, but just to take one second, special blend well for example is to make sure that for more price sensitive consumers in the franchise that they have a place to go during this difficult economic period.","Your strategic choices obviously are you cannot meet them where they are in your franchise with a big huge brand like Marlboro and you can let them go. We think the better strategy is to have a price point for them within the franchise and retain their business and I think that makes good sense and by the way you see that the margin increases at the Marlboro level again, so we are managing the margin there.","If you look at the brand equity components of Marlboro they continue to be extremely small, right. We've shared the TNS scores overtime, it has high brand loyalty. The price gaps were so constant during the worst recession you would have thought that you would have seen an erosion in equity that they wouldn't command those price gaps, they have been absolutely constant during the period.","The smokeless business David, of course it\u2019s a different situation right, because we are trying there to grow income by participating in the growth in the category. It\u2019s a growing category unlike cigarette which is a declining category as you well know, so if we can participate in the volume growth there and with Copenhagen and Skoal together gain some share, we can grow our income quite nicely and I think you see that actually over the first nine months in the smokeless business.","To be sure, we do have SKUs in the smokeless franchise that are at popular price points as well as having price points there that are mainline and the reason for that is again that's where some of the business is. So we have a competitor that has an offering at a popular price point. We believe that Copenhagen and Skoal can compete there and should compete there; all the while we want to manage the margin at that franchise level if you will and guess what, we've been pretty successful in doing that. Copenhagen and Skoal have grown together very nicely, I mean if I look at it from again, call it say Q3 of \u201909 after the acquisition to Q3 \u201912 their combined retail share growth is about four points and the margins have expanded all the while.","So that's a bit more complex I suppose, but we think that the strategy is right there and again just to return I guess to the core of your question, while we are trying to manage through that environment we are not concerned about the equity of those brands.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel Nicolaus.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","I had a question for you in particular with Marlboro Black as an example. I know certainly the measured of success for a new product in this category is the degree to which you can reduce promotion in the time in which you can do that. So perhaps our expectation is a little high that promotion would come down. I do characterize still the Marlboro Black promotion is a bit high. It has come down to a unit, but still high. So I'm just curious as you look at the brand and the way it\u2019s positioned today, is it the economy, is it the attempt to retain some of those Marlboro consumers that will shift. It's resulting in a requirement for you to keep promotions at a relatively high rate or do you see this is just probably the natural progression as kind of building this brand and I know you could rush it down?","Marty Barrington","The latter; I think its part of the natural progression of building the brand. Remember Chris, brands are build in three months. Marlboro Black was launched earlier this year. This is a category in which there are relatively high loyalty rates; people are in the category, like their brands. There are some participating more in the price value equation, but for premium brands, you have to have an offering to persuade someone not to buy the pack that they have been buying in to try yours and that\u2019s the purpose of those promotions, because we believe we\u2019ve got a terrific product, it\u2019s in a terrific pack, it's in a terrific franchise, but we have to offer, we have to raise awareness to begin with. Then we have to send trial and hopefully we will get some conversion.","But again, I would point out as you know, these promotional allowances have come down and I think you know what one might conclude from that is, is that those allowances are doing their job. We\u2019ve said previously, we don\u2019t have any desire to have promotional allowances any higher than they need to be to achieve their purpose. I think you should probably read in to that that Marlboro Black is achieving its purpose. We're very happy with that product. We think it's a great addition to the Marlboro franchise. It's got great demographics. It's contributing to the equity. It's a long-term play and that the ultimate success of Marlboro Black, I think it'll be measured over the years not over a quarter or two.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Did you suggest that margins for the Marlboro brand were up this quarter?","Marty Barrington","Smokeable segment, I said that margins were up.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","In the Smokeable segment, okay sure, I got you. And then just one final question, it\u2019s in relation to inventory levels just to kind of give a base where we are today on inventory and that\u2019s been jumping around quite a bit and still like in the fourth quarter. But where do we stand today on sort of your inventory level, I know you mentioned that it was less de-loading that occurred in the prior year; how would you characterize inventory today?","Marty Barrington","","Yeah, it doesn\u2019t make, for us it\u2019s kind of washed out over the last nine months Chris, as you know it does add over the course of the year there is just not a lot of difference over the nine month period. Howard referred in his remarks to the fact that there was less depletion in the third quarter which flattened the results a little bit, but it\u2019s not really significant for the nine months.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Marty, given your comments about the macro environment and price sensitive smokers, is it fair to assume that as long as the economy doesn\u2019t pick up, there is maybe a chance that promotions for some of these [non-exemptions] will be dived back much more significantly?","Marty Barrington","","Well, we will see overtime Thilo is the answer. Like you and everyone else I am sure everyone hopes that things are going to improve and if they do obviously we will all take that into account as we look at our promotional allowances; I just don\u2019t know how to predict that going forward.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","What\u2019s your best assessment there how much Marlboro market share would be at risk if you took away promotions all together?","Marty Barrington","","We don\u2019t think about it that way; we are managing the brand in a very different kind of way. We are trying to maximizing coming to category while making sure that Marlboro is healthy. So that\u2019s just a completely different way of looking at it which isn\u2019t ours.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","But market share is part of the equation, right?","Marty Barrington","","Sure, we are trying to maintain modest share in the Marlboro.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Okay. And then Howard a question for you, given the market share losses for Skoal and some of the smaller UST brands, since you acquired UST, at what point will you have to seriously consider asset impairment tax and what point do we have to get concerned about write-off for some of these brands?","Howard Willard","Yeah, well as you know that's a calculation we do on a pre-regular basis; we certainly revisit that in any case of the fourth quarter. So I think we will wait and see; I think when you look at Copenhagen and Skoal, they have had quite nice growth over the time since the acquisition, but obviously Copenhagen has have the stronger share than the Skoal. So we\u2019re certainly doing those kinds of calculations and if we end up in an impairment situation we will certainly let you know, but that's how we do quite regularly.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Just from an accounting perspective, is it just the volume growth you have to look at or do market shares play a role in that determination as well?","Howard Willard","Well, the primary driver of the impairment tax is really income; and if looking and what the expected income is out into the future and comparing that to the valuations that were used in valuing the trade marks at the time of the acquisition. So income is the bigger driver than either share or volume.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Vivien Azer of Citigroup.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup","Just to circle back on the competitive landscape part of (inaudible) issue; I think about the growth in the total tobacco profit pool which is something you guys have pointed to in the past. Over the last four years it\u2019s been fairly volatile, ranging from anywhere to 2% to 8%. As you think about the total US tobacco profit pool growth going forward can you give us an indication of what you think the right growth rate is?","Marty Barrington","Well, I'm not going to comment on profit pools, I\u2019ll just comment on how we think about running our business which is as you know we have the company positioned to participate as a total tobacco company we have this terrific business of PM USA, we have a business at Middleton, we have a great UST smokeless business. So as those companies follow their plans and maximize their income and participate in the way that we described it earlier in the call, we expect obviously that we will do just fine with that. So I would limit my comments to what our plans are maybe and that's supposed to be anything else.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup","Understood. I would just like to turn to NXT for a second. I know it\u2019s definitely very early days given the roll out that you've done in late September, but can you give us any indications of early consumer response to that brand.","Marty Barrington","No honestly Vivien I wish I could, but it\u2019s really literally weeks so I just don't have anything to give you there I'm sorry. ","Vivien Azer - Citigroup","Any color on kind of future plans for the roll out.","Marty Barrington","Well, I mean we've announced our plans for what we are going to do with Marlboro NXT. I think it\u2019s a terrific product; it\u2019s a nice offering, its going to be a nice addition to the Marlboro Black family. Everyone has high hopes for us again, but as you correctly pointed out you have to see what it does in the market. We've got a good plan for it, a good support plan. So I think it will do fine, we just have to see the data.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup","And just lastly, can you comment on what your share of menthol looks like today and whether it\u2019s up relative to the end of 2011 given the success we've seen for Marlboro Black.","Marty Barrington","I don't know that I have a comment on that. I would have to maybe Brendan will get back to you. I just don't have the number in front of me. Sorry.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","","I also have a question on Marlboro maybe asked a little differently and it\u2019s related to innovation. I'm curious how much of your share gains in the quarter, do you estimate were being driven by the new line extensions, and I'm trying to understand if you have comfort with how much incremental growth you are getting from these versus growth from your underlying core Marlboro brand and I'd be curious to hear how full your pipeline is next year for Marlboro and then overall.","Marty Barrington","Okay. Well innovation is a great topic, thanks for raising it. We don't break out at the sub segment level as you know, but we can observe it right that if you look at innovation in Marlboro, its going through a period really I think of accelerated innovation, isn't it. We've got Marlboro Black which we are very happy with. We've got Marlboro NXT, you remember we have the packaging innovation on Marlboro 83, and while we don\u2019t disclose our pipeline of course, we have excellent brand management teams. It is actually part of the power of the architecture, which we have explained previously. ","We have our brand management structure now, aligned against the four product families within Marlboro and each of them is developing excellent plans, not just for this year and next year but beyond, which includes a variety of product ideas, programmatic ideas and the likes. ","So we are pretty happy about how Marlboro architecture is rolling out and innovation is a key component of that. ","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","And then I guess the last question would be on your discount cigarette segment which has sustained pretty strong momentum this year. Could you talk a little more about your strategy for this segment, and then in terms of L&M and its share gains, is the brand taking share do you think from other discount brands or is the growth maybe being driven by down trading from some of the premium brands or are you seeing both?","Marty Barrington","Good question, our strategy of course is while we focus on premium and again more than 90% of PM USA shipments are premium, there is a discount segment in the category of about 27%. We want to make sure we have an offering there and the offering that we have is L&M and it's doing a very nice job there I think. ","In some respects, it's taking share that our former discount brand Basic sheds as it raises its price and its margins. Our strategy is obviously to just to have an offering there. Our retailers like for us to have an offering there. There is some business there. We have a competitor obviously it\u2019s got a significant offering there. We want to make sure that we\u2019ve got a competitive offering. So our strategy on L&M is to have that offering there for that purpose and as you\u2019ve seen, this year certainly has been a contributor to volume which is nice.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","As you talk about maximizing income, I would love for you to give a little color there, because this year certainly it's being helped by the restructuring, the cost savings that you\u2019ve got and those are as you said skewed towards this year. As you move in to next year, do you think about maximizing your income on an operating basis or on a net income basis? And by that I mean, how much would the interest expense savings become part of that equation?","Marty Barrington","Well, a couple of different questions in there; let me try to unpack and to do justice to it. Certainly I am not in a position to talk about what we're going to do going forward, but when we talk about maximizing income I would refer to the comments I made earlier Michael which is you can do that through a variety of ways, right pricing is important, has been important, will continue to be important. We do manage our cost structures carefully because they can contribute. We watch the promotional allowances very carefully. So that strategy I think should be seen as constant without commenting on what we may do in the future. Do you want to talk about interest expense Howard?","","Howard Willard","Sure. I think Marty just referred to the strategy for the smokeable business. I think when we look at the overall company, we\u2019ve talked about our longer term objective of growing our EPS 7% to 9%, and certainly there we have multiple levers. Certainly the biggest contributor is the smokeable business, but we\u2019ve also seen nice contributions from our investment in SABMiller as well as the smokeless business and some of the other areas and you importantly point out that as a result of the tendered refinancing we did this year, we expect to see a reduction in interest expense. But when we think about our overall EPS growth, I think we look at really all of those levers as opportunities to increase EPS overtime.","","Michael Lavery - CLSA","That\u2019s helpful, but just to be clear so you are saying when you talk about the cigarette business and maximizing income there, you don\u2019t necessarily mean operating income?","","Marty Barrington","No, I don\u2019t think anybody said that. What we said is, there is a number of ways that you can within the PMUSA business smokeable segment to maximize income there is pricing; there is cost management and the likes. I wouldn\u2019t take that from the comments, and then Howard\u2019s correctly pointing out that the Altria business model which is diversified in, I would argue differentiated from our principal competitors is that there are multiple levers for us to achieve our long term goals of adjusted diluted EPS including our smokeless business and our wine business and our exposure to the SAB alcohol assets and the like, you know its provided us with a number of levers in order to achieve those goals. I think that's where we are trying to communicate if that wasn't clear.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","That's helpful. On the market share side, do you have specific objectives there and how significant is the 50% share mark psychologically. Is that an internal objectives, because obviously you reach that again in last quarter, it\u2019s fairly [below] right now, is there something that you focus on?","Marty Barrington","You talked about [PMU] Michael?","Michael Lavery - CLSA","You are right.","Marty Barrington","Yeah, I think it\u2019s to best explained by the overarching strategy of maintaining modest share for month-to-month. Marlboro while maximizing income out of the smokeable segment, and I think that there is no magic numbers anywhere; you have to look at this, competitively said, you have to look at the environment in any point of time. As long as we are following that strategy, maximizing income and delivering to our shareholders to what they expect that's how we think about.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay, thanks. And then just one last question back on the introductory pricing, I know you\u2019ve explained how variable that is for [contrail], but is there any expectations with those wouldn\u2019t talking like a Black or special blend become [imperative] with the rest of the portfolio given the state of list prices or did they - currently do they have a discounted profile, what is the right way to think about how those compared?","Marty Barrington","Well, I would refer to the explanation, I gave earlier which is each of those SKUs has a role to play, we have promotional strategies to design to help them achieve the objectives set for those roles and obviously as you know we don't want to spend more promotional dollars than we have to, to achieve them because we are trying to maximize our income there. So I wouldn't think of it as any one moment in time as much as it is promotional allowances that support the strategy of growing those brands.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","I guess what's making me wonder a little bit is that the Black strategy with a sort of a premium value almost mid price point and a little bit of a way is reminiscent of something like (inaudible) down in smokeless but are you suggesting that its not meant to going permanently be in that sort of a new lower tier but that its just a gradual process to get that drifted back closer to drifting in price?","Marty Barrington","","Yeah, I think we've explained that it\u2019s a promotional allowance designed to raise awareness and generate trial and conversion of adult competitive smokers and that's its purpose.","Operator","Thank you. We would now like to take questions from the media. (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Thomas Russo of Gardner, Russo & Gardner.","","Thomas Russo - Gardner, Russo & Gardner","Hey Marty, I switched over to the media. Marty thank you for being on the call and a couple of quick questions for you. But first has to do with whether you and Murray might be spending any particular amount of time down in Madison County and in general look at cost of the, developing aspects of litigation but specifically the price files case that might be revisited. What's your sense there?","Marty Barrington","Well, we haven't heard anything. I think we've got updates out on the price case but I think that the issue has been brief there Tom and its sitting with the judge and I don't think we've heard anything as of this morning.","Thomas Russo - Gardner, Russo & Gardner","Howard, congratulations on refinancing so much high cost that was terrific, do you have the capacity to keep going back to the market, like you did with the longer data paper and taking advantage of today's remarkably low rates for the [prefunding] in the sense the future pay downs of other blocks of debt?","Howard Willard","Yeah, I think if you are asking do we have the ability to do what we did this year into the future and I would say that, that's certainly an option. But its just one of many options we have in thinking about how to use our cash and how to reduce our effective interest rate and I think we will make those decisions as the year progresses.","Thomas Russo - Gardner, Russo & Gardner","Congratulations on that move though, just fantastic. And what about the role of the lower interest rate as it impacts your pension obligations and your funding requirements and how you might be rethinking that the overall pension as to your liability exposure in light of the high net [percentile] cost by remarkably low rates?","Howard Willard","Yeah, I think you raised an important point which is as the discount rate has continued to trend downward this year that does have an impact on our pension costs and that's something we are looking at quite carefully. I'm pleased to say though that as you look at the overall market performance this year, the market performance has been a bit more positive than its been in some years in the past. So there's some offset there but that's certainly something we are looking at quite closely because both of those factors are going to have an impact on pension expense going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nik Modi of UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS","Just a couple of quick questions. On the architecture, if I have the strategy, right, I mean it seems like you\u2019ve been really focused on the Black portion of the architecture so far this year. Is it fair to assume that you're going to kind of work your way around architecture over the following quarters and years? Is that kind of a way we should be thinking about it?","Marty Barrington","Yeah, I think what we\u2019ve said Nik is that we\u2019ll be rolling out our investments in that architecture through \u201812 and \u201813.","Nik Modi - UBS","Okay, perfect and then just following upon Barney\u2019s question on the innovation. You said your folks are working on a lot of stuff. But in terms of what's already approved by the FDA, I mean is the pipeline still relatively focused. It seems like you guys had a lot of stuff in the marketplace before the proper dates. So I am curious on how full your existing approved pipeline is, that will be helpful?","Marty Barrington","I understand your question. We were I would say plan full about the substantial equivalent stake and so I think we're in pretty shape. Obviously the other dimension to your question is, in light for the FDA obviously to start moving on substantial equivalents because people have applications that are pending and I think that\u2019s a fair request. They're building out their structure over there and they\u2019ve made comments about how they\u2019re going about that. I would expect that overtime you are going to see the FDA start to rule. So I just wouldn\u2019t want to leave anyone with the impression. I don't think that there is going to be some sort of a magic date and if you are in before you are okay and after that you are not. I think that will probably result overtime.","Nik Modi - UBS","And the last question Marty is just kind of a bigger picture question. The Altria business model has been kind of moderate share gains and balancing with profit growth and this quarter, I mean, obviously 100 basis points of share gains from Marlboro is pretty big number for a pretty large brand. And your new CEO and I know I have been getting a lot of questions so I am sure your folks have been getting the same about strategy and if it\u2019s changing, it\u2019s very clear from what you have been saying that it\u2019s not changing, but certainly the numbers would suggest otherwise. So I was hoping you can just give kind of your viewpoints so you can help clarify for people exactly kind of what\u2019s different about the strategy, what\u2019s not, relative to the prior year\u2019s which is obviously have been very good for the stock price? Thanks.","","Marty Barrington","Yeah, thanks for asking that question. The strategy is not changing Nik. We have been very successful at doing what we are doing. I think again as I mentioned once or twice this morning I think it looks, it depends in some respect to how you look the time period sure enough if you look at the quarterly comparison it\u2019s a 100 basis points. If you look at it over the nine month period its five-tenths if you look at over a four year periods it\u2019s eight-tenths. I think that\u2019s consistent with how we have been taken about that overtime and we have no intention of changing that, it\u2019s been enormously successful for Altria.","","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Karen Lamark of Federated Investors","","Karen Lamark - Federated Investors ","I must have I missed it, did you give the comparable estimated market share for discounted brands in the prior year. I think you suggested 27.4% but I wondered if you could give the year-over-year comparison? And that\u2019s first question.","","Howard Willard","","Yeah, I mean if you look at the discount share that we spoke about was 27.4% in the prior year quarter it was 27.9%. So it\u2019s come down modestly.","","Karen Lamark - Federated Investors ","Okay. And not to be, how do you define discounts is it simply by brand and known brand positioning that is it does not include premium discounted premium brands or line extensions is that true?","Howard Willard","Yes, the way we define discount is we have a set of brands that we identify as discount brands and it does not include or promoted on premium brand volume.","Karen Lamark - Federated Investors ","Does that changed overtime or let\u2019s say the last year or so?","Howard Willard","No, it\u2019s been largely consistent for sometime.","Karen Lamark - Federated Investors ","Okay, is it to assume that if the macro pressures and prices that if smokers persist that, you would not change that definition, in other words, you would not include anyone\u2019s wine extension promoted premium brands, is that true?","Howard Willard","Well, I hesitate to make a statement of what we might to do in the future on something like this, but I can tell you it certainly not something we\u2019ve considered. This has been the way we define discount for quite sometime and to me as this times it seems quite logical.","Operator","Thank you, your next question comes from Andrew Kieley of Deutsche Bank.","Andrew Kieley - Deutsche Bank","Marty, I just want to ask last question on promotion, if the cigarette competitors are adjusting their promotion programs as well in response to the economy or other factors. How do you think about compatibility of that kind of situation with the profit pool on your sort of long-term income objectives?","Marty Barrington","Well, I am going to go back to what I have said Andrew, which is we\u2019ve got two plans in place. We take everything into account when we put them in place and we are going to execute against our plans which are consistent with the strategy on that. I have outlined and certainly I wouldn\u2019t comment on what we might or might not do going forward, we are going to stick to our netting.","Andrew Kieley - Deutsche Bank","Okay, on Marlboro, would you say at this point that the brand has, I don't know some what more attractive opportunity in Menthol than in non-Menthol?","Marty Barrington","I think Marlboro has got a big reach. It appeals to lots of adult smokers, its proven that, not just recently but over decades as you've seen the charge with how the brand grows first with Red and Menthol and Gold and Black. It\u2019s a big brand, it\u2019s got a lot of room for a lot of flavor segments, it\u2019s got a room for a lot of adult smokers and that's how we think about it as opposed to one particular segment or another.","Andrew Kieley - Deutsche Bank","And just last question for Howard, if you could comment on the cost savings program, of the dollar amount accelerated sequentially or sort of where we are on the status of the program.","Howard Willard","We continue to make progress on the cost reduction program and we are really on track for $400 million in savings by the end of next year.","Operator","Your final question will be coming from Michael Felberbaum of Associated Press.","Michael Felberbaum - Associated Press","First, can you talk a little bit more broadly about the Marlboro brand architecture and how that plays into your ability to maintain and gain market share, and what are the top selling brand. Secondly your competitors have made some investments in electronic cigarettes and other next generation type products, and wondering if you can comment at all about any of your plans in that area.","Marty Barrington","Thank you for your questions. We've explained previously I think that the Marlboro architecture is the next evolution really in how that brand which has grown over time can continue to grow into the future, and we have a product families in it, Red, Green, Gold and Black, we've set up our SKUs at retail so that its much more evident to an adult smoker when they walk in what the Marlboro architecture looks like. We have our brand teams arranged around that. It actually provides some room for the brand to operate. Remember it\u2019s about a 42 share brand, so it\u2019s really up if you will while they are all Marlboro and they all stand to where, or come to where the flavor is.","They do have slightly different positions and we want to give Marlboro the license if you will to reach out to all the smokers who want to be in the franchise. It\u2019s a terrific brand with great equity and great premium pricing and we believe that the architecture is the next logical step about how to grow that brand over time and you will see that played out in the marketplace through products and programs and at retail when we like. We are aware of the developments in each cigarettes, it probably represents what we already know which is that there are some adult smokers who are looking for alternatives in the tobacco space and some of them have gone to e-cigarettes as an exploration at least about whether that's going to be for them and that's a situation obviously that we monitor closely and we will keep an eye on that.","Operator","Thank you.

Lower financing costs also contributed to adjusted diluted EPS growth in the quarter. So we\u2019re off to a good start against our full year objectives.","Here are the highlights from the quarter. Our smokeless products segment continued to deliver against its strategy of maximizing income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro over time. The segment produced strong adjusted operating company\u2019s income growth of 6.4% and expanded its adjusted operating company\u2019s income margin primarily through higher pricing.","PM USA\u2019s 2014 first quarter, reported shipment volume decreased 2.5% primarily due to the industries decline partially offset by changes in trade inventories and retail share gains. PM USA\u2019s income and volume performance benefited from modestly higher wholesale inventories compared to the same period last year, though we expect inventory levels to moderate as we move through the year.","Marlboro continues to be strong at 43.8 share points, larger than the next 10 brands combined. PM USA successfully grew Marlboro\u2019s retail share behind investments in the Marlboro architecture and grew its total share of the cigarette category driven by Marlboro and L&M in the discount segment.","Turning to smokeless products, the segment grew first quarter operating company\u2019s income by 7.75% primarily through higher volume. The segment also grew Copenhagen and Skoal\u2019s combined volume and retail share behind another strong quarter for Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen, which now has posted 14 consecutive quarters of retail share gains.","During the first quarter USSTC began implementing strategies to enhance Skoal\u2019s equity and carefully manage Skoal Classic price gaps in select geographies. These strategies including changes to Skoal\u2019s promotional plan resulted in some retail inventory movements that negatively impacted USSTC\u2019s first quarter shipment volume.","While these short-term dynamics also may impact the segments second quarter results, USSTC\u2019s strategy should strengthen the brand over the long-term and we\u2019re encouraged by the early results.","This strong performance by our core tobacco businesses was partially offset by comparatively lower gains on asset sales at Philip Morris Capital Corporation and lower earnings from our equity investment in SABMiller, primarily due to gains from common stock, issuances in the first quarter of 2013.","Moving to innovator products, Nu Mark continues to make excellent progress against its long-term goal of achieving e-vapor leadership. The company is on track to begin its rolling national launch of MarkTen in June. And earlier this month Nu Mark completed its acquisition of Green Smoke adding significant e-vapor experience, broadening Nu Mark\u2019s product offerings and strengthening its supply chain capabilities.","We\u2019re happy to welcome Green Smoke\u2019s talented employees to our team.","And of course Altria continues to focus on returning large amounts of cash to shareholders. During the first quarter, Altria paid $957 million in dividends and purchased shares valued at approximately $272 million. So to start off we\u2019re pleased with our first quarter performance and we\u2019re continuing to focus on our key strategies, strong consistent results for the long-term.","Altria reaffirms its guidance for 2014 full year adjusted diluted EPS to be in a range of $2.52 to $2.59, representing a growth rate of 6% to 9% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.38 in 2013. We expect stronger adjusted diluted EPS growth in the second half of the year compared to the first half driven by various factors including lower fourth quarter costs in the smokable products segment due to the end of the quota by our payments and a significantly lower fourth quarter tax rate compared to the year-ago period resulting from our 2013 debt tender offer.","I\u2019ll turn things over to Howard who will discuss Altria\u2019s business results in more detail.","Howard Willard III","Thank you Marty, good morning everyone. As Marty mentioned our smokable products segment delivered strong first quarter results. The segment grew adjusted operating company\u2019s income by 6.4% to over $1.5 billion and expanded its adjusted operating company\u2019s income margin by 2.2 percentage points to 44.1%.","Adjusted operating company\u2019s income growth was primarily driven by higher pricing, partially offset by lower volume. The smokable product segments reported operating company\u2019s income declined 20.3% primarily due to the NPM adjustment settlement in the first quarter of 2013 and lower volume partially offset by higher pricing.","After adjusting for changes in trade inventories PM USA estimates that its first quarter domestic cigarette shipment volume declined approximately 3.5% less than the category decline rate which PM USA estimates was about 4%.","PM USA grew Marlboro\u2019s wealth share by 2\/10s of a percentage point to 43.8% and increased its total category retail share by 2\/10s of a percentage point behind gains from Marlboro and L&M in the discount segment.","These gains were partially offset by share losses on other portfolio brands. In cigars Middleton grew Black & Mild\u2019s first quarter retail share by 3\/10s of a percentage point. Our shipment volume was essentially flat.","Our smokeless product segment grew operating company\u2019s income by 7.7% to almost $240 million driven by the higher volume and higher pricing partially offset by increased promotional spending. The segment also expanded its operating company\u2019s income margin by 1.1 percentage points to 62.1%. USSTC and PM USA grew combined reported domestic smokeless products shipped volume by 5.9% in the first quarter primarily due to volume growth for Copenhagen partially offset by declines for Skoal. The segments first quarter reported volume benefited from an extra shipping day, it was partially offset by changes in trade inventories.","After adjusting for calendar differences and changes in trade inventories USSTC and PM USA estimate that their combined domestic smokeless product shipment volume increased approximately 4% for the quarter. Our smokeless products category volume grew at approximately 5.5% over the last 12 months. USSTC grew Copenhagen\u2019s and Skoal\u2019s combined first quarter volume by 6.3%. USSTC also grew Copenhagen and Skoal\u2019s combined retail share by 2\/10\u2019s of a percentage point to 50.8% driven by Copenhagen.","Turning to innovative products Nu Mark continues to use its two MarkTen e-cigarettes test markets to refine the brand value equation. For example Nu Mark has experimented the different tools for creating awareness in trial in Arizona. While brand shares continue to move over time as manufacturers change promotion levels. MarkTen remain the leading e-vapor brand in Arizona during the first quarter. Nu Mark\u2019s test markets are providing valuable insights that we used to compete for category leadership over the long-term.","In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle grew first quarter operating company\u2019s income by 10% primarily driven by improved premium mix. Ste. Michelle\u2019s wine shipment volume increased 1.1% primarily driven by increased distribution of 14 Hands, partially offset by changes in trade inventories.","That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions while the calls are being compiled let me cover a few first quarter housekeeping items. Marlboro\u2019s price gap versus the lowest effective cigarette was 33%. Marlboro\u2019s net pack price was $5.91 up from $5.80 in the first quarter of 2013. The lowest effective price cigarette was $4.43 up $0.10 from the first quarter of 2013.","The cigarette discount segment\u2019s retail share was 25.1% down from 25.5% in the first quarter of 2013. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the first quarter was $1.48 per pack up $0.06 cents from the end of the first quarter of 2013.","Copenhagen\u2019s price gap versus the leading discount brand was 32%. Copenhagen\u2019s retail price was $4.09 dollars up from $4.07 in the first quarter of 2013. The price of the leading discount brand was $3.10 up $0.11 from the first quarter of 2013. CapEx was $27 million and ongoing depreciation and amortization was $50 million.","Operator do we have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.","Owen Bennett \u2013 Nomura","Couple of questions please. And firstly I was just wondering if you\u2019ve got any comment on the pending deeming regulation announcement it\u2019s been in news article this morning and how you expect this to impact both your e-cigarette and cigar growth. And then secondly obviously you had a very strong margin performance in the quarter particularly in smokeless. I was just wondering what was driving this and how we can expect margins to play out into the rest of the year and ignoring fourth quarter release from the tobacco file closure. Thank you.","Martin Barrington","Thanks for calling in. I don\u2019t have a comment on the deeming because I haven\u2019t read them yet. I guess the release \u2013 even as we\u2019re on the call here so I\u2019ve read only the press reports this morning and I\u2019d like to read them before I comment on them. With respect to margins you\u2019re right to point out that we did have good margin performance, we had a growth in smokeless, growth in the smokeless and that\u2019s all consistent with our strategies in the core tobacco business which is to grow our income in smokeless maximize our income in the smokeless segment. And then to grow our income to volume growth in smokeless so I don\u2019t know how you want to say more a quarter \u2013","Howard Willard III","No I might think, I think certainly in the first quarter we had 3.8% revenue growth for tax basis in smokeless. And that was a strong driver in the first quarter. And I think you said it\u2019s consistent with our strategy maximizing profitability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","David Adelman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Marty two things I wanted to ask you first the comment about faster second-half earnings-per-share growth and the alluding to the absent of the quarter buyout costs in the fourth quarter. That obviously only flatters your profitability if the pricing would have more or less be as it would have been otherwise. In other words do you or the industry collectively promote that away, it wouldn\u2019t have that benefit. So implicating what you\u2019re saying about the outlook for the fourth quarter is it your intent and hope to capture at least some of that net cost reduction benefit?","Martin Barrington","Well I think it\u2019s consistent with what we said before when we talked about quarter which is if you\u2019re trying to maximize your income in the smokeless segment, you obviously want to take every opportunity you can to do that and that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about that.","David Adelman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay and then that\u2019s a good takeaway to my second question which is to talk about pricing and your attitude and approach to pricing and the smokeless business Marty because the positive during the quarter, last year profits have been growing, 7% that\u2019s not shabby but the really hasn\u2019t been any net pricing in the last couple years. I mean do aspire to get to a point and a place where you can add to volume growth with net pricing. And what\u2019s holding it back is it the, is it the performance of Skoal, is it the competitive environment and discount brands etcetera.","Martin Barrington","Yeah sure let\u2019s go back. What I\u2019d say first of all is remember for us and our smokeless business we have margins above 62%. So of course you can always have a better net pricing realization but in the category that has margins like that and that were the category is growing. We can grow our income very nicely and remember what we\u2019re trying to do there is, is to grow that income off of the volume in line with the category growth and then to have modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal.","So that\u2019s the approach and I think in CAGNY we did a fairly good job I think of laying out how that\u2019s played out over the last five years since we got the business and whether it\u2019s on volume growth or income growth we\u2019ve really grown these business very nicely. Copenhagen of course has taken off well and we\u2019re now working on Skoal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Two questions. First is on, I\u2019m just its kind of interesting how the weather was so disastrous in the US weeks of January and February and this earning season broadly speaking companies really haven\u2019t seen any impact. So I\u2019m just curious on your kind of state of union on the consumer, is the consumer stronger than we\u2019ll thought? As we started off the year and then the second question is, now that the Green Smoke acquisition is closed, curious on if you plan on kind of launching it nationally in conjunction with MarkTen so you have kind of two, two different blends in the marketplace to try capture as much growth as you can.","Martin Barrington","Look with respect to the whether we could see some disruptions from time-to-time but actually it didn\u2019t really translate into a drag on other operating or our financial performance. With respect to the adult tobacco consumer I don\u2019t think that our view has changed since last we spoke about this. Given the unemployment and the underemployment rates and labor participation rates in the like and consumer confidence still being better but nowhere where it needs to be.","We\u2019re hopeful that things are going to improve but our operating plans from 14 assume that the adult tobacco consumers going to be cautious as was in \u201813. Good question about Green Smoke, we closed on Green Smoke and we\u2019re working now, we have our integration teams working on supply chain and marketing and the like. Our launch though, nationally will be focused on MarkTen and then obviously Green Smoke has retail opportunities in the US and we\u2019ll be working on that, but that\u2019s not a part of the national plan.","Nik Modi \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And Marty one just follow-up to that. It strikes to me that the innovation cycles and the e-cig category are much more rapid obviously when the traditional cigarette and tobacco businesses. What is Altria doing just from a capability standpoint to kind of prepare for so it\u2019s kind of a faster innovation timeline? It seems like most companies are struggling right now, they have the next generation of products but they can\u2019t launch them because they still have their existing products in the marketplace. I was just curious on your view?","Martin Barrington","Yeah, that\u2019s another good question. We actually started back on this Nick a couple of years ago to really improve our innovation system as a whole. We thought that we had opportunities to get faster, to develop better consumer insights and to more rapidly turn them into products to satisfy their needs. So we\u2019ve actually been after this, not just on e-cigarettes but on all of our business just for about two years now. We\u2019ve made significant improvements I\u2019d like to think in the system itself.","And then with respect to e-vapor, you\u2019re right to point out that the learning cycles are shorter. And so we were working very hard on our consumer insight system in our market reach systems to make sure that those systems are adjusted to give us quicker reads on what\u2019s happening with the consumer and in the marketplace. And we\u2019re using lots of techniques like ethnography and other techniques to make sure we\u2019re staying close to that consumer because they\u2019re moving around a bit.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So my first question is just really trying to better understand your investment spending behind the Nu Mark and MarkTen specifically just looking at the all others segment with a loss of $1 million, it\u2019s actually a little bit better sequentially from the fourth quarter. So trying to strip out what would PMCC versus your investment on Nu Mark. And then as you prepare for the national launch in June we see a step up in terms of the spending particularly in the second quarter there. So just kind of any help on your thoughts on the investment spending there?","Howard Willard III","Sure Judy, this is Howard. I think as you look at the year-over-year comparisons in the other segments, I think first quarter reflects what we\u2019ve said during the course of the year, which is we\u2019ve had unfavorable comparisons year-over-year on PMCC. And we\u2019ve also increase our investment related to Nu Mark, and I think as we move into the second quarter you\u2019re going to continue to see trends of us continuing to invest in Nu Mark as we ramp after that national launch in June.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","If I can follow from that Howard because just in terms of thinking about items, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts below the line. So if you can just help us understand just in terms of the interest expense because you did see a big drop off and if we just pick the run rate for Q1 it\u2019s a pretty meaningful decline in terms of the interest expenses. And then just in terms of the SAB Miller seems like that\u2019s coming in on a year-over-year basis, more of a drag in terms of your guidance. So any help you can provide us in terms of Q1 below the line and then how we should think about that for the rest of the year?","Howard Willard III","Certainly, I refer back to our annual guidance and I think you are right that this is going to be a bit of a unique year in that as the quarters unfold, you might have different trends in the quarters then that are reflected in the total year performance. And certainly that\u2019s reflected in the first quarter related to SAB Miller. IN SAB Miller we actually had unfavorable year-over-year trend, although that was really driven by the fact that SAB Miller issued more stock in the first quarter of last year than they did in the first quarter of this year that has a negative impact on our earnings.","If you actually looked at the performance excluding that SAB Miller had a growth in the quarter. So I think that certainly was a unique impact in the first quarter with regard to SAB Miller. We\u2019ve already communicated that on an annual basis, because of the strong asset sales in the past from PMCC, if those slowdown, there\u2019s going to be an unfavorable impact. But then of course below the operating company\u2019s income line there were number of favorability for the year. And you started to see the interest decline in the first quarter with certainly benefited earnings and that\u2019ll continue to unfold through the year.","You also see it in our cash rates on adjusted income basis has come down in the quarter. And that is going to be reflected through the total year. And then of course there\u2019s an impact on EPS growth from our share repurchase program. So there were certainly a number of positives in the quarter including a strong performance on the smokeless segment, but that is being offset by SAB Miller, by PMCC and some investments in Nu Mark. Although ultimately resulting that we thought was a nice 5.6% EPS growth for the quarter.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Is the run rate for the interest expense for the year a 2-1 run rate, it should be what we should be using?","Howard Willard III","Yeah, I don\u2019t know that you can just take an annualized in first quarter because there were a number of different things that happened last year. But certainly you should expect to see a nice favorable interest impact for the total year just like we had a nice favorable interest impact in the first quarter.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, and then Marty I just wanted to go back to sort of the cigarette industry consumption question. And the question just really is more just thinking about the longer-term run rate because clearly you have smokeless and some of these other tobacco products that have grown pretty nicely, and also just thinking about your MarkTen launch in a couple of test markets.","What do you see in terms of substitutability and kind of the trade-off you\u2019re seeing on cigarette consumption versus e-cigarettes? So is it really the decline for cigarette consumption, even if we come out of the economy in the more challenging economic conditions is the decline really going to accelerated just because all these other tobacco products really grow at a faster pace?","Martin Barrington","That question comes up a lot, but there\u2019s no reason to think that right now. We don\u2019t predict to the consumption decline rate going forward but we do look at a number of factors as you know. And what have we seen is that over the last several years it\u2019s really been 3% to 4% and that\u2019s been through periods when there have been other products that come into the marketplace. E-cigarettes I would argue being just among the last, so is it possible that it could speed up or head the other way I suppose anything is possible.","But when we look at the data and we look at it pretty carefully to see if there are any new drivers that would change what the historical rate has been, at least right now Judy we don\u2019t see that. Our model as is to use an estimate of secular decline of call it 2% to 3% in that neighborhood and embedded in that in our model are people who are trying other products or even indeed migrating to other products. And that seems like that plus the historical price elasticity still seems to do a pretty good job of explaining the decline rate.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And the test markets that you\u2019ve launched MarkTen, any difference that you\u2019re noticing in terms of the cigarette consumption behavior?","Martin Barrington","But that\u2019s pretty early there with respect to the test markets to be reading that.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you.","Martin Barrington","Judy, thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, I have a two part question on Marlboro. First could you drill down further on what drove the share gains and then how much of the gains were driven by your relatively new line extensions or has your core Marlboro improved and contributed to the gains. And then second I\u2019d be curious to hear from you how you\u2019re going to balance keeping your eye on your core Marlboro brand and then innovation behind the brand while also focusing on driving innovation e-cigs. I know you touched on this a little bit but just wanted to hear from you how you think about the targets for the businesses?","Martin Barrington","Sure, let me start with Marlboro. I think the answer to Marlboro lies in the main in the implementation of the Marlboro architecture which is itself a terrific example of innovation in the business. So you know the story behind the Marlboro architecture, I won\u2019t repeat it, but what we see there is that by employing it we\u2019ve been able to reach out in different ways to adult smokers.","You take Marlboro Black, which is doing extremely well and then really the Marlboro architecture along with innovation say on Marlboro.com the age restricted website and you\u2019ll like, has really helped Marlboro grow in the way that it wants to grow. I would also say if you look at Marlboro\u2019s historical share growth, it\u2019s completely consistent with that. So I think that\u2019s the answer on Marlboro and so far we\u2019ve been able to execute our strategy well I think of maximizing income while keeping Marlboro on a good momentum pad.","The way we describe the answer to your question about how can you focus on your core business while also paying attention to innovation is almost exactly like that. We call it maximizing the core business while innovating through the future. And our organization is filled with enough talented people and we have enough resources to develop that. I just don\u2019t accept the notion that the world is so binary as you have to do one of the other. And I think that you\u2019ve been able to see that recently. We continue to maximize the income that comes out of our core tobacco businesses at the same time we\u2019ve entered e-vapor space.","We created our own product. We\u2019ve been into test markets we\u2019ve done a transaction with PMI to hopefully sell those products internationally. And now we\u2019ve done a very nice tack on acquisition to improve our capability in such things as the supply chain and entrepreneurial culture. And you know what I\u2019m very proud of the organization. We have really I think done quite a good job of describing this to our people and where we\u2019re going and how we\u2019re going to get there. And I am very proud of the work that\u2019s been done in that regard.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay that\u2019s helpful looking at other companies. Historically a lot of times they feel as they, they start to chase growth and maybe lose focus on the core so I think it\u2019s just something to make sure you guys are paying attention to, that was very helpful. And then my question is a little bit of a follow on in terms of your approach to building your e-cig business. You did mention you\u2019re going to make disciplined investments. So I\u2019m curious to hear, how willing you are to let this business be a drag on your earnings or how should we think about this in the next couple of years in terms of the potential impact on earnings?","Martin Barrington","Well we think about it is through our mission. And our mission is to satisfy adult tobacco consumers. And if adult tobacco consumers want to move to innovative products like e-vapor probably won\u2019t be the last by the way, there\u2019ll be other products that they want to try. Particularly those, that may hold out the promise for less harm if the FDA were to approve them. I think it\u2019s the wrong approach to try to run the business in a way to hold that back.","We\u2019re in the job of satisfying our adult tobacco consumers. And we\u2019re going to have products for them that are premium and then have margin and they done responsibly. And that\u2019s how we think about it. And so it\u2019s about understanding your consumer and trying to give them what they want. All the while of course paying attention in keeping the word discipline is important. And we use that word deliberately so that we keep our eye on our core businesses.","Howard Willard III","I think this is Howard. I do think, we remain committed to our long-term EPS growth of 7% to 9% and continuing to return a large amount of cash to shareholders 80% payout ratio. And as we see it now we think the different levers we have to pull and the strength of our business platform auto allow us to make the appropriate investments and stay consistent with our long-term strategy.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","Alright very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Gowe of Stifel.","Chris Gowe \u2013 Stifel","I just had two questions for you if I could. First would be asking before about you\u2019ve got a pretty healthy stream of new products while the industry\u2019s been a little \u2013 to little slower just due to the FDA approvals. And we had more of those theoretically coming off from the FDA. So, maybe from what your portfolio in addition of new products but do you expect to see an increased activity with these new FDA approvals coming out over the next few months?","Martin Barrington","I suppose so I mean they have seen that FDA issued new performance metrics about how it\u2019s going to try to turn FET\u2019s faster beginning with fiscal year 2015 and they had some increase from various people about the time that\u2019s taken of FET so I can only talk about ours of course but we remain I think with a very healthy portfolio. Ultimately of course that\u2019s the way the industry\u2019s is going to work. The FDA is going to have to look at new products and approval.","Chris Gowe \u2013 Stifel","And then just a question in relation to taxes there\u2019s obviously an FET proposal for this year. I just want to get a sense of what you\u2019re expecting at this early stage of the year for bit of sales tax increases for the year do you see this year a larger than average volume this year?","Martin Barrington","Well I hope no and we\u2019ve working very hard to make that not happen with many others. So far be activity Chris has been very active in terms of proposals but actually fairly modest in terms of passage. So we don\u2019t have any FETs to memory that had passed so far this year although there have been lots of proposals. And there remain proposals in the state houses so our government authority is hard to have that. The FET is still hanging around out there although it is not seen at this moment in time anyway to have gain to lot of traction.","Chris Gowe \u2013 Stifel","Okay and just if I could ask one quick one maybe to Howard in relation to share repurchase activity you have some are you able to renew since the third quarter but my calculation you got a lot of free cash flow as well still coming through this year so are there any other unusual need for that cash that maybe keeping from being a little more aggressive the share repurchase activity this year.","Howard Willard III","Well I think you\u2019re right to point out this, on the current program we are coming towards the end of it. We got about $187 million left and our normal practice has been that most of the cash returned to shareholders come through our 80% dividend payout ratio but opportunistically we\u2019ll do some share repurchase. So additional share repurchase is sure to be a discussion topic here over the next several months. And I think with regard to incremental cash needs going forward, I don\u2019t think we see that there are dramatically different incremental needs going forward than we\u2019ve had over the last year. So, certainly use of cash for something, we\u2019ll be looking at over the next few months.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","I guess the most conspicuously Epsilon is in the mention of those competitive impact from new product launches in your largest non-menthol, non-full flavor segment. Can you just give a little color there, you\u2019ve gained share and since 3Q your price mix seems to have accelerated. How does that look, I mean obviously you\u2019re getting on just time, can you give a sense of kind of what you\u2019re seeing in the market you\u2019re in?","Martin Barrington","I think PM USA; the short answer is PM USA\u2019s have done a heck of a good job of managing its plans. We say this at the beginning of the year; it\u2019s a good reminder to us actually. When we do our planning we take everything into account including the fact that, competitors will launch products from time-to-time. And so we don\u2019t disclose how we think about that or the actions that PM USA takes to protect its franchise. But you\u2019re right to point out I think, that the metrics of its performance in the face of that and other challenges really speaks to the strength of the PM USA franchise.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Okay, that\u2019s fair and then just looking back at PMCC, versus about three years ago your asset balance there is less than half what it was. And certainly if you had asset the sale run rate that you did over the last few years that business would entirely go away in two and a half or so years. But I realized there are some assets that don\u2019t make sense to sell for any of a combination of reasons. And there\u2019s probably a little bit of a long tail. Just looking ahead can you give us a sense of what you expect in terms of the split in that segment it\u2019s income between sales and just ongoing operations? Are there still sales that makes sense to do, are they going to be sporadic or few and far between. Can you just give some color on kind of how the outlook is there?","Howard Willard III","Sure. I think you\u2019ve accessed PMCC about right, which is our goal really has been to rapidly unwind that business, but to do it in a way that is maximizing the profit and cash flow that Altria gets from it. And so we\u2019re pleased to see that we\u2019re down to a net finance receivable of only about $2 billion down quite significantly. Frankly our goal with an eye towards still having an appropriate earnings impact and cash flow impact is to unwind that business as quickly as possible because we think that our focus really is elsewhere at this time. I would say that we\u2019ve had quite strong asset sales over the last couple of years.","I would expect to see those asset sales continue but at a lower rate. And that\u2019s really what our belief is and I think that what results from that is the results we\u2019ll continue to get an income contribution from that business, the year-over-year comparisons. Certainly for this year are likely to be unfavorable and it\u2019s going to be lumpy in any given quarter. You\u2019re going to see part of the variance in that quarter driven by what goes on at PMCC. I think the good news is as you\u2019ve pointed out, the business is a much smaller part of Altria now. And I think its impact is going to diminish greatly here over the next year or two.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","That\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly this is me picking your wording a little that you mentioned in your release closing the Green Smoke deal and its affiliates, does it have any notable affiliates or like maybe a vaporizer business or anything that you might be looking at that\u2019s interesting or is that just sort of terminology that doesn\u2019t really \u2013?","Howard Willard III","We just meant to describe that there was more than one company in that family, but the business is exactly as we described it before.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you at this time, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Miss Sarah Knakmus for closing comments.","Sarah Knakmus","Thank you everyone for joining our call this morning.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Marshall (00:49), Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead.","Unverified Participant","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're here this morning with Marty Barrington, Altria's CEO, and Billy Gifford, Altria's CFO, to discuss Altria's 2017 first quarter business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing these results, which is available on our website at altria.com and through the Altria Investor app.","During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2016. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.","Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.","Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Bill (02:12). Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Altria is off to a solid start in 2017 despite some short-term headwinds. We grew first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share by 1.4% against a difficult comparison in the year-ago quarter when we grew adjusted diluted EPS more than 14%.","The smokeable product segment continued to generate strong results, which offset lower equity earnings from our beer investment and the effect of the voluntary product recall in the smokeless product segment.","Our business fundamentals remain strong and we believe we're well-positioned for the rest of the year. Earlier this morning, we reaffirmed our 2017 full year adjusted diluted EPS growth guidance of 7.5% to 9.5%, and we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted to the second half.","Here is some color on the businesses. The smokeable product segment grew its adjusted operating companies income by more than 8%. PM USA estimates that cigarette industry volume declines were in line with the historical rate as the industry lapped the improving consumer conditions and benefits from lower gasoline prices. Against this backdrop, the industry remains competitive and PM USA saw several competitive product expansions and promotional changes.","In this environment, PM USA remained focused on maximizing income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro across its measures of brand strength, which include equity, demographics, retail share, and profitability. PM USA implemented list price increases in March and continued to compete effectively at retail. PM USA was steady in its strategy and execution, resulting in strong smokeable segment price realization.","In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the more profitable tipped cigar segment continued to generate good results and the business is performing very well. The cigar category strength and trade inventory movements drove Middleton's reported shipment volume up over 12% in the quarter.","Turning to the smokeless product segment, it was a disappointing quarter resulting from the product recall caused by a product tampering incident. USSTC did the right thing by moving quickly to address the issue with consumers, the trade and other stakeholders, but the recall's effect shows in the numbers. Smokeless segment adjusted OCI declined 7.8% and USSTC estimates that the recall had an approximately 1-retail share point impact. The recall is concluded and USSTC has now largely completed replenishing wholesale and retail inventories. We expect that USSTC will recover the share loss over time.","Turning to innovative tobacco products, Altria continues to develop a portfolio of products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences. In April, Nu Mark announced the expansion of MarkTen to approximately 10,000 more stores and the availability of three more flavors for its adult vapors: winter mint, summer fusion, and smooth cream.","In heated tobacco, Altria continues to partner with Philip Morris International in seeking regulatory authorization to commercialize the IQOS system in the U.S. Both the modified risk tobacco product and pre-market tobacco product applications for IQOS now have been submitted with the FDA. PM USA's team continues to build its U.S. commercialization plan for IQOS.","So, in summary, we believe that Altria remains well-positioned for the rest of the year and, thus, we are reaffirming our full year guidance.","Now, here's Billy for more detail on our performance.","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the smokeable products segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter to 51%, due primarily to higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses.","Smokeable reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.7% in the quarter. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately 3%, in line with PM USA's estimate for the industry decline rate.","In addition, California's cigarette SET, which went into effect on April 1, will also affect shipment volumes in the short term. PM USA's first quarter retail share was 51%, down 0.1 share point; Marlboro's retail share declined by 0.2 share point to 43.6%.","In smokeless, adjusted OCI margins decreased by 3.6 percentage points to 61.9%, driven principally by the Recall impact, partially offset by higher pricing. The Recall drove USSTC's shipment volume down 5% in the quarter. USSTC estimates that smokeless industry volume grew at approximately 2% over the past six months.","It was a tough quarter for wine. Ste. Michelle's adjusted OCI of $21 million was 25% lower than last year and its margins contracted 4.6 percentage points to 15.4% due to lower volume and higher cost. Ste. Michelle's lower volume was driven by wholesalers reducing year-end inventory and the timing of the Easter holiday, which occurred in the first quarter of last year.","Let's now turn to our beer investment. As a reminder, ABI's fourth quarter 2016 results are included in our first quarter results due to the reporting lag. In the quarter, Altria's reported equity earnings from our investment in ABI were $23 million. These results included net pre-tax charges of $73 million for ABI special items.","As ABI noted in its fourth quarter earnings release, its underlying results were negatively impacted by a challenging environment in Brazil and mark-to-market losses related to ABI's hedging of its share-based compensation payment programs.","We, of course, continue to focus on our shareholders. In the quarter, we returned a large amount of cash to them, paying nearly $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchasing over $550 million in shares. As of March 31, Altria had approximately $1.4 billion remaining in the current $3 billion share repurchase program. We continue to expect completing this program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.","As Marty mentioned, we continue to expect that our 2017 adjusted diluted earnings growth will be higher in the second half. This is due primarily to the financial effect of USSTC's Recall this quarter and the benefit of reporting four full quarters of equity income from our ABI investment.","Lastly, a quick word on IRI's retail market share reporting. As a result of IRI's most recent database restatement, cigarette and smokeless retail market shares had been restated. Share information for each quarter of 2016 is available in our press release.","You remember that IRI uses a sample of retail stores and certain wholesale shipments to project market share and depict share trends. Historical trends of restated numbers are generally consistent with those under IRI's previously reported numbers.","That wraps up our results. Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we've posted for your reference a usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.","Operator, we're ready for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I actually have a question on Marlboro, and it looks like you've been losing slight share behind Marlboro over the past several quarters based on the adjusted data. So, I guess I'd like to better understand your current strategy with the brand and if some of the new SKUs haven't been as effective as you had hoped and what your innovation pipeline looks like for the remainder of the year behind the brand?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Bonnie. Thanks for the question. Listen, I think the best explanation of Marlboro was the one we gave at CAGNY just a little while ago. As you know, Marlboro remains the strongest brand by far in the cigarette category; it's the iconic brand in the category.","I think it's also useful to remember what our strategy is. Our strategy in smokeable is to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro over time. And so, as we've explained, momentum is viewed by us across various metrics. Let me just mention a few of them.","One is brand equity, and brand equity for Marlboro has never been higher. Indeed, I think the number we gave was 14 points higher than the next nearest competitor. Demographics are good. As you know, we've stabilized its share among the important 21 to 29 cohort. And actually, Marlboro share is very good across all the rest of the cohorts as well.","Its profitability is undeniable. I think the number we put up at CAGNY was $34 billion in retail sales in 2016. And then we come to share, and so with share, we look at it over time. It's down two-tenths in the quarter to be sure, but that's why we look at it over time because promotions and the like come in and out of the quarter.","If you look at it over a longer period, I don't know, say 2011, we've gained \u2013 I don't \u2013 call it, 1.5 share points to 2 share points. So the strategy hasn't changed at all. It's to be the leading brand in the category and to maximize its profitability.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I wanted to ask a question on your wine business. You mentioned it was certainly a tough quarter. Your margins were very low, probably the lowest they've actually been for a number of years. So guess I was hoping you guys could drill down a little further in some of the things that hurt your business during the quarter. You mentioned your volume was very weak due to the wholesalers reducing year-end inventory, so more color on this and then any sense what your volume was excluding this inventory fluctuation.","And then, finally, this begs a question, which I've asked you guys about before, but would love to hear any updated thoughts or plans that you might have for this business over the next several years in terms of further investments and if you need to actually increase your investments possibly to turn the business around? Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the question. Listen, I think you have to put the wine quarter in context. If you look at its income growth over the last five years, its grown double-digit, call it, I don't know, 12% give or take. And so you have to place the quarter in context. They had a tough quarter; there's no denying it.","There was inventory that got burned off from the end of the year and the Easter holiday was pushed back into the second quarter this year. So that has the effect on all the numbers if you called out in terms of the volume and obviously in terms of the margin.","The wine company does a terrific job out there. No quarter is perfect and this is ours, I guess, for the wine business. But they do a great job. I don't see the need for anyone to think that we have to step up, in any material way, the investment in the wine company. It was just a tough quarter.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Then just maybe one final quick question for me.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","On your EPS guidance this year, I just wanted to confirm that it does include any potential expense associated with the commercialization of IQOS this year in terms of any hiring you might need to do, marketing, store openings, et cetera. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes, it's all in.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So I wanted to pick up first, just to round out the Marlboro discussion...","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Marty, you talked about, I think, in the response to Bonnie that share trends amongst that important younger adult smoker segment had stabilized.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Just a little bit more color on \u2013 to the extent you have the granularity \u2013 what the sequential movement in that cohort looks like over the last year plus, is it similar to the overall where stable means down slightly or is actually truly stable?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I think the last time we looked at it, it was equal to or slightly greater than. And actually, if you look at it, Steve, from when we implemented the architecture in 2012, that's when it really began to stabilize and, obviously, with the implementation of the architecture, Marlboro Green and Marlboro Black, in particular, are helping in that cohort.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. That's great. And then a question on IQOS and, really, it's a clarification for my benefit. As I understand it, your joint efforts with PMI right now are based on a relationship whereby you'd effectively be licensing IQOS IP owned by PMI for commercialization in the U.S. Is that the correct understanding?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I might be a tad more precise on that if you let me. They're sourcing the product to us, as you know, they're licensing it into us for commercialization, which is essentially the inverse of the relationship we have on e-vapor, which is we source the product for them for e-vapor outside the United States and we license the trademark and the IP to them. The only distinction of course is that, before the spinoff, there was IP under the Altria tent which we retained at the spinoff.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Okay. That's clarifying. And I guess the question I'm thinking about, is there any reason \u2013 I know this is hypothetical, but just any reason why we couldn't evolve to a structure in the future where you would end up taking outright ownership of IQOS IP, at least as related to the U.S. market? Is there anything that would prevent that kind of outcome?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","No, I would agree with you that's it hypothetical, though. And there's nothing, I guess, that could foreclose a different arrangement being struck than the one that we have today, but what I've described is the arrangement we have today with PMI.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right, Steve. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I just wanted to ask a question about the smokeless division, and just to make sure I'm looking at it properly, if you kind of quantify the market share loss around 100 basis points of market share, your numbers you gave in the press release show you lost 70 basis points. Am I getting to like an underlying performance kind of ex the recall of how you performed at retail?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, Chris. Good morning. This is Billy. I think that's the proper way to look at it, Chris. What we quantified was about 100 basis points, the impact of the recall and you're right, in the actuals, we were down 70 basis points.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And have you had any of the SKUs back on the shelf long enough to see how that rebuild is going, of market share?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, as Marty mentioned, we are pretty much done replenishing the out-of-stocks that occurred because of the recall at retail, and we are seeing share recover. Now, remember, whenever you have that consumer purchasing other products in the marketplace, it takes a bit of time for us to recover the share, but we're seeing promising signs.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just a quick question, if I could, a bit of a follow-up on the e-vapor business. PMI has launched a new form of their platform for their e-vapor product in the U.K. Is that technology that Altria has access to or has helped develop? Could you have access to that product for the U.S. market?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I can describe generally to you the way that we're handling it at vapor, which is in addition to the two agreements that I described with Steve, I think you know, Chris, that we also have a technology sharing agreement with PMI to work on vapor products. And the way that basically works, at the risk of an over-summary is, technology that's developed under that agreement can be deployed by each of us in our respective geographies.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for your time this morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you for calling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just a quick follow-up on cigarette industry volumes, which improved a bit sequentially versus what we saw in the fourth quarter despite the fact that retail consumption in measured channels appeared to slow. We had some headwinds from slower c-store trends, difficult comp. So, how did that 3% compare to your expectations? And are there any favorable dynamics at the consumer level, maybe consumer confidence that you'd point to as having help support volumes in the short term?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I guess our view is that it's going back to about where we expected, Matt, is the honest answer. If you look at long-term trends, call it, a five-year trend for the industry, it's about 3%. As you know, we were flatter there for the period that we've discussed previously. Last year was at 2.5% and now, for this quarter, we're back at about 3% as our estimate.","So, our view is that the secular decline is what drives this. It has since the 1980s and it looks to us like it's going about that. In the quarter, there may be some movements in and out because we've got some excise tax activity, particularly in California, but I don't think its material over the course of the year.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Marty. And on IQOS, are there any updates you can provide on kind of the level of or pace of engagement at the state level as you're talking to legislators about tax treatment, any sense you can give on timeline and your level of confidence that you could potentially align those discussions with the outcome of the FDA's review of pre-market approval?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, that's an interesting question. We are talking to state legislators about the policy issue, of which IQOS is but a part, of having differential taxing, obviously, on lower risk products. That would make good sense. And tax policy gets changed over time, so we're working on that, but I don't have anything new to announce on that. But it is one of the elements of our work streams.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And if I could squeeze in one last one, sorry...","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just with the advent of deeming in the vapor space, just curious any observations on what the implications have been at retail since August. Have there been changes in retail or inventory levels in vapor? Have you seen better flexibility in being able to secure and manage shelf space as a result of those rules going into effect?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","No, I wouldn't say that. I'd distinguish probably how the dynamics with respect to our vapor business, which, as you know, is going quite well with MarkTen XL. You saw big boost in the number of stores that we're in. We see very good consumer response to the new product. I would say the thing to watch probably from an industry dynamic are the vape shops.","So, I know you're familiar with that phenomenon, but they now have to deal with FDA regulation where they didn't have to deal with any before. So we have seen some evidence that there's been a reduction in the number of vape shops and that the volume is moving to more traditional channels, which would be a good development for our business of course.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Marty.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, everyone.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Hey, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, a couple questions. Just \u2013 Marty, maybe you can just comment on Nat Sherman and how that integration is going and if you're seeing more space \u2013 more of your fair share of space in that higher-end of the back bar. And then the broader picture question is on IQOS and I guess, as you guys think about your plans to invest ahead of the approval process, what kind of consumer work have you been able to do? How do you know that the consumer is going to uptake on this product because, obviously, since you can't really launch it in the U.S. until you get that approval, I'm just curious on the science and the research that you're doing with the consumer to get a sense of what the uptake could be?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure. So, first on Nat Sherman, we're working through our plans now. We closed in January, if memory serves, and we're getting that ready to roll. So I don't really have a lot to tell you about Nat Sherman yet because we're just getting started.","On the IQOS consumer work, the situation of course, which is you're right, we don't have the product in market, so we can't do any in-market consumer work. But we certainly can do out-of-market work, which we are working on and, in particular, we are using the learnings from PMI, which I think we've discussed before.","So many of us have been in the international markets and our teams are working quite closely. The idea basically is to try to extract trade and consumer insights and then try to apply them to what we know about our market here, and so we're working on all of that now. And then when we get in the lead market, that's when we're going to learn more, once we have that product available for consumers. So we're trying to do as much as we can to get a fast start, but you're right to point out and we've pointed out, until you get it in the consumers' hands, you have to be careful.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And I guess, Marty, the follow-up to that is having been in the international business, are there any markets that you believe are analogous to the U.S. market just in terms of consumer behavior, tax structures, demographics?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I think the better way to look at it, Nik, is that there's no perfect market, but that each of the markets, if you're asking the right question, can give you insights into the behavior. So, obviously, in terms of traditional cigarette markets, it's customary to compare the United States more to Western Europe. But, obviously, there are insights to be generated from seeing the uptick that's taken place in Japan, so rather than to get locked in on a geography, we're focused in on the insights.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Excellent. Thanks so much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay, Nik. Good to hear from you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So I just had a few follow ups. One is just California and Pennsylvania, just kind of a color that \u2013 any color you could give us in terms of the impact from the excise tax increase in those markets?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Our estimate is that it will have about a 1% impact on volume this year.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And that there's no changes based on what you've seen so far in those markets?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","No, not so far.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just in terms of guidance, I know at CAGNY you talked about the potential Recall-related expenses in smokeless and I think, at that time, it wasn't clear whether it was going to be included in the adjusted earnings growth numbers. So, now, you're including it, but you didn't change the adjusted EPS numbers. So does that sort of imply that may be the underlying trends are actually slightly better than what you would've thought during CAGNY?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Hi, Judy. This is Billy. As we answered that question at CAGNY, you'll recall, when we provide guidance, we run a range of scenarios that are included in the guidance, and so that'll take into account these types of events, and so we feel the same that we felt at CAGNY. We feel good about guidance and that's why we were able to reaffirm today.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And then just lastly, Marty, on MarkTen XL, just in terms of the conversion rate that you're seeing on that product versus the prior versions, is there anything you can share with us on that front?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yes. We've had much, much better return business on the new product than we did on the former product, and so we can measure that by the number of cartridges that are purchased versus the device, and they're much, much better.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Nice to speak with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning, Vivien. You there?","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","I am. So, Marty, I just wanted to double-click on your comment around promotional activity from competitors in the quarter. Can you elaborate on that at all? And perhaps contextualize it in the broader context of the competitive landscape over time, because I know we see these episodes of competitive activity bubble up from time to time. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","That's probably the best way to describe it. Look, it's always competitive, and we're always monitoring and we're always adjusting. That's basically how it works. We were trying to provide some color in the quarter about seeing some competitive product expansions and some promotional changes, and PM USA has adjusted appropriately, as it always does.","So this is the Sturm und Drang that goes on, I think, at retail and in competition, but we watch it carefully, of course. But, of course, if you look at net pricing for the quarter, you can see that PM USA's realization was still above 4.5%. So that's what we were trying to convey, Vivien, which was some color about that.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. A bigger picture, theoretical question, if you will. Yesterday, President Trump noted that he would be open to a gas price increase and we haven't seen one since 1993. And I know there are a number of macro factors that you look at to determine kind of the health of the consumer and the potential impact on cigarette volumes, but can you just offer any commentary on how you guys would think about a gas tax increase impacting cigarette volumes? Thanks.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, obviously, that announcement just came out yesterday, and so we're taking a look at what it might do to the c-store trade. Obviously, gas is a big deal at c-store and that's where most of our traffic runs through. So I guess we'd have to \u2013 we'll have to take a look and see what it is. I know that there are sort of entrenched interests on both sides of the question about whether the gas tax should be raised. So we'll have to wait and see, I guess.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And then the last one for me, from the FDA from a menthol perspective, any updates there?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","None.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for calling, Vivien.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So, as I look back, as I think about the quarter as a whole, you've had really strong growth in OCI in smokeable against a really tough comp. Smokeless segment, yes, you've had the recall, but excluding that, profit looks really strong as well.","On the other hand, I guess market share in cigarettes has been a little bit disappointing. So the question is, as you look forward, is there any reason to suppose it won't return to a, let's say, a more normal pattern with perhaps less price realization, a little less OCI, but equally a better market share trend in cigarettes. That would be the first question.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. Well, let me respond to that. It's always a balance, is the honest answer. The strategy on the smokeable business, as you know Adam, is to try to maximize our income and we try to do that and we have done that, I think as you point out, quite well over time. At the same time, we want to make sure we have momentum on the key brands and we're mindful of that. So, the honest answer is it's a balance.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Fine. Okay. And then just turning back to the FDA, can you \u2013 at CAGNY, you gave quite a lot of detail about the expense of putting in applications for authorization for your cigars and e-products of various sorts. Can you just give an update about how those applications are going? Whether you've had any response back from the FDA, and whether there has been any news there? What news is there?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","I would say it continues to be as we described it at CAGNY, which is there's much more activity in terms of the interaction between the agency and our operating companies about their applications as they work through, and you're right, it's much more expensive than the FDA has estimated. And so, we're having to be mindful about which products we pick in order to put applications in because they come with an expense.","Look, our strategy is to engage constructively with the agency and to try to encourage it to make good policy decisions, and that includes on approval of our submissions. We continue to believe that our submissions are well-founded and in good form, but it's a process and you have to go through that with FDA. So, I would say, it's been more of the same since we last discussed this at CAGNY.","Adam J. Spielman - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thanks for calling in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray","Good morning.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Michael, good morning and welcome.","Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray","Thank you. You mentioned in your release that your strategy on Middleton is maximizing income and, obviously, that didn't reference share momentum. I don't think that's new, but can you confirm that? And then, either way, can you just speak a little bit to your thinking there? Because, certainly, the volume momentum in cigars broadly typically is a bit better than cigarettes, but is it just that the economics aren't as attractive or can you just frame why share momentum there wouldn't be part of the strategy?","William F. Gifford - Altria Group, Inc.","Sure, Michael. This is Billy. Thanks for the question. If you recall, when we look at the cigar category, you have it in basically three segments. You've got the tipped, where Black & Mild participates and has over about 90% of that segment. You have the un-tipped and then you have the non-cigarillo form.","We participate in the tipped and we have basically a large market share there. And so that's why we're running for profitability. That's where most of the profitability is in the cigar category. In the un-tipped segment, there's basically a price we're going on where people are competing for volume, but at a very low profitability, and we're really not participating in that segment. So it hasn't been a change for us, but I think that describes the strategy and the approach we have in the cigar category.","Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray","Okay. That's good context. Thank you. And then just one last one; on Nat Sherman, I know you are still working on plans and working on the roll out and so it's still very small, but in terms of the volume in the quarter, would that have had any material \u2013 how much did that add? Is there any amount of the volume there?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","It's very small. As you know, that brand right now is pretty much a boutique brand and so, in this quarter, I wouldn't call anything out as material.","Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Nice to hear from you.","Operator","And your next question comes to the line of Glen Anderson with Nuveen Asset Management.","Glen Richard Anderson - Nuveen Asset Management LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the call.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Glen Richard Anderson - Nuveen Asset Management LLC","I wanted to go back to IQOS and your conversations with the states. Have those conversations included how the IQOS would be measured as far as the MSA goes? Are the sticks going to be counted as a regular cigarette?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","No, but that's a good question as well. Our operating hypothesis is that the definition under the Master Settlement Agreement would cover the Heat Sticks because they're tobacco wrapped in paper. So it's a parallel definition. It's not the same as the states, but it's a parallel, you're right.","Glen Richard Anderson - Nuveen Asset Management LLC","And they would count as a cigarette then?","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","For those purposes, yes, sir.","Glen Richard Anderson - Nuveen Asset Management LLC","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Thank you for asking.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for the follow-up. Marty, I was just wondering \u2013 or Billy, if you can comment on just the general c-store environment because most companies are suggesting it's been pretty tough from a traffic standpoint, but it looks like cigarette industry volumes actually came in a bit better than I think most folks were looking at. So I was hoping to get your characterization on, kind of, how you see the environment right now.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question. We continue to see, at least our consumer, who of course are moving to the c-stores, we think the environment continues to be largely constructive for them, Nik, when you look at the factors we've discussed whether it's unemployment rates or housing starts or consumer confidence. We have been following carefully the commentary by others in CPG about perhaps some softening for their consumer set, which obviously overlaps with ours in some respects. We just haven't seen it yet and we haven't seen that in the c-store trade for our category, not yet.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Martin J. Barrington - Altria Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for following up.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Marshall (36:36) for closing remarks.","Unverified Participant","Thank you, all, for joining our call this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact us at Investor Relations.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
