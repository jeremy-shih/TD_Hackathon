All participants will be on a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. Participants will be announced by their name and company, and in order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of one question per person.","I would now like to introduce Shelley Young, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Shelley Young","","Thank you, operator. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone and welcome to IFF\u2019s second quarter conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our second quarter 2012 financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our website at iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay for up to one year on our website.","Before turning the call over to management, I\u2019d like to take care of a few housekeeping items. Please keep in mind that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s performance, particularly with regard to the second half and full-year 2012. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty.","For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our forward-looking statements and risk factors contained in today\u2019s 10-Q filing with the SEC as well as our 2011 10-K filed on February 28, 2012 and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website.","Some of today\u2019s prepared remarks will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today and on our website.","Now I\u2019d like to introduce the participants on today\u2019s call. With me today is Doug Tough, our Chairman and CEO; Hernan Vaisman, our President of Flavors; Nicolas Mirzayantz, our President of Fragrances; and Kevin Berryman, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Doug Tough, our Chairman and CEO.","Douglas D. Tough","","Thank you, Shelley, and good morning and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased with our performance this quarter, especially in light of the macroeconomic challenges presented by the ongoing difficulties in Western Europe and external sales volume declines in our Fragrance Ingredients business. Despite these challenges, we were able to deliver solid top line growth and even stronger double-digit earnings per share growth due to our efforts to diversify our revenue base, focus on our customers and control our costs.","Our diversity in terms of our customers, our end-use categories and our geographic footprint allowed us to continue to grow our business this quarter and deliver local currency sales growth of 4% and on a like-for-like basis, local currency sales growth of 5%. The growth we achieved this quarter, the highest since the first quarter of 2011 is due to the momentum we have established in many areas of the business. Our global reach and our customer intimacy enable us to better serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities that are available today for market share growth.","IFF\u2019s growth this quarter was driven by our Flavors business, which delivered 8% local currency growth on top of 8% local currency growth in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year performance reflects the balanced and the consistent nature of our business, and a strong and growing presence we have in emerging markets. We also saw growth in our Fragrance Compounds business this quarter, which delivered 6% local currency sales growth.","Solid growth in both the Fine & Beauty Care and the Functional Fragrance categories offset continued erosion in Ingredients. Nicolas Mirzayantz will provide more details on our Ingredients business later in the call. As anticipated this quarter was an inflection point for our business in terms of volume, costs and profitability and we are pleased with the results.","Raw material cost increases started to ease this quarter. However, they remain at high levels. As you know, raw material prices have been increasing for the last five quarters on average by 11% each quarter. We have been able to mitigate this inflation through pricing resulting in a more favorable relationship between raw material price increases and pricing this quarter.","Our other margin enhancing efforts including cost efficiencies and volume leverage when combined with pricing led to gross margins expanding 210 basis points to 41.8% this quarter versus 39.7% in the year-ago and 40.2% in the first quarter of 2012. Our adjusted operating profit increased 8% to $132.3 million driven by gross margin expansion and our cost management discipline. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 18.3% of sales from the second quarter of 2011.","Our enhanced operating profit combined with lower interest expense and other income and expense gains resulted in our ability to achieve earnings per share of $1.08 this quarter. We are able to achieve these results off of modest top line growth due to a continued focus on margin improvement opportunities, which include the exit of low-margin business that Hernan will talk to.","We\u2019ll now turn the call over to Hernan and Nicolas, who will provide you with an update on the progress of our business units, and then to Kevin Berryman, our CFO who will provide an overview of our financial performance. After their respective sessions, I will give you some perspective on our outlook for the balance of the year.","I would now like to introduce our Group President of Flavors, Hernan Vaisman.","Hernan Vaisman","","Thank you, Doug. I am pleased to report that this quarter, the Flavor business delivered 9% local currency growth on a like-for-like basis, which excludes approximately one percentage point associated with the strategic exit of low-margin sales activities, on top of that 8% local currency growth that we delivered in the second quarter of 2011. This is our 26 consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth. This quarter, we delivered a strong growth across all regions and categories with sequential growth over the first quarter in every region. Our beverage category achieved double-digit growth this quarter while Savory, Sweet, Dairy also delivered solid growth.","In North America, like-for-like growth was 12% excluding the exit of low-margin sales activities. The best-performing category was once again beverage, which was up strong double-digit due to new exciting wins in a steel beverage and other refreshing drinks. Dairy also delivered double-digit growth in the second quarter. We also saw incremental sales related to our sweetness modulation tools. Savory also increased on a like-for-like basis of winning part to savory modulation tools as part of our health and wellness initiatives.","Within our EAME region, like-for-like growth of 8% was led by strong growth in savory. Western Europe continues to be positive territory overall, due to continued strong wins in the market and volume growth in the emerging market of Africa and the Middle East.","In Latin America, local currency growth was 6%, led by double-digit growth in Sweet and a strong growth in Dairy and Beverage. We are looking to improve our sales momentum in Latin America. Greater Asia is our largest region, and once again this region delivered a strong growth with 9% local currency growth. On a like-for-like basis, Greater Asia grew at 10%. This growth was led by double-digit growth in Dairy and high single-digit growth in Beverage, Savory and Sweet.","As you know, our Flavors business is heavily indexed in the emerging markets, which are growing a bit much faster rate than other areas of the world due to changes in disposable income and lifestyle. People in these markets are not only looking for great, authentic taste and convenience. They are looking for healthier options in the food they eat.","To better support our customers in the emerging markets, we are building new facilities in Singapore and China, and expect to be making announcement of the opening of Singapore later this year and China early next year. We continue to invest in building creative centers that expand our global footprint and put us in closer proximity to our customer base.","In June, we announced the opening of a new facility in Delhi, India to house creative, technical, sensory and sales professionals. This facility will help us to better serve our global and regional customers\u2019 present and future needs and create the best taste for the Indian market. We have an 80 years history in India, and this investment together with our investment in Singapore and China demonstrate our faith and commitment to the region. ","This quarter, Flavors in emerging market achieved double digit increase on a local currency basis for the eleventh consecutive quarter. This performance was driven by double digit local currency growth in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, as well as strong growth in South Cone and Brazil.","Turning to profit, second quarter segment operating profit increased $10 million or 13.5% to $81 million. The strong volume, driven in part by new wins, favorable mix, pricing increase, the exiting of low margin business and ongoing cost reductions, more than offset rising raw material costs and resulted in increased gross margins. Improved our gross margins more than offset increases in research, selling and admin expenses. ","Operating profit margin increased 170 basis points versus the previous year to 22.3. This quarter, RSA was negatively affected by a payment to our biotech partner. As we reach a milestone in our collaboration much sooner than expected, we are excited about this collaboration and look forward to telling you more about the project as it evolves. Looking ahead, we expect to see consistent sales growth in the second half of 2012, led by continued momentum in the emerging markets, offset in part by the accelerated exit of low margin sales activities, which I expect will be more than twice the levels seen in the first half of this year. ","However, our consistent underlying sales growth remains strong driven by new businesses wins, using our sweetness and savory modulation tools to make our customers\u2019 end products healthier. We are excited of our future growth prospect.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Nicolas Mirzayantz, our Group President of Fragrances.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","","Thank you, Hernan, and good morning, everyone. For Fragrances in the second quarter of 2012, local currency sales were flat compared with the prior year quarter. Improved pricing, new business wins and favorable product mix were offset by declining ingredients volume. We saw positive trends in many areas of the business, resulting in a sequential improvement over the prior quarter in our Fragrance Compound business.","Local currency sales gross in Fine & Beauty Care increased 4% with strong growth in hair care in all regions and in toiletries especially in Latin America and EAME. The Fine & Beauty category was up 29% in LatAm and 11% in Greater Asia. In Functional Fragrance, we saw strong growth led by fabric care. Local currency sales growth of 7% was positive for the 16 consecutive quarter as new business wins, less erosion in the base business and the realization of price increases continue to drive results.","The Functional Fragrance category was up 11% in Latin America, up 6% in Greater Asia and up 8% in EAME. Our Fragrance Compound business was up 6% overall led by strong growth in Latin America and Greater Asia. This growth reflects the strength of our strategic relationships with our global and regional customers and our long-standing presence in the emerging markets.","Sales from encapsulation technology continued to increase double-digit and supported the growth in our Functional Fragrance business. Unfortunately, we\u2019re facing continued challenges in both Western Europe and in Fragrance Ingredients. ","Our total Fragrance business in EAME had negative local currency growth due to a 4% decline in Fine & Beauty Care and 24% decline in ingredients offset in part by the growth of 8% in Functional Fragrances. Sales in our EAME region were negatively affected by the ongoing Eurozone issues and the effect of economic uncertainty and unemployment on disposable income.","Now, I\u2019d like to say a few words on Fragrance Ingredients since this has been a concern to investors. Over the past year, we have seen continued deterioration on the external sales components of our Fragrance Ingredients business. This has prompted a thorough strategic review of our Ingredients business. ","Unprecedented increases in input cost and the resulting change in both competitive pricing and our customers\u2019 willingness to take additional supply chain risk to minimize their own input cost pressures have resulted in a change in industry dynamics. With the availability of cheaper materials from low price manufacturers in China and India, we are seeing incremental pressure on the top line, particularly in those non-patent protected ingredients that are commonly found in the marketplace.","Our strategic review and evaluation of options to improve the overall performance of our Ingredient business has confirmed that the Ingredient business has been and continues to be of strategic value to IFF due to the supply of cost advantage ingredients to our Fragrance Compounds business and the profitable sales of ingredients to external customers at acceptable margins. Overall, we have maintained our gross margin in this business even on the lower volume. ","I want to make clear that we are not looking to close or sell this business based on our current views. However, changes to operating models are required. We are now developing the specifics for how we will execute against the plan that will reduce cost to levels consistent with existing realities of the market. We will be communicating further actions to you at the appropriate time, so as not to impact our competitive positioning and ability to successfully execute.","After four challenging quarters, our continued focus on cost savings initiatives and discipline, improved mix and pricing allowed us to more than offset continued although lower increases in raw material input costs. As a result of these factors, gross margins expanded over the prior year helping support gross margin expansion at the consolidated level and resulted in improved segment operating profit.","Segment operating profit increased 2% or $1 million this quarter to $64 million. Our segment operating margin expended 90 basis points to 17.7%, up from 16.8% a year ago. We expect category and geographic diversification to help mitigate continued volume declines in Fragrance Ingredients. We expect to see continued momentum in Fine & Beauty Care and moderate growth in Functional Fragrance. ","We are encouraged by the pipeline of new business in our Fine & Beauty Care and Functional categories, as well as continued traction against our encapsulation technology, but we still must be mindful of potential economic weakness in Europe where economies are under pressure and in ingredients. We also expect continued margin recovery as we continue to implement further increases in pricing and focus on cost efficiencies and cost discipline.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman, our CFO.","Kevin Berryman","Thank you, Nicolas, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Reported revenues for the second quarter totaled $721.3 million, an increase of 1% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, local currency sales increased 4%. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of lower margin discontinued sales activities, our local currency sales growth was 5%, reflecting improved sales trends in many parts of our global business.","As you\u2019ve heard from Hernan, Flavors achieved high single-digit growth in every region, an 8% growth overall. This is on top of 8% growth in the year-ago quarter, which speaks to the consistency and stability of this business. Excluding the impact of discontinued business, Flavors growth was 9% led by a long list of new product wins among a diverse set of customers.","In Fragrance, the growth in Fine & Beauty Care and Functional was much improved from the first quarter, although the 6% local currency growth in compounds was offset by volume softness in Ingredients, resulting in flat Fragrance local currency sales growth for the quarter.","I want to saw a few words about our performance in Europe. We have seen some weakness in Western Europe, particularly in those countries as economies are challenged by low growth and high unemployment. Overall, our Flavors business continues to grow, but our Fragrance business, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the volume in Western Europe, has been pressured by both the weakness in European economies as well as pressure in Ingredients.","On the positive side, we are not heavily indexed to the countries that are most under economic pressure and even though our volume is somewhat impacted, our geographic diversity has muted the impact. As you know, we have a large geographic footprint in both developed and emerging markets.","We are extremely well indexed in the emerging markets, perhaps better than any of our competitors, but we are seeing emerging market growth of 9% this quarter on a local currency basis led by very high growth in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, and Vietnam. The emerging markets represented 48% of our sales in the second quarter, up from 46% of sales in the first quarter, so they continue to grow much faster than the developed markets.","Many of you have been asking about our ingredients progress and I wanted to add a few words to what Nicolas has shared with you about the strategic review. As he said, we are developing a detailed plan for making changes to our business model. I\u2019d like to provide some insight into how that will play out over the near-term.","Due to the complexities of the business, we do not expect to see any material changes to our business in the near-term, especially in the third quarter. However, we do believe our plan will result in a stronger and more sustainable foundation longer-term.","Turning to bottom line growth, adjusted operating profit increased to 8% to $132.3 million this quarter due to pricing actions and volume gains, which more than offset increases in raw material costs and increased incentive compensation accruals.","Interest expense declined to $1.4 million in the quarter, reflecting lower levels of outstanding debt and other income, expenses improved to $1.9 million year-over-year due to favorable exchange gain and losses on outstanding working capital balances.","I\u2019d also like to talk briefly about our second quarter tax rate. This year our effective tax rate was 27.7% versus 27.4% a year-ago. This is primarily due to a reserve adjustment related to one of our tax defaulting cases in Spain. Other provision adjustments on uncertain tax positions and the absence of an R&D tax credit in U.S. during the second quarter of 2012. Despite a slightly higher tax rate of 27.7%, adjusted EPS was still able to increase 11% to $1.08, up from $0.97 in the second quarter of 2011 when excluding restructuring and other charges of $0.04 per share in the prior year quarter.","As expected, and as we discussed on our first quarter conference call, our raw material cost increases started to moderate in the second quarter. As you can see in the slide, material costs were up 5% this quarter, and they are growing at a slower rate than in the second quarter of 2011 when they were impacted by a 12% cost increase. While increases in raw material costs are moderating, they remain at high levels.","Since the second quarter of 2011, we are seeing on average and 11% increase in raw material cost each quarter. We saw the highest increase in the third quarter of 2011. Again, we expect that raw material cost increases will continue to ease over the balance of the year.","In the second quarter, with the easing of raw material cost increases, increased realization of pricing and achievement of other margin improvement initiatives, we believe we have reached an inflection point in our gross margin percentage from both Q1 2012 and the year-ago period.","As a result, our consolidated gross margins improved to 41.8% compared with 39.7% in the second quarter of 2011 reflecting gross margin improvements in both businesses, although both remained below the gross margin pre-inflation levels of 2010. This gross margin improvement resulted in adjusted operating profit margins improving to 18.3%, up from 17% in the prior year quarter or 130 basis point improvement.","From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA expenses, as a percentage of sales increased to 80 basis points to 23.5% of sales, up from 22.7%. The increase in RSA reflects continued R&D spend of close to 8% of sales combined with planned spend in sales activities to support our growth in the emerging markets and higher pension cost. The year-over-year change in RSA is expected to increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to increased compensation accruals in the second half of 2012, over the second half of 2011.","Foreign exchange in the second quarter had an approximate 300 basis point impact on the top line, but had a lesser impact on profitability as a result of our cash flow hedging activities, which we\u2019ve discussed in the past. Looking ahead, over 70% of our euro-dollar exposure in 2012 remains hedged at a rate near 1.39. However, given the deterioration of the euro with current rates at 1.24, we expect headwinds from foreign exchange to increase despite our hedging activities.","The full-year FX impact on our EPS is approximately $0.05 versus what we outlined on our first quarter call, when the euro was trading more in the range of 1.30. Of course, this will be affected by any change in rates throughout the second half of the year. Note also that we are nearly 50% hedged against the euro for 2013 at levels that approximate 1.30.","From a cash flow perspective, for the first half of the year, our operating cash flow increased by $133 million of the first half of 2011. This was driven by increases in net income, improved core working capital, lower incentive compensation payouts in the first quarter of the year, and lower tax payments.","As anticipated, capital expenditures increased in line with our guidance due to our investments in Singapore and China, and we expect capital spending to approach 5% of sales for the full-year 2012. Our investments in the Singapore and China are progressing well, and we will continue to be focused on supporting our strategic growth with a specific concentration on the emerging markets and the addition of new technology platforms.","Our history has proven the willingness to return cash to shareholders and our Board authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share of the company\u2019s stock, an increase of $0.03 from the current quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. We expect to continue to increase our dividend in line with our earnings growth while investing in attractive growth opportunities.","I would also like to make some comments regarding our recently announced settlement with the Spanish tax authorities. As a result of the settlement, we will report an after tax charge of $72.4 million or $0.88 per share in the third quarter of 2012. We have agreed to pay an aggregate amount of \u20ac86 million or approximately $106 million before the end of the year.","The settlement was the result of recent discussions and we are satisfied with the outcome. Not only does it remove much uncertainty related to our past tax position, but importantly, we were able to agree upon the key principles that will establish the company\u2019s tax basis in Spain for 2012 and future years. We expect to formalize this agreement before the end of 2012, and believe the terms of our agreement will not have a material impact on our effective tax rate going forward.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year.","Douglas D. Tough","","Thank you, Kevin. Although we are pleased with our performance this quarter, we are mindful of the challenges that lie ahead related to slowing macroeconomic growth in Western Europe, the foreign exchange headwinds coming from the strengthening of the dollar versus the euro, and ongoing top line pressure we anticipate on the ingredients business. Although we\u2019re cautious about the second half of the year, we are positive about many aspects of our business. We\u2019ve seen strong and consistent growth from Flavors in every region and our Fragrance Compounds business enjoyed strong growth in Greater Asia and Latin America.","We have often said that our customers\u2019 products are resilient even in a slowing economy, and we are seeing signs of this. Given the strengths of our customer relationships, based in part on our ability to provide them with valuable insights related to consumer preferences as well as our robust pipeline of innovation from R&D, we expect to continue to grow. From a top line perspective, we expect to see continued local currency sales growth in Flavors, offset in part by the accelerated exit of low margin sales activities in the second half of this year.","In Fragrances, we expect momentum to improve in Fine & Beauty Care while also maintaining solid growth in functional. In total, we believe that many parts of our business will demonstrate continued growth. The one area where we see risk to our forecast is in Ingredients as current trends remain weak on our external portfolio due to price competition on non-patented ingredients that are commonly found in the marketplace. Ingredients, although an important part of our business, accounts for less than 10% of our external sales and we want to put their performance into perspective. ","We expect to see Fragrance Ingredients continue to experience top line pressure in the near term, certainly during the third quarter. Decisions that are made by our customers, based on price or anything else for that matter have long-term implications for the business and we need to adjust our business model as needed to the new insights into the current market dynamics. With regard to margin trends, we expect that raw material cost will continue to stabilize at current rates. We expect our gross margins will continue to trend above year ago levels. ","With regard to earnings per share, it is our policy not to give guidance; however, excluding the impact of the Spanish tax settlement, we believe that if our business continues to perform as we expected, we will be able to deliver year-over-year earnings per share growth more in line with the current marketplace estimates. We will continue to make investments in our business, which are vital to sustain long-term profitable growth, which remains our focus. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook given the lagging and uneven recovery cycle for foreign exchange pressures and softness ingredients.","In conclusion, our strong performance this quarter is a result of our geographic footprint, our product diversity, and our ability to work with our customers year-in and year-out to develop new products that define the industry and delight consumers. Going forward, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook, given the lagging economic growth in many areas of the globe. We will proactively manage our performance and calibrate our costs in line with our top line growth as we continue to execute against our business plans.","With that, here at IFF, we would be glad to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark Astrachan \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Thanks. Hey, good morning everybody. Two quick questions. One, Kevin, on incentive comp, could you just give us an idea of what you think the headwinds will be in the back half of the year given some of the comparisons from a year ago? And then more just a broader comment, could you talk a bit about the competitive outlook for pricing over the balance of this year. And then maybe Hernan and Nicolas could give a bit of an update on how they\u2019re thinking about it in their own businesses, especially versus some of the competition that seems to want to continue to take more pricing?","Kevin Berryman","","Sure, no problem, Mark. this is Kevin. Good morning to you. Look, I think in terms of the incentive comp, the way I would direct you is to look at our second quarter numbers that is pretty much very close to a normalized level of incentive comp and that would probably be a good measure to talk to or to model out for the balance of the year, that would not be a bad assumption, assuming we could continue to perform at our level of expectations. As you know, deterioration over the back half of last year resulted in us changing our incentive comp. so there will be differences versus year ago. if you use kind of the year-to-date figures, they\u2019re going to be pretty close in terms of what our expectations might be going forward.","As it relates to pricing, I think as you look at our total pricing for the quarter, effectively we had nearly 3% of pricing that was seen in the quarter. However, I will let you know that\u2019s certainly skewed because of the dynamics of the Fragrance and Ingredients business. So if you look at the 3% kind of pricing number or close to it versus the 4%, it looks like the majority of the sales growth is coming from pricing. but if you eliminate the ingredients dynamic and really talk to just the effects relative to our compound business, we actually saw a greater than 50% of our growth in the compound business came from volume with, let\u2019s call it 45% coming from pricing. So that continues to be an effort that we have been working on over the course of 2011, and there will be some subsequent discussions that continue to occur over the balance of 2012 as well, although much of the pricing has already been put in place.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","","Mark, good morning, it\u2019s Nicolas. How are you?","Mark Astrachan \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Fine.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Mark, regarding your questions about the pricing, it is important to mention that and as indicated input cost remained at high level in 2012, which required us to have ongoing discussions with our customers to capture additional price increase as needed. So we\u2019re still engaged in price increase discussion with our customers.","Hernan Vaisman","","Hi, Mark, it\u2019s Hernan here. I mean similar comments what Nicolas mentioned, we are still in ongoing discussion with customers. Our belief is that by the end of the year, we will be at least covering the whole impact of the input cost. But having said that, I mean it still have a negative impact in the margin on a percentage basis.","Mark Astrachan \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to first ask about Asia and particularly China, if you\u2019ve seen any kind of slowing in demand or deceleration in base business volume or if it\u2019s kind of a steady issue goes?","Hernan Vaisman","","Yeah, hi Lauren, it\u2019s Hernan. Yes. in fact, we see deceleration in the volumes; I think that is basically because I mean you have a different consumer sentiment there. Having said that, I mean we are seeing now, I mean this quarter, the sales picking up a little bit, but the overall I mean having these relationships in China, overall Greater Asia were very strong. We have a very good momentum in Southeast Asia. That\u2019s why I mean we started believing that it\u2019s going to keep on growing at the current rate.","Douglas D. Tough","","I would say Lauren, just one additional comment, I think that the strength of the Greater Asia numbers that we have been able to show even with some slowing in China indicates the diversity of the portfolio, and the ability to continue to drive growth even when there can be specific markets that show a little bit of softening versus others. So I think that that\u2019s a positive, relative to the ability to continue to put pretty good growth numbers up in the second quarter.","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital","","And then what about the same questions for Nicolas, just in terms of Fragrance in China?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","","Yes. We have seen also some pressure and lower demand in China, but to really echo what Kevin was saying, the introduction of new product is in encapsulation and the diversity in the region are enabling us to deliver good growth in the region and to offset some of the softness in China at the moment.","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Okay, great. And then just also, I was curious about sort of base business volume trend, I think erosion was a bigger issue kind of Q4 and Q1. and then it sounded like Q1 was ending and moving into Q2 the reason is you have a little bit more confident was that the win rate here are even strong, but base business volumes are stabilizing. So, how did that sort of develop through the quarter, I guess from an aggregate basis. and then where do you stand as you look into the back half? Thanks.","Kevin Berryman","","I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat the question again, Lauren?","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Sure, yeah. So, Q4 and Q1, you guys had already been talking about an accelerating rate of wins, but that the drag on the businesses in compounds was base business was weak. So, I\u2019m asking how that has evolved, because at the end of last quarter, you said that things looking into Q2 were looking a little bit better when you are looking at the first month of the quarter from a base business standpoint. So, I was curious about that dynamic base business volume, and the outlook for the rest of the year versus new wins?","Kevin Berryman","","Thanks for the repeat. Look, the underlying volume of the business did improve in the second quarter as we expected. Wins continued to be positive, so we saw a good win, new win momentum. But we did see an improvement in the underlying volume of the existing business, which certainly helped support the improvement in the growth dynamics.","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital","","And was the bigger shift, was there a greater improvement in the Fragrance side of the business, I mean obviously flavors has been strong throughout?","Kevin Berryman","","I think directionally, yes, but we saw improvements in both.","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Aaron with RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to just start with the question on the raw materials. So, I think you\u2019re kind of running maybe upper single-digits for the first half, and I think from last quarter, you had mentioned an expectation for the year to be kind of have a modest inflation. So, is it fair to assume that inflation will turn negative in the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis? And then can you give us any kind of early insight into how you\u2019re thinking about the cost backdrop for 2013 in light of some of the stuff that we\u2019ve seen with kind of the drought impacting certain costs?","Kevin Berryman","","Ed, let me take a crack at that and then if any of my colleagues would like to jump in. Certainly, if you look at our year-to-date figures on the input costs, if you just assume that we\u2019re flat over the balance of the year, we kind of get to that moderate level of input costs that we\u2019ve been talking about over the balance of the year or for the full-year. So, I think that it\u2019s probably too early to say at the end of the day exactly what happened on input by the end of the year, because it will depend upon the mix and the use and so on and so forth. But certainly, it\u2019s trending in the right direction.","And then I would echo the comments of my business units, our colleagues who have talked that the input costs continue to remain at elevated levels and certainly, well above the levels of 2010 before the inflation that we saw significantly in over the course of the last 12 months or thereabout. So, certainly, we\u2019re expecting to see that continue to improve. As it relates to 2013, a little bit early to say at this particular point in time and we\u2019ll provide some additional guidance when the time is appropriate, but certainly the comments that we would make is, we\u2019re continuing to see stability versus anything other than that. But it\u2019s too early to say for 2013.","Edward Aaron \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Okay, thanks. And then I think you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that you thought that growth in Fine & Beauty would improve in the second half of the year. Can you maybe just speak to the drivers of that? Is that more of a kind of an easier comparison issue or are there some new wins that are kind of flowing through that\u2019s going to give you some lift in the second half?","Douglas D. Tough","","I think it\u2019s a combination of the two, but there is obviously a very good momentum in new wins, as we had spoke before, and that you have different ways of launches for the new wins and this year the majority of the wins in which we participate are more geared towards Q3 and Q4. So, we are benefitting from this new introduction to the marketplace and also another component is lower erosion levels. So the three combine are providing good level of momentum and good level of confidence for the second half.","Edward Aaron \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And then just my final question related to FX, so I think Kevin you mentioned a $0.05 incremental headwind, is that relative to kind of what you\u2019re expecting when you reported last quarter or is that the total impact on a year-over-year basis for the year? And then can you maybe just also help me understand $0.05 seems like, I understand that euro has weakened quite a bit but $0.05 seems like kind of lot just considering that you are about 70% hedged, so I\u2019m just struggling with the math on that a little bit as it relates to the full year.","Kevin Berryman","No problem. Mark, look, it\u2019s the difference in the balance of the year in terms of how the euro has changed in value relative to what we were talking three months ago. The reason is, because as you think about our structure of our cash flow hedges, those hedges are supporting investments or purchases of materials. Those materials go into inventory at the hedged levels and consequently as we get closer to the end of the year, the benefits of those hedges start to rollover into the 2013 year as opposed to seeing the benefits this year. ","So effectively, if the euro continues to deteriorate in this year specifically, we\u2019ll see incremental pressure because the hedges that are impacting our current purchases will more likely than not impact next year as opposed to this year.","Edward Aaron \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good morning. When you look at your Fragrance business on a sequential basis, your revenues were flat and your operating profits were up $8 million. Can you parse the $8 million as to where that improvement came from? Was it raw materials? Was I don\u2019t know a quarter of it raw materials, a quarter of it price, and then there is some cost efficiencies? How do you look at that $8 million number?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Yes. Good morning. It\u2019s Nicolas.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good morning.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","The improvement was $1 million to the $64 million. I think that as we have mentioned, a lot of the margin improvement initiative, cost discipline, also the restructuring benefits that we announced earlier this year, and pricing actions are all contributing to offset the continued input cost increase and deliver some improvement in operating margins.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan","And then, for the company generally, did your sequential prices increase in the quarter and do you expect them to sequentially increase in the third quarter?","Kevin Berryman","Yeah, this is Kevin. Yes, they did. So if you kind of look at two-year stacks of pricing, which is the way to think about it, yes, we did have higher levels of pricing in the second quarter. And given the discussion that both Hernan and Nicolas had alluded to in previous responses to questions, there is some incremental pricing that is continuing to be discussed with our customers over the balance of the year. So to the extent that those occur, those would be sequential pricing on top of the sequential pricing we have been able to realize.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, and then if I can just squeeze in the last one on ingredients. The Ingredients business has contracted at a double digit rate for four quarters in a row. So the comparisons will really ease. Come the third and the fourth quarter, are you now expecting volume growth but price erosion, is that the operative dynamic or is there a different dynamic that you expect in the second half?","Kevin Berryman","Jeff, this is Kevin. I\u2019ll take a crack and then Nicolas would like to add any additional color commentary that would be appropriate. ","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan","Sure.","Kevin Berryman","But I think as we outlined in our prepared remarks, we continue to see there will be pressure in our Ingredients business. It is certainly something that we have been incorporating into our review of the business and our actions that we are working on finalizing and developing are really embedding the most recent views as it relates to the ingredient business. So we continue to see some pressure certainly in the third quarter. There certainly has been volatility in this part of the portfolio. And Nicolas has already alluded to the fact that gross margin however has continued to be held in that business, which is a positive aspect, even with these pressures that we\u2019ve seen on volumes. And so as we go forward we will provide additional updates into the future. but certainly, in the third quarter, we continue to expect to see some pressure.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","It\u2019s Nicolas, as you know the dynamic in the Fragrance Ingredients are really contract commitment every six months and as we\u2019re negotiating for the second half, some of these contracts were renewed and retained and some were not. One thing, which is important to mention is that we really elected to older margins and some of the contracts that were lost, many of them were at margin that will be value destroying or EP negative. So we\u2019re seeing pressure for the second half of the year, and we know that margin protection was really important for us and we didn\u2019t want to chase low margin business.","Kevin Berryman","Okay, thank you very much.","","Operator","Your next question comes from John Roberts with Buckingham Research.","John Roberts \u2013 Buckingham Research","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Kevin Berryman","Yeah. Good morning, John.","Douglas D. Tough","Yes.","John Roberts \u2013 Buckingham Research","After you take your actions on Fragrance Ingredients, do you expect the external sales to remain large enough to justify separately reporting this business or do you think we might end up with it folded into both Functional, Fragrance and maybe little in Fine Fragrance?","Douglas D. Tough","I think we have to understand the full impact of the plan that we have. At this juncture, we would leave it reporting as a standalone item. and I expect we would want to continue to do that in the short-term, particularly as a function of it is very important from the Board to look at. I think the important part about this, I think is to understand how important it is within both supporting the current compounds business, but also the focus of our R&D continues to be on the development of products and molecules, which we then would sell on an external market basis and not be subject to the vagaries of commodity pricing and high volume, but lower pricing that we\u2019ve seen. So we still see there is a bright future, we\u2019ve done the economic profit analysis to understand how important this business is, revisiting briefly a comment that Jeff made a while ago, we did not foresee the magnitude of the shift in volumes. ","So we\u2019ve had four quarters of some softness and thought at this stage of the game, we would be coming out of that trough and comparing against an acceptable target in order to achieve growth that hasn\u2019t happened. but that\u2019s really what the focus is right now, but how important it is both internally and continues to be externally, despite the growth, it\u2019s still a large part of the volume, we\u2019ll keep the microscope on it at a very big level.","John Roberts \u2013 Buckingham Research","And then secondly, was the incentive comp accrual above budget. And did you increase the rate sequentially or it was expected to be above year-over-year and it was in-line with what you were budgeting?","Kevin Berryman","It was pretty close to budget.","","John Roberts \u2013 Buckingham Research","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Yang.","Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Hi, good morning, thank you for taking my question. First a clarification, did Kevin say that in Western Europe \u2013 your Western Europe exposure, two-thirds of that is Fragrance?","Kevin Berryman","Yes.","Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay. and just an update on your currency hedges, so you have that I think 70% this year at $1.39, 50% hedged on the euro in 2013 at $1.40. So what\u2019s the best way to think about that once those hedges all rollover and assuming the euro stays where it is? Does that mean that your base level earnings from a translation basis is, I calculated something back-of-the-envelope maybe 3% or so?","Kevin Berryman","Yeah. This is just a quick comment, you mentioned $1.40 for 2013, it\u2019s actually $1.30.","","Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay, got it.","Kevin Berryman","In terms of the 50% coverage, so if the euro were to stay at, for example, current levels and we continue to layer in hedges that would obviously result and that number coming down over time, because of assuming that the rates and the futures as it relates to the current spot don\u2019t materially change. That will translate into a lower effective number at the end of the day when we finalize with our layering end of the hedge programs. We haven\u2019t talked specifically about what the impacts will be, but certainly our hedging program doesn\u2019t eliminate ultimately dynamics of currency over the long-term. It certainly eliminates volatility and fluctuation, and I think that\u2019s the way you need to think about it.","Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay. And on the Spanish settlement, about $100 million in U.S., what\u2019s the timing of the payouts there and does that affect our interest expense?","Kevin Berryman","Yes. We will be making payments. It\u2019s expected that that money will be paid over the course of the balance of the year; probably the bulk of it is going to be in Q3, maybe most of it in Q3. We are effectively going to be able to access our revolver to make any potential payments in the short run, but as you know, we have good cash flow dynamics in our business. So at the end of the day, we\u2019ll be able to fund the operations from our funded payment from our cash from operations. And consequently once we do that, we should be able to eliminate existing bank guarantees that are in place relative to those tax matters with Spain and certainly the payments or the interest rates relative to our revolver are quite low.","Kevin Berryman","Got it; thank you.","Operator","I am showing no further questions at this time.","Douglas D. Tough","Well, thank you very much, to all our participants on the call discussing our second quarter results, and particularly the relevant questions which came from the participants.

[Operator Instructions] ","I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau","Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's second quarter 2019 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.","Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for our third quarter, second half and full year 2019. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 26, 2019, and our press release that we filed yesterday.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday and is on our website.","With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We'll start with prepared remarks, and then take any questions that you may have.","With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Mike. On the call today, I will like to provide a recap of our vision 2021, which we shared at our Investor Day the past June. After that, I will provide comments on our second quarter financial results and give an update on our integration progress. Once finished, I will ask Rich to give a more in depth financial review of our business performance and provide an update on our outlook for the balance of the year. Then we will take any questions that you may have.","We are very confident in the long-term outlook for our business. Thanks in large part to our industry leading innovation, both in diverse customer base and superior product portfolio. IFF has a history of strong sales growth and proven profitability. We are excited about the future as we believe that combination of IFF and Frutarom will create significant value for our customers, employees and shareholders.","At our Investor Day in June, we outlined our new vision 2021 strategy. The Vision 2021 strategy has been designed to leverage our newly combined organization, our enhanced product portfolio, increased naturals position, expanded market access, broader customer base and greater innovation pipeline, all with our customer at the centre of everything we do.","Our four strategic pillars include, unlocking growth opportunities, while we'll capitalize on our expanded product portfolio on a customer base, and extensive geographic presence. We also expect that cross selling and integrated solutions are relatively new capabilities set will lead to 100 million sales over the 2019 to '21 period, driving innovation while we will invest in high growth and high return platforms to continue to drive our industry leading R&D pipeline. ","I'm pleased to say, with the combination of IFF and Frutarom on R&D is the strongest it has been in the company's history. We have expanded R&D capabilities with cutting edge research, all carefully prioritized platforms based on future return potential. ","Managing the portfolio, while we will focus on optimizing our portfolio to maximize value creation, our business portfolio is much more broad and diverse with a range of growth potentials and margin profiles. To maximize value creation, we are focusing on disciplined resource allocation, where we establish clear guidelines to prioritize our investment decisions as we move forward. ","Accelerating business transformation, while we were successfully integrated Frutarom on delivering 145 million of synergies, but also continuing our strong productivity agenda in our legacy business for incremental 100 million in savings. And of course, culture, technology sustainability, M&A and talent all remain critical enablers to our strategy.","From a long-term perspective, we're excited about where we compete. Our market potential is now approximately 50 billion with an estimated 4% total market growth rate. This is a significant increase from just one year ago, while estimated market was approximately 26.5 billion with an average growth rate of 2% to 3%. ","So Frutarom, we have gained broad exposure into many attractive adjacencies where growth is approximately 6% in the next five years. This additional access not only provides us with incremental market potential, but we believe growth over the mid and long-term should accelerate as needed as nearly all these adjacent markets have higher intrinsic growth rates. ","To ensure we capture the opportunities ahead, we are we aligning our business to take effect in 2020. Frutarom's tastes and flavor solutions were transitioned under our legacy taste business unit. We are also adding Frutarom's inclusions business, which comprises Taura, Inventive and Leagel, our ice cream ingredients business into legacy taste. The remaining parts of Frutarom will be grouped into a new nutrition and ingredients division. This high growth high, margin business will include Frutarom's natural product solutions, as well as the flavor ingredients business. At the business unit level, we are focused on prioritize our strategy to ensure we capture future growth potential.","Within scent we serve customers across a wide spectrum of scientists. However, the bulk of our market is composed of multinational companies who work via co-lists. We recently won a new co-list access, providing us with the opportunity to compete for 450 million of market potential we previously didn't have access to. This was a significant opportunity for growth. And as such, we are focused on capitalizing on our new access with maintaining strong improvements with regional and local customers.","Our go forward goal in scent is to drive value creations with disciplined portfolio management, investing in high margin businesses and fixing profitability in categories that have been disproportionately impacted by higher raw material cost. In addition, we've identified and executed on opportunities to streamline our organization within the scent business unit, which is already contributing approximately 4 million of savings through the first half of 2019.","In taste, the focus on effectively integrating the Frutarom businesses and our go to market approaches by expanding our case point model to ensure we serve and capture opportunities with faster growing small and mid-sized customers in other key markets around the world. We are also targeting higher growth geographies, for example, Africa and the Middle East and enhancing our portfolio by expanding savory solution and inclusions globally.","In nutrition and ingredients, it's all about geographic expansion, focusing on differentiating natural and clean label technologies and targeting value enhancing acquisitions. The majority of the categories within the division natural health ingredients, natural food protection and natural colors all have strong future growth potential. And we are focused on increasing our scale to disproportional growth at accelerated rates. ","At the core, we anticipate that based on encouraging natural growth to be approximately 3% to 5%. Then we believe that we have incremental opportunities to long-term to add an additional percentage point for cross selling and integrated solutions, as well as another percentage points for acquisitions. The net result is that we expect overall currency neutral sales growth to average 5% to 7% over the next three years.","Taking a step back, we now have the broadest and deepest portfolio of businesses in our long history, one that provides a variety of investment options. To maximize value creation, we have established portfolio roles and clear guidelines to prioritize our investment decisions. There are three approaches to managing our portfolio growth, where we will accelerate margin accretive categories through incremental investments, such as fine fragrance and cosmetic active ingredients. ","Balanced, while we'll self fund investments to maintain gross margin cash flow and fix. But we will have limited investments until margin goals achieve targeted levels or we de-prioritize. An example of this is creative marketing, while we have de-prioritized our approach given the margin profile or the businesses we exited earlier this year. As you can see, we have categories in all of these three portfolio certifications. These certifications will streamline our category management, and fine tune our strategic efforts to ensure we grow sales and also improve our margins.","We have strong programs in place to drive profitability. From 2019 to '21, we expect margin improvements to be driven by our portfolio optimization strategy and 145 million of integration savings from the Frutarom transaction. As discussed, portfolio optimization is expected to profit as margin, management, pricing, cost leverage and selective pooling of our low margin and non strategic sales will drive overall margin expansion.","Within our planned integration synergies from the Frutarom acquisitions, we are rationalizing and harmonizing our procurement activities via leverage spent and make versus volume. We are also optimizing the global footprint as we expect approximately 35 sites globally to be optimized, which will generate additional efficiencies. The last piece is streamlining our overhead expense, which is intended to reduce non-strategic costs and eliminating redundant expense expenses. We are highly confident in our ability to achieve on 145 million in cost savings target at the end of 2021.","In addition to our integration synergies, we expect approximately 100 million savings and additional productivity programs. Beyond margin expansion these industries are key in a journey to fundamentally transform how we operate, focusing on process improvements, simplifications and centralization. This will provide flexibility to drive bottom line is results and reinvest in our growth engines.","Our long-term financial objectives are clear. This includes total shareholder return on drivers of 5% to 7% currency neutral gross, margin expansion to be less than three times net debt to EBITDA in 18 to 24 months, 10% plus adjust EPS growth, excluding amortization and approximately 2% dividend yield. Our vision 2021 strategy is focused on discipline execution and integration. We remain steadfast in our approach and belief in the long-term value equation for all of our stakeholders.","Turning now to the second quarter, year-over-year results on a consolidated basis were strong, including the contribution of Frutarom. Reported sales increased 40% with the largest driver being the contribution of additional sales related to Frutarom. As communicated at our June Investor Day, currency neutral performance on a combined base was soft due to significant volume erosion with multinational customers within taste and a continued pressure within Frutarom driven by decline in F&F ingredients, notably citrus source, natural colors, pricing, parts of savory solutions and trade and marketing, While Rich will go into details in a moment, I feel it's important to highlight several strong performances within the quarter to ensure we do not lose sight of the progress we're making. ","In scent we delivered mid single digit sales growth with growth in all categories and doubled digit adjusted segment profit growth rose on a currency neutral basis. Within the rest of the business, several of the high growth categories continue to have solid performances led by beverage and savory and taste, natural food protection, gelato, the ice cream ingredients business and algae in Frutarom. In addition, the businesses we have acquired since the beginning of the year, Mighty, Leagel, and Wiberg Canada are all growing at or above our expectations. ","From a profitability perspective, we are also pleased that adjusted operating profit margin excluding amortization improved 80 bps, year-over-year driven by productivity initiatives and acquisitions related synergies, a market acceleration as opposed to our first quarter performance. I'm pleased to report that our integration efforts are well underway. We're making excellent progress. Those businesses where we have aligned our go to market approach with IFF growth was strong, increasing high single digits.","In terms of cross selling and integrated solutions, we have already achieved 8 million in run rate sales. Longer term, we believe that we can deliver at least 100 million of top line sales by 2021. We are leveraging the compelling combination of R&D technologies and capabilities of both organizations. As stated many times, innovation drives differentiation and is critical for long- term success. I'm pleased with the progress the team is making and as they strengthen our product offering to our customers.","Turning to cost synergies, we've made strong advancements year-to- date, as we have achieved approximately 15 million in the first half of 2019, based on our progress to date and our expectation in savings benefit to accelerate throughout the year. We're now forecasting that we will achieve approximately 40 million in cost savings in 2019 up from our previous estimate of 30 million to 35 million. In terms of debt repayment and cash flow, our operating cash flow was up 130 million in the first half of 2019 compared to the previous year period and we repaid 47 million in the first half of 2019. ","With that I would like to turn the call over to Rich.","Richard O'Leary ","Thank you, Andreas. In the second quarter we delivered quarterly sales of approximately 1.3 billion. On a combined basis currency neutral sales grew 1% driven by acquisitions and strong growth in scent. We also maintained strong profitability levels led by productivity initiatives, acquisition related synergies and favorable price versus input costs. ","This combined with the addition of Frutarom led to a very strong 29% increase over the prior year period and adjusted operating profit margin excluding amortization improved 80 basis points year-over-year.","Our financial results were in line with my comments at our Investor Day, when I said we would be between 1% to 3% depending upon how June progressed. And while we did not finish as strong as we had would have liked in terms of sales, we did a good job delivering overall profitability in line with our expectations.","From a cash flow projective perspective, we had significant year-over-year increases in operating cash flow and free cash flow driven primarily by higher earnings and amortization. As we've done previously I would like to highlight the impact of emerging market pricing on our growth rates to better compare with our peers.","As a reminder for a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in US dollars or other hard currencies for our index to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. When recording our currency neutral sales growth, we exclude foreign exchange related price changes in emerging markets. But this is different from our peers.","We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a true assessment of underlying currency neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the US dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition.","During the second quarter and first half of 2019, the stronger US dollar environment plus significant emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 2% currency impact of growth if we included emerging market pricing. This is essentially driven by large the evaluations in three countries, which represent less than 10% of our consolidated scent and taste sales.","Turning to business unit performance, in scent second quarter currency neutral sales grew 4% against a solid year ago comp a 5% with growth in nearly all regions and categories. Performance was strongest in fragrance ingredients and consumer fragrances, both increasing mid single digits. Consumer fragrances was led by high single digit growth in home care and fabric care. Fine fragrance also grew low single digits following a double digit performance in Q1, led by strong new wins, particularly in EAME. ","But should be noted that raw material driven pricing increases represented approximately 4% in the second quarter on a consolidated basis, with the strongest increases in fragrance ingredients. In fragrance compounds, the composition of growth was balanced, with equal contribution between volume and price. Same currency initial segment profit increased 19% benefiting from cost and productivity initiatives and more favorable price to input costs.","We believe that this was due to the timing of raw materials between the inventory and our P&L as we continue to see year-over-year increases in our purchases. Raw material costs remain elevated significantly above historical levels and we will continue to work with our customers on actions to mitigate these increases. In terms of segment profit margin, year-over-year performance was up approximately 200 basis points to 19.2%.","In taste, second quarter currency neutral sales decreased approximately 1% against the strong growth of 6% in the year ago period. Growth was strongest in Greater Asia with year-over-year improvements in China, India, and the ASEAN region. We also post the growth in EAME led by strong performance in Africa and Middle East. In Latin America and North America, volume origins with multinational customers were significant and intensified throughout the quarter. ","When comparing to historical averages, our volume erosion rate in the second quarter was approximately three times our historical average. Taste currency neutral segment profit was adversely impacted by volume declines, unfavorable price, the material costs and a week or mix. Nevertheless, segment profit margins will remain best in class amongst our industry peers. ","For Frutarom in the second quarter sales totaled approximately 382 million. On a standalone basis for Frutarom sales were flat, driven by the contribution of acquisitions. Excluding the contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses, Frutarom sales declined low single digits or 4%. Similar to what we communicate at our Investor Day, results were primarily driven by decline in F&F ingredients, most notably citrus source where one of our competitors are no longer purchasing from us, as well as well as raw material driven price decreases in natural colors and weaknesses in savory solutions related to weather conditions in Europe and Canada, and trade and marketing, where we are the de-prioritizing. ","While all of these are very similar to what we have discussed previously, it is worth noting that Frutarom's taste volumes decelerated throughout the second quarter driven by weakness in the UK and Ireland. In terms of segment profit, the Frutarom delivered $37 million and $77 million in profit excluding amortization. The margin profile for Frutarom in the second quarter continues to be strong at a robust 20.1% if you exclude amortization. This has been driven by acquisition related synergies and continued cross discipline.","For the first half of 2019, we have delivered 15 million in integration synergies. As Andreas mentioned earlier, we are now expecting to achieve approximately 40 million in cost synergies in 2019, up from our previous estimate of 30 million to 35 million driven predominantly by procurement optimization. In addition, we continue to deliver on our core productivity program, where we drive process improvement simplification and centralization. On a year-to- date basis, we've achieved approximately 25 million of core productivity savings in the first half of 2019. Together we delivered approximately $40 million in year-over-year savings are about 19% expressed in terms of operating profit growth on a combined basis.","Operating cash flow in the first half of 2019 was up significantly from 55 million last year to 185 million this year. Performance was driven by higher earnings and amortization. Core working capital, defined as inventories, accounts receivables and accounts payable, improved modestly driven by receivables and payables. Inventories continued to remain at elevated levels, primarily due to raw material cost increases and safety stocks within the scent division. Expected inventories will begin to improve in the second half for the year.","In the first half CapEx as a percentage of sales was approximately 4.6% driven by new plant and capacity investments, mainly in Greater Asia, as well as creative centers and integration related investments. For the full year we continue to believe that CapEx as a percentage of sales will be between 4.5% to 5%. Bringing all this together, we had a strong $78 million increase in free cash flow in the first half of 2019.","A key component or overall TSR algorithm for our shareholders is a competitive and attractive dividend yield. We believe that the 2% threshold is an important one that broadens our potential shareholder base. Together and today we are pleased to announce we have authorized 30% increase in our quarterly dividend executing on our long-term strategy and our strong financial position and should be noted that this marks the 10th consecutive year of dividend increases.","Considering our year-to-date performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are adjusting our full year sales and adjusted EPS excluding amortization guidance. For the full year we now expect to deliver between 5.15 billion and 5.25 billion in sales in 2019 as we're approaching the low end of our original guidance of 5.2 billion to 5.3 billion. On a combined basis and excluding the impact of currency, growth is expected to be 3% to 5%.","The forecast now reflects low versus mid single digit growth for Frutarom driven by three areas, F&F ingredients, savory solutions and trade and marketing. Within F&F ingredients, citrus source is the primary contributor of the decline as one of our large competitors has significantly reduced his purchases. We are shifting our focus of this business to mid versus high to drive value creation. In savory solutions, performance was impacted by first half weakness, as well as a modestly revised second half outlook related to reductions in volume. We also will de-prioritize trade and marketing based on our strategic category management approach.","From a taste perspective, continued multinational volume erosion in Latin America and North America has lowered our expectation. It should be noted that we do not expect the second half to be strong in the first half. But taste performance in the third quarter will be challenged by a strong prior year comp. We now expect adjusted EPS excluding amortization to be 615 to 635 and I will go through the changes in a moment. On a combined basis and excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS excluding amortization is expected to be 6% to 9%.","To provide additional detail related to the adjusted EPS ex amortization change, I would like to walk you through the drivers. Our original guidance was 630 to 650. In the second bar, I highlight the $0.10 impact related to the change in top line expectation, which is essentially $15 million in sales at low margins given the impacted businesses like trade and marketing, citrus source and PTI. Mitigating this is the incremental 5 million in integration savings that we announced earlier today. Combining the two, the net operational impact is a reduction of approximately $0.05 to our adjusted EPS excluding amortization.","The larger impact on adjusted EPS excluding amortization is related to a change in the average effective tax rate on the amortization of intangible assets, as well as the small changes in redeemable non-controlling interest. The net impact of these combined is approximately $0.10. In the end, our revised guidance for adjusted EPS excluding amortization is now 615 to 635. ","With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig ","Thank you, Rich. In summary, we believe we have the framework to achieve our long-term ambitions with our 2021 strategy, which is focused on disciplined execution and integration. With that context, we have a long-term commitment to 12% total shareholder return which is expected to be driven by about 10% EPS growth and a 2% dividend yield. In the second quarter we achieved broad based improvement in sales, margin and cash flow. For the full year we believe we can deliver solid operational results. We're taking actions of strengthen to the overall growth profile of our business, as well as ensuring we capture synergies to generate strong margins and returns for our shareholders. Expressing our confidence in our long-term strategy and future prospects, we also raised our dividend, the 10th yearly consecutive increase. ","With that operator, we are now happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Mark Astrachan ","Thanks and good morning everybody. ","Andreas Fibig ","Good morning, Mark. ","Mark Astrachan ","I guess it's done on Frutarom not really sure where to begin, but maybe starting, how confident are you, there won't be further discoveries at Frutarom related to the alleged bribery negatively impacting sales in other geographies or any sort of things that you can find from an accounting standpoint or anything else. And do you know of or anticipate any US authority to investigate the goings on there at this point?","Andreas Fibig ","Mark, thank you for the question, I'll take it. And given that we have done compliance disclosure here. I'll take a moment to reiterate what we have said in our former disclosure. During the integration of Frutarom, we were made aware of allegations that two Frutarom businesses operating principally in Russia and Ukraine made certain improper payments, including two representatives of a number of customers. So we promptly commenced investigations. We have a very robust program in place here in particular when we take over companies. So that's very clear and it's clear SOP on our side, we have notified relevant US regulatory authorities and relevant Israeli regulatory authorities. So I think that's good and done. We have not uncovered any evidence suggesting that payments had any connections to the US. Based to the information we have, we believe that these improper payments are no longer being made. The estimated affected sales represents less than 1% of combined pro-forma net sales for 2018. ","So we do not believe the impact from these methods is or will be material to our results of operations or financial conditions. I believe that's a super important point as well. We've taken or we'll take appropriate remedial actions with respect to the matters I have described. And I want to assure you that we have committed to the highest standards of ethics and compliance and have strict compliance policies in place. Although, investigation are continuing, based on the results to date and other compliance related integration activities. We are not currently where similar instances of this conduct in any other geographies. So I would say all in all, we stick to what we have said in our disclosure, we feel very comfortable that we have a good handle on it. And I'm actually very proud about the program we are running here and how all the teams are working together to get these things done in the appropriate manner.","Mark Astrachan ","Okay, staying with Frutarom, I guess your organic sales decline was much worse than was expected, I think including your own expectations. So what gives confidence that can get back to growth in the second half of the year apps and easier comparisons and what is a reasonable long-term growth rate for the business going forward? And I just wanted to follow up on the first question, just so how confident are you that there's not going to be another stone unturned that that finds something else that you're not anticipating at this point? I mean, how thorough has the investigation been by the board and the committees? ","Andreas Fibig ","Yeah, sure. I think Mark that's a fair question. Principally, despite that investigation, nothing has changed since our Investor Day because we feel very good about our strategy. We see also that the portfolio of the acquisition is helping us in terms of getting exposure to some of the higher growth areas like the health ingredients or natural food protection, which is even shown in the second quarter or the inclusion business as well. So portfolio wise, we are very happy. What we do certainly is that we prioritize our portfolio as we said, we are trying to maximize returns and we are de-emphasizing the marketing and trade business for example, because there's not a lot of profitability in and that obviously shows. We are very, let's say clear and happy about the customer portfolio. We haven't lost too many customers here and I think still, we believe that some of the small and midsized customers have good growth rates and that will help us with the business. The portfolio is proving to towards naturals and that's a trend which is not changing through that event. ","Talking about the integration, I believe what is important to see here is that in general, despite the compliance topic we just talked about, we are very happy with what is happening during the integration because you see it on the cost synergies, everything in terms of integration whether it's North America, Latin America, Asia or Europe is working as planned. We see that we get more cost synergies and Rich just mentioned that in his presentation, all of them we saw then that's predominantly driven by procurement, which is good news because first of all, it has no impact on our employees and no impact on our customers as well. So that's an important one. On the sales side, certainly, the second quarter was softer than I would like to have it. But we will see that this will turn around in the second half as we've said during the Investor Day as well. And we believe a mid single digit growth rate for the business is very doable. In particular, if we emphasize the strong parts and the high growth parts of portfolio. ","Having said this, we have now a real good team in place for the cross selling synergies. You will hear more about this over the next couple of calls. We haven't seen too much of a result, it's Rich just mentioned the 8 million, but there's certainly more to come and actually very exciting opportunities for us to cross sell the portfolios to the different customer groups on both sides of the business. Having said this, I would like to mention as well that we have seen now a nice turnaround on the scent business side that has not too much to do with Frutarom, just a smaller part of it. But we see that we're turning around despite the crisis we had with raw materials in the last year, Nicholas's business is going in the right direction, growth wise as well. So we're very optimistic on this front as well. And you know that was a bit of a trigger in the last year as well. And the turnaround is pretty strong year. So that's how I would guess like characterize where we stand in terms of the Frutarom business, but making a remark on the total portfolio as well.","Richard O'Leary","Andreas, may be just \u2013 Mark a couple of quick comments on my part. I mean, I reiterate what Andreas said, I think we feel strongly in the ability of the Frutarom business to grow mid single digits, mid to long term, I think we're still going to some of the challenges that we've seen for the last three quarters like citrus source and trade and marketing and the savory business are not going to correct overnight. I think we would expect to see low single digit growth for Frutarom ex M&A in the second half of this year. But we're not going to get \u2013 I think it doesn't change our long-term perspectives, in terms of the potential of the business. ","Andreas Fibig ","What we see and I might add this, but it's more mid to long-term markets, on the R&D technologies, we have very optimistic what that can deliver for us going forward, but that takes bit of more time to realize.","Mark Astrachan ","Okay.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Mike Sison ","Hey guys. I guess the two \u2013 ","Andreas Fibig ","Mike, good morning.","Mike Sison ","Good morning, two quick ones, I think in the \u2013 your compliance commentary mentioned that there were some senior management that Frutarom involved are they still around? How have you sort of changed that dynamic culturally and then as a quick follow up, what are you looking for, for Frutarom in the second half of the year in terms of either constant currency growth, it was down 4% you mentioned in 2Q and maybe just kind of thoughts on profitability. I think you said operating margins ex amortization was still pretty healthy, do you expect it to stay at that levels in the second half of the year? Thank you.","Andreas Fibig ","Okay. Let me let me take the compliance piece first. We have taken very remedial actions on the involved people. The good thing is it is very contained to geographically, so that that makes it makes it easier for us to act on that. Culturally, we have started with actually day one and all of our town hall meetings in the new company, as we usually do when we take over companies that we educate people on the compliance codes, on the code of conduct. Everybody is going through the sort of training whether it's a live training or training via their computers. So we feel good about this. And this is coming actually nicely together. This is an unfortunate event, but as I said, it's geographically very limited. And then I hand over to Rich on the margin question. ","Richard O'Leary","Yeah, so my two things, one on your question on the second half, I just want to clarify the answer I gave the Mark. Frutarom, second half of the year, I think it's low single digits on a two year average basis. Given the week Q3 last year for Frutarom, it will be a stronger Q3 versus Q4. In terms of in terms of margins, I think we had a very strong quarter, Q2 despite the challenges from the top-line standpoint. You heard the comments I made regarding the very strong quarter and margin performance for scent. I think some of that, as I said in my comments were timing and so I don't expect that. I think this Q3 and Q4 will be a bit more pressure on the scent side in terms of margins with input costs remaining elevated, the teams have done a very good job in terms of mitigating that, in fact, they did the price realization, but there is timing in terms of inventory when the raw materials flow through the P&L. And then when you get to Q4 obviously, there's a bit of seasonality where our margin profiles in Q4 are generally the weakest of the full year. So I would expect the second half to be modestly below where we were in the first half of this year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. ","Andreas Fibig ","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson","So first just on the compliance question, can you detail how long were the alleged payments actually happening? And specifically, you've cited in the last couple quarters of some sales declines in the savory business and through in Eastern Europe. Is there any nexus or common customer overlap between those, just want to be clear on that point? And then secondly, on the taste business, maybe just a little bit more color on the volume declines that you're seeing in the Americas in the second quarter and the first half of the year, they seem to be a bit darker than what we would see from the food and beverage companies. So just a little bit more color, perhaps by category or kind of where you're seeing the greatest pressure is? Thank you.","Richard O'Leary","So let me start with the last one in terms of the volume side of it. As I've said in the comments, and I think Andreas said also, I mean, what we're seeing on the taste side is significant volume erosion on the existing business. Again, if you look at our fundamentals, we don't believe we're losing share, when you look it up on the pricing, adjusted volume growth or total top line growth in on a two year basis for the first half of the year, we're very much in line with competition, so we have confidence that we're not losing share. We are seeing significant volume erosion on existing business. Our win rates remain good for both businesses, pretty much at five year averages, so we're not seeing any erosion in the business. We've talked about in the past that we see significant upside going forward on the scent business in terms of access to new business. ","So we believe is very much a volume erosion piece where Q2 was much worse than what we saw in Q1. It's one of those things that I've seen. These trends occur over time and it's hard to predict when those things sort of return to the norm. And it can vary from their underlying product mix and the categories where we operate with a particular customer, their supply chain, so it's hard to predict, but I don't see this as being a long-term trend. As I said in my comments related to the Frutarom piece, it was primarily an issue in Europe. Again, it was quite strong with mid to low single digit growth in the EAME taste business for Frutarom through the end of May and then it was a very disappointing and challenging June which drove the declines that was a bit unexpected from where we felt we were going to be. From a compliance standpoint, based on what we've seen through the investigation, they may have been occurring for a few years. But we there's never been indication that there are material amount in any particular year.","Andreas Fibig ","Maybe I add to the first point Rich made, if I look at our taste business, we had, in particular in '18, very, very strong growth in the first and the second quarter, 6% each. So it's strong comparables. And we can say that in the third quarter, we have had to slightly better start into the third quarter, for the taste and for the Frutarom. I think that's important. ","Richard O'Leary","And yeah, last question, which I forgot Adam was, in terms of customer overlap it's pretty negligible customer overlap, particularly in this business.","Operator","Our next question will come from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. ","Heidi Vesterinen","Hi, good afternoon. So if we step back and think about your performance over the past year, we've seen that you've tended to underperform on your top-line targets and once again this year despite help from a 53rd [indiscernible] and strong pricing in response to exceptional inflation, you're still below targets in terms of organic growth. So can you help us understand what you're doing internally both on the legacy IFF side and the Frutarom side to get back on track? You think maybe some more radical changes might be needed, may it be in terms of investment or personnel or so on to ensure that you can get back to your long-term targets? Thank you.","Andreas Fibig ","So Heidi, that's a good \u2013 it's a good point, because I would say all the other parameters and KPIs are going actually pretty well. And we focus a lot on the top-line growth and for me or actually for us as a management team, the recipe is very, very clear. What we need is we have to focus our activities on the most driving parts of the portfolio where we have now a much better portfolio than we had before. So we have a couple of let's say areas, which might be small at the moment, but still from the market perspective, really nice growth for us, like the inclusions, like the health ingredients or natural foods or even the active cosmetic. So we believe that's the first one. The second thing is, where we have to look in is, our customer structure. And here we have to drive through and particularly on the taste side, with some of the smaller and midsized customers. Here certainly the acquisition helps a lot. We take the blueprint we have from our Tastepoint. We will drive it through. We have now integrated the Frutarom taste business into Tastepoint already in the US. ","And actually in that regard, if I can give the detail, we have a double digit growth on this side. It's a very nice growth of the business, so we like that a lot. The next thing is on the scent side, because I don't want to shortchange us too much, but we have no access to more our co-lists, our most important customers. And I know that there are a lot of activities are ongoing. And you know, these are all big customers it takes let's say nine to 12 to 15 months to really capitalize on it. But we see strong interest, we see strong first let's say wins on our side. And that will help us to let's say accelerate the top-line side on the scent business as well. On top of it and that's what's in the works and we will report on this is the cross selling aspect. We have now moved the leader of our bigger key accounts from the taste business into the role of being the head of cross selling and total solutions business. He is building a small, but very, let's say powerful and nimble organization to facilitate the cross selling between the two organizations. And we believe that can deliver very nicely on our top-line growth. So if I add this all together, I think we can come back to the good growth rate we have outlined the 5% to 7%. We believe it's very, very doable. And the first, let's say \u2013 initial, let's say, signs we see are going in the right direction.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. ","John Roberts","Hi, guys. I just wanted to put some numbers to what's going on in the taste with the 3x erosion, so is it like, normally you see 10% to 15% of product discontinued in any given year by taste customers. And normally they replace that, but now you're seeing something like 30% to 45% kind of discontinued older products and even though you're having the new wins, they're not launching the new products at an offsetting rate here, is that the dynamic that we're talking about?","Richard O'Leary","John, put it in perspective, I mean, on a five year trend volume on existing businesses slightly negative, so call it low single digits and is down 1%. For the last \u2013 and now at the current rates particularly in Q2, we're in a mid single digit range. So that's by far the single biggest driver. I mean, as I said earlier, our win rates are in line with long-term five year trends. Pricing is slightly positive a little bit below the five year average, but part of that's been driven by what we've seen over the last three years with vanilla. So I would not say it \u2013 fundamentally, it's all the volume erosion on existing business. Some of it may be driven by shorter cycle times, but that's the fundamental driver in terms of the biggest change in the last two quarters.","Operator","Our next question will come from Alexandra Thrum with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Alexandra Thrum ","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on margins, in both the scent and taste division you've sort of explained what's happening in the top-line dynamics, but when I look at taste, could you break up how much that margin decline is driven by volume versus \u2013 also the pricing versus growth. And then on the flip side is margin development has expanded quite decently. I expect because the managed the pricing in scent, but could you please break down that margin expansion both between pricing versus growth and volume?","Richard O'Leary","Sure, Alexandra. I mean, in terms of taste, I mean, the pricing impact was pretty negligible. And the biggest driver for taste is on the input costs in terms of it's more of a mix issue. I mean, I think our overall view in terms of mix of consumption as opposed to mix a product, I think that's a smaller impact from a mix standpoint. But as similar to what we've seen on the taste side as we consume individual lots or product by product, we can have some fluctuation there. So the biggest driver into the margin pressures in taste is, one, the input costs and two, is the lower volumes hurting us from an absorption standpoint. From a taste standpoint, you heard in the comments that pricing is a bigger driver from a taste standpoint, certainly on the scent standpoint, certainly on the ingredient side, but also in the compounds. ","As I said earlier in my comments and teams have done a very good job of aggressively pursuing price realization to offset that. And I said earlier, we had \u2013 why we call it a unique situation in Q2, where we had mix of consumption of raw materials, which drove a favorable margin progression in Q2, which I don't expect to repeat in the second half of the this year for scent. So that's why I said earlier, I would expect margin profiles in scent to come down from where they were in Q2, given the mix of raw materials. We still are seeing elevated prices from scent. They're at near all time highs. I think we've seen that the rate of increase has slowed. So I think that's starting to be a positive trend, but we don't expect to see any relief in the near term from a input cost standpoint.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks. Thanks very much. Can you talk about the change in global expenses from the first quarter to the second? I think you went from about 19 million to 13 million. And then to go back to 13 million sequential decrease in cost of goods sold. I would think maybe 3 million is from volume and maybe there's 2 million or 3 million from Frutarom. But I take it there are some hedging gains in there. And can you describe what went on from a raw material standpoint a little bit more precisely, if you don't mind?","Richard O'Leary","Sure, Jeff. So from a corporate expensive standpoint, the single biggest driver is the cash flow hedging as you said, it's about a $5 million impact. And so that's the biggest driver as you said, it also impacts COGS. I think, clearly the volume impact is further reasoned in terms of $15 million impact. I think the other thing that keep in mind, as I said earlier, we did have I'm going to call it a mix impact in terms of scent, in terms of the raw material consumption, as it flowed through from finished goods and raw materials into COGS. So there's a timing impact there. I think those are the biggest drivers. In terms of the sequential performance, from an overall perspective we still expect to see mid single digit inflation from a raw material standpoint for the full year. But that's in line with what we've seen our expectations from the beginning of the year. And as I said just a moment ago, I think starting to see some slow down in terms of the rate of the increase, but we're still at very elevated levels.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brett Hundley with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Brett Hundley ","Hey, thank you. Good morning, guys. Rich, I just have one detailish type question for you. So if I go to the change in EPS guide for the year. I wanted to focus in on the change in non-controlling interest piece and just ask you whether is that related to like the carrying value of those fruit subs dropping below the redemption value? Is it due to a changeover to consolidated status away from non-consolidated status because I will admit your other income line in Q2 was less of a benefit than I thought it would be relative to Q1. So sorry for the detailish type question, but just wanted to understand that better. ","Richard O'Leary","No, look, I mean, I think \u2013 so you added that $0.10 \u2013 I'd say probably $0.06 to $0.07 of that is the change in the average effective tax rate on the amortization, so that one's clear. On the non-controlling interest, it's really a mark-to-market adjustment that we have to monitor and adjust each quarter based on the results and the outlook for the individual entities in which the minority interest had \u2013 there is a redeemable component of the minority interest. So it's based on the underlying performance and the projection is for those businesses and so there's been a slight change between where we were at the beginning of the year and based on latest projections.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. So I'll turn it back to Andreas for closing remarks. ","Andreas Fibig ","Yeah, thank you very much for participating. I think it was an important call with a couple of really important messages we wanted to make and we are now basically happy to take all the one on ones we want to do and give you more explanation around some of outcome of the businesses.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Shelley Young, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Shelley Young","Thank you, operator. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to IFF's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our first quarter 2013 financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our website at iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live at and will be available for replay for up to 1 year on our website.","Before turning the call over to our senior management team, I'd like to read our forward-looking statement. Please keep in mind that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the first quarter and our outlook for 2013. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our forward-looking statements and risk factors contained in our 2012 10-K filed on February 25, 2013, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today and on our website.","I'd like to introduce the participants on today's call. With me on the call is Doug Tough, our Chairman and CEO; Nicolas Mirzayantz, our Group President of Fragrances; Hernan Vaisman, our Group President of Flavors; and Kevin Berryman, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Tough.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Shelley, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Our focus on the call this morning is to provide an overview of our first quarter results and operating performance and provide you with a more in-depth review of our Fragrance and Flavors business segments. We will also provide our current outlook for 2013 and after our prepared remarks, we will leave time for questions.","Turning to our first quarter results. We delivered solid local currency sales growth of 3%. On a like-for-like basis, which excludes the exit of low-margin sales activities in Flavors, we delivered local currency sales growth of 4%, which reflects underlying momentum in both our Fragrance Compounds and Flavors Compounds businesses, supported by strong new wins based on innovations and growth across diverse categories and geographies. Our top line performance continues to be driven by 9% growth in the emerging markets, which now account for nearly half of our sales. This is due to strong growth in many countries, including Brazil, Russia, China and Turkey.","Turning to the business segments. Flavors delivered modest growth of 2%. But on a like-for-like basis, which is a more consistent measure of growth, Flavors delivered growth of 6%. The 6% growth overlaps 6% like-for-like growth in the first quarter of 2012 and is consistent with historical growth rates in this business, once again showing the strength and stability of the business. Our Fragrances business delivered growth of 3% in total. Fragrance Compounds, which excludes Fragrance Ingredients, achieved growth of 7%. Our Fragrance Compounds business, which consists of Fine and Beauty Care and functional fragrances, was supported by strong new wins including products using our encapsulation technology as well as increased [indiscernible] participation.","Turning to our margins. This quarter, our adjusted margins improved 270 basis points over the prior year to 42.9%. The overall improvement reflects the combined benefit of pricing and declining raw material costs, volume growth, the benefits of our hedging programs as well as other cost improvement initiatives. Kevin Berryman, our CFO, will address our margin progression in more detail later in the presentation.","Our margin gains this quarter were also due to exit of low-margin sales activities in Flavors business, which has had an overall 30 basis point favorable impact on our margins. The solid top line performance and margin expansion more than offset increased RSA costs this quarter and resulted in 13% growth in our adjusted operating profit. And adjusted earnings per share, which includes a lower effective tax rate, increased 19% to $1.19.","As we have done in the past, this quarter, we continued to optimize our manufacturing footprint by making the decision to close both our Flavors plant in Sweden and our Fragrances plant in Jakarta, Indonesia and transferring the production from these facilities to our larger facility in The Netherlands and our new facility in Singapore, respectively. The company looks to operate as efficiently as possible to remain competitive, and these actions were taken with this objective in mind.  Lastly, we also announced our intention to close our Fragrance Ingredients plant in Augusta, Georgia and consolidate the production into existing facilities. We provided a strategic review of our Ingredients business to our Board and are now executing on our plan to improve the profitability and the competitiveness of our Fragrance Ingredients business, thereby strengthening our competitive cost position in the Fragrance business.","We are also taking steps to strengthen our innovation platform. During the quarter, we issued a press release on the successful outcome with an outside partner, Evolva Holding, in the production and scale-up of a natural sustainable vanillin through a biosynthetic process. We are very pleased with our partnership and believe the program with Evolva will increase the availability and sustainability of vanillin, which is a key flavor ingredient in many food products.","Last week, we entered into a multiyear collaboration with Amyris, a leading biotechnology company, to develop and commercialize renewable cost-effective fragrance ingredients. We continue to work with R&D and creative teams to commercialize products that will provide us with a competitive edge in the market. These 2 biotechnology programs are complementary, and we believe collaborations such as this are critical to driving our future growth and profitability. Our earnings per share growth this quarter enables us to continue making investments that will secure our future. I would now like to turn the call over to Nicolas Mirzayantz, our Group President of Fragrances.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Thank you, Doug, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone.","Turning to our top line results. Our overall Fragrance business delivered 3% local currency sales growth, which reflects 7% growth in Fragrance Compounds partially offset by an 11% decline in ingredients. Our growth was supported by strong new wins plus the benefit of increased core list participation, though this quarter was also supported by strong growth in the emerging markets. The emerging markets accounted for 54% of our Fragrance Compounds sales. Within Fragrance Compounds, the emerging markets grew by 18%. In Compounds, we achieved very strong growth in many areas of the world, including Brazil, the Middle East, Mexico, Turkey and Indonesia, among others. Brazil continues to be one of our leading markets and has strong double-digit growth again this quarter. We had a solid first quarter and we are seeing strong momentum on many fronts.","Our Fine and Beauty Care category, which includes fine fragrances, toiletries and hair care, grew by 4% this quarter, driven by double-digit growth in Latin America of 25% and Greater Asia of 11%, which more than offset volume softness in North America and EAME. To put this quarter's growth into perspective, this quarter followed exceptional growth in the first quarter of 2012. As you may recall, in the fourth quarter of 2012, Fine and Beauty Care delivered growth of 19%, driven by a -- by 17% growth in North America. We believe that part of the softness in North America in the first quarter is related to the Christmas holiday, which appears to have impacted first quarter demand in the industry. Still, there are many new launches in 2013, including recent launches with Balenciaga and new launches such as L\u2019eau de [indiscernible] and Katy Perry Killer Queen, which had its first launch last week, which we believe will help improve sales momentum going forward.","Functional Fragrances, which includes fabric care, home care and personal wash, achieved local currency sales growth of 9% this quarter on top of 12% growth in the fourth quarter with positive growth in every region, led by double-digit growth of 13% in both Latin America and Greater Asia and strong growth in EAME. This marks our 19th consecutive quarter growth in functional fragrances, led by double-digit growth in fabric care and high-single-digit growth in personal wash. This strong growth reflects new wins, our increased core list participation and increased use of products using our encapsulation technology.","Turning to Fragrance Ingredients. We saw continued top line pressure in our external portfolio, primarily from AD [ph] products. And overall Fragrance Ingredients sales declined 11%. As you know, we have developed a strategy to improve our overall profitability and competitiveness in our external foreign [indiscernible] business and have been continuing to finalize our execution plan. As Doug mentioned, last week, we announced our intention to close our Augusta, Georgia facility, consolidate production into existing Fragrances Ingredients facility. This is in line with our plan to improve manufacturing efficiencies and increase the competitiveness of this business, and Kevin will speak about the financial impact related to the Augusta closure.","I want to underscore the strategic importance of our Ingredient business. Our Ingredient business provides innovative and cost-effective ingredients to our perfumers  for their use in creating winning solutions, winning fragrances for our customers, thereby providing a significant strategic benefit to our overall Fragrance business. We do not take decisions such as this lightly, as you know. But moving production to existing locations and further consolidating our manufacturing footprint will create synergies and improve operating efficiencies. Our decision is based on an ongoing business review and is one of several actions we will be taking to improve the competitiveness of our Fragrance Ingredients business.","Turning to profitability. Our segment operating profit increased $12 million or 22% to $68 million in the first quarter. Modest decreases in raw material costs combined with residual pricing, volume and mix improvements as well as other costs and margin improvement initiatives more than offset increased RSA, resulting in a 280 basis-point segment margin improvement this quarter to 18.4% versus 15.5% in the prior year quarter. Although our margin this quarter benefited from modest input cost reduction, input costs remains at very high levels, and the margin improvement that we are seeing over the past 2 years is driven less by pricing and more by our strategic initiatives. Kevin will discuss this further later on in our presentation.","In accordance with our strategic priorities, we have implemented many programs to improve the profitability of our portfolio and optimize our geographic footprint. During the quarter, we made a decision to close our fragrance facility in Jakarta, Indonesia, and transfer production to our new facility in Singapore, which is a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant. We also took action to strengthen our innovations platforms by announcing our multiyear collaboration with Amyris to develop and commercialize sustainable cost-effective Fragrance Ingredients. We are excited to strengthen our biotechnology platform and continue exploring additional opportunities that biotechnology offers.","Looking ahead, in the second quarter of 2013, we expect we will benefit from new wins in Fine products [ph] and Beauty Care and Functional Fragrance, and we see continued sustained performance in our Fragrance Compounds category. We also expect to see some improvement in our Ingredient sales performance.","I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague, Hernan Vaisman, our Group President of Flavors.","Hernan Vaisman","Thank you, Nicolas. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to our top line performance. In the first quarter, Flavors delivered local currency sales growth of 2%. Excluding the exit of low-margin sales activities, which includes sales in both savory and sweet, Flavors like-for-like growth would have been 6%. The 6% growth is consistent with our historical growth rate, and reflects strong new wins from our motivation tools. The first quarter also marked our 29th consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth and was supported by mid-single-digit like-for-like growth in every region.","This quarter, we exited over 10 million on sales activities affecting both savory and sweet end-use categories. We expect to exit the same level of business in the second quarter of 2013 and after that, we are largely finished within this program. As a percentage of sales, we would expect the impact in the second quarter of exited sales to be approximately 3 percentage points. This quarter growth was supported by strong new wins, particularly those using some of our health and wellness motivation technologies, and we ended the quarter with a strong pipeline of new wins. Flavors and dairy are benefiting from these technologies, all contained in our FLAVORFIT brand  umbrella, and much of our growth in these categories is being reinvigorated by our health and wellness programs.","We also saw some momentum in our citrus toolbox offerings. Citrus is one of our biggest Flavors profiles in this Beverage category. In North America, like-for-like growth was 4% excluding the exit of low-margin sales activities. This best-performing category was Beverage, which was up strong single digits on local currency basis on account of strong new wins in the citrus area as well as increased volume of products using our citrus modulation tools.","Within our EAME region, local currency growth was led by strong results in Western Europe, specifically Spain, Portugal and the U.K. with new business using natural flavoring as well as increased customers\u2019 orders in Beverage and Savory. Greater Asia, which is our largest region, achieved 6% in local currency growth due to strength in Australasia, China and India. We saw strong growth in both Dairy and Savory. In Latin America, we saw strong growth in Beverage and Dairy. We recently won new business in the region, and we have a lot of new projects in the pipeline. We expect to have a stronger growth in Latin America in the quarters to come, and we're pleased that we are picking up momentum in this business.","Turning to our profitability this quarter. This quarter, our segment profit improved 4% or $3 million to $83 million. The exit of low-margin sales activity contributed 60 basis points to our gross margin improvement. This quarter, we benefited from the favorable relationship between raw material costs and pricing, although our input prices remain at historically high levels. Kevin will talk more about it. The gross margin improvement more than offset increased RSA costs associated with R&D. For this first quarter, our segment operating margin improved 50 basis points to 23.3% versus the prior year of 22.8%.","As we mentioned on our fourth quarter conference call, this quarter, we announced that we have entered in a preproduction phase to develop and scale up via a third-party [indiscernible] for commercial application through a cost-effective sustainable route. This collaboration with Evolva [ph] and is consistent with our strategy to strengthen our innovation platform.","Also this quarter, we took several actions to consolidate our manufacturing footprint, improve efficiency and better meet our customers' changing needs. We made the decision to close our Fragrances plant in Sweden and transfer production to our plant in the Netherlands. We also announced the formal opening of our Flavors plant in Guangzhou, China, and we continue to build out our plant in Gebze, Turkey. We also continue to invest in commercial offices and satellite labs in Asia to better serve our customers in the region, with locations in Chengdu and Beijing now fully operational.","For the second quarter, we expect to see improved top line growth, although our overall growth will still be impacted by the exit of low-margin sales activities for one final quarter. On a like-for-like basis, we expect to achieve mid- to high-single-digit growth fueled by broad-based geographic growth. Although it is still early in the second quarter, based on our orders in-house, we believe we are off to a very strong start. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman, our CFO.","Kevin C. Berryman","Thank you, Hernan, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone.","Turning to our summary quarterly results. Reported revenues for the first quarter totaled $728 million compared with $711 million in the prior year quarter or an increase of 2%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, our local currency sales increased 3%. And on a like-for-like basis, which excludes the impact of the exit of low-margin sales activities in Flavors, our local currency sales growth was 4%.","Our growth was again fueled by our geographic footprint in the emerging markets. Importantly, we continue to see momentum behind our Fine and Beauty Care, Functional and Flavors businesses. We collectively refer to this business as our Compounds business, which represents our total business excluding the internal sales of our Fragrance Ingredients.","The growth momentum in the first quarter for the compound portion of our business remains quite healthy, even with some softness in Fine Fragrances. As Nicolas mentioned, we believe the short-term softness is due to the impact of the very strong fourth quarter sales we realized just last year. And as Nicolas previously noted on the call, Fine and Beauty Care growth in Q4 was 19% and was driven by strong growth in Fine Fragrances. Importantly, our consolidated compound like-for-like growth levels over the last 12 months have consistently remained at 6% or better and represented an annual growth over the last 12 months of 8%. We believe that this is an indication of our traction against our strategic initiatives of focusing on our advantaged positions, driving innovation into our portfolio and providing winning, value-added solutions to our customers.","Adjusted gross margins this quarter improved 270 basis points to 42.9%, up from 40.2% in the prior year quarter. The improved performance was due to the impact of moderating input costs and the benefits of residual pricing, as well as an improved sales mix including the benefits of exiting lower-margin sales activities in Flavors, continued cost improvement initiatives and gains associated with our foreign currency hedging program. I will provide more detail on our trends in gross margins in a moment.","These gross margin improvements more than offset increases in RSA due to higher compensation expenses, pensions and training costs and resulted in an adjusted operating profit improvement of 13% or plus $16 million to $139 million for the quarter. The adjusted operating profit improvement, combined with a lower effective tax rate due to the reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credits in 2013, resulted in adjusted EPS growth of 19% to $1.19 this quarter.","Importantly to reiterate what Doug, Nicolas and Hernan have already noted, we recently took several proactive steps to ensure we maintain a cost-effective structure as part of our continuing efforts to drive efficiencies in all that we do. We will be initiating the closure of 3 facilities over the course of the next year, our Fragrance plant in Sweden, our Fragrances plant in Indonesia and our Fragrance Ingredients plant in Augusta, Georgia. In Q1, we recognized restructuring costs for Sweden and Indonesia, which totaled $1.2 million. Our closure of the Augusta plant is the most material and represents our commitment to ensuring our Fragrance Ingredients operations remain competitive longer term. Our Fragrances Ingredients plant closure will be a second quarter accounting event.","To summarize the impact of this initiative, we expect to incur onetime costs of $6 million to $9 million, including personnel-related costs and plant shutdown and other related costs. We also expect to take a charge of $10 million to $12 million related to accelerated depreciation of 6 assets associated with the facilities.  As for the phasing of the cost of savings, approximately $3 million to $4 million of these costs will be recorded in the second quarter, with the remainder expected to be recognized over the following 4 quarters. Once fully implemented by mid-2014, the plant closure is expected to generate savings of approximately $6 million to $8 million per year.","Turning to our gross margins. With gross margin growing 270 basis points to 42.9% as noted earlier, this quarter, we again achieved improvements from the year-ago figure. We are pleased with our success in driving this margin improvement, but it certainly is important to understand what continues to be the fundamental driver in the improvement of this critical metric. As you know, our industry has seen substantial input cost increases over the last 2-plus years, resulting in input cost increases to IFF of approximately 14% in our raw materials, with an increase that was even more pronounced in Fragrances. The increased costs have had a significant impact on our gross margins in Q1 2013 versus pre-inflation levels. We estimate the negative impact on our margins from these cost increases to be roughly 400 basis points versus the pre-inflation level.","As you also know, we have, as a necessity, been very active in implementing price increases over the 2011 and 2012 years to help offset the impact of these input cost increases. Importantly, the company has been able to effectively recover the absolute dollar costs through price increases, allowing us to recover nearly 250 basis points of that input cost pressure. While pricing was enough to recover the absolute increase in input costs, it was not enough to cover the full impact of input cost increases on gross margins. The net effect is that our gross margin still remains pressured by 170 basis points in the current quarter versus the pre-inflation period prior to the run-up in raw material costs. This drag on our margin is shown by the red bar on the chart.","As a result, the improvement that we are now seeing in gross margins is less about the net impact of pricing and input costs and more about our strategic initiatives. The improvement is effectively being driven by our strategic plans and the disciplined execution of same. Our strategy to accelerate our innovation, drive efficiencies in all that we do in 6 underperforming assets while focusing on our advantage positions has translated into strong improvement in our gross margins. In fact, these efforts have resulted in 330 basis points of improvement as can be seen on the green bar on the chart. Importantly, these actions have more than offset the net 170 basis-point pressure from input costs and pricing and have resulted in the company realizing an overall increase of 160 basis points over the last 3 years since before the input costs inflation began. You can see why we are pleased regarding the execution of our strategy, as our margin progression ensures that we will be able to continue to make investments in R&D and other business-building initiatives, all to drive our growth plans into the future.","Turning to RSA cost. This quarter, RSA expense as a percentage of sales increased 100 basis points to 23.9%, up from 22.9% of sales in the prior year quarter. The higher RSA reflects higher compensation expense, incentive compensation accruals, pension cost, increases related to our deferred compensation plan program and training. In addition, spending on key R&D initiatives showed double-digit growth this quarter, consistent with our strategy investing in those opportunities, which we believe can deliver the greatest incremental value to IFF. IFF's R&D spending remains an important focus area for the company.","Turning to foreign currency impacts. Foreign currency translation this quarter had a limited impact on our reported sales growth. However, as a result of our hedging activities, foreign currency had a 40-basis point favorable impact on our gross margin, thereby contributing to our $0.19 EPS improvement. Again, to remind you, in 2013, we remain nearly 80% hedged against the euro at levels that approximate $1.29, effectively consistent with the average exchange rate levels for the full year 2012.","Turning to our cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for the 3 months ended March 31, 2013, was $19 million, or $34 million lower than the prior year quarter. The decrease this quarter primarily reflects higher year-over-year incentive compensation payments, as last year's incentive payments in Q1 2012 were abnormally low. In addition, we also made additional pension contributions in the U.S. These incremental outlays were offset in part by an improvement in the cash flow versus last year in core working capital of $7 million and increased net income due to our improved operating performance in the first quarter 2013 versus the year ago period. As you may know, our Q1 cash flow is historically our lowest cash-generative quarter, and the results in Q1 of this year indicate solid cash flows as compared to historical levels. It is worth noting that we paid out our normal fourth quarter dividend in late December as opposed to early January, so our net cash flow in Q1 also benefited from not having this normal outflow during the first quarter.","Finally, turning to our capital structure. During the quarter, we began implementing our share buyback program by buying back approximately 200,000 shares at an average price of $70 a share. As you know, we announced the $250 million share buyback program at the end of last year as a way of providing value to our shareholders. After the quarter end, we also successfully executed a $300 million bond offering in the public markets. This 10-year senior note carries a rate of 3.2%, and this was our first public offering in more than 10 years. By issuing this bond, it has enabled us to take advantage of attractive rates while diversifying our sources of funding as well as our investor base. We also maintained our quarterly dividend at $0.34. And per our normal course of action, we will be evaluating our dividend payout in our July meeting when we will decide on future actions relative to dividend increases.","In summary, before handing it back over to Doug, we ended the year with increased optimism and see many areas of the business positioned for future growth and profitability. Here are some key takeaways. First, we delivered solid top line growth led by new wins owing in part to our innovations and to our expanded quarter\u2019s participation. Our growth this quarter was supported by 9% growth in the emerging markets as we continue to grow with our customers in the developed markets. Our ability to anticipate consumer preferences with innovative products such as those using our sweetness and sodium modulation tools in Flavors or those using our encapsulation technology and Fragrances were critical drivers to our new-win successes. Our diversification with regards to categories, products and customers provides us with ongoing stability and supports our growth. Our compound growth in the quarter of 6%, combined with our latest 4 quarters trailing growth of 8%, indicates the continued momentum in this portion of our business. We also made investments in our future growth as evidenced by our recent announcement of our multiyear collaboration with Amyris to develop and commercialize sustainable ingredients.","Second, we improved our gross margins again this quarter, owing to moderating raw material costs, residual benefits of previously taken pricing, innovation and improved product mix and cost reductions. Over the last few years, our ability to protect and expand our margins has been less about the net impact of pricing and input costs and more about our efforts to maximize our portfolio. Importantly, the improved margin profile enables us to strategically invest in innovation and business-building initiatives such as those involving Evolva and Amyris.","Third, we are looking to continue to leverage our geographic presence. We are in the process of building out our facility in Gebze, Turkey. And this quarter we announced the formal opening of our plant in Guangzhou, China, which we expect to commence commercial production in the third quarter of 2013. In addition, satellite labs and creative centers that have opened in the last 12 months include Chengdu and Beijing in China and Delhi in India. We believe we are very well positioned for the near and longer terms and continue to execute on our plans.","Fourth, we are taking continued action to consolidate our manufacturing footprint and realize operating efficiencies, and we have recently decided to close 3 plants including our Fragrance Ingredients plant in Augusta, Georgia.","Fifth, we have made changes to our capital structure to provide us with ample liquidity and added financial flexibility, while continuing to return cash to shareholders both through a share repurchase program and quarterly dividend payment.","Clearly, a lot is happening at IFF and all of it is about driving our strategic agenda forward. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Doug for his outlook on 2013.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Nicolas, Hernan and Kevin. We are pleased with the progress we have made over the past few years in driving growth across both businesses based on our innovations and our capable teams. The diverse and stable nature of our business, combined with our customer intimacy and consumer insights, enabled us to deliver solid results again this quarter. We feel confident that based on the diversification in terms of our portfolio, geographies and customers, we will continue to expand our presence along with our customers and continue to achieve solid growth. The accelerated momentum we see in the Flavor and Fragrance Compounds business is fueled by the strategic investments we have made in the emerging markets over many years, combined with our ability to provide customers with products that meet or surpass consumer expectations, and potentially lead to market share growth for both our customers and for us. We are committed to driving the business for long term, creating new and innovative products that will appeal to customers, consumers all around the world and collaborating with global and local customers to bring these products to market. We continued to execute on our 3 strategic pillars, which are helping us to chart our growth.","At the same time, we are focused on our performance and making sure we produce strong results.  Our outlook for the full year 2013 is to deliver growth and profitability in line with our long-term targets. We believe we will be able to deliver these results based on our current view of the environment and our performance within it. In addition, our R&D pipeline should provide us with longer-term growth, while also providing us with sustainable cost-effective raw materials that give us the competitive edge, enable us to grow our gross margin.","For the second quarter of 2013, we expect to see improved local currency sales growth in Flavors, even though we will continue to be impacted by the continued exit of low-margin sales activities. In Fragrances, we expect momentum to increase in Fine and Beauty Care and maintain our solid growth in Functional. While we expect to see improved volume trends in Ingredients for the full year, we still expect year-over-year declines in the second quarter. Of note, notwithstanding Fragrance Ingredients sales softness centered on high volume and low-cost items, we expect to maintain Fragrance Ingredients margins. We have a committed and a dedicated group of people whose mission is to see the company succeed. We are pushing ahead to meet our internal financial objectives and expect to be able to deliver top line growth in line with our long-term targets due to our diversity and our ability to provide value to customers year after year in every region.","In conclusion, we believe our strong performance at IFF this quarter is the result of our geographic footprint, our product diversity and our ability to work with our customers to develop new products that will help shape the industry and delight consumers. We believe we are very well positioned in the market and we plan to continue to selectively invest in those areas where we see the most growth. We are investing in the future, making daily changes to advance the business. We will continue to proactively manage our performance and calibrate costs in line with our top line growth as we continue to execute against our business plans. We will continue to focus on excellence in the execution of our strategies.","Before we take your questions, I wanted to mention that we are gearing up for our 2013 Investor Day, which will be held on Wednesday, June 5, in New York from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.. If you've already received an invitation, please access the online registration site and sign up by the end of the month. If you have not received an invitation and you are interested in attending, please reach out to Shelley Young and let her know of your interest. The theme of this year's event is innovation, and we will be showcasing some of our leading technologies and providing you with an update on our 3 strategic pillars. We hope you can make it, and we look forward to seeing our IFF analysts, investors and prospective investors at the New York event.","Thank you for your attendance and for your participation. I will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first response is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess a couple questions to try to clarify and sort of get some thoughts around the outlook. One is just trying to understand the confidence in the second quarter sales improvement, including how much is pulled forward into the fourth quarter or pushed out into the second quarter this year in terms of just overall puts and takes on what the number was in the first quarter, including maybe some comments on what's going on with new wins or existing business. And then secondly a bit of a longer-term point of view, EBIT and EPS outlook, what is the full benefit from the facility rationalization that you've talked about so far, the 3 facilities? I guess in particular the Sweden and Indonesian pieces, and now the Augusta, Georgia, benefit from an EBIT standpoint. So what's the incremental for those 2? And then on the clarification, does several actions within ingredients specifically mean there's more to come in that specific business?","Douglas D. Tough","Okay, Mark. You have got several questions in there. Let me start to talk to a couple of them. And then I'll ask [indiscernible] Hernan, Nicolas to talk to volume and Kevin with the question on rationalization benefits. Certainly, on the volume, you'll know we almost always see a certain degree of lumpiness in the results. And I think Nicolas pointing out that the 19% performance in Fine Fragrance in the previous quarter was an indication of extremely solid results then offset by weaker results now. So when they, in the moment, talk about the volume performance in the outlook for Q2 and beyond -- I'll let them address specific wins, specific commercial results and so forth. But certainly as it relates to this quarter and in particular, we have a good line of sight on order book results and on both the results of the wins and then the forward orders. And it's an encouraging picture, which is why we elaborated the way we did on the outlook for Q2. Only because it might come up elsewhere, but in the context of the Fragrance Ingredients issues, we have had a comprehensive review with our Board of Directors. There are several opportunity areas to improve the business. We will be advising the marketplace as and when we are ready to commit to those. But certainly, the first one we've done was the announcement on Augusta. And you're correct in assuming there might be more there, but we won't be talking about that today. And I'll come back to the volume discussion now and the projections and start with Hernan as it looks to Flavors in Q2 and beyond.","Hernan Vaisman","Hi, Mark, this is Hernan speaking. Regarding why we are confident in Q2 is basically we have a visibility in our orders in-house. Because the high volumes coming, truly because we placed some orders starting in the first quarter, but also because we have a big wins in some regions that we will be launching in the quarter. So basically, that's why we are confident, firstly, the wins that is going to impact. And then secondly, we have some order issues and order -- particular order issues in the first quarter and now is correcting in the second quarter.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Mark, it's Nicolas. Regarding pretty similar comments regarding Q2, where we're seeing we have very, very strong pipeline of new wins that already started in Q1, and looking at the way that the quarter has started and the order in-house, we believe that we have good momentum going on. Regarding your questions of pushing and pulling versus the different quarters and the customer dynamics, obviously if you had the Q4 performance in Fine & Beauty of 19 plus 4% in Q1, that's about 11% growth over the 2 quarters. And we know that the Christmas season was positive but probably not as a strong as expected, therefore, it's impacting our intake. But it is fair to say that North America is probably not as strong, starting the year not as strong as we could have expected in terms of consumer trends. But as far as new wins participation and pipeline of new projects, it remains very strong. And if you add new wins in Q1 we\u2019re above historical levels.","Kevin C. Berryman","Mark, this is Kevin. I'll follow up on one quick comment on the volume and then talk about the restructuring question that you had. The only other point to add to what's already been said is that in Q1, our win rates were actually quite strong. So our growth associated with new business offset by any losses that we might have had was actually near strong levels, and not necessarily at historical levels but very strong. So if there was any weakness in Q1, it was relative to some of the erosion that we saw in our business. So underlying the growth outlook going forward is a continued momentum in terms of that win performance. So that's one comment. On your second question on the ingredients -- excuse me, on the restructurings or closures of the additional plants, we already talked to the benefits associated with the Fragrance Ingredients effort. We do have the other 2 plants. We expect that the savings associated with those plants will, once that's fully instituted, probably be $4 million plus or thereabouts. We'll start to see some of that this year because the timing that we'll be facing over the second half of the year. However, I would say that will largely be offset this year because at the same time, we'll be ramping of our facility, our new facility in Guangzhou, China, which is the new Flavors facility. So that's probably a net loss roughly speaking in 2013 in the back half. So I think we'll start to see those benefits in 2014 and beyond for Sweden and Indonesia in Fragrance.","Operator","Your next response is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was hoping you could give a little more color first on where you stand on the work to migrate Ingredients business from Ingredients into Compounds. It doesn't feel there was much of that in the current period. And then thinking through it again, I would think it probably takes more than \u2013 it\u2019ll be a perfect match between Ingredients, losing Ingredients business, and getting that to flow through to Compounds. So could you talk a little bit about that?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Lauren, it's Nicolas. Lauren, you are right. It takes some time for the migration to occur. And then the migration, from the visibility that we have, will occur in Q2, so we will see that migration from one part of our business to the other. It will be progressive. So we have not seen that benefit yet, and it will come later in the year.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just following up on all the comments you all just shared on the volumes and answering the first question. It is a little -- comparisons get a lot more difficult in the back half of this year. And so I just wanted to make sure I'm hearing it clearly that when you talk about the run rate of the business and kind of, I think Kevin, you said you had 7% or 8% run rate for the Fragrance Compounds business that, that you think is indicative of where things stand this quarter, a bit of an operation deceleration. But even versus tougher comps in the second half, that should be sustainable?","Kevin C. Berryman","Lauren, this is Kevin. If you think about the outlook that Doug has provided in terms of the full year, at the end of the day, we're thinking we\u2019re going to be able to deliver against our long-term financial target of 4 to 6, and we're comfortable with that. So by definition, that translates into us having to have incremental performance in the back 3 quarters of the year relative to our start at 3%. So I think that remember, our 4 to 6 has always been including the exit of low-margin business. So we said we would hit our long-term targets even with those exits, the impact of the exits. So the fact that we're at 3% in Q1 I just won\u2019t indicate we're going to have to see some improvement in the back 3 quarters.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great, perfect. And then my final thing, sorry, the partnership with Amyris, I was just curious because I believe from Minex [ph] who also put out a press release earlier this year about having a similar relationship. Or at least the way press release read, it was kind of similar. So if you're able to kind of offer any color around what\u2019s different with what you're doing versus your understanding of what competition is doing, what would be exclusive, what wouldn't be and so on?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Lauren, it's Nicolas again. In this type of collaboration and partnership, it's really linked to your own portfolio. And so everybody's really developing different agreement regarding their different portfolio, their strengths, unique complementary expertise from both the company we\u2019re partnering with and with ours. So they are very, very specific to what we do, what we can for and our existing portfolio, which is different as you know, in ingredients. We don't compete with our key competitors on the same portfolio. We are not competing against them. Therefore, it's very, very specific to what we do and probably -- I\u2019m not aware of their [indiscernible] but what they are doing on their side is indicative to their portfolio.","Operator","Your next response is from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Silke Kueck for Jeff. I was wondering whether you could clarify like what percentage of the Ingredients business of the Augusta plant represents? My recollection is that wasn\u2019t a particularly large plant servicing the Ingredient business. And my -- I have 2 follow-up questions. I was also wondering what you thought about the sustainability of the Fragrance margins in the second quarter and for the year. Because seeing some bigger margins that are -- these are much higher margins than I would have expected. I know you\u2019ve commented on ingredients, but not on the Fragrance business as a whole. And lastly on the Amyris question, I was wondering whether you could just talk about what applications you are working on with Amyris, whether this is for Fine Fragrance applications or Functional. Maybe you could just give a little bit more detail, if you wouldn't mind.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Yes. I will start with your last question -- it's Nicolas, regarding Amyris. One thing which is really critical to underscore and the strengths or the critical importance of ingredients to us, that usually you can use one ingredient across all categories. So whatever progress improvement, cost effectiveness you can gain or even access to more a longer-term source of supply really benefits not only your ingredients but it benefits your compound business. And that's why for us to be vertically integrated has significant benefit to our business, enabling us to win more business and to support the growth that we are making. So that's why Amyris, it's really broad-based in terms of the impact in our business. Regarding other stuff, we don't disclose the relative importance of our plants, so we cannot provide that detail. And regarding also the quality of the margin, I think it's important to recognize that our focus has been in terms of the margin protection, margin improvement as you saw for the last quarters, and also as a result of our greater focus and emphasis on the economic profitability, we\u2019re really asking the team to focus on every part of the business that can improve our position. And as Kevin was talking about, the majority of our improvement came from this margin improvement, efficiencies in the business to help to regain some of the margin pressure that we are facing.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So the way I take this answer is just that you hope to sustain these margins, yes?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Yes.","Douglas D. Tough","Yes. I mean, I think it's important to understand some of the elements that Nicolas talked about is the wins, the briefs [ph] we're going after, the target margins we've set, the basis for innovation and a number of other internal productivity moves that have all contributed more to the margin improvement than did the pricing recovery. So the focus of that group is very much on margin preservation enhancement and increasing.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That is helpful.","Operator","Your next response is from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You started with the strength in the emerging markets. Would you hazard a guess as to what percent of your sales now are to developed markets? Did the customers re-export their products to the emerging markets?","Kevin C. Berryman","We don't have an exact read on that. But if you look at it on an overall basis, the emerging markets represent 49% of our overall sales. Now included in that figure is the fact that ingredients, our Fragrance Ingredients business, is actually 80-20 the other way or 80-20 focused on development -- developed markets. Certainly, some of that is going to the emerging markets, but we don't have a good ability to really indicate what that is. So probably at the end of the day, that means more than 50% of our business is supporting emerging market business, but we don't have the clarity as it relates to what that number actually is.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","And John, if I can maybe augment the comments regarding compounds, we say that now we are at 54% of our Compound sales in emerging markets. And there is one category which is more global, which is Fine Fragrance, for which you really would typically capture sales in North America and Europe. But you know that these products are then reexported to the rest of the world. Most of the other categories are manufactured locally and regionally. So if you think about fine fragrance now being reexported, our share of emerging market would be greater than 54%.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then secondly, a follow-up on the Flavor side. I\u2019ve seen a few specialty chemical companies recently talk about their specialty food and ingredients businesses. I am not talking about bulk ingredients, but the specialty additives in food, and they're looking to build out. Would you benefit or do you think you could create value by partnering in the food ingredient area beyond Flavors?","Hernan Vaisman","Well, we -- this is Hernan. We're always looking to enhance our portfolio. I don't know exactly what you mean by putting in and which type of food ingredients. But definitely, we have some partnership with some including ingredients varieties to help us to formulate better flavors.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You're actually pretty narrow in Flavors, right? I mean, you're just talking about your work with other companies. You don't have anything formally in terms of a JV outside of the Flavors area?","Hernan Vaisman","In fact, we have, we have many. But we usually for a strategic point of view, we are not disclosing that. But we have several partnerships with different companies to really enhance our portfolio.","Douglas D. Tough","John, I think there's a broader question here. And it's really if you look at what we're doing with Evolva and Amyris, we will be increasing a focus on external partnership and opportunities. So through our innovation or beneficial commercial opportunities perhaps in fragrance -- flavor ingredients, perhaps in other categories, the company would have an interest in those.","Operator","Your next response is from Edward Yang of Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Are any customers asking for price concessions now that raw materials are declining? I know in the past, your pricing was relatively fixed once you were placed within the product. Or are you -- are they asking for any volume discounts?","Douglas D. Tough","Well, I think the answer, we'll always be having conversations with customers about whether we need a price increase or they\u2019re looking at opportunities in the context of a benign cost of goods environment or opportunities to perhaps renegotiate things with us, so that's an ongoing phenomena. But I think that Kevin touched upon it I think really well in one of the slides was that we still are not fully recovered all that we had from the standpoint of our cost increases. So in some cases with customers, we continue to have dialogue surrounding getting that price increases to help us recover our margins.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And Doug, you mentioned Kevin\u2019s comments on, you said you\u2019ve effectively recovered absolute cost increases, but you still have about 170 basis points in gross margin to recover. So are you think about it from a gross margin percentage standpoint, are you basically done in terms of looking at the absolute cost increases?","Douglas D. Tough","It's the former, trying to regain the margins we had.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Nicolas talked about the Christmas impact on Fine Fragrance, and that was offset by some of the new wins that you\u2019ve had. Typically, what's the volume overhang after Christmas like we did? Are you satisfied that the inventory levels are now back to levels that won\u2019t be a headwind?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","I think we are looking at really the 2 quarters together and we know that the market did not grow at 19% in Q4. I think the market was a more modest growth of maybe 3%, 4%. Therefore, also reported by lot of new activities. We had a very, very strong new win pipeline last year. So a lot of the effort to promote these new launches at Christmas. So that affected obviously our volume intake in Q1. But what I said earlier, our pipeline of new wins and the benefit that we saw in Q1 going into Q2 gave us good perspective on the business moving forward. If you are comparing about those 2 inventory level compared to 2 years ago, I think that the industry has learned a lot at everything, all level of the supply chain, and we\u2019re not seeing the same pressure that we have or exposure 2 years ago than today. So the inventory period, what is in the trade is father than it was 2 years ago.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just the tax rate, is 24% good for the rest of the year?","Kevin C. Berryman","This is Kevin. Really the benefits associated with the tax rate were associated with the carryover R&D tax credit. As you may recall, our friends in Washington finally decided on implementing the 2012 push under the R&D tax credit after the end of the year. I think it was at 12:15 or something in the morning on January 1. So effectively, the reduction in the tax rate for the first quarter is really recognizing the full year benefit of 2012 R&D tax credit in Q1 2013. The more normalized figure should be when you\u2019re thinking about the balance of the year, 26% to 26.5%, perhaps a little higher in terms of the tax rate.","Operator","We have a follow-up from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just quickly, I want to make sure I thoroughly understood. I think you guys talked about ingredients, obviously it would still be down in Q2, but at more moderate rate of decline. And then did you say up for the full year?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","No.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, okay.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Lauren, this is Nicolas. I think that your perception on Q2 is accurate, but it's not -- it's -- we should not expect any positive growth ingredients for the year.","Operator","There are no further responses in the queue at this time.","Douglas D. Tough","Well, thank you, all, for participating on the call today. And we look forward to seeing you at the Investor Day if you make it on June 5 in New York. Thank you.

(Operator Instructions)"," I would now like to introduce Shelley Young, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Shelley Young ","Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IFF\u2019s first quarter 2014 conference call. Earlier today, we distributed a press release announcing our first quarter results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at www.iff.com. This call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. ","Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements which I will read out loud. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the second quarter and our outlook for the full year of 2014. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 2015 10-K filed on February 25, 2014, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today and is on our website.","With me on the call today is Doug Tough, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nicholas Mirzayantz, our President of Fragrances; Matthias Haeni, our President of Flavors; and Kevin Berryman, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Matthias joins us for the first time in his new role, so welcome, Matthias.","I would now like to turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Tough","Thank you, Shelley. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Before I start my formal comments, I would like to extend a warm welcome to Matthias Haeni. As of April 1, Matthias assumed the role of Group President, Flavors after serving as Regional General Manager of Flavors for our EAME region for the past three years. Prior to that, Matthias was the Regional General Manager for Flavors of our greater Asia region. Under his leadership, IFF expanded our manufacturing network in Asia and Europe. We opened new plants in China and Singapore for Flavors, and more recently, we have been expanding our strategically located facility in Gebze, Turkey which will serve the fast growing emerging markets in the region, region, including the Middle East and Africa. We also achieved consistently strong sales and operating profit growth in both EAME and greater Asia in Flavors. Matthias is a 23-year veteran of the flavors and fragrance industry, and we are pleased and excited to have someone with his experience and insight in this role.","Turning to the agenda for today's call, I will provide an overview of the first quarter for consolidated IFF, followed by Nicolas Mirzayantz and Matthias Haeni, who will provide their perspective on the performance of our fragrances and flavors business segments, respectively. Then Kevin Berryman will provide you with a financial overview of our first quarter and turn the call back over to me for a balance of the year outlook and some concluding comments before we open the call to your questions.","Turning now to the first quarter of 2014, our local currency sales growth was 7%, which reflects balanced growth between flavors and fragrances and includes a percentage point of growth from our Aromor acquisition, which we acquired on January 15. This quarter, fragrance delivered growth of 8%, which includes 2 percentage points of growth from Aromor, and flavors achieved growth of 5%. Growth this quarter was also more balanced between the emerging markets, which grew 7%, and the developed markets, which grew at 5%.","Our organic growth this quarter reflects a higher level of new wins, consistent with our performance in 2013. The level of new wins was strong across both business units due to our emphasis on innovation and technology, and the strength of our teams in leveraging our consumer insights, R&D, and creative capabilities to provide outstanding, high-performance products for our customers. As you may recall, on our fourth-quarter call we said we expected to see more moderate top-line growth in the first quarter following a strong Q4. We were pleased that we were able to deliver 7% growth for the second consecutive quarter. Due to some seasonal order patterns, we had stronger than expected sales in the final few weeks of the quarter, which accounted for a large portion of the upside to our original forecasts. ","On a regional basis, our strongest local currency growth was achieved in greater Asia, where we are investing in new facilities and capacity and technology in order to support our customers. We saw continued strong double-digit growth in many of the countries where IFF has committed capital, such as Singapore, China, and Indonesia. We also delivered high single-digit growth in EAME and positive growth in Latin and North America. All of our regions are seeing positive growth, which added to our overall sales growth.","Turning to our profit margins, our gross profit margins improved 150 basis points versus the prior year. Our strong growth and favorable mix of business contributed to the margin expansion. Our adjusted operating profit in the first quarter of 2014 increased 14%. This is primarily due to our strong growth, combined with margin expansion and disciplined cost control. The results of Aromor were not significant to our consolidated financial performance.","IFF's adjusted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.32, in line with our long-term growth targets. We did not benefit from the R&D tax credit this quarter, which resulted in a higher effective tax rate than our adjusted tax rate in the primary year.","In summary, we started the year with strong top-line momentum, which resulted in favorable gross and operating margin expansion and enabled us to grow our adjusted earnings per share by 11%. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Nicolas and Matthias, so they can provide more detail on their respective business units. Nicolas, it's over to you.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Thank you, Doug. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone.","Turning to our fragrance business, we had a very strong first quarter with many highlights. Fragrance net revenue of $404 million increased 9% this quarter on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, fragrance delivered local currency sales growth of 8%. This includes 2 percentage points of growth from our recent Aromor acquisition. The strong overall organic growth of 6% reflects a continued high level of new wins, resulting in continued momentum and broad-based growth.","The developed market had local currency growth of 9%, and the emerging markets had local currency growth of 2%, indicating the benefits of our geographic and customer diversity. Regionally, our strongest region this quarter was greater Asia, with local currency growth of 16%, and our EAME region had local currency growth of 12%.","North America had growth of 8%, reflecting continued strong momentum from new wins and increased coalesced participation. With our stronger move this quarter in our developed markets, a reversal of what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters, due to a higher volume of fine fragrance sales, in particular to customers in North America and Western Europe, we delivered double-digit growth in fine fragrance in both our North America and EAME regions.","Regarding our decline this quarter in Latin America, I would like to put our results into perspective. We are comparing to very strong growth of 15% in Latin America in the first quarter of 2013, including 37% growth in fine fragrance and 11% in consumer fragrances, both higher than the market growth. The overall fragrance business unit growth of 8%, even with the decline in Latin America, points to the strength and diversity of our portfolio.","In regard to our end-use category of commercial (inaudible) with fragrance compounds, were recently realigned. Starting with our first-quarter results, we are reporting our top-line sales growth consistent with our new organizational structure. Fragrance compounds consist of two newly-defined market categories: fine fragrances and consumer fragrances. Fine fragrances needs no further explanation. Consumer fragrances consist of five end-use categories, including fabric care, home care, personal wash, toiletries, and hair care.","Fine fragrance achieved 10% local currency growth this quarter compared with growth of 1% in the first quarter of 2013. This growth reflects very strong performance with our customers in Western Europe and the United States. We are seeing continued momentum in some of our prior launches, such as Invictus for Men by Paco Rabanne from Puig and La Vie Est Belle by Lancome from L'Oreal. Due to the ongoing longevity and popularity of our classic fragrance launches, which are still in high demand by global consumers, we continued to have strong usage volume in addition to our strong win rate.","Consumer fragrances had steady growth of 4%, led by double-digit growth in hair care and high single-digit growth in fabric care, offset in part by a small decline in home care. Our hair care category was up double digits in North America, Europe, and Latin America; and single-digit in greater Asia, in large part due to our success in providing our customers with consumer-preferred fragrances.","Our performance was very strong in fabric care, particularly in greater Asia, which accounted for more than half of the upside due to a high level of new wins in both global and regional customers in the region. ","Our fragrance ingredients business, which now includes the results of Aromor, had local currency growth of 22%. Aromor added 14 percentage points to the ingredients end growth. The business growth of 8% benefited from sales of unit product families, including specialty ingredients. We also saw the continued planned migration of some of our volume in fragrance compounds. Excluding the impact of both Aromor and the planned migration, which had a 4% negative impact on growth, fragrance ingredients had growth of 12%. Next quarter will be the final quarter of the planned migration of volume from ingredients to compounds. ","In summary, we achieved very good top-line growth, thanks to the strength and diversity of our portfolio, customer base, end-use category, and consumer insight in our key markets. Here you see both our top-line and operating profit growth. As you can see, we were able to leverage our 8% local currency sales growth into higher segment operating profit expansion of 28% due to gross profit improvements combined with improved cost control.","Our gross margin this quarter benefited from strong volume gains and improved end-use category mix, as well as a favorable impact of price to input costs and continued focus on cost reduction through multiyear programs, which have resulted in productivity enhancements. The extreme margin growth combined with the higher growth units resulted in a $19 million improvement in segment profit to $87.2 million. Our segment profit margin improved 320 basis points to 21.6%.","For the second quarter, we are expecting continued momentum in the business. We are anticipating a modest amount of inflationary pressure in the input cost environment in the second half of the year. And we have been focused and continue to focus on driving efficiency into our portfolio to reduce our overhead cost structure. To that end, over the past few years we restructured and streamlined our organization. We reduced our manufacturing footprint both in compound and ingredients and realigned our organization to increase go-to-market and offer improved alignment with customers. By implementing these actions, we were able to minimize price increase to our customers. ","Before I conclude, I would like to make a few comments about our recent acquisition of Aromor. We are very pleased they have joined IFF, and all of our teams, R&D, creative, commercial, operations, and finance, are working closely with our new colleagues to ensure a successful integration. Our combined R&D pipeline is very strong, and we are working collaboratively to capture synergies between the two organizations. ","I am also pleased that some of our new launch in the second half of the year will include fragrances formulated using our new molecules, which you may recall were only recently launched internally. This signifies not only our consumers\u2019 confidence in our new molecule pipeline, but also shows our faster speed to market, which is a testament to the collaboration of the entire team and improved processes.","Before I turn the call over to Matthias, our new President of Flavors, I would like to welcome him to the new role and wish him continued success. ","Matthias Haeni ","Thank you very much, Nicolas. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to be here on today's conference call. I joined the team in New York.","Turning to our sales performance, in the first quarter Flavors achieved local currency sales growth of 5%, led by double-digit growth in the emerging markets, which continued to be a strong and important driver for our business. We achieved solid growth within our long-term targets despite weakness in North America, thanks to the diversity and breadth of our portfolio and customer base. Notably, we achieved strong performance in many of the countries where we committed or are committing capital to add capacity or technology. In particular, the growth we are seeing in emerging markets of greater Asia, Latin America, and central and southeastern Europe clearly supports our investment strategy. In total, Flavors grew 12% in the emerging markets, led by Latin America, where we had growth of over 20%; and greater Asia, which achieved high single-digit growth.","Turning to the regions, in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as you see on the slide, we had solid growth of 4%. This was supported by growth in all categories. In greater Asia there was widespread growth across all end-use categories, resulting in total local currency sales growth of 8%. There was double-digit growth in many countries, and we were extremely pleased to see the continuation of strong trends.","In North America this quarter we saw a decline reflecting overall market weakness. It resulted in lower volumes on existing business, and new wins were not sufficient to offset these volume losses. Our customers have been impacted equally to softer market environment we are seeing in North America, and we are closely monitoring the situation.","Finally, turning to our strong performance in Latin America, I know Hernan talked about Latin America in the past and the improvements that IFF was making in this market. Our people in the region have been working hard to leverage our technology and creation capabilities to develop new growth opportunities. And we are seeing the results of their efforts in terms of strong new wins, especially in beverages, where our technologies are opening new avenues for growth.","Latin America increased 23% in the quarter and was up double digits for the second consecutive quarter. The accelerated positive momentum is based on the strength of our product offerings; based on our creative and application know-how; and customer intimacy, which is ultimately the hallmark of IFF.","We also look at our performance through the lens of end-use categories. Flavors delivered double-digit growth in beverages and mid-single-digit gains in savory and dairy, all supported by our health and wellness platform. As you know, our Flavors' creative and applications teams worked with customers across end-use categories to develop high-performing products that address the needs of health-conscious consumers who want great-tasting food and beverages that have less fat, less salt, and less sugar. In summary, Flavors achieved solid and widespread growth, with emerging markets, again a key growth driver.","Turning to our financial performance, local currency growth of 5% included high levels of technology-driven wins and double-digit growth in the emerging markets. Historic volume growth, combined with mix gains, net favorable pricing inputs, costs, and manufacturing efficiencies resulted in enhanced gross margin again this quarter. At the same time, we exerted tight control over our fixed expenses, resulting in increased growth leverage. The margin gains combined with disciplined spending resulted in a 6% or $5 million improvement in our segment profit performance this quarter. Put another way, our segment profit margins expanded by 70 basis points to 24% in the first quarter.","Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2014, we expect moderate growth as we compare to strong like-for-like growth of 8% in the second quarter of 2013. We expect continued growth in the emerging markets, where we have made significant positive investment in capacity and creation capabilities to better serve our customers. ","In summary, our performance this quarter was solid on top and bottom lines. We continued to make focused investments to better serve our customers and to provide growth for the short, medium, and long term.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin, our CFO.","Kevin Berryman","Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see on the slide, our performance was certainly strong in Q1. Our net sales of $770 million were up on a reported basis by 6%. Excluding the 100 basis point negative impact of foreign currency this quarter, our consolidated local currency sales growth was 7%.","As noted earlier, our consolidated sales included the results from our recent acquisition of Aromor, which added a percentage point to our consolidated growth. We are pleased with the initial results from this strategic acquisition and welcome our Aromor colleagues to our global organization.","This quarter, fragrance represented 52% of our sales, and flavors comprised the remaining 38%. Our growth in the quarter was well balanced between flavors and fragrances. We had a strong mix of business between the emerging markets and developed markets, up 7% and 5%, respectively.","Our adjusted gross margins this quarter improved by 180 basis points to 44.7%, which reflects gross margin expansion in both business units due to very strong volume gains, certainly driven by growth from the wins, sales mix improvements, as well as some favorable impact of price to input costs and cost reduction initiatives.","Strong margin growth and disciplined cost control resulted in a 14% increase in our adjusted operating profit to $159 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter of 25.5% was above our effective rate of 24% in the first quarter of 2013, primarily reflecting loss of tax benefits relating to the U.S R&D tax credit this year. As a result, our adjusted EPS growth of 11% brought our first quarter adjusted EPS to $1.32, resulting in an EPS growth in line with our long-term targets.","Turning to our Research, Selling, and Administrative costs, RSA as a percent of sales increased 10 basis points this quarter, from 23.9% of sales to 24% of sales, for an increase of $11.5 million. The increase reflects the addition of Aromor to our operating results as well as slightly higher incentive compensation accruals for the quarter. We remain focused on maintaining cost discipline while investing in research and development and other strategic growth opportunities. Importantly, our research and development spending was 8% of sales in the quarter, consistent with our continued focus on driving our innovation agenda. ","Here you see our customary chart showing the change in the strength of the euro relative to the dollar. This quarter, despite the strengthening of the euro, foreign exchange had a 100 basis point negative impact on our top-line growth, as favorable foreign exchange rates were more than offset by a significant weakening of some currencies during the quarter, including the Indian rupee, the South African rand, the Japanese yen, and the Australian dollar.","As it relates to our bottom line, however, as a result of our hedging programs and proactive management, FX had a slight positive impact on our EPS, reflecting our continued focus on reducing volatility in our results through our cash flow hedging programs or other measures. At this point in the year the full-year impact on our bottom-line growth is expected to be somewhat favorable versus year ago at current foreign exchange rates. As a reminder, for 2014 the majority of our euro exposure is hedged at a rate of $1.32, close to the average for 2013.","Turning to our cash flow, our operating cash flow in the first quarter of 2014 was $35 million compared with an operating cash flow of $19 million in the prior-year quarter. The prior year cash flow included a $30 million incremental U.S pension contribution. The year-over-year increase reflects the $16 million improvement in net income, partially offset by increased incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of 2014 versus the first quarter of 2013. As a percent of sales, the current-quarter operating cash flow is 4.5% of sales compared with 2.6% in the year-ago quarter. Core working capital improved in absolute dollars to support our business growth; however, it declined on a percentage of sales of the business.","Turning to our capital structure, capital spending for growth in infrastructure and newer technology continued to be our most important use of cash. Over the past few years we have been investing approximately 4.5% of sales on adding capacity where it's needed to optimize our geographic footprint and provide newer technologies to our customers in all markets. As Matthias mentioned, we are in the midst of building out our manufacturing capacity and building a new creative center in Turkey. At the end of 2013, we also announced a $50 million investment in Indonesia to build a new manufacturing facility in the Jakarta area and install a new creative center on our existing site in Jakarta for our customers.","We are also committed to returning capital to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and cash. We currently pay a quarterly dividend of $0.39 a share. In addition, in the first quarter of 2014, we spent $20 million on share buybacks, representing 227 million shares at an average price of $88.70, which brings our total spending program to date to $71 million through the end of the first quarter. Based on the current share price, we continue to expect that we will spend more our share buyback in 2014 than we did in 2013. ","Subsequent to quarter end, we also completed the extension of our $950 million credit facility to April 4, 2019, at more attractive rates than our previous revolver. This provides IFF with continued financial flexibility and a lower cost than the Company's previous facility.","Finally, we continue to evaluate business development opportunities such as Aromor and other entities, and we are targeting those opportunities that will provide us with access to new technology, geography, or business adjacency that will make strong strategic sense and leverage our expertise in science and technology. ","Before turning the call back over to Doug, I would like to provide you with an update on the performance of our portfolio as it relates to economic profit. This slide highlights the progress we have made in improving the return profile of our overall portfolio. I would like to highlight that while improving the return profile, we have been delivering against our sales growth objectives, consistent with our long-term financial targets. This demonstrates our ability to both grow the business while improving the profitability of our portfolio. ","The pie chart on the right shows the breakdown of our portfolio at the end of 2013, while the pie chart on the left shows the breakdown of our portfolio at the end of 2009, the year immediately preceding the initial implementation of economic profit as a management tool. At the end of 2013, 80% of our invested capital was supporting EP positive categories, up from 65% in 2009. Furthermore, a full 95% of our portfolio is now EP breakeven or positive, up from 85% in 2009, or an improvement of 10 percentage points. ","As you may recall, as part of our objective to strengthen our overall portfolio, we identified in 2011 approximately $50 million of operating profit opportunity that we believed we could realize while applying the principles of economic profit and driving efficiencies into the underperforming parts of our portfolio. By exiting lower-margin sales activities, focusing on profitable growth, and driving operating efficiencies, by year-end 2013 we had exceeded our going-in target of $50 million -- two years ahead of our original estimated time. This has been reflected in our improved operating margins and results.","Today, we still believe there are additional opportunities to improve certain parts of the portfolio further while delivering meaningful product innovation. While we expect that this will represent additional profit opportunities, we also expect that certain growth investments will be made that will offset this benefit over the next few years. These ongoing, continuous improvement efforts are a fundamental part of our three-pillar strategy.","I will now turn the call back over to Doug discuss our outlook and provide a wrap-up.","Doug Tough","Thank you, Kevin, Matthias, and Nicolas. As you heard from the team, we had a strong start to the year based on our operating performance. Our local currency sales growth of 7% was higher than our original forecast. Given the strong start to the year, we are reconfirming our expectation for local currency sales growth of 5% to 7%, which includes a percentage point of growth from the Aromor acquisition. Due to the volume growth and the improved mix of business, we delivered strong gross and operating margins.","Our adjusted operating margins achieved growth of 14%, while our adjusted earnings per share increased 11%. We\u2019re also reconfirming our expectation to deliver double-digit operating profit and earnings per share growth for the full year. For the second quarter we expect more moderate sales growth. However, given our emphasis on productivity savings and other margin improvements, we expect to see continued gross margin expansion, but at a lower rate of year-over-year improvement, especially as we compare the improved gross margin performance of the prior year in quarters two, three, and four. In addition, we are also closely monitoring input costs and expect to see some inflationary cost pressure in the second half of the year. Certain input costs are expected to increase.","Our emphasis on our 10 key research and development platforms has resulted in a stronger pipeline for the Company, and we continue to invest in our programs and subject them to a disciplined review process to make sure they are proceeding on track. For the second quarter of 2014 we are expecting to achieve sales, operating profit, and earnings per share growth within our long-term targets.","I would like to leave you with a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, we achieved strong momentum in both business units, with more balanced growth between our emerging and developed markets. We also achieved growth in both our local global and regional accounts. This diversity provides us with greater stability and enabled us to achieve 7% growth, even when some areas of our business are facing a more challenging set of circumstances.","Second, we have made and continue to make strategic investments in the business to expand our footprint and make sure we have the necessary capacity to grow with our customers in the regions and to continue to work with new customers who have strong local positions. We are able to work with global, local, and regional customers and provide them with consumer insight, R&D expertise, and fragrance and flavors that they can sell to consumers anywhere in the world. ","Third, we continue to grow our gross and operating margins by focusing on productivity, efficiency, and quality improvements and we have seen the benefits in our strong profit growth.","Fourthly, our strong performance reflects the collaborative efforts of our people to leverage our consumer insights, R&D, and creative capabilities to provide outstanding results for our customers and our shareholders. We are making investments in our people to make sure they have the necessary training and development to better serve our customers and anticipate future trends.","And fifth, we continue to execute against our three strategic pillars to leverage our geographic reach, to strengthen our innovation platform, and to maximize our portfolio. We continue to believe execution of our three pillars will enable us to drive profitable growth for our shareholders.","Thank you for your participation today. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) and your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus","Good morning, everybody, and welcome, Matthias. I guess just couple -- few questions. One just sort of broader question on the developing markets, so a bit of a slowdown relative to 2013 growth. I guess we\u2019ve heard from some of your larger customers that they are starting to see a slowdown. I guess maybe sort of quantify what you've seen year-to-date in 2014, and how you are thinking about that growth going forward -- and maybe even talk about specific markets, countries where you may be seeing a bit of a slowdown. And then Matthias, can you talk a bit about the North America business? I know you haven't been there that long, but maybe talk a bit about what you are thinking about expectation-wise in terms of potential improvements, since it's not just this quarter. It\u2019s been a bit weak over the last year or so.","Doug Tough","Okay, Mark, I will start off, and then I'll ask both Matthias and Nicolas to weigh in with their perspectives. I think the overarching comment is we still have great confidence in overall emerging market opportunities, the celebrated next billion consumers. We believe that trend is inexorable, and we remain committed to it. I'd also say that -- and you will get more specifics in a minute, but to the degree that some of our customers are sensing or mentioning some of the slowdown, it's been marginal for us. And the buoyancy continues pretty good across almost all of the major emerging markets. So we haven't seen the trend to the degree they have, and we remain bullish. But you\u2019ve asked specific questions and I\u2019ll ask Matthias to start, and then Nicolas can weigh in with thoughts from fragrances.","Matthias Haeni","Thank you. Let me tell you that we are really pleased to see development which we see with the emerging markets. We have seen very strong momentum in Latin America, but also in most of the strategic key markets in Asia Pacific as well as in central southeastern Europe, and strong, focused markets for our folks in Africa. As such, we don't see a slowdown. I believe we have continued to put solid momentum going forward in these markets. Coming back to your question on North America, indeed we are disappointed with our performance in the first quarter this year. We have experienced lower volumes on existing business; and new wins, which we had particularly in key categories like beverages could not offset the weakness we have experienced with our sales in many key accounts. I tried to outline that we will be up against very strong comparables. Also, in the second quarter in North America we will expect a different order pattern and a change in our performance in the second half of this year.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Mark, good morning. This is Nicolas. Sentiments overall regarding our confidence in the emerging markets, they have been a growth engine for many quarters in the past. You see we have continued momentum in greater Asia following last year's momentum, and coming from a very, very good -- increased new wins and increased penetration of the market, and also leveraging our encapsulation technology. So maybe the additional comments will be about Latin America. The decline that we saw is coming after nine consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. I think that -- let me chart it through drivers. ","First of all, we are comparing to very strong growth of 15% in the first quarter last year, and as I indicated 37% including fine fragrance and 11% in consumer fragrances. It would be sure to say that we are seeing in major countries, such as in Brazil, with the market slowing down a bit, and also some inventory correction from some of our customers. Two important factors moving forward; first of all, the level of new wins is comparable to our historical average. So our momentum and our coalesced participation and success is continued. And also, we are early in the quarter. And we are seeing a reversing of the trend in Q2. So it's really one quarter which will be impacted by the factors I just shared with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Good morning, guys. Great start to the year. Nicolas, you talked about three to four areas that drove the improvement in operating margin this quarter, pretty impressive there in the low 20s. Can you maybe give us a feel of which of those 3 to 4 areas were most pertinent and sustainable for the rest of the year? Is this sort of a new level of profitability we should expect going forward? And then one for Matthias. Congratulations on the new spot there. Anything different that you are going to drive going forward? I think Hernan had a great run. Anything new that you expect to do to drive growth and keep that business on track? Thank you.","Kevin Berryman","Okay, Mike. This is Kevin. Thanks for the call, and let me make a couple of comments as it relates to some of the drivers on margin, and then I can turn it over to Nicolas to provide further clarity. Look, I think at the end of the day we have continued to be driving the maximization of the portfolio, which is about a lot of initiatives throughout the organization to help drive incremental profitability into the portfolio. That really was the primary driver to our improvements in margin on a total basis for the Company. If you think about growth leverage, you think about the benefits of mix, you think about the cost reduction initiatives that are in place, those were the majority of the driver for the gross margin improvement. Of course, that was really the big driver to our operating profit improvement as it relates to the combination of the two, the volume, the growth at the top line as well as the gross margin improvement. So, the road from -- slight benefit as it relates to the net benefit of input costs and pricing options that had been taken, are really the big drivers. And the material part of the improvement was relative to the growth leverage, the mix, and the cost reduction initiatives.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Mike, this is Nicolas. Just to add to Kevin's comment, you have already talked about the extreme focus on the productivity initiatives, and we've really reduced our footprint. We've been focusing on some of the most effective parts of our portfolio. We invested. It's the result of innovation and really driving the innovations of our portfolio faster. And now you are on the level of execution. So all these productivity initiatives, along with the focus on really maximizing our portfolio and driving innovation have been some of the key drivers of the improvement.","Matthias Haeni","Thank you very much, Mike. We have made significant investments over the last few years in key strategic markets and added infrastructure to increase capacity, but also in our creative skillset. We have a very strong innovation pipeline in our health and wellness portfolio, where we are addressing the demands to reduce sugar, fat, and salt. I am very confident we will capitalize on the many investments which we have made in the past in our fold. I\u2019m very proud that I have a very strong management team which I can take over from Hernan.","Doug Tough","And, Mike, it might be fair for me to weigh in, having worked with Hernan and now Matthias for a short while. Matthias is focused on technology, and technology being a driver of growth and innovation is probably something I have really noticed. And it fits and aligns really well with what we are trying to do. Matthias's knowledge of the industry and technology is going to be a real plus for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So I have a couple of questions. First of all, I wanted to get an update on the input costs. I know that you talked about a benefit this quarter, but then the back half is expected to be -- it's supposed to be more expensive on the input costs side. But then it looks like you took some pricing this quarter. So was that pricing related to the expected increase in input costs in the back half? Or -- and then more specifically, where exactly are you able to take the pricing this quarter? And then my second question was on for selling and admin costs. It looks like those increased -- and I know you highlighted the incentive comp increase. Was that really the only thing that drove that increase? Or were there any costs associated with, for example, the Aromor acquisition that you may have considered as part of adjusted operating profit, but may really be extraordinary? If you could just comment on that. Thanks.","Kevin Berryman","Thanks for the question, Faiza. I think, first thing, on pricing, we really didn't take any pricing in the quarter. So if you look at our top-line performance, it's really related to volume and mix, which is driving the top line. So, no real fundamental change in pricing levels for the quarter. The second point as it relates to input costs, we feel pretty comfortable as we sit here today that our current inventory levels plus contractual arrangements won't result in there being a material change and any pressures on gross margins this year, per se. But we do know that current pockets of areas of input and material are in fact at elevated levels versus what we would be enjoying at this particular point in time in terms of our costs. ","So once we get back into the market and are purchasing those new inventory levels, they will be at higher prices. And we expect that to be occurring over the back half of this year. I would call out a couple of areas. I would call out citrus. I would call out onion. I would call out patchouli as some areas where we know that there are some increases in costs coming. So as we realize those costs, we will be having targeted discussions with certain customers to understand those pressures that will be developing. And certainly, as we enter into 2015 we\u2019ll start to see some of that flowing through the P&L.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.","Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Good morning and congratulations a nice quarter. Just following up on the question about pricing. How often do you go back and talk to customers now on pricing? Back in the day in the industry, I think generally you kept prices pretty stable and tried to get higher prices on new products. But I think that changed during some of the raw material inflation we saw in the last five years or so. So how often do you have these conversations at this point in terms of pricing?","Kevin Berryman","Let me take a stab. This is Kevin -- at the question. I think it really is depending upon the specificity of the issues that are involved and the magnitude of the increases. And we could have targeted discussions with one group of customers because of the mix of the materials that they use, and no discussions with other customers, because they are not faced with the same dynamic. Look, if in fact there is a general minor cost increase, I think generally speaking, we don't look for pricing relative to that, because we look to drive efficiencies into our portfolio on an ongoing basis. So we try and limit our asks for price increases for our customers. But when we look at the increases that we are expecting in the areas I called out, they are high enough where we are going to need to have a discussion with certain customers, and that will be occurring probably over the back half of the year, as we see those costs developing. ","Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","And do the customers, Kevin, come back and initiate pricing discussions on their own? For example, if you are getting raw materials relief, do they ask for -- have they been asking for concessions?","Kevin Berryman","I think as in any buy\/sell relationships, our customers always ask for lower prices. I think that's a continuous kind of process. But certainly, it becomes a little bit more elevated if, in fact, they believe there are input cost reductions that we are able to realize. But I would remind you, though, at the end of the day, the input costs where we are today are still at very extraordinary levels versus historical. And so at the end of the day, we are still underwater in terms of gross margins, just from the input cost increases we saw over the course of 2011 and 2012. We\u2019ve recovered the gross profit, but not the gross margin impact of that. So as we look at these input costs going forward, we\u2019ll be having those targeted discussions with customers.","Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay. And just some final cash flow questions. Buyback activity -- you said that would be up year over year. Could you give a sense of the range there? Is it still going to be targeted towards primarily offsetting options creep? And the CapEx was up 13% year over year. What's your expected spending for 2014?","Kevin Berryman","Sure. Our expected spend is consistent with the message that we have been delivering over the last actual few years. We will be in the neighborhood of 4.5%, so between 4% and 5% of sales. And I would say probably closer to 4.5%, kind of in the middle of that range in terms of CapEx. In terms of the share buyback, certainly at current share price levels, I would say it will be slightly above the amount of the share buyback that we had last year. But certainly, that's dependent upon what's happened on the share price going forward. If we see significant increases, we\u2019ll probably be buying a little bit less. And if we see significant decreases, we\u2019ll be buying more.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Doug Tough","Thank you very much for everyone's participation on today's call, and we look forward to talking to you again in early August, when we have our Q2 results.

You may begin.","Michael DeVeau - Vice President-Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to IFF's first quarter 2015 conference call. Earlier today, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements.","During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the second quarter and full year of 2015.

We will start with prepared remarks from Andreas and Rich, and then the entire team will be available for questions that you may have.","With that, I would like now to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Michael. And good morning, good afternoon to everyone. I would like to start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter. Then Rich will review our consolidated financial results in greater detail, and turn the call back over to me for comments on the balance of the year and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions.","We are pleased with our operational performance in quarter one. On a currency-neutral basis, we delivered mid-single digit sales growth and double-digit increases in both adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. At the same time, we continue to invest in the business to support our strategic goals by bolstering our Flavors business with the acquisition of Ottens Flavors, the opening of the new sales and creative facility in Chicago, and the expansion of our creative center in South Africa.","Currency neutral sales this quarter grew 6% on a consolidated basis, primarily driven by new win performance across both businesses. Currency neutral sales to the emerging markets, which now represent 51% of total company sales, grew 9%, twice of the rate of sales of the developed markets, which grew 4%.","Adjusted operating profit grew 10% on a currency neutral basis to $163 million, and adjusted operating profit margin was 21%. This improvement was driven by strong sales growth, combined with manufacturing and RSA cost leverage.","From a currency neutral adjusted EPS perspective, we also benefited from a lower adjusted effective tax rate, interest expense and shares outstanding. The net result drove a 13% improvement in adjusted EPS, on a currency neutral basis, to $1.45 per share in the quarter.","In Fragrances, currency neutral sales grew 5% in quarter one, as most regions delivered mid to high and single-digit growth. In the emerging markets, our Fragrance Compounds business, which includes Consumer Fragrances and Fine Fragrances, grew 8% while the developed market grew by 4%.","On a category basis, Consumer Fragrances continued to be our strongest performer, growing 9%, as Fabric Care and Home Care grew strong double-digits. EAME and Latin America both grew high single-digits, followed by mid single-digits in North America and Greater Asia. It should be noted that this marks the 14th consecutive quarter of Consumer Fragrances growth.","Fine Fragrances currency neutral sales declined by 2% against a very strong 10% growth reported in the year-ago period. Our double-digit performance in Greater Asia was more than offset by softness in North America and EAME, both of which compared to a strong double-digit growth in the prior-year period. If you recall, our quarter one performance was our strongest of 2014, as it benefited from a customer pre-building inventory before implementing SAP.","In Fragrance Ingredients, currency neutral sales declined 2%, as it compared to their strongest year-over-year comparison. From a profitability perspective, Fragrances segment profit decreased 6% to $82 million, and segment profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 20.5% as the unfavorable net impact of price to input cost and currency pressures more than offset productivity and cost control initiatives.","Turning to Flavors. For 41 consecutive quarters, Flavors reported positive currency neutral sales growth, increasing 9% in the first quarter. While overall market performance was driven by double-digit growth in the emerging markets, the developed markets also posted gains, increasing 7% year-over-year.","On a category basis, the strong trends we saw last quarter continued, as Beverages grew double-digits with broad-based growth across all regions. This strong performance was a result of our creative team's ability to provide innovative solutions that are satisfying consumer desires for healthier products.","It also should be noted that all other regions within our Flavors business achieved solid growth, led by high single-digit increase in Dairy and mid single-digit increase in Sweet and Savory.","From a regional perspective, Greater Asia posted 4% currency neutral sales growth, led by a double-digit improvement in Beverages and a high single-digit increase in Savory. Southeast Asia, India and Japan, all reported growth, while China continued to be soft.","In EAME, currency neutral sales growth was strong, increasing 9%. Results were driven by strong double-digit growth in Beverage and high single-digit increase in Sweet, all a result of new win performance.","In North America, conditions continue to improve relative to the middle of 2014, growing a robust 10% year-over-year in quarter one. This improvement can primarily be attributed to a strong double-digit growth in Dairy, Sweet and Beverage, all of which were a result of strong innovations and our recent investments to drive consumer intimacy in this key market.","For the sixth consecutive quarter, Latin America grew double-digit, up 21% on a currency neutral basis. This performance continues to be driven by innovation, in particular our successful proprietary delivery system.","From a profitability perspective, Flavors segment profit increased 5% to $93 million in quarter one. Segment profit margin improved 60 basis points to 24.6% from 24% in the prior year quarter, as top line growth, mix benefits, productivity and cost control initiatives more than offset currency pressure.","Before turning the call over to Rich, I wanted to provide some commentary on our recent acquisition of Ottens Flavors. For those of you who have not heard of Ottens, they were a privately held company headquartered in Philadelphia, with approximately $60 million in annual sales and 170 employees. They are all well known for their diverse flavor technologies, strong talent base and long-term reputation for high-quality customer service.","IFF and Ottens Flavors share rich histories, world-class and complementary R&D capabilities, and a strong commitment to innovative quality products, with a keen focus on the customer. The deal will strengthen our operations in North America, improving our market share in this key developed market and increase our ability to meet the needs of our customers, especially the faster-growing strategic accounts. The impact of this transaction is not included in our guidance for 2015.","With that, I would like to now introduce Rich.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Andreas. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Net sales in the first quarter were up 6% on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in both EAME and Greater Asia. Overall, performance was driven by new wins across both businesses and lower volume erosion on existing business, mainly in our Flavors business.","While currency neutral sales were strong, net sales on a reported basis rose 1%, reflecting a strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus most global currencies. Adjusted gross profit margin remained constant at 44.7%, as sales growth, cost savings initiative and mix benefits were offset by an unfavorable net impact of price to input costs and foreign exchange headwinds.","Our adjusted operating profit grew $4 million, or 2%, to $163 million, and adjusted operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 21%, driven by sales growth and expense leverage that more than offset currency headwinds.","Adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% to $1.45, driven by improvements in adjusted operating profit, foreign exchange gains on working capital and other income, a lower adjusted effective tax rate and interest expense, as well as reduced shares outstanding.","As I did on our Q4 earnings call, I wanted to show the two-year average currency neutral sales growth chart by quarter to highlight the underlying trend. As you can see, in Q1, currency neutral sales continued to grow at the upper end of our long-term guidance range, increasing 6% on a two-year average basis. Relative to the market, we believe we are outperforming, which is indicative of market share gains.","We continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of end use product categories with strong growth in Flavors and Consumer Fragrances, and in geographies with growth in three of four regions.","Adjusted RSA expenses, as a percent of sales, declined 20 basis points from 24% to 23.8%. The year-over-year decline was driven by cost control initiatives, and a favorable impact from currency, which was partially offset by higher amortization and incentive compensation expense. Maintaining cost discipline and implementing process improvements remain a priority, and by doing so allows us to reinvest into R&D and commercial resources to drive longer term growth. In Q1, R&D as a percentage of sales remained within our 8% to 9% range, at 8.2% of sales.","From a currency perspective, Q1 was challenging as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many global currencies. We have a natural hedge, given our considerable operations in Europe, along with pricing mechanism in most emerging markets. In addition, we proactively hedge our net euro exposure to raw material purchases. However, the recent volatility in exchange rates negatively impacted our results. In particular, the weakening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our largest currency exposure, had the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies, such as the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound and Japanese yen, weakened versus the U.S. dollar, further pressuring Q1 results.","We did experience a modest gain from our transactional euro hedging program. However, the benefits of this program are more back-half-weighted based on the phasing of the program this year. As a result, foreign exchange movements in Q1 had a five percentage point impact on top line compared to a seven percentage point impact on adjusted operating profit and three percentage point impact on adjusted EPS.","For the full year 2015, we remain approximately 70% hedged on our euro exposure at a rate close to the full year average of 2014. And while this significantly reduces our exposure in 2015, based on the April rate of $1.08, we believe it will have approximately seven percentage point impact on sales and approximately four percentage points to five percentage points impact on operating profit. This impact is included in our full-year guidance, which Andreas will speak about momentarily.","Our operating cash flow in the first quarter was $31 million, compared to $35 million in the prior-year period. Improvements in net income and inventory during the quarter, as well as lower incentive compensation payouts, were more than offset by a $50 million incremental pension contribution, which strengthened the funded status of our largest plans.","Our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales, as our five-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q1 was down 70 basis points to approximately 29.1% of our trailing 12-month sales. From a capital structure standpoint, we expect to spend between 4% and 4.5% of sales in 2015 on growth and infrastructure initiatives, specifically our new plants in Turkey and Indonesia. After this year, we expect capital spending to begin to revert back to more normalized levels at 3% to 3.5% of sales for this foreseeable future.","Regarding cash returned to shareholders in the first quarter, we've spent about approximately $38 million on dividend payouts and $11 million on share repurchases.","With that, I'll now turn the call back to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rich. Looking to the balance of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. On a currency neutral basis, we expect all of our key financial metrics, sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS to be in line with our long-term targets. Yet, if global currencies remain where they were in April for the balance of the year, we expect adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS to grow low to mid single-digits, including the impact of currency as well initiating investments in R&D and commercial resources based on our new strategy to drive long-term growth, which will be communicated in June.","For second quarter of 2015, we expect currency neutral sales trends in Flavors to continue, albeit at a level more in line with our long-term target range. In Fragrances, we expect momentum to improve in our Fine business and continue to see good growth in Consumer Fragrances. And while we expect to see improved volume trends in Ingredients over the course of the year, we still expect year-over-year declines in the second quarter. From a profitability perspective, we expect currency to remain a significant headwind in quarter two, which will pressure our reported results.","In summary, we have started the year well, as we have achieved all our key financial objectives on a currency neutral basis, while simultaneously investing for the future growth of our business. In addition, with the acquisition of Ottens Flavors, the new site in Chicago and the renovation of South Africa, we continue to reinvest in R&D and commercial initiatives to build competitive advantage longer term.","Diversity is not only a strength of IFF, it is a source of our stability. It begins in the way we operate, what we offer and where, and extends to consumers around the world who have made our customers' products part of their everyday lives. This unique profile provides us with the confidence that we should be able to deliver financial results in line with our long-term targets on a currency neutral basis.","Before I open it up to questions, I want to take a moment to explain how excited I am about the opportunity to unveil and discuss our refreshed strategy with you on June 2 at our Investor Day here in New York City. It will be a great chance for us to share our 2020 aspirations and speak to the opportunities where we can further differentiate ourselves from the competition and provide innovative solutions for our customers to win in the marketplace.","For those interested in attending, I ask that you reach out to Michael to register for the event. My hope is that you will not only have a chance to hear Vision 2020, but also provide you with an opportunity to experience some of our excellent R&D capabilities.","With that, we are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I wanted to ask about the FX impact to your expectations for the year. So the last time you had talked publicly about numbers, it was mid-to-late March, and now current FX rates are what they are, which is to say actually slightly improved relative to then. So could you talk a bit about sort of the dynamics at play between then and now to the impact that seems to be more significant than previously expected, and specifically talk to anything underlying that within the actual operating results in the business getting worse that would contribute to that?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Rich?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Yeah, Mark, when we talked in March, at that point in time we were probably in a $1.10, $1.12 range \u2013 $1.12 or $1.15 range based on the forecast at that point in time. As we indicated in the call, the current outlook is based on a euro rate, based on the April forecast and the April period in time which is about $1.08. So there is a bit of a strengthening.","As you said, since the beginning of May, the euro has recovered a bit. That has not been reflected yet in our outlook, in the guidance that we just gave. The underlying fundamentals have not changed significantly in terms of where we are across the business. There can be some mixed impacts country by country. Also, the phasing of the \u2013 as I mentioned in the call, the phasing of the hedging contracts are more back-end weighted, and so that's why you're going to see more pressure in the first quarter and the second quarter.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay. And switching to specific geographies, what's causing the weakness in recent quarters in China and what are your thoughts on when and how it can look as we go through this year? Could it improve or what's sort of the impact there?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Mark, I'll give this to Matthias.","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Thank you, Mark. Well, in China, in line with what we hear from our own customers, we are positively optimistic. We see particularly larger accounts being softer in the overall performance. We see, however, also greater opportunities with smaller sized companies. As you know, we have expanded our footprint in China. We are now closer to smaller sized companies as well, and we are positively optimistic for the remainder of the year.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So maybe just broadly on China then, cautiously optimistic, what is the base that you're coming from? I guess, without a comment specifically on a country if you don't want to, it seems to me at least that sales may have declined in recent quarters. Is that a fair assumption? And then as you say cautiously optimistic, does that mean for a slight positive growth?","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Yes, for a slight positive growth, Mark. In China, we did not experience quarter-over-quarter declines, with the exception of what we had in Q1, but it was a very modest decline. We also had some discontinued business, which we have started in Q4 last year as we had some business which cost (22:36) very profitable, but we are not going to report it separately.","Overall, again, we remain positive. We have some challenges, and I think we are in line with probably what you will hear from our customers across the categories as well.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","Hi, Mark. It's Nicolas. Regarding Fragrances, very solid performance in Q1 for China, and we remain also cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the year, with good performance with global \u2013 regional and global accounts.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay?","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yep. Great. Thank you, guys.","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Lauren.","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","First, I just wanted to know, in the Q, I noticed there was a mention of extra selling days in the quarter. So did that have any kind of financial impact on the local currency sales growth reported?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Lauren. It had, I'll call it, a modest impact. The estimate is probably about a point impact in growth on the quarter.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then if I hear correctly that the Ottens Flavors is not included in the outlook right now?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Correct. It's not in the outlook.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So 4% to 6% top line is ex Ottens?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Ex Ottens.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then Latin America on Beverages, I know you had broad-based strength everywhere in Beverages, but that was the one market where you mentioned proprietary delivery systems. So I was just wondering if some of the wins you've had in Latin America, if that's reflected globally yet with those proprietary systems or if that's still isolated to Latin America, and should we think about that materializing this year if it's something that would come further out?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Matthias?","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Thank you, Lauren. Well, in Latin America, it was one of the first regions where we deployed our new technology. That's why also we had a much stronger growth performance versus other regions. We are seeing good traction in other regions as well. In Latin America, it's mainly for Beverages, but the technology as such is also very impactful when it comes to other categories such as gums, for example, where customers constantly are looking for differentiation, but also in Savory. We are very positive that we will see a good traction going forward also in other regions, though I have to say, even the last few quarters, the impact of new wins through this technology is material.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just in that Latin America business in particular, was there any kind of pipeline fill, like that up 21% -- would you expect that moderates from here, that there was just some initial stocking on that (25:48).","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","I think it will moderate, but it's not a pipeline filling; it's just a lot of new wins which we had. Unfortunately, I'm not expecting the very same growth dynamics of 20% for the quarters to come. But frankly, while still early in the quarter, we also expect a very solid momentum in Q2 going forward in Latin America.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just one last thing, if I may, on the guidance. Where I'm a little bit confused on including FX is that at least my recollection is that previous guidance was for 7% to 9% operating profit growth, emphasizing the low end of the range, but that included a 4% headwind from currency. So you said it was only 4% to 5% from currency, so it's one point worse, but I don't know why low single digits would be on the table for EBIT growth unless there's something I'm missing.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Lauren; you're right. I mean it's probably somewhere between a point \u2013 it's probably 1.5 point additional currency headwind based on the current outlook. As Andreas already talked about, reflected the outlook is initiating some of the investments that we've identified to drive long-term growth associated with the strategy. That's now been incorporated into the forecast that was not in the outlook at the beginning of the year as the work had not been identified yet. And I think the other part of it is that we're being, I'm going to say, cautious about some of the pressures that we're seeing in terms of price and input costs, particularly on the Fragrance business, as well as Fragrance Ingredients top line and a little bit of pressure on Fine Fragrances. And so there's a mix impact there also.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good. Good morning.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Silke.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So the Ottens acquisition closed in May. And as the average operating margin is similar to what IFF reports, like it should contribute like a $0.05 to your earnings this year. Is that the way you see it?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","No. Silke, you also have to remember that we have to look at it on our basis and, basically, the purchase accounting related to the price we paid for it. So there's step-up in the assets and then there's amortization related to that. So I think the impact \u2013 we believe that the impact \u2013 we still have to finish that assessment -- but we think the impact from an operating profit standpoint will be a modest impact.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","A modest impact. Okay. In terms of the negative price raw material issue, is the issue that the raw material cost curve is sort of flattish and your prices are down? Like I'd be surprised if your raw materials are up.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","As we talked about on the last call, where we're seeing the greatest amount of pressure is on the naturals in both businesses and then there's things like patchouli. But the biggest part of our portfolio are the natural ingredients. And that's where we're seeing upward price pressure, particularly in the Fragrance business, and that's more than offsetting any potential benefit we see down the road from oil-related derivatives.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Are your pricing trends generally flattish?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","There's some pressure on the Ingredients business, on the commodity end of the business. So it was not significant, but was down slightly in the quarter.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I guess I have two last questions. So do you expect the Fine Fragrance business to be up year-over-year on a neutral currency base for 2015? And secondly, I was wondering whether \u2013 what your share repurchase goals are for the year. Thank you very much.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Nicolas?","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","Hi, Silke. It's Nicolas. As you remember in Q1 last year, we came out at a very, very strong Q1 performance of 10%, and it was our very strong year-ago performance, especially in Europe of 19% and 29% in North America. So, Q1 faces a tough comparison. Moving forward, we expect momentum to improve in our Fine business.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Michael DeVeau - Vice President-Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Silke, I think there was one more question you had.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. And I was wondering whether you \u2013 what your share repurchase goals were for the year?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","We repurchased \u2013 as I said, we repurchased about $11 million in the first quarter. Our authorization at this point is based on a share price value matrix. And so for the time being, I would expect that that rate would continue given the current price levels or we expect that to continue certainly into the second quarter. We do our annual capital structure review with the board mid-year. But at this point, I would count on a similar rate than what we saw in the first quarter.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much. I'll get back into queue.","Operator","And your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about Fragrance margins. So I think there might be two dynamics at play, one is sort of the weaker Fine Fragrance performance, and then some of it might be ingredients. So I was wondering if there is a way to quantify how much was the impact from both of those factors, and then if there's anything else at play? And then how we should view Fragrance margins sort of going forward through the rest of the year?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","I think, Faiza to your point, I think the year-over-year performance for Fragrance is there's certainly an impact on the Fine Fragrance side from a mix standpoint. We had very, very strong growth in the year-ago quarter versus negative growth in the current quarter. So that's \u2013 I'd say that's probably the biggest impact of it. Second is, as I mentioned earlier, there is pricing input cost pressures which had a negative impact in the quarter. Those are probably the two biggest drivers of year-over-year margins.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So as Fine Fragrance performance improved through the rest of the year, we should see margins improve also?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think you also have different comparables in the second \u2013 for the balance of the year last year, some of that will spin to offset each other going forward.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then...","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","(33:06)","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then, I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the increased investments that you mentioned in R&D. So should we expect the R&D ratio to be above the 9% range for the year or if you could just expand a little bit more on that?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. Faiza, this is Andreas speaking. No, we \u2013 you should not expect that because it's early days of our, let's say, implementing some of the steps for our refreshed strategy and it will certainly not go above 9%, that's very clear. But we do a couple of strategic hires for the programs we have selected and that's what we will present second of June to you, but it's not that this is crazy for the rest of the year.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","And part of it also, Faiza, is on the commercial side also. It's both commercial and R&D resources.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just one last question, if you could just talk about currency impact for 2016, I know you told us before how much you were hedged and at what rate for 2016. So, I wonder if there's an update on that.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","At this point, where we are \u2013 our hedge program has obviously extended forward from where we talked about earlier in the year. Right now, we're about 40% hedged for all of 2016 at a rate a little bit above $1.10.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Faiza, it's so volatile at the moment, the whole market that I think it would be a bit early to talk already about 2016. But let's talk about it when we are later in the year and we know a bit more when particularly the euro will develop.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. My one question is you called out some strength in the Beverages business. And it's \u2013 I guess I know there's some new technology at play, but I kind of wanted to parse how much was that and how much was maybe other technology or innovation versus sort of the base business in your global Beverages business within Flavors? Thanks.","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Good morning. This is Matthias speaking. Well, I cannot give you an exact rate, but I can tell you that majority of new wins are the results of health and wellness solutions. We have fantastic proprietary tools, which help taste \u2013 calories-reduced beverages taste better and we constantly make progress. It's not like we have few molecules and we only deploy them and we rely on the success of few of them.","Over the last few months and quarters, the teams have made significant progress to come up with additional new solutions. And frankly, we feel really excited. So, first of all, the opportunities which we have; second also on the success rate; and third, on partnering much closer with our customers together.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Got you. Thanks very much.","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","You're welcome.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Roberts of UBS.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","The decline in the North American Ingredients business, is that sales out of the U.S. or sales into the U.S. that declined? I should know that, but it's a simple question. And how much of the decline is, you're using more ingredients internally, or is the decline really all external market?","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","Hi, John. It's Nicolas. It's purely external sales and here it's very much targeted towards one specific segment of the market. So, we had some visibility into it and what we decided is not to participate in some lower margin business. And as you know, we have been rationalizing both our portfolio and our footprint in Ingredients, especially in North America. You remember that we had closed our manufacturing unit of August last year because we knew that we will be facing some pressure. So, it was a decision for us not to participate in some specific contracts.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","And, John, from a definitional standpoint, it's sales in the U.S. market, not exports from the U.S. market.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And I thought we were largely through that, so we'll have this comp issue now for another three quarters, sort of?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","For the year, you will see some pressure in North America for Ingredients and then that will be a new base for the future.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And you have a follow-up question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, again. Which quarter will be impacted by the extra selling days this year to offset the first quarter benefit?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Fourth quarter, Mark.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, it's similar expected impact, roughly 1%?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think, yes. I mean, that's the best way to think about it.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then Andreas, not to steal your thunder from the strategic refresh event in a month, but I guess you just need to think about FX being incrementally worse than where you were when you joined the company and then now to use incremental investments as it relates to refresh. Should we be thinking that there will be some offsets to come in terms of efficiency programs and like to basically be able to redeploy some of that?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mark, good question. We certainly look what can we do to fund the journey internally so that we reallocate some of our resources towards our new programs. And that's what we are doing. Secondly, we certainly look at, let's say, our footprint. And we already have, I would say, a pretty good natural hedge, but we have to look into it whether we can do some of these programs in areas where we have at the moment a euro exposure, like in Europe. And as you well know, we have around about one-third of our employee base in Europe anyway. So that's certainly in the cards to look into it, how we do it in the most efficient and effective way for us. So these are the things we are looking into.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. The last question comes from the line of Curt Siegmeyer with KeyBanc Capital.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Morning.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, just a couple more on the Fragrance side. You mentioned \u2013 I thought that you do expect a little bit of improvement on the Fine Fragrances piece of the business. Is there anything, I guess, a little bit more tangible or is it just more a function of easier comps as we move through the year?","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","I think it was easier comp. I mean, if you look at the growth of 10% last year in Q1, you know very well that the market did not grow 10%. And that growth really was primarily driven by new wins, but also by a customer pre-building inventory before the implementation of SAP, something that reversed itself over the course of 2014.","So factoring that comparison and looking at the business over a two-year period, performance in Q1 2015 actually accelerated on a two-year average. As such, we will expect our performance to return to growth going forward.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just maybe one more on the margin for the segment as a whole. Are there any other levers you guys can pull? Or if you don't see any raw material relief, if it kind of stays at these levels, should we anticipate margins down year-over-year over the course of 2015? Or you mentioned productivity in sort of other maybe areas where there might be pricing opportunity, I guess. Is there any other levers you guys can pull there to offset some of the raw material pressure?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Curt, I mean, I think there's \u2013 we're always looking at \u2013 I mean, I think the levers that we can pull are looking at the spend and trying to be focused in terms of where that spend occurs and make sure it's focused on driving the business, whether it's on the R&D innovation side or in the commercial side to drive and accelerate the growth.","From a productivity standpoint, we look at opportunities day-to-day in our manufacturing operations, whether it's the capital investments or process improvement, to try to gain some leverage and that's inherent in our model. And so I think those efforts will continue. We may have some pressure near term when you combine currency and in some of these new investments. But long term I think the model still works.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So you think then for the year, is it going to be tough to offset sort of the hole that we're in after the first quarter in terms of keeping that margin flat year-over-year. Would that be too difficult to get back to?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Well, we're flat year-over-year as it is in the first quarter. So I think we've always said, look, we're not going to expect to have kind of margin expansion that we had in prior years, that's not possible. I think we're going to be challenged by some of the mix impacts on the Fragrance business, but I think there are some opportunities that we'll look at, but there is some challenges from a timing standpoint.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Great. Thanks.","Operator","This does conclude. I will now turn the call back to the speakers.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay then, let me conclude the call. So we are pretty pleased with our first quarter performance, very robust in terms of 6%, which is certainly outperforming the market, which we expect 3% growth. We have given you our outlook for the rest of the year, so we expect that in currency-neutral terms, we will stick to our guidance. And we certainly have an opportunity, 2nd of June to update you on our, let's say, five-year strategy for 2020.","Thank you very much for participating.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau","Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's third quarter 2019 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR Web site at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.","Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty.","For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 26, 2019, and our press release all of which are on our Web site.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday and is on our Web site.","With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We'll start with prepared remarks, and then take any questions that you may have.","With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Michael.","On the call today, I would like to provide comments on our third quarter financial results and give an update on our integration progress. Once finished, I will ask Rich to give a more in-depth financial review of our business performance and provide an update on our outlook for the balance of the year. Then, we will take any questions that you may have.","Let me start by saying that positive momentum is building at IFF. In the third quarter, we delivered a sequential improvement in our combined currency neutral top-line growth rate. Scent continued to perform well, growing low digits disclosed in all regions and nearly all categories.","On a standalone basis, Frutarom sales increased 5% including the net contribution of activations and divested businesses. Organically, tastes were flat in the third quarter, a sequential improvement from the second quarter results with an improvement across many subcategories.","In taste, our win rates remain at a high level, however, performance continued to be impacted by volume erosion primarily with multinational customers. It should be noted that on a two-year basis, growth remain solid when we factor in the 7% growth we achieved in the year ago period.","We are pleased to also report a continued improvement in profitability as we drove a 60 basis point improvement and adjusted operating profit margin ex-amortization as we deliver productivity savings in our core business and benefits from an acquisition-related synergies. Our integration efforts, Frutarom are progressing well. Cost synergies continued to be a source of strength as we achieved approximately $30 million for the first nine months of 2019 and now expect to deliver approximately $50 million for the year significantly ahead of all $40 million estimate that we announced last quarter.","We also substantially completed our review of the Russia and Ukraine allegations as well as a second aerial view of Frutarom operations in certain other jurisdictions including those that we deem as high-risk. These reviews supplement our prior global compliance and initiatives that we've conducted subsequent to the closing of the Frutarom transaction. While I will speak in more detail in a moment, I want to state that we have confirmed in this investigation the total affected sales represents less than 1% of IFF and Frutarom combined net sales for 2018. And that the impact of the reviews including the cost associated with them to-date have not been and are not anticipated to be material to IFF's financial conditions or results of operations.","In addition no evidence has been uncovered suggesting that any of these compliance methods had any connections to the United States.","Finally, as we look to the fourth quarter, we have started strong as all three segments grew mid single digits in October as a continuation of this trend, we believe our full year 2019 sales and adjusted EPS excluding amortization will finish in line at the low-end of our previously stated guidance range.","As I reflect on the year in entirety and ignores that many moving parts both good and bad that have occurred, I am pleased to say that we are on pace to deliver solid top and bottom-line results. On a combined company and currency neutral basis, a testament of our industry, our exceptional business and unbelievable employees that make it happen. And as we build it stronger more competitive organization for the future 2019 provides the foundation grounded in resilience that gives us confidence and optimism for a journey ahead.","Now circling back to our third quarter 2019 financial performance, we delivered broad based improvements in sales profitability and cash flow. Our sales totaled approximately $1.3 billion, one of our highest in company history, on a combined basis, we saw a sequential acceleration in currency neutral sales growth as we grew 2% driven by activation and our scent performance. An absolute value, the additional Frutarom provided a very strong benefit to currency neutral adjusted operating profit excluding amortization, which increased 45% over the prior year period. This combined with margin improvement initiatives in acquisition synergies led to a 60 basis point expansion in just operating profit margin excluding amortization.","The net result was a benefit to cash flow generation where we achieved improvements in both operating and free cash flow.","Our integration efforts are well [Technical Difficulty] to deliver against our plan. We are currently strengthening our go-to-market approach with the expansion of our taste point model in key markets around the world as a blueprint for success. Our intent is to continue to serve the fast growing local and regional customers with a differentiated service model built on speed and agility to help them win in their marketplace.","In terms of cross-selling and integrated solutions they have already achieved approximately 14 million run rate sales and have identified greater than 800 projects in the pipeline representing approximately 110 million of sales. And while we are on track to deliver our stated target of 100 million by 2021, we expect that this number will only increase over time as we capitalize on our innovation pipeline, broad category exposure and vast customer base.","We continue to strive towards our ultimate operating model of scent, taste and nutrition and ingredients which will define organization moving forward. Talent and culture within the organization remains paramount as we execute our talent agenda to enhance our high performing corporate culture with extreme accountability, bias for action and effective collaboration.","We also continue to deliver strong cost synergies achieving 30 million through the first nine months based on our progress to-date and our expectation that savings benefits will continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter, we are now forecasting that we will achieve approximately 50 million in cost synergies in the year 2019. In terms of cash flow, our operating cash flow was strong up 181 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the previous year period.","We also improved our net debt to EBITDA ratio from 3.6x in the second quarter to 3.4x. As a reminder, debt repayment continues to be our number one priority in our capital allocation as we progress towards our net debt to EBITDA target of below 3x by the end of 2020.","As I just mentioned, we are further increasing our year one cost synergy target to approximately 50 million. With this, we are not expecting to deliver greater than 60% higher synergies in 2019 against our initial target of $30 million to $35 million. In the areas were we are focusing on our cost energy efforts. We continue to see significant progress against our goals. We are meaningful outpacing our original procurement savings target driven by purchasing power, [indiscernible] and tail spent.","We also have completed the closure of five plants and announced an additional eleven closures via our manufacturing network optimization program. Expanding our focus, we are driving operations, excellence initiatives to generate incremental savings. Some examples include logistics and packaging synergies which will benefit all of our segments.","Assessing what we are today, our team has done a very good work generating incremental savings. Looking at our one 145 million goal, I believe we are on track to over deliver upon this target further supporting the business and driving value for our shareholders.","As a follow-up to our complaints disclosure in the second quarter, I want to take a few moments to provide a more formal update. That's a reminder as disclosed last quarter during integration of Frutarom, we were made aware of allegation that two Frutarom businesses operating principally in Russia and Ukraine made certain improper payments to a number of customers. We are pleased to report that we have now substantially completed a robust review for the Russia and Ukraine allegations, we have substantiated the allegations and have confirmed that key members of Frutarom senior management at the time were aware of such payments.","As a result, we have taken appropriate remedial actions including replacing senior management in relevant locations and believe that such improper customer payments have stopped. We have also conducted robust secondary review of Frutarom's operations in certain other jurisdictions including those that are deemed high risk. These reviews supplement our existing global compliance initiatives that were implemented at Frutarom in connection with the closing of the Frutarom transaction. These secondary reviews were conducted with the assistance of outside legal and accounting firms, including Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Deloitte. These reviews are substantially completed.","Following [indiscernible] review, we confirmed that the total affected sales represents less than 1% of IFF's and Frutarom's combined net sales for 2018. And that the impact of reviews including the costs associated with them to-date have not been and are not anticipated to be material to our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, no evidence has been uncovered suggesting that any of these compliance matters at any connection to the United States.","With that, I would like to turn it over to Rich to take you through our financial performance in more detail.","Richard O'Leary","Thank you, Andreas.","Combined currency neutral sales grew 2 percentage points over the prior year driven by the contribution of acquisitions as well as growth in the scent division and a stabilization at Frutarom. From a profitability perspective, we're also pleased that adjusted operating profit margins excluding amortization improved 60 basis points year-over-year driven an increased emphasis on productivity savings and the benefit of acquisition-related synergies.","From a legacy IFF standpoint, we delivered very strong operating profit leverage with currency neutral adjusted operating profit up 6% and 1% top-line growth. As I have done in the last few quarters, I would also like to highlight the impact of emerging market pricing on our growth rates to better compare with our peers. As a reminder, for a variety of reasons many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, for our indexed hard currencies, when we have to invoice in local market currencies.","When reporting our currency neutral sales growth, we exclude foreign exchange related price changes in emerging markets, but this is different from our peers. We believe our reporting standard provides investor with a truer assessment of underlying currency neutral growth especially when there are large emerging market valuations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to our competition.","During the first nine months of 2019, the stronger USD environment plus significant emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 2% currency impact, if we include emerging market pricing. You can see from the chart that three countries outlined represented less than 10% of scent and taste sales, but have significant devaluation.","Turning to business unit performance for the third quarter, in scent currency neutral sales grew 3% with growth in all regions and nearly all categories. Performance was strongest in fine fragrances strong mid-single digits led by robust growth in EMEA and Greater Asia.","Consumer fragrances grew low-single digits with increases in nearly all categories led by home care, hair care and fabric care. Fragrance ingredients was flat as price increases were offset by volume declines related to supply chain destocking.","Scent currency neutral segment profit was flat as the benefits of productivity initiatives and mix were offset by unfavorable price to input costs. We believe that the timing impact of raw materials between inventory and the P&L that we saw in Q2 reversed in the current quarter.","We are starting to see signs of raw materials easing, but the costs remain elevated given the 20% increases, experienced over the past two years. In taste, third quarter currency neutral sales declined approximately 2% against the very strong growth of 7% in the year ago period.","Growth was strongest in greater Asia with high single-digit growth, contributing to this growth for improvements in key markets such as Indonesia, India and China. However, as expected the volume erosion with multinational customers that we outlined last quarter continued into the third quarter offsetting growth. From a category perspective, it should be noted that performance was strongest in beverage and savory led by new win performance.","Despite a challenging pipeline, taste segment profit grew 4% on a currency neutral basis driven primarily by productivity initiatives and cost management. This focus to over 90 basis point margin improvement year-over-year","Before moving on to Frutarom, I want to share some additional context on taste. The fundamentals of this business remain quite strong. Our project pipeline and win rates are both up about 25% year-over-year. This bodes well for the future. As I just mentioned volume erosion worsened further in Q3 and is now more than 5x our three year average. However, I'm pleased to say that we have already begun to see this inflection in the fourth quarter of 2019 as new win contribution contributions time and volume erosion has begun to normalize.","In the third quarter Frutarom totaled of $364 million. On a standalone basis currency neutral sales increased 5% driven by the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses as organic sales remain constant. Performance was driven by growth in taste and savory both offset by some of the same dynamics that we shared in the second quarter with continued pressures in the F&F ingredients mostly notably citrus sauce and note natural products or solutions particularly raw material -- more material driven price declines in natural colors.","We are seeing growth stabilize in the third quarter and are expecting an improvement in the fourth quarter as we start to lap some of the transitory issues. I'll discuss this in more detail in a moment.","In terms of segment profit, the Frutarom division delivered $828 million and $68 million of profit excluding amortization, third quarter margin profile continues to be strong at 18.7%, if you exclude amortization. Margin continues to be strong driven by cost management and acquisition related synergies.","Turning to cash flow dynamics. Operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2019 was up significant from $202 million last year to $383 million this year. The performance was driven primarily by higher cash earnings, core working capital defined as inventories, accounts payable and accounts payable improved year-over-year with progress in all three metrics. Inventory still remain at elevated levels primarily due to raw material cost increases and safety stocks within the scent division. However, in the third quarter we saw a positive inflection and the levels are continuing to improve.","In the first nine months of 2019 CapEx as a percentage of sales was 4.2% driven by new plant and capacity investments, mainly in [indiscernible] as well as creative centers and integration related investments. For the full year, we continue to believe that CapEx as a percentage of sales will be between 4.5% and 5% of sales. Bringing this all together, we had a strong $123 million increase in free cash flow in the first nine months of 2019.","Before turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, allow me to bridge our expected full year 2019 organic growth to our long-term growth aspiration of 5% to 7%. In '19, we've been impacted by two specific challenges, one in our taste segment and the second in our Frutarom segment.","Starting with our combined organic growth, we expect to finish 2019 at approximately 2% organically. As we communicated throughout the year, we had been impacted by higher than normal volume erosion on our core taste business, particularly with multinational customers. The impact of this on our consolidated growth is approximately a 0.5 on a full year basis.","At Frutarom, the combination of the transitory issues we outlined including citrus source, natural colors, trade and marketing as well as the compliance investigation had approximately 1.5 adverse impact on our top-line growth relative to expectation. If we adjust for these items, our normalized, combined organic growth would be approximately 4% this would be in line with the long-term organic growth guidance we communicated at our Investor Day in June this year. Then, when you layer on approximately a percentage point of cross-selling benefits which we will see a significant ramp up in 2020 and a percentage point from additional M&A, similar to the one percentage point we achieved in 2019 you get to 6% which is the mid-point of our long-term range of 5% to 7%.","Looking at the cadence of our growth in 2019 combined company currency neutral sales, inclusive of M&A has improved sequentially from Q2 to Q3. And while we're early in the fourth quarter, we do expect the improving sales trend to continue up mid-single digits in Q4. As noted by Andreas, the start to Q4 puts us on a trajectory to see this level. We are seeing a strong rebound in taste as volume rose and is normalizing and we are targeting positive growth at Frutarom as we began to lap several of the isolated issues I mentioned a moment ago.","Taking into account our year-to-date performance and if the strong start to Q4 sales trends continue, we expect to be at the low-end of our previous guidance range for sales and adjusted EPS excluding amortization. Delivering upon the low-end of our previous guidance represents very good results in a challenging year with currency neutral sales growth of approximately 3% and adjusted operating profit ex amortization, increasing mid-single digits both on a combined basis. The operating leverage is even more pronounced in the second half, in excess of 3x times.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Rich.","As we look ahead, there are several potential near term catalysts that we believe will provide tailwinds. From a sales perspective, taste volumes are starting to rebound as Rich just mentioned, which we expect to increase mid-single digits in quarter four as destocking ends. In scent, we will capitalize on a 450 million incremental excess via additional three global coreless assuming we only achieve our fair share that can provide a couple of percentage points of growth over the next few years.","And Frutarom we expect to see improving cleanse as Q3 was better than Q2 and Q4 was expected to be better than Q3. Then as we cycle transitory issues which highlighted [indiscernible] to our mid-single digit trend. To compliment this cross selling benefits are expected to trade approximately 100 million by the end of 2021.","From a profitability perspective, we expect to benefit from acquisition related cost synergies. 2019 have already had great success achieving 50 million savings for the full year and expect the incremental benefits, we will be no less than an additional $50 million in 2020 as we are internally targeting more.","At the core, we will also deliver on the 100 million productivity initiatives we outlined at our Investor Day. About one-third will be achieved in 2019, two-thirds coming in 2020 and 2021. And finally, we're starting to see signs of raw material deflation following a 20% increase we experienced over the past two years.","Translating this into go forward financials, we continue to expect to deliver 5% to 7% currency neutral sales growth and a 10% plus in adjusted EPS excluding amortization, including both cross selling benefits and bolt-on acquisitions.","In summary, the third quarter was a quarter of good progress, with positive momentum building. We delivered a sequential improvement in growth and achieved adjusted operating profit margin expansion excluding amortization via synergies, productivity and cost management.","We are confident in our execution of our integration plan and in turn have to live at increased cost synergies in year one. We have started quarter four strong and given this trend, we are reconfirming our full year 2019 financial guidance.","Looking beyond 2019, we have strong value creation opportunities via many near term catalysts. I'll pause forward is clear deliver strong value creation for all of our stakeholders, the growth acceleration, margin expansion and a successful integration.","With that operator, we are now happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Mark Astrachan","Yes. Thanks. Good morning everybody. I guess a few questions. So, maybe just start the commentary about the strong start to the fourth quarter. I guess what gives confidence that you can sustain the improvement through the quarter, last quarter sequentially worsened through the quarter. So what gives confidence that this time is different? And I guess two, if you're talking about October being better, you've got the extra week at the end of the quarter, so then by definition wouldn't the number be materially better for the fourth quarter? I guess maybe, can you reconcile some of that for us, and then, also confirm whether Frutarom is like-for-like in that it's excluding the three days at the beginning of the quarter that weren't in the base.","Andreas Fibig","Okay, Mark. Good morning, first of all. It's Andreas. Let me get started. So from the visit visibility point of view, we have already five weeks, which I think is good. We see what we have in the order book and we have in particular on the taste side, very, very strong win rates. So, these are the things which make us confident for the first quarter. And as you just mentioned, we have the 53rd week as well. So, all-in-all we see good development starting into the first quarter. And in particular we are happy about taste, that we had a couple of quarters which were not going so well. Certainly, again, a very, very strong comparison last year, but that's turning the corner quite rapidly and absolutely in the right direction, but Rich might add to that.","Richard O'Leary","Yes, Mark. I think you are right. If you recall, the comment I made was that as the trend continues through the end of the quarter, we're on target to exceed the mid-single-digit, which includes the 53rd week. So and doing that would enable us to get to the low-end of the guidance.","Mark Astrachan","And on Frutarom piece, so that excluded in the fourth quarter numbers?","Richard O'Leary","It's the standard 445, and excludes the M&A also.","Mark Astrachan","Got it. Okay. And then, thinking about 2020, I realize it's early and you may not want to want to talk about it, but I guess just a couple of puts and takes to it. So, you've got a bunch of headwinds in terms of things that you're lapping, like the extra week, incentive, comp reset, hedge gains FX, et cetera.","So it seemed like, maybe it's a little harder to get to the longer term earnings algorithm for next year, unless sales growth accelerates, I guess a, is that directionally a reasonable way to think about it, and then, b, from a currency neutral sales growth, obviously it's a longer way off. But, directionally, how should we think about the commentary you just gave about the bridge from the 2% fiscal '19 organic to this normalized growth of six next year, which would seem like you need a little bit to go right to get to.","Andreas Fibig","Look, we Mark we have a lot of positives and I actually believe we will start in the next year was quite a bit of tail wind. Let me talk about it. The first one is, is certainly that we see that the tastes volumes are rebounding very, very strongly. So that's one which is really important because it has direct us down in 2019 then we have now these more core lists with our scent business which gives us access to 450 million in incremental sales potential. And we see that we have already won some businesses with these customers this year, which will then materialize next year. So, that's another an important move for more forward. We are lapping some of the Frutarom transitory challenges like citrus source for example.","And then, the brush share case so that that's a good thing as well and thing which talked always to it that we can see a good mid single digit gross for the assets from mid, mid of next year. So that's good. And what we do makes me very optimistic is that we see the first nice cross-selling wins. We have this as an extra budget line in. We have a very, very strong pipeline of more than 800 projects already, which is really, really, really good. And on top of it, if you take a very close look to the cost synergies, we are very happy what the organization has delivered this year in particular on procurement savings because procurement is so important because it doesn't distract the organization from anything. And we're delivering all cost savings in general this year of 50 million, which is way above what we had expected and we call this at tailwind into 2020 as well.","Then the usual core productivity programs which are running. And then, we see some tailwind on the [indiscernible] as well. So that's, I think these are a lot of very strong positive scoring are going forward. Certainly hedging in FX might be a bit of a headwind, but it all depends on the currencies develops, but Rich, you might comment on that.","Richard O'Leary","Yes. Look, I think Mark, there are -- as you said, I think when you look at absolute year-over-year, there's going to be some headwinds from currency. We don't have the 53rd week. So that could be, 50, 60 basis point headwind year-over-year. We do get the benefits from cross-selling. I think the fundamentals are strong and I think that's what we feel good about. As I said and as Andreas mentioned, is how I said on the last call. I think it's going to be more towards the middle of next year when we lap some of these transitory issues. So I'm not ready to say we're going to get to the 60% next year because I think we have clearly some transitory issues we have to work through. But the foundation solid and I do think the long-term, our beliefs are that the long-term growth potential is there and that view hasn't changed.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Thank you. I'm looking at slide 15, in the 1.5% sales headwind from transitory issues in Frutarom, I think that's about 20 million or that would've been about a 5% sales headwind to the Frutarom segment sales. So, as a way to think about this is an underlying business trends for Frutarom, excluding these headwinds is mid single digit currently. And do we get that that should accelerate to be above the corporate average sale? Are you still consider Frutarom to be one of the highest growth longer term segments in the company?","Richard O'Leary","Yes, John. I think it's, look at, you look at the underlying mix of businesses and the categories. That's the right way to think about it that it's an above average grower. Once we cycle through that those transitory issues, some of which will continue into next year. But yes, that's, that's consistent with our view.","Andreas Fibig","We have seen a couple of these segments within the legacy Frutarom business like inclusions where we have good double-digit growth and we believe that this will continue going forward.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Mike Sison","Hey guys. Nice quarter. In terms of the Frutarom effect on earnings, that it was 1.5% hit on sales. What was the hit on earnings or EPS, which, where do I look at it? And does that come back with higher leverage, longer term? Is that you got more cost savings and synergy to support that growth?","Richard O'Leary","Yes. From an overall profitability standpoint, if you include the synergies, it's not a hit, right? I mean from an exclusive of the borrowing cost and the cost of capital. But from a growth standpoint, we move forward some of these businesses that we're cycling through that we've talked about in the past, citrus source, the trade and marketing, some of the compliance related stuff, our lower margin is lower than average margin profiles compared to the overall Frutarom level. So, so as we've cycled that, there's a -- actually a favorable pickup going forward. So I think, overall, it's not that much of a drag in terms of from a P&L standpoint. Great. Thank you.","Mike Sison","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks. Good morning. So, I noticed in the Q, you talked about raw material headwinds persisting for the next two quarters. I think even partially offset by cost savings. So does that imply that margins will be under pressure for the next two quarters 4Q and 1Q?","Richard O'Leary","I think for me, Lauren, we have to think about is that they're still at elevated levels. I mean, I think we're starting to see some signs of stabilization. As I look at sort of the net of input cost to raw material -- pricing of raw material costs, they were definitely a negative for the first half of the year. Q3 were basically breakeven and I expect it to be slightly favorable in Q4.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. And what helps us as well as that Nicholas and his business unit have done a good job to keep let's say take some structural cost outs to be very competitive in this field and that's helping here as well.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great. And then, Rich, it wasn't in the Q, what was the incentive comp tailwind for the quarter because that'll help off with modeling next year.","Richard O'Leary","Between $5 million and $10 million.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. All right, great. And then, if you can talk also just North America taste point, I was just curious kind of your thoughts on why that business has slowed because I felt like that was sort of an advantageous model you'd put together. And so any commentary you can offer would be really helpful.","Andreas Fibig","Yes, absolutely. And that's a very, very good point. We have seen it in that very quarter, but it's already rebounding strongly in the fourth quarter. I would say it's a transitory topic for the quarter driven by vanilla in a sense that some of the customers went from a natural vanilla to more the one and the synthetic solutions, which is good from a profitability point of view, but not so good from the sales point of point of view. And we see now a good start into the quarter. So I would not interpret too much into it. The concept stays and the concept survives. So, we are doing very well here..","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Gunther Zechmann","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a few to run through please. The overall synergies with Frutarom, you kept unchanged a hundred million revenues of a three years, 145 million cost synergies. You speak very confidently about achieving or overachieving those targets. What makes you hold on to the numbers that you originally came with then? Or what would trigger you to actually raise the synergy target? That's number one.","The second one is on the mid-single-digit growth that you've seen in October. Just wanted to clarify that this is local currency sales growth rather than organic. And is a drive that in Q4 you should have just about over percentage planned of consolidation gains on the revenue line as well. And then within my one question, very briefly, it just CapEx 2020, what should we expect? Thanks.","Richard O'Leary","Let me just make sure I get the three different items in the question, Gunther. So, first let me start with October. It is currency neutral organic growth, so it excludes the M&A and that's the results through the first five weeks of Q4. In terms of CapEx next year, I would expect this to be around 4.5% plus or minus, we're still working through that, but it's the peak year in terms of '19 to '20 as we've talked about. We're finishing up a couple of the key investments in Asia, India and Indonesia. We've got the probably the peak of the integration CapEx. And then, from there we all move down pretty quickly into 2021 going forward along the lines of the 3.5% that I've talked about previously.","In terms of the synergy guidance, just keep in mind, where are we seeing the traction and where we've -- over-delivered in 2019 is really on the procurement side. I think we're very, very confident in our ability to deliver that. Obviously that, plateaus and I think we still have a lot of work to be done next year, particularly around the footprint and the site integration work. So it's a little bit early for me to raise the target from the 145, as I said in my comments, I think it puts us on a trajectory to do that, but I'm not ready to declare victory.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Faiza Alwy","Yes. Hi. Good morning. So a couple of questions. I guess, first, if I look at some of your competitors and how they're doing, it seems to me that they haven't seen the type of volume erosion that you have this year and accepting that there seems to be a turn in October, but I wanted to see if you had any thoughts on why that is. And what can you do to align yourselves more with those that are winning?","Richard O'Leary","No. I think from a big picture standpoint, we're on all the core list that we want to be on. And where it makes sense is to be on it beyond the coreless from an, from an economic standpoint. Certain of our customers are not performing as well. When you look at a two-year trend, for the first nine months of the year you adjust for the peer-based currency dynamic. We're very close to our largest competitor. So, I think we don't believe that we are fundamentally losing share and that we're performing well in the market and once we pass the transitory issue.","So, I think we're the best thing we're doing and we're focused on, is actually carrying on our plan. Andreas has talked about the opportunity we have going forward on the scent side in terms of nearly $450 million in core lists access, as, we progressed on that that provides real upside to the scent business. I talked about some of the commentary around. On the legacy taste business about the order book and win rates being up significantly year-over-year, that bodes well for the future. So, I don't know if there's -- look, we have to execute and battle every day and we compete every day. And that's what we're focused on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Yes. Good morning everyone. I was hoping you could provide us a little bit more color on the taste kind of growth outlook and the confidence you just have there about that kind of returning in 2020 just given the performance this year, just you really think it's concentrated with the multinational customers and just categories where you feel your win-win. Win rates with suggested accelerations in the offing. Thanks.","Andreas Fibig","That's absolutely, look, listen, we will see the turnaround already in the fourth quarter. What we have seen in the first five weeks and what is in the order book looks, looks very, very strong and usually the business goes a little bit in [waves here] [ph] and we are not on the upswing right now. We see a good demand in many areas in particular in very innovative areas. We see it in, in the plant based proteins for example, which is becoming a really important driver of the business. We see that we have more of these solutions available. So the portfolio we inherited through Frutarom, which is helping as well. Some of it will be accounted in the cross selling and total solution space. So, we are actually very optimistic that this is going in the right direction and the team is thriving.","And what I just said for taste point is actually important as well because certainly the last quarter was not great for taste point, but we are seeing a good rebounding on this one with many of our core call customers and we see in particular also a good winning on the beverage side, which is very helpful. So all in all, all the signs are very, very positive on that business. And I think that the team is fairly optimistic and motivated for the next couple of quarters.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Unidentified Speaker","Good morning. It's [indiscernible] for Jeff. How are you? Hi. I have a on your productivity initiatives outside of Frutarom. Can you talk about like where you stand so far, so I think what you've announced is that you've picked like a $40 million charge in there, 190 positions to be eliminated and maybe like a total cost will be 20 million. So, there's some to go. So, where are you in terms of the program and what do you think the savings might be that you'll see from this year and next year?","Richard O'Leary","Yes. So I mean, it's, I would say we're on track to deliver the a hundred million that we've talked about remember there's different components of it. A big part of it is in the scent business, on the cost transformation line -- that part of it is in the early stages now. What you're seeing some of the charges for relate to on the scent side, the overhead, the realignment of the business, finance transformation is some what we're going through now. I think we're going to basically deliver probably a little less than a third this year and then the remaining two-thirds equally over 2020 and 2021.","Andreas Fibig","What is really exciting on this area as well as that the reason why we spent good amount of CapEx, this year is to modernize much of our manufacturing footprint where a lot of more OpEx and AI goes in, which will help us in the mid and long-term to a very competitive manufacturing costs in place. And that's helping as well. And that's what Rich said, because we have to finish up a couple of projects in Asia, which will have, we are just building the most modern and biggest flavors and fragrance manufacturing plant in India. We're doing something in China and in Indonesia. And also with the optimization of the footprint we bring in a lot of technology which will help us to come to a very, very competitive manufacturing costs.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane. Please go ahead.","Heidi Vesterinen","Hi. Good morning. So, you had a new comment in the 10-Q highlighting potential risk of a goodwill impairment. What was your rationale for adding that comment this quarter and are you prepared to roll out impairments at this stage given the underperformance?","Richard O'Leary","Heidi, look as we go through the normal process at the end of the year, it's a required update in the disclosure. Look, at this point I consider it unlikely that we'll have impairment. And as I said earlier, we haven't changed our change, our view on the long-term impacts and potential of this business. So, I consider it unlikely.","Heidi Vesterinen","And then, if I could ask another one, another question from the 10-Q. So, you've also announced you've entered into a new factoring agreement. What explains the rationale for this and does this in parts, explain your confidence over cash flows?","Richard O'Leary","Yes. I think it's consistent with our plan. To me, I look at it as it helps us accelerate the de-leveraging plan the cost of capital to do the factoring on a short-term borrowing rates versus our long-term cost of capital rates. It's an attractive trade-off. And so, we're being opportunistic about that aspect.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks very much. Just let me start with a detailed, when you talked about acceleration in Frutarom for the first few weeks of October, can you confront that means it's growing organically, not just by acquisition, but growing organically where it was flat I think last quarter. Thank you. That's quick related\u2026","How would roughly flat organic for last quarter have compared with your original plans when you laid out the 145 million synergy target? And I guess related to that and finally if there were any kind of, you've emphasized procurement as the main source of synergies and that makes a lot of sense, but is there any rationalization going on here in Frutarom that is effecting the growth rate where you're going in and getting rid of unprofitable or tail business and that's maybe slowing the business down versus what the kind of organic growth rates but the deal?","Richard O'Leary","No, John, I mean, you know, I think there's a couple of different pieces there. I think when you ask where the growth rates were and Q3 being flat versus our expectations obviously is below where we wanted it to be and where we expected to be. It's driven by some of the transitory issues that I talked about previously in terms of colors issue and in [NPS] [ph], the trade and marketing the citrus source businesses.","So, if I look at the core taste part of the business as you call on a Q2 call, we talked about a very challenging June in the taste business, particularly in Europe. Some of that continued into Q3, but again, we've seen a good start to Q4 and than certainly higher where we saw in Q3 all for four regions in the taste of Frutarom as well as for the savory business. And that's why I think ultimately, we have the confidence in the structural capability of that business.","In terms of impacts related to integration, the reason why we're highlighting the procurement savings is that's really what's accelerating and what's changed. The biggest driver or difference in terms of our expected synergies -- that started the year at 30 to 35 and where we are now in 50. We're making -- we are on target and we are making good progress against the site rationalization you saw on -- I think it was Andreas' comments when we talked about the number of closes we've announced. So far and completed in the second half of this year. That will accelerate into 2020 and that's a big part of the driver of the increased synergies year-over-year between '19 and '20. I think from a, you get to the point about businesses that are -- on less attractive margin profile, profitability profile. I think that's more of a mix effect that we'll see going forward.","Operator","Our next question's from Brett Hundley with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Brett Hundley","Hey, good morning guys. Rich, I just wanted to go back -- just want to go back to the Heidi's question related to the -- your comment on the factoring agreement. Do you, do you see that pulling anything forward from Q4? What's normally a pretty big working capital quarter for you? And then, if I can just follow on with a separate question. Just going back to raw materials are we seeing any new synthetic production coming online out there that might help to combat some of the issues that we've seen in recent years? And does that play into some of your confidence about the go forward there? Thank you.","Richard O'Leary","Excuse me. For the first part on the working capital piece of it, it might have a small impact on what we typically did before, but it's not, it's not a huge program. I mean, I still expect to get the -- the improvement in Q4 that we typically see given the cyclicality and the way things operate in the fourth quarter. In terms of new capacity input costs, I think certainly the first thing is that we've seen, I'll say a stabilization of the supply chain. And that's the starting point. I mean if you think about what I talked about, Q2, Q1 was they were still a lot of volatility out there.","Inventory levels remain high on the scent business for us and our competition, but we are seeing signs that as I said, that it starting to stabilize and I think the industry as a whole is starting to rebalance inventories and get away from safety stocks. The talk that we saw some improvement in Q3 in terms of inventory levels coming down. I expect that to continue in Q4. There's new capacity coming on from VASF in the fourth quarter. I think some of the capacity that was out of the market because of the fires is coming back on. And I think that helps provide a trajectory going forward for us to reduce inventory levels. And provide, as Andreas said, we're starting to see some signs that we may have some easing next year or going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from James Targett with Berenberg. Please go ahead.","James Targett","Hi, good afternoon. I'm just one question for me, on the compliance update. Can you just confirm, you talk about being substantially complete when you do expect it to be complete and what's outstanding? Thanks.","Richard O'Leary","Yes. I mean we're substantially complete in terms of doing the investigation as in anything like this, there's things that have to -- we have to finish putting, resolving issues whether it's people that are on garden leave that have to then go through. But it's the normal sort of follow up and clean up that that has as a result of something like that.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. It's also cleaning up all of these documents we have screened. So, Deloitte and some of our legal partners here as well, I think in the first quarter we should be fine with that.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's Q&A session. I'd like to return the calls of Andreas for final remarks. ","Andreas Fibig","Thank you very much for all the good questions and the attendance here. And we will follow-up with was one-on-one sessions with many of you. Thank you. Take care.","Operator","And this does conclude today's program.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. Participants will be announced by their name and company.","I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's third quarter 2017 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.IFF.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website.","Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 28, 2017, and our press release that we filed yesterday.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday.","With me on the call is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have.","With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. As usually, I would like to start with an executive overview of our financial performance for the third quarter. Then, I want to provide some key highlights of our strategic progression. Once finished, I will ask Rich to cover our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit, as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year.","We are pleased with our third quarter results, as we achieved growth across all categories and regions. Currency neutral sales grew 12% on a consolidated basis, with an equal contribution from Flavors and Fragrances. Both business units delivered marked improvements versus the first half, moving from a low single-digit organic performance to mid-single-digit organic growth in quarter three, led by strong new win performance as well as improved volume trends on existing business.","Our top line also continues to benefit from our recent acquisitions, contributing approximately 6 percentage points of growth in the quarter. At the same time, our focus on driving greater efficiencies throughout our business, via costs and productivity initiatives, continue to support overall profitability, as currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 7% this quarter. Rich will take you through the drivers of year-over-year profit performance.","Currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 5%, driven primarily by operating profit growth, a lower effective tax rate and a year-over-year reduction in shares outstanding, which more than offset high interest expense related to dual carrying cost on our recent $500 million bond as well as existing private placements which matured in September.","Fully recognizing that we have and continue to operate in a challenging global environment, we are pleased with our financial performance through September 2017. Our team continues to deliver winning innovative solutions to our customers, while achieving sustained profitable growth for shareholders.","On a year-to-year basis, currency neutral sales growth for the first nine months was strong at 9%, with 11% percent growth in Flavors and 7% growth in Fragrances. Adjusted operating profit grew 5% and adjusted EPS increased 8%, both on currency neutral basis.","I wanted to take a few minutes to highlight a few of our strategic accomplishments in the third quarter. In terms of innovating, first, in Flavors, sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continued its trend of strong double-digit currency neutral growth across all categories, led by Savory (sic) [Sweet] (5:00) and Dairy.","In the Fragrance side, encapsulation-related sales grew high single digits, led primarily by Fabric Care and Personal Wash.","Tastepoint, our new brand within IFF, designed to service the dynamic and faster growing middle market customers in North America, improved strong double digits in the third quarter. This early success shows that our efforts have been very well received by our middle market customers and that combining the long-established and well-regarded relationships of Ottens Flavors and David Michael is the right approach to serve these critically important growth accounts.","Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, acquired now two years ago, remains a primary growth driver as Cosmetic Active Ingredients continues its strong growth, improving double digits in the third quarter. We also opened a fully-renovated and expanded facility in Cairo, Egypt. This investment supports both our regional focus on growth in the Middle East and Africa, as well as our focus on key categories, providing enhanced services to customers and strengthening our presence in the key market.","The expanded labs will allow us to better serve our Egyptian customers and strengthen our market presence in Africa and the Middle East, as it remains a critical component of our long-term strategy. I should note that in the third quarter, our Middle East, Africa region improved high single digits.","I'm also happy to announce that we recently launched our Re-Imagine programs in flavors to accelerate innovation and increase agility to capture unmet opportunities in the changing food and beverage market.","Based on a combination of future trends analysis, consumer insight and a modernized cross-category development process, the programs guide our research and development efforts to ensure an innovation pipeline that addresses the evolving consumer needs and desires. It is another way in which we show how we are dedicated to being our customers' partner of choice as we progress our business strategy, imbue sustainable thinking throughout the creation process, and continue to strengthen our industry-leading innovation platforms.","The programs focus on six key areas, including culinary, citrus, delivery systems, naturals, modulation and protein, and were selected based on market potential, customer input, expert industry collaboration and versatility across end-use categories.","They consider a rapidly changing world from the expectation of sophisticated consumers too busy to cook for themselves, to the realities of a warming climate and its impact on key crops and ingredients, to an increased awareness of our role in the health of the planet.","This extensive innovation platform requires an innovative approach to taste creation. To address this, our bespoke IFF Taste Design is a combination of artisanal, handcrafted techniques and proprietary technologies that drive consumer preference and market differentiation. We believe that both our Re-Imagine programs and our IFF Taste Design approach will provide our customers with winning tastes and further establish us as their essential partner.","In terms of sustainability, I'm pleased to announce that we have joined FReSH, a project of the World Business Council on (sic) [for] (8:39) Sustainable Development designed to improve the health of people and the planet while recalibrating the global system of consumption, transportation, production, and agriculture, thus achieving the initiatives goal to make responsibly-produced healthy, enjoyable diets available for all.","As a standing member of the WBCSD, IFF will join forces with the EAT Foundation and 25 leading businesses and science companies to accelerate transformational change in global food systems. We are passionate about doing the right thing and happy to have the opportunity to contribute in areas where we can make a positive difference in the world.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich.","[07BDC1-E Rich O'Leary]","Thank you, Andreas. Before reviewing our results by business unit, I'd like to start by walking you through the drivers of currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth. On this slide, we show you the year-over-year impact in terms of contribution of growth, expressed as a percentage of our restated third quarter 2016 adjusted operating profit.","Starting with the second bar, you can see that volume represented 15 percentage points of operating profit growth. In the third bar, the net contribution of acquisitions added 5 percentage points of operating profit growth, but please note that this also includes both operating performance and synergies. We also continued to benefit from our cost and productivity initiatives. Through the likes of formula optimization, procurement savings plus the restructuring program savings, we've delivered approximately 4 percentage points of benefit year-over-year.","If we combine all cost and productivity programs into one bucket, including both organic and inorganic components, it would represent approximately 7 percentage points expressed as a percentage of operating profit.","From a headwind perspective, as seen in the next bar, sales mix had a negative impact as we experienced stronger share of sales growth in Savory, specifically snacks; Fabric Care; and Fragrance Ingredients, which have lower than average margin profiles. In the sixth bar, price to input costs was unfavorable by about 4 percentage points, as favorability in Flavors was offset by Fragrance. This reflects targeted adjustments with select customers as well as strategic price reductions within Fragrance Ingredients.","In the next bar, we have highlighted RSA expenses, which represented a 9 percentage point headwind. Please note that included in the bar is incentive compensation, where we have a large year-over-year variance, and represents approximately two-thirds of the change. Regarding incentive compensation, we are highly incentivized to deliver on our financial commitments. There are variations in incentive compensation, as it is based on our performance relative to our annual plan. If we achieve our financial targets, we receive 100% of our designated payout. Should we over or under-perform versus plan, our incentive compensation is adjusted higher or lower.","In terms of the year-over-year comparison in the third quarter, we have large delta as we are comparing to a lower base period due to under-performance (12:14) in the prior year quarter versus strong results in the current year quarter. For simplicity purposes, we grouped several miscellaneous items into Other, as they're negligible.","Turning to the business unit reviews for the third quarter, Flavors currency neutral sales increased 12%, with a strong contribution related to the acquisition of David Michael and, to a much lesser extent, PowderPure, as well as mid-single-digit organic growth where all categories, led by Savory, improved year-over-year, driven by new wins. From a regional perspective, all four regions delivered growth, led by strong double-digit performance in North America, which improved 28%, reflecting additional sales related to acquisitions, principally David Michael, as well as high single-digit growth on an organic basis, driven by new win performance in Savory and Beverage.","EAME increased 12% on a currency neutral basis, inclusive of the additional sales related to the acquisition of David Michael, with the strongest growth in Beverage, (sic) [Savory] (13:28) and Dairy. On a geographic basis, Western, Central and Southeast Europe, as well as Africa and Middle East all reported strong growth. Greater Asia grew 2% on a currency neutral basis in the third quarter, driven principally by double-digit growth in India and high single-digit growth in Thailand. Latin America increased 1% on a currency neutral basis, as growth in Colombia and Argentina more than offset softness in Brazil.","In the third quarter, we experienced isolated pressure with a limited number of customers who are experienced challenges on a volume metric basis. On a currency neutral segment profit basis, Flavors grew approximately 19%, led by volume growth, the contribution of acquisitions and the benefit from productivity initiatives. Overall price versus input cost was slightly favorable in the quarter. The situation regarding raw materials, such as vanilla and citrus, remains fluid and volatile. And we continue to pursue price increases where appropriate.","In terms of currency neutral segment profit margin, we achieved margin expansion year-over-year of approximately 130 basis points to 22.3%. Fragrance currency neutral sales improved 12%, as overall growth was broad-based, with a balanced contribution between organic and acquired businesses. Regionally, growth was strongest in EAME and Latin America, increasing double digits, followed by mid-single-digit growth in Greater Asia.","From a category perspective, Fine Fragrance improved 18% on a currency neutral basis, including Fragrance Resources. Organically, performance was driven by strong new wins in EAME, Greater Asia and North America, as well as improved volume trends in Latin America. Some of those new launches included YSL Y, Armani Because It's You by L'Oreal, At The Beach by Limited Brands, and Pure XS by Pooch (15:37-15:47). Consumer Fragrances grew 11% on a currency neutral basis, with a balanced contribution from organic business and additional sales related to the acquisition of Fragrance Resources. Organically, nearly all categories achieved growth, led by strong double-digit growth in Home Care and high single-digit growth in Fabric Care, driven primarily by wins.","I'd like to note that Consumer Fragrances showed a marked improvement relative to second quarter of 2017, growing 6% year-over-year, as volume on existing business was positive in Q3. Fragrance Ingredient sales were up 8% on a currency neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in EAME and Latin America. IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics also continued to perform well, as it grew double-digits in the third quarter.","From a profit perspective, Fragrance currency neutral segment profit increased 6% on a currency neutral basis, as volume growth, the contribution of acquisitions and the benefits from productivity initiatives more than offset unfavorable price to input cost, weaker sales mix and higher incentive compensation expense.","We do expect to see input costs rising as we exit 2017 and, as such, have already initiated discussions with our customers regarding the need for price recovery in 2018. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margin, our profile remains strong at 20.2%.","Moving on to cash flow, operating cash flow was $199 million year-to-date which compares to $342 million in the first nine months of 2016.","Performance was adversely impacted primarily by the previously-announced ZoomEssence litigation settlement, which was about $56 million, and higher working capital requirements, in particular, accounts receivable. It should be noted that we expect accounts receivable to improve going forward, partly due to timing, regarding stronger sales in Q3 with collections in Q4, and as well as traction on our improvement program. From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $77 million on capital expenditures or about 3% of sales, and we believe we will spend approximately 4% to 4.5% of sales in 2017.","Regarding cash return to shareholders, through the first nine months, we've spent approximately $152 million on dividends and $53 million on share repurchases.","Last week, our Board of Directors approved an extension of our existing share repurchase authorization through 2022 with a total value of $300 million, including approximately $50 million remaining on our prior authorization. This share repurchase authorization is consistent with our established return of capital strategy and reinforces our belief that IFF is well-positioned for the future.","Our strong financial position and cash generation enables us to return cash to our shareholders, as we continue to strategically invest both organically and through acquisitions to create long-term value for our shareholders.","Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we remain optimistic that we can achieve our previously-stated currency neutral guidance for the full year 2017. We are reiterating our currency neutral sales growth projection of 7.5% to 8.5%, with the expectation that we could be at the higher end of that range.","We expect high single-digit growth across both business units, with broad-based contributions from acquisitions and organic performance. From an adjusted operating profit and EPS perspective, excluding the impact of currency, we expect to achieve 5.5% to 6.5% and 6.5% to 7.5%, respectively.","While our currency neutral guidance has not changed, the effect of currency movements on our results has moved. From a top-line perspective, the impact of currency improved approximately 100 basis points, essentially having no impact for the full year, primarily driven by an improvement in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate.","On a profit and an EPS basis, we anticipate a 50 basis point (20:51) improvement versus last quarter. And on a full-year basis, we expect that the impact of foreign exchange on adjusted operating profit to be approximately 1% and approximately 2 percentage points on adjusted EPS.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Rich. In summary, we are very pleased with the strong financial performance we achieved in the third quarter. We continue to be focused on the execution of our long-term strategy, accelerating growth, increasing differentiation, and driving cost efficiencies to drive sustainable, profitable growth in the future and maximize value creation for our shareholders. And, as Rich just stated, we are on track to deliver our previously-stated 2017 financial goals on a currency neutral base.","With that, I would now like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Morning, Mark.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","It's afternoon where I am, actually, but nonetheless, wanted to ask about the top-line expectations for the year. So that implies fourth quarter with pretty nice acceleration on the tough comparison. I guess, trying of figure out exactly how to think about what's improving in the business, what gives you visibility that you're going to be able to see that improvement, given those comparisons? Maybe you could talk a bit about category and what sort of has surprised you. Obviously, with a strong third quarter number as you head into year-end and I know (22:33) preliminarily, but how you think about that heading into the first half of next year as well, when you have more favorable comparisons?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay, Mark, let me take it. So if we look into the fourth quarter, we had a strong start into the fourth quarter up to the end of October. So that's a good thing. What we see is that our performance, and particular in Fragrance, is just pretty, pretty strong. And it's continuing and has a very, very good momentum. On 2018, I prefer not to comment right now. You know, we do this usually in February because, first of all, we have to close our fourth quarter, but the start was pretty good.","Rich, any...","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. A couple of things from my perspective, Mark, I mean, I think we did expect to see improvements in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. I think we've got good strong win performance in both businesses, particularly Fine Fragrance. In that category, you heard in our commentary regarding the third quarter, there's a strong volume component in terms of on existing business. Some of that, we believe, is event-driven and potentially timing. So the impact between Q2, Q3, Q4 is still a little bit volatile, but I think we feel, again, as Andreas said, looking at the start to the quarter, we definitely feel like it's the trend. I don't think it's going to be at the same level as Q3, but certainly an improvement versus what we saw in the first half of the year.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And just on gross margin, wanted to try to understand the puts and takes there and specifically try to figure out the puts and takes between mix and price concessions or pricing that you're giving customers. And maybe can you help us sort of explain exactly what is going on there. And I guess just lastly, how do you think about that going forward? I mean, I guess just fourth quarter, if you don't want to talk about 2018, but what the puts and takes are would be helpful.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sure. I mean, I think from the first standpoint, I mean, let me take mix as a starting point. As I said in the comments, I think mix is driven by our customers. And what they order is what we're going to deliver. And I think we saw, as I said: really strong growth, strong double-digit growth in Savory, particularly snacks, in the Flavors business, that has below average margins from an overall standpoint; Fragrance Ingredients, similar story, good growth, high single digits, below average margins; and Fabric Care, good growth. So I think that's clearly the drivers of mix. I think that we're going to still see mix headwinds in Q4.","The second component of that, price to input costs, really, I would say, two different dynamics going on there. On the flavor side, as I said in my commentary, overall price to input cost was flat to slightly favorable. And we've been able to recover and pass through the increases that we're seeing in the naturals, that we've talked about previously, like citrus and vanilla.","On the Fragrance side, we've got Fragrance Ingredients. We've talked about the strategic pricing changes we made late last year to rebalance and drive growth in that business by making modest changes in there. The impact related to that has been fairly stable.","Where we're seeing the greatest amount of pressure is on the compound side. We've got large customers that have significant improvement objectives of their own. We have to work with them and balance their short-term objectives, but do it in a way that provides us long-term growth opportunities. We're not going to jeopardize the entire business.","On top of that, we're starting to see an acceleration of input costs in the second half of this year. Input costs were up slightly in Q2 year-over-year for the Fragrance business. That accelerated in Q3. And that's why we talked about the need to drive and realize price realization going forward for the Fragrance business.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Could you just quantify the impact in gross margin between mix and price concessions?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I would say mix on gross margin was probably 60 basis points, more or less, and about 80 basis points for price and input costs.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kate Grafstein with Barclays.","Katie Grafstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. So I just wanted to ask a question on the emerging markets growth. The 7% growth is the highest level I think since 2015. Do you see this as a sustainable inflection point? And I guess how much of the acceleration is about true market growth and an improvement in consumer demand or optimism from customers ahead of real consumer acceleration? And then just if you could also discuss the improvement in the context of both local, regionals and multinationals, that would also be helpful. Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","You can get started. (28:23)","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sure, Katie. I mean, I think it's still quite volatile. I think that, as I talked about, I mean, I think that we've seen on the last call and then we talked about in today's call that I think we've seen improvements in Latin America on the Fragrance side, improvements in Brazil. One of our largest customers, a local regional customer, has had a strong turnaround in their business in Brazil and Latin America in the third quarter. We feel good about that. But I would not say that we're sort of out of the woods. We saw strength in, I think, Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, certainly for Flavors; continues to be a positive and a bright spot. I think that on the Fragrance side, Indonesia and India had strong growth in the quarter. There's still uncertainty and challenges in Indonesia and China for the Flavors business. So I would say it's better. I'm not sure I'm ready to say it's an inflection point, but, again, there's a big piece of what we saw in both businesses in Q3 versus Q2, in particular, was the volume component on existing business was much better in Q3 versus Q2.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. On the local and regional customers, that's certainly a source of growth for us and a growth engine within the company, not just in emerging markets, but in particular in North America in the Flavors division with the setup of Tastepoint we have installed. We believe that this business model truly can help us to grow the business substantially. And it's shown in the numbers so far.","Katie Grafstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And then, I guess also just talking about the acceleration in the developed markets, it's interesting just as the customers are talking about slower market conditions. So was wondering if maybe you can talk about that disconnect.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. Well, what we see is, in particular in Western Europe but also in North America, good performance on both sides of the business. It's certainly driven by good win performance, in particular with the bigger ones. But as I said and reflected, the customer mix plays a super important role here. And with our setup, in particular in North America, that positions us very well for good growth rates and further growth to come.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I think the other thing for me as I mentioned a couple times is the volume component is definitely stronger this quarter than five-year long-term trends. So I think some of this may be event-driven, whether it's timing between Q2 into Q3 as our customers adjust their order patterns, as they look at what's going on in their market. So I think it's a combination of factors. I mean, we feel good about the win performance. The volume component is hard to predict from quarter-to-quarter.","Katie Grafstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane BNP Paribas.","Heidi Vesterinen - Exane BNP Paribas","Hi. I wanted to ask a bit more about the Re-Imagine initiative you talked about. Could you maybe help us understand, maybe with an example, what the initiative is? Is it kind of like an integrated solution? And is what you're proposing here \u2013 what is the margin profile here compared to the rest of the group, please? Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hi. Let me try to answer that in a way. It's actually a creative process to build our solutions. And it tries actually to look what the customers and consumers really need from the consumer insight perspective, figure out what are the most important trends, and then come up with solutions which bring as many of our technologies together as we can to make sure that we are well-positioned vis-\u00e0-vis our competition certainly, but also to satisfy the customer needs and that we basically focus our investments in R&D and applied R&D on the right areas like, an example, like naturals protein delivery systems.","Talking about the margins, usually the margin should be very good because we combine a lot of technologies together to come up with these solutions.","Heidi Vesterinen - Exane BNP Paribas","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys, nice quarter.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Mike.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hi, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I think you noted Cosmetic Active's another really strong quarter. Can you maybe talk about the momentum there? And are there other potential acquisitions to continue to build on to this business?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Mike, let me take it. First of all, what we see is that this part of the market has a nice growth also compared to the core F&F markets. So that's number one. Number two, in the segment where we play with Lucas Meyer, we are in the upper premium segment, which is usually more dynamic than the other segments of the market.","And now, it's going into the natural actives as well where we are in particular strong because, remember, with Lucas Meyer, we have access to SouthernCross Botanicals in Australia. We have access certainly to our own naturals palette and naturals ingredients here as well. So it's going actually very, very well and we had a good start into the fourth quarter as well. So we foresee good growth for this business going forward.","And as you were asking, we always evaluate other opportunities, whether we can strengthen this business in an inorganic way as well.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then encapsulation is another one that has continued to post pretty good growth there. Is it still just in the laundry side that you're seeing the growth, or have you been able to move into other markets that maybe could continue to grow into next year?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. Actually, the expansion goes in different directions. The first one is that we are evolving out our encapsulation technology, which is now more multi-cap systems which help us in the classic fabric care area. But we are moving technology into other categories like hair care, for example, as well, and that's ongoing and in full, full swing.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Morning.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","My question relates to the price and the raw material costs, just following up from that. What was the pricing effect on your top line in the quarter? And given the recent trends and increases we're seeing in petrochemical intermediates, do you feel an increased urge to push up prices, especially in the Fragrance division going into next year?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","In pricing itself, if you segregate it from the input cost piece, it was slightly favorable. I mean, it's less than 1 percentage point. On a combined basis, as I said, I think we are seeing what we believe the start of input cost increases on the Fragrance side and we're going to definitely have to work with the customers and get price increases to compensate for the input cost trend going forward.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. Which we have done actually very well this year on the Flavors side already.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","And if I can just follow up, and when are you going to lap the price rebates in the Fragrance Ingredients space?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","End of the year, we'll lap it in the fourth quarter.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Faiza.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So a couple questions, can you just talk about what you're seeing from your multinational customers? So it seems like local regional customers, the performance with those customers was better. But are you seeing any improvement from the multinational customers at all?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah, look, I think that if you look at Q3 itself, I mean, the growth was pretty well balanced between local and regional and global customers. I think the drivers of that might be slightly different, as I talked about. I mean, I think the local (37:38) continue to execute well and gain share. On the global side, I think there is some element, again, of volume. The volume swings from quarter-to-quarter, so in recovery in volumes on base business.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, Rich, just drilling in on some of the comments you made around events-driven and sort of timing factors, is that something that you saw globally or was it more concentrated in a particular region or category?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Let's see. I mean, it was fairly broad-based. I think it was largest in North America for Fragrances, a little bit in Latin America and in Western Europe.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then, just broadly, are you seeing any appetite for innovation from your customers across the board or do you feel like many are so just focused on whether it's short-term seasonal trends or sort of a quick pick-up from a new flavor or are you seeing sort of any sustained drive for innovation from your customers?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. I would say we do. And in particular, it was really cutting-edge innovation if you talk about delivery systems or some specifics. So, that's what we see and that's actually very good and we try to drive this trend as well with our customers.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, Andreas, is this like a change that you saw this quarter or is it something that you've been seeing all year?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Actually, already for quite some time. It's not specific to the quarter, I would say.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Okay. And then, just last question from me on, Rich, I know you don't want to talk about 2018 at this point, but any guidance on FX would be really helpful in terms of the top-line and the bottom-line impact that you anticipate.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Let me think about this. I mean, I...","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","You should have a crystal ball on FX.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. If I was, I would be on a beach somewhere probably.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Assume current spot rates.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","No, look, I mean, again, if we stay at where we are today, we're going to have a favorable impact from a currency standpoint in the first half of next year and probably more I'd say flat, mute-ish in the second half of this year.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good, very good. (40:20)","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Silke.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","My first question is in the quarter, you had you know 6% organic local currency growth and I think the profit improvement on that (40:35) was 15%, as you show in your slides and the acquisitions contributed 6% to sales growth, but the profit contribution was 5% and maybe if you strip out the synergies, maybe it contributed 2%. So the question is why is that and what type of contribution do you expect for 2018 from the acquisitions as you try to pull out cost synergies and you integrate these businesses?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yes. So a couple of things. Let me start with the organic business on the volume impacts, so then you've got the mix impact going as an offset to that. You've got pricing input costs offsetting that. And then particularly the incentive comp reset are all offsets that ends up bringing that number down.","On the M&A side, keep in mind that we have the amortization expense that we have to get through all of our synergy programs before we start getting the incremental leverage. The sales come right away, but we've got to work through our integration plans. We've got to work through the cost savings programs before we start to get acceleration from an operating profit standpoint.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So that means like next year, the cost amortization still that means that even the contribution may not be... (42:05)","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. Once we start lapping the amortization and we continue the process next year on realizing the synergies and we get the growth, then we'll start to get acceleration from an M&A contribution standpoint.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","What's the incremental amortization on the acquisitions year-over-year?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","$3.6 million.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. My second question is what is behind the accounts receivable issue, why the receivables so high? Is it a regional issue where these sales took place, or is it just that you had most of your sales at the very end of the third quarter?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I mean, it's a huge increase in sales. We go from 2% organic growth to 6% organic growth. I mean, the biggest piece of it is just purely the volume effect in the quarter compared to where we were. If you compare December last year to third quarter this year, we had an acceleration in our business. If you compare December 2015 to third quarter 2016, you had a deceleration of the business. So you have a different dynamic going on. I fully expect that we're going to recover that from a timing standpoint and then we'll collect those receivables in the fourth quarter. And then, fourth quarter is seasonally a slower quarter. So, we'll be able to recover a large portion of that outflow.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Rich is already collecting.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","It is a focal point. Believe me, it's a focal point for us.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Right, but the reason why I ask this is you had like an improvement in sales year-over-year in the second quarter as well and the receivable increase wasn't quite as big, but it's true, there is a large sales increase.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah, there is a big difference in the performance.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I have two more questions. One has to do with Fabric Care. Is the growth in Fabric Care, does that have to do with new product launches or is it the case that products that were previously launched are now reaching better penetration, you're selling more of it and maybe that it goes to the detrimental of like what you can charge on price because you said it's sort of like a lower margin contribution?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","It's a big volume component in this number for (44:39) existing business.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","The win rates, they're good, but there's not been any significant uptick. It's driven primarily by the volumes on existing business.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. I understand. And lastly, can you pull out the acquisition a bit more specifically? Can you discuss what organic sales was like for North American Flavor excluding David Michael and what it was for European Flavors excluding David Michael? And maybe can do the same thing for North American Fragrances and European Fragrances if you strip out the Fragrance Resources acquisition, if you have that data.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, North American Flavors on an organic basis was 7%. North America organic for total Fragrances was down 3%. What other area were you...","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And in Europe, I think there was an acquisition piece in European Flavors and also in European Fragrances.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay. So...","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I was wondering what the organic piece was.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay. No problem, no problem. Organic in Flavors was 10% and organic in Fragrances was 11%.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Those are big numbers. Okay. Thanks very much. I'll get back into queue.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Adam.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","A lot of ground's been covered, but maybe just a question on operating leverage in the quarter, because the volume growth, I mean, very healthy, sounded like a little bit above 5%. And I'm just trying to think about if we can sustain those kind of operating profit levels into 2018 and you don't have the comp issue for incentive compensation this year versus last, should the implied operating leverage that you did in the quarter ex the incentive comp, should we think about that being sustainable into the first half of next year, especially when your organic revenue comps are not particularly challenging?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I'll sort of skip over the comment about not particularly challenging. But, I mean, look, I mean, I think as we head into next year, certainly incentive comp will be a significant less headwind than what we experienced in 2017. I think that we're going to continue to drive the productivity agenda that we've laid out at the beginning of this year. We've got to continue to execute against that. We've got to continue to look at investing in driving innovation that's going to help from a sales mix standpoint and a product mix standpoint. And we'll continue to look at our cost base and say how can we drive leverage through the P&L.","It's a tough environment. It's volatile. As I talked about earlier, we're expecting input costs to go up next year, so our ability to pass those increases on to our customers on the Fragrance side is going to be critical to our success in 2018.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just a question specifically on Fine Fragrances, which did seem to improve in the third quarter, I think you alluded to some new customer wins in the prepared remarks, but any comments there on the sustainability, what you're seeing at the department store level, if you're seeing better buying activity and better expectations for foot traffic and just thoughts there. It's an important business in the Fragrance division.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. So, Adam, what we see is actually on the Fine Fragrance side a tremendous development in Europe. It's going very well, in particular, for many of the other premium brands. So we see good demand and we certainly have a good win rate here as well. So for us, we see that this hopefully will be sustainable for the months to come.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then in the U.S., are you seeing better activity at the retail level or is it more Europe that's driving the strength?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","No. It's more Europe what's driving it at this spot. (49:12)","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's all very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Can you hear me?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yes, very well.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hey, good morning, John.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. I think you said you had positive price raws in Flavors. I would assume it was negative in vanilla and negative in citrus. What would be the kind of offsetting categories where the overall would be positive?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Well, no. I mean, we were able to get price increases related to those materials and get out ahead of it. And the Flavors business has done a great job in doing that. So I mean, it was slightly positive but it's really our ability to push through and anticipate those impacts.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then it's pretty hard to time acquisitions, but would you say you're ahead of plan or behind plan or on plan in terms of the number and size of acquisitions that you've done over the past year and a half, two years?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","We're absolutely on plan and we are a little ahead of plan with the performance of our acquisitions compared to our business cases. So we're very happy with all the five acquisitions we have done in the last two and two and a half years. (50:28) We are pretty much on plan.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Lambert with Raymond James.","Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. A few questions, first on the M&A 2018 component of the growth, sorry for jumping to next year, but in our model, we have about 2% contribution for (51:01) M&A 2018, would like to get your views on that, if nothing else is being (51:06) acquired, of course.","And also what's your view on operating income impact from M&A in 2018, again, looking at the synergies, looking at the integration was question number one. Maybe I'll let you answer that one first.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sure, Patrick. I think from an M&A impact in 2018 on acquisitions, it's principally related to PowderPure. The Fragrance Resources was a couple weeks, so it's insignificant. So the 2% number that you're looking at seems way too high for me. So I think that impact, again, it's only going to be \u2013 PowderPure is really for half a year is the primary impact. Again from a profitability standpoint, all the other acquisitions go into organic and they'll be in our guidance for the full year from an organic standpoint. We'll embed our guidance for PowderPure in the full-year guidance also. But I think from a purely financial standpoint, it's what I said earlier, which is I would expect, once we lap the amortization impacts, that we'll continue to drive expansion through the synergies, growth of the business, and drive in improvements in the product mix of those businesses.","Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.","Great. Second question, CapEx, are you still targeting 4% to 5% for this year and next year, and any plans (52:48) we need to consider for next year in terms of increasing capacity?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. For this year, I expect us to be somewhere between 4% and 4.5%. We do expect that CapEx next year will be closer to plus or minus 5% because we've still got some of the big projects in Asia that we've got to execute against. We've got China. We've got India and some of those projects. So, 2018 and 2019 are going to be the elevated years.","Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.","Okay. And last question, I guess, would be (53:28) China in particular. Could you comment a bit more on details of what you're seeing in China, in particular, in both Flavors and Fragrances? Still weak organic developments there, so if you can comment on that. Thank you.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's still challenged. I mean, I think on the Flavors side, I know I mentioned in my comments that volume was down. We're going through and still working our way back up from some of the issues we've had. On the Fragrances side, we're seeing customers again trade down and not buying some of the categories where we're stronger at. We have a larger exposure to some of the globals in China also, and they're struggling in the marketplace on their volume basis compared to some of the local and regionals. So, it's still a challenge for both business units.","Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Hundley with Vertical Group.","Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Good morning. This is Brandon Groeger on for Brett Hundley.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Good morning. Perhaps you could give us some more detail on the new Chinese fragrance plant Does that plant replace any existing production or is it additive? And when do you expect that to come online?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","So, it will come online probably end of next year, and it will be in addition to the existing Flavors plant we are having there because for two years, in 2015, (55:03) we had an issue with our Flavors plant, and it is probably prudent to have a second opportunity here for us on the Flavors side as well. So it will be an additional plant for...","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. There's actually two plants that we're dealing with. One was a smaller ingredient plant that we're finishing now. And it'll start up in the fourth quarter.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Which is on the Fragrance side.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Which is on the Fragrance Ingredients side. And then, as you've seen in the footnotes to the 10-Q, we're in negotiations with the government regarding their request for us to relocate our other larger ingredient plant in China and that I would expect to happen over the next two years. (56:01)","Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC","So relocating that other plant is in addition to this plant as well?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yes.","Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","In both cases, they've asked us to leave existing sites and go to a new site, and we're going to put both of the plants in a single site over the next two years.","Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, shifting to the balance sheet, it looks like it's in a good place. You're less than 2 times net levered. You recently announced the share repurchase. Ingredient valuations have been rebounding in recent months. I was thinking about your grid that dictates the repurchase of the shares. Do you intend to update that at all? And then, outside of that share repurchase activity, how are you thinking about putting the balance sheet to work?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Let me take the share repurchase first. Yeah. As I noted, we did get an updated authorization from the board. The matrix is stock price-driven, but I would say that there is a component of the new authorization that provides for a minimum amount of share repurchases that's targeted to offset dilution. And then on top of that, will depend upon where we are versus the share price grid.","From a utilization of the rest of the capacity in the balance sheet, I think, as Andreas talked about, we continue to look and pursue our M&A agenda, but it all depends upon what's available. And we want to make sure we are targeting the right deals and have the proper return profiles.","Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much, guys.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Morning.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good quarter. I wanted to talk about active cosmetics. I'm trying to look at a couple of regions where you saw some real big lift in Fragrance Ingredients. Is active cosmetics growing in every region, and that's just two places where there's not offsets, if you could kind of comment on that and maybe dimensionalize how big that business could be going forward?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Jon, the big drivers in terms of where ingredients are growing significant, which is the EAME and Latin America, is on our Fragrance Ingredients side. The growth on the cosmetic active side has been pretty consistent. It's in the double-digit range, so that's not driving the changes. What you're seeing is on our Ingredients business.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. And it's pretty well-distributed across on the active cosmetic side. Region-wise, we are certainly stronger in Europe and North America, in terms of the size of the business. We still have a ways to go in Asia and in Latin America. Well, that's good. That gives us growth opportunities going forward.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks. And just one follow-up, if I could. Rich, I went back and looked at 2006, 2007, like strong periods of Asia, basically global luxury fragrance development that would advantage a fine fragrance business like yours. Certainly, we're seeing that across some of your key end customers. What's different? You're seeing much better growth this time around than 2005, 2006, 2007, when you saw similar kinds of trends in beauty, particularly in Asia, but luxury globally. Could you comment on like why \u2013 how much of that \u2013 do you worry that some of that is economically cyclical and why the difference this time? What kind of capabilities do you have now, around Fine Fragrance particularly, that you maybe didn't have back then? Thank you.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Well, there's a lot there in your question. But, I mean, I think, that certainly we're seeing good growth in some of the emerging markets, Middle East, Africa in particular, within the EAME region. As we've been talking about for several quarters, we need to and we have adapted our strategy on Fine to focus on those categories in the channels that are most attractive.","Certainly, that profile has changed over the last 12 to 18 months, where there's a lot less going through the department stores and the brick-and-mortar. And we're going to continue to target our resources towards those, the premium and the prestige components of the Fine business.","Look, it's a reflection of the team we have around the world and their ability to leverage the consumer insights, understand what's going on in the market, understand our customers and designing fragrances that are attractive to the consumer. And that's ultimately what it comes down to is our ability to put the right fragrance in the right place at the right time.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's first quarter 2017 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed our press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please take a note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements.","During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for our second quarter and full-year 2017. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 28, 2017 and our press release that we filed yesterday.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release.","With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have.","With that, I would now like to introduce, Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Michael. I would like to start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the first quarter. Then I want to provide an update on the progress we made in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, I would ask Rich to cover our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit, as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then, I will provide some concluding remarks and we will finish by taking any questions that you may have.","I'm pleased to report that our first quarter sales growth was strong and in line with our expectations. Currency-neutral sales increased 7%, which was comprised of 10% growth in Flavors and 3% growth in Fragrances.","Sales performance was predominantly driven by the contribution of our recent acquisitions of David Michael and Fragrance Resources and a strong performance in our Organic Flavors business, while we achieved growth across all categories and regions.","In Fragrances, we were successful in offsetting challenging macroeconomic conditions in Latin America, primarily Brazil, driven by Fragrance Ingredients and Fine Fragrance, in particular in the EAME region. In terms of currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, the contribution from our recent acquisitions was strong and support our overall profitability as we are ahead of our acquisition plans. Organically, our currency-neutral adjusted operating profit came in consistent to the prior year as volume growth and productivity initiatives were offset by unfavorable price to input cost, as well as several unplanned expenses that Rich will go through in more detail later in the presentation. We also benefited from a lower effective tax rate and reduced shares outstanding in the quarter, which supported a 9% improvement in currency-neutral adjusted EPS.","We continue to make progress each quarter with respect to our Vision 2020 strategy. I'm happy to report that the two of our key R&D-focused areas continue to be growth drivers in the first quarter. In Fragrances, our encapsulation technology continues to expand beyond the traditional Fabric Care category with strong growth in Personal Wash.","In Flavors, sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continue to post strong growth and proving strong double-digits on a currency-neutral basis, led by savory, dairy and beverage. This is further proof that our innovative solutions are allowing us to meet our customers' demand by healthier and better-for-you products.","Looking towards the future, we also commercialized two new flavor molecules to enhance our Flavors palette for (5:04) in order to continue to build winning solutions for our customers. We continue to see accelerated growth in the areas where we are targeting market leadership position, benefiting from our recent strategic acquisitions, as well as from solid growth in our Organic Flavors business, we saw a 14% increase in North America in the first quarter 2017.","Our ongoing commitment to provide our customers with in-depth local consumer understanding, superior innovation, outstanding service and the highest quality products allowed us to continue to capture the growth of both global and faster growing regional accounts with regionals outpacing global accounts. This continues to strengthen as our recent acquisitions of David Michael and Fragrance Resources are all well strong from a regional customer base.","I'm also happy to report that IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics continued its strength in the cosmetic active ingredient segment as it won several beauty industry awards on CosmeticsDesign, including Best Skin Care Active Ingredient for Americas with Miniporyl, Best Hair Care Ingredient for Americas with Defenscalp, and Best Skin Care Active Ingredients Global with Miniporyl. All of which are showcased at CAGNY earlier this year.","In addition to the slides, we have made from a market share and innovation perspective, we continue to position ourselves to be our customers' partner-of-choice and to-go supplier. In the first quarter of 2017, we expanded our business access by gaining core list status with a multinational Flavor customer to ensure we continue to increase our participation, ultimately leading to continuous growth. We also received an innovation award from a top Flavors customer, validating that our innovation, collaborative work and inspirational sessions are driving the success in achieving solutions that meet end consumer demands.","During the first quarter, we launched our 2016 Sustainability Report entitled Circular by Design. It is an in-depth state testament to all we have accomplished over the past year and provides insight into our aspirations as we move forward with our journey to make IFF a deeply greener company. If you haven't already, I invite you to check out our report and companion video are found online at the iff.com\/sustain.","Beginning in 2014, IFF-LMR took a step forward and partnered with the Institute of Marketecology, a leading provider for international inspection and certification services for organic, ecological and social standards to certify that our strategic supply chains and operating platforms meet with the For Life criteria.","During the first quarter, we were proud to announce that IFF-LMR achieved its 9th For Life Certification, this time for Burgundy Blackcurrant Bud. Our responsible sourcing platforms in naturals demonstrates our commitment to traceability and towards progressively more responsible ingredients. Certification For Life is a guarantee from IFF to our customers and their consumers.","We are also targeting opportunities within our industry and near adjacencies to develop new technologies and to expand our geographic and business access. All of this must be done in a way that make strong strategic sense and leverages our expertise in science and technology.","Over the past two years, we have successfully acquired five companies, three of which closed in the past seven months. Our acquisition of David Michael in October 2016 helped further reinforce our differentiated service model is the U.S. for Flavors middle-market customers, focused on innovation, agility and enhanced collaboration.","In early 2017, we acquired Fragrance Resources, which is a key player in a fast-growing specialty Fine Fragrance category, also increasing our exposure to regional customer base. In the first quarter of 2017, these two acquisitions contributed approximately 5 percentage points of our sales growth and 3 percentage points of operating profit growth already, as we are tracking ahead of our acquisition case, driving sales growth and extracting synergies.","Last month, we also announced the purchase of PowderPure to further expand our expertise and offerings for clean label solutions that satisfy consumer demands. Founded in the early 2000s and based in Oregon, PowderPure utilizes its patented Infidri drying technology to create all-natural food ingredients by eliminating water while leaving the taste, nutrition and color matrix intact.","Using minimal processing, PowderPure currently focuses on all fruits and vegetable powders, juice powders, as well as other specialty products. PowderPure's technology has also been used to effectively repurpose valuable materials resulting from other food processing systems, turning them into useful and nutritious products and saving them from waste streams.","The global trend in natural food formulations and the delivery of taste was options for the cleanest possible label. It's clear and we found the combination of powders, product quality, and the unique benefits of their technology very compelling.","This platform further expands our access to fast-growing natural, clean label food ingredients and potentially creates opportunities in adjacent markets of nutraceuticals, specialty extracts, and coloring food stuffs. Overall, we are very excited about this addition to our organization and the future growth prospective it brings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Andreas. Our first quarter results in sales growth was strong and in line with our expectations. Currency-neutral sales grew 7%, including approximately 5 percentage points related to the contribution of David Michael and Fragrance Resources, and 2 percentage points from our Organic business.","Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit grew 3% as the benefit of acquisitions, volume growth, and cost savings initiatives more than offset unfavorable price to input costs, as well as unplanned expenses, including unfavorable manufacturing variances, bad debt, a product recall, and litigation loss. I'll go through these in more specifics on my next slide.","Below the line, we had strong leverage as we benefited from a more favorable effective tax rate, which we expect to normalize over the next three quarters to approximately 22.5% on a full-year basis, and a reduction in shares outstanding related to our share repurchase program. These two factors led to a robust currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth in the quarter of 9%.","Looking at our Q1 currency-neutral operating profit growth, I want to provide some more clarity on our performance drivers year-over-year. In the second bar, you can see that volume growth added 6 percentage points to profitability. In the third bar, we have highlighted the benefits of our cost and productivity initiatives. Due to the likes of formula optimization, procurement savings, and restructuring program savings, we delivered approximately 4 percentage points of benefit year-over-year.","As Andreas stated earlier, the contribution of David Michael and Fragrance Resources added 3 percentage points to operating profit growth, as shown in the fourth bar, as we are growing and realizing synergies.","From a headwind's perspective, as seen in the next bar, price to input costs were unfavorable by about 4 percentage points, driven by a reduction in pricing within Fragrance Ingredients, as well as volume-related rebates in core listing agreements in Fragrance compounds.","The area where I'd like to elaborate more on is in the next box, which is related to unplanned expenses that negatively impacted our operating performance in the quarter by approximately 4%. About half of that amount relates to manufacturing variances in Fragrance Ingredients. We have a reactor temporarily suspended for approximately two to three weeks in one of our plants, and manufacturing yield variances due to the implementation of new manufacturing processes at another Fragrance Ingredient plant.","The other half of the variance is \u2013 the headwinds, was driven by bad debt for a single customer based in Latin America, a litigation loss, and lastly, a charge of $1.8 million related to the write-off associated with the product recall.","The remaining items, grouped together in other, primarily relates to deferred compensation expense, where we make mark-to-market adjustments based on the performance of the equity market. Net-net, had we not had these unplanned items, currency-neutral adjusting operating profit would've been more in line with our expectations.","Looking at the business unit performance for the first quarter, Fragrance currency-neutral sales improved 3%, driven by growth in Fine Fragrances, Fabric Care, and Fragrance Ingredients.","From a category perspective, Fine Fragrance improved 10% on a currency-neutral basis, inclusive of additional sales related to the acquisition of Fragrance Resources. Three of the four regions, led by EAME, achieved strong growth, with the exception of Latin America, which continues to experience abnormally high volume erosion due to weak economic conditions.","Consumer Fragrances grew 2% on a currency-neutral basis, principally driven by the additional sales related to the acquisition of Fragrance Resources and improvements in Fabric Care. In the first quarter, Fabric Care grew low single-digits on a currency-neutral basis, with three of the four geographies posting strong growth, led by double-digit increase in North America and high single-digit growth in EAME and Greater Asia.","Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 2% on a currency-neutral basis, as double-digit growth in EAME and LatAm were offset by softness in North America and Greater Asia. From a profit perspective, Fragrance's currency-neutral segment profit decreased 6%, as volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable price to input costs, as well as several of the unplanned expenses that I mentioned earlier.","In terms of currency-neutral segment profit margin, our profile remained strong, yet was under pressure year-over-year, driven by the above items I mentioned. Plus the Fragrance Resource acquisition, inclusive of a step-up in purchase price accounting and before realizing all the synergies.","Flavors' currency-neutral sales increased 10%, driven by broad-based organic growth across all categories, as well as the contribution of sales related to David Michael. From a regional perspective, each region delivered growth led by strong double-digit performance in North America, which improved 27%, reflecting additional sales related to the acquisition of David Michael, as well as strong double-digit growth in dairy and savory in the Organic business. EAME increased 6% on a currency-neutral basis, led by high single-digits in Western Europe, Central, and Southeastern Europe. This performance was primarily driven by strong new wins.","Greater Asia posted 3% currency-neutral growth, led by strong double-digit growth in India, Thailand and the Philippines. On a category basis within Greater Asia, performance was led by double-digit growth in beverages. Growth in Latin America continue, improving 7% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Mexico and the Andean Pact, as well as mid-single-digit growth in the Southern Cone.","Flavors currency-neutral segment profit grew approximately 12%, led by volume growth, the benefits from productivity initiatives, and the contribution of David Michael's acquisition. In terms of currency-neutral segment profit margin, we delivered year-over-year improvements, principally driven by our savings related to the productivity initiatives as well as volume growth.","Turning to our cash flow, our core working capital levels continued to show improvement, principally driven by the timing of payables. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $22 million compared to $40 million in the first quarter of last year. While we experienced lower outflows from working capital, we were negatively impacted by the timing of higher pension payments, which will normalize throughout the year, as well as higher incentive compensation payments.","From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $27 million in CapEx and we continue to believe we expend approximately 5% sales in 2017. Regarding cash return to shareholders in Q1, we spent approximately $51 million on dividend payouts and $38 million on share repurchases. For the full-year, we expect to meet or exceed our total payout objective of 50% to 60% of adjusted net income.","As we look to the balance of the year, we are optimistic that we can achieve our previously stated total financial guidance on a currency-neutral basis. Please note that this is absent of any additional costs and\/or recovery related to the product recall, as it's not estimable at this time. We do not believe that the ultimate settlement of the claim will have a material impact on our financial condition; however, it may have an impact on any one quarter.","We are reiterating our previously stated currency-neutral sales growth projection of 7.5% to 8.5%, including approximately 4.5 percentage points' contribution from the acquisitions of David Michael's and Fragrance Resources. Embedded in the acquisition impact is the sales benefit related to recent acquisition of PowderPure, which is expected to have a negligible impact on a full-year basis.","From adjusted operating profit and EPS perspective excluding the impact of currency, we expect to achieve 5.5% to 6.5% and 6.5% to 7.5% respectively, inclusive of a 2.5 percentage point contribution from M&A for each.","Given our performance in the first quarter and the outlook for the balance of the year, we raised the contribution from acquisitions which provided an offset to the unplanned expenses in our Organic business in the first quarter. For modeling purposes, please note that we expect the momentum in terms of currency-neutral adjusted operating profit to accelerate in the second half of the year as we fully realize the benefits of our previously announced productivity improvement initiatives.","While our currency-neutral guidance has not changed, the effects of currency movements on our results have. From a top line perspective, the impact of currency improved by approximately 1 point to 1.5 percentage point headwind, primarily driven by an improvement in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate.","On a profit and EPS basis, movements in several currencies such as the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Indonesia rupiah and Mexican peso versus the dollar has had an adverse effect on our guidance as well as transaction rate differences on the timing of inventories.","We are hedged approximately 75% on euro profit exposure at $1.12 for 2017. As a result, on a full-year basis, we expect the impact of foreign exchange on adjusted operating profit to be approximately 2.5 percentage points and approximately 3 percentage points on adjusted EPS.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Rich. In summary, we are pleased that we achieved currency-neutral growth across all metrics in the first quarter of 2017. Sales growth was strong and overall currency-neutral adjusted operating profit was supported by a successful integration of recent acquisitions, evidence that we are allocating capital to the highest return initiatives.","Simultaneously, we continue to refocus on the execution of Vision 2020 as we believe our emphasis on building great differentiation and delivering profitable growth that will create incremental shareholder value long-term. For the full-year, we are optimistic that our financial growth rates should accelerate as our 2016 performance as we have confirmed our currency-neutral financial guidance.","With that, I would now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey. Morning, everybody. So, wanted to ask, if I heard correctly, the organic sales growth expectation is unchanged while EBIT and EPS are a little bit lower. So, I guess, on the top line, confidence in achieving accelerating organic sales growth through the year, including now off of a lower 1Q base. And I guess maybe putting it differently, too, what would have to happen for you to hit the low and the high end of that 3% to 4% range?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. Look, I think from a top-line standpoint, the first quarter was challenging. I think when we look at our full-year expectations, it's based on our current views in terms of confirmed new wins.","We do expect that volume erosion and the effects of destocking, expect to have less of a drag as we proceed through the balance of the year. We are expecting to see improved performance particularly in the second half of the year related to Lucas Meyer's. And we'll continue to see greater contribution from the faster growing acquisitions and their impact associated with local and regional customers.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","If I might add, and if you look at the acquisitions, you have certainly an impact from David Michael, which was done in the fourth quarter, but it's not the total quarter, so we have technically more sales than Fragrance Resource, which was closed basically mid of January, so that has an effect here as well.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Maybe just following on that. You sort of look at the business performance relative to peers. Clearly, IFF has been underperforming, depending on which you want to -you benchmark against at least of the other big public four companies. So, I guess, I'm curious what your thoughts are that has contributed to that. And then, sort of related to it from a geographic standpoint, why do you think developed markets contribute more than developing markets, in terms of the expected growth? And what are you specifically seeing that would be the underlying behind that?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay. Mark, I'll take it. First of all, we don't see an underperformance compared to competitors on a FX-neutral basis, that's number one. Last year, the first quarter is the first quarter, and I think we should look at the year.","Looking at the developing markets, we see actually right now a pretty good performance for certainly North America, in many regards, organically, but also through the acquisitions. Europe is actually amazingly strong for us, which is a good one.","Coming to the emerging markets, here, we see a lot of headwinds in terms of currency. I think all the currencies with exception of the euro, Rich just mentioned are all in the emerging markets, which are creating a lot of headwind for us. We see a lot of economic turmoil and volatility in Latin America, which is obviously an important customer not just for the Fragrance business \u2013 or region for the Fragrance business, in particular, Brazil is really not easy to manage right now.","We see certainly more turmoil in the Middle East as well, and China is volatile. So, you see that the emerging markets or the contribution of the emerging market was not as good or as, let's say, important as it was many years or the years before. We believe that we still \u2013 as our exposure to the emerging market that many of these markets will come back over time and will create again a growth engine for us looking forward during the, let's say, strategic planning horizon.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. So, looking at the outlook for the balance of the year, and Andreas, you just mentioned \u2013 sorry, I think it was Rich \u2013 about volume erosion and destocking being less pressure as we go through the year.","Just when we look at the results of some of your customers, largely in the U.S. more so for the food companies, but also the HPC (28:35) players, the first quarter was a shocking turn to the negative, and they all seemed very surprised.","So, I'm curious with degree to which you've seen that, sort of inventory adjustments for customers make its way to impact your business yet, or is that something we should still be anticipating in the second quarter?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hi, Lauren. It's Rich. I think couple of things from me. One, I would say that, again, while I expect and we expect to see less of an impact, it's not like it's based on a significant turnaround. We still expect to see pressure, and it's less about having less of a headwind, but it's still going to be headwind.","Our expectations are not based on having a significant turnaround, for example, in Latin America for Fragrances. Latin America for Flavors is quite strong and our full-year outlook for Flavors in Latin America is pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter.","I think when we look at our relationship to our customers, I think as there is a downward correction, we are more lagging. And I think when conditions are improving, we're probably an earlier indicator.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","And I might add on \u2013 if you look at the market and you have seen this between the big companies and the small or mid-market companies, it's really bifurcation of the market. And now for us, in particular in North America, increasing our share in the smaller customers is really beneficial for us, and it will help us with our growth rates as well going forward.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But, Andreas, were those \u2013 and I understand that and I know that's been a big piece of the strategy and the acquisitions, it all makes a ton of sense. I just wonder if those businesses are yet large enough to offset some of the pressure that may be ahead, even if it's a short-term, again, as Rich said, kind of lagging the correction that your larger customers in North America have seen in the last three months?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Actually, we see it now through, because it is now five acquisitions if we include PowderPure, and we are building critical mass. And what we see here is new wins as well going forward. And actually, all of these acquisitions \u2013 okay, I can't talk for PowderPure, it's probably between you. But all of the four acquisitions have at least double to triple the growth rate of regional business, and they are becoming an engine of growth for us. And I think it's helping.","I agree with you. At the beginning, when we had our first acquisition, it was very small. It was not moving the needle, but now accumulating more of these growth engines that's really, really helpful for us, and that's actually moving it forward. Particularly in North America, we see it actually big times, big times.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Lauren, I would...","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I would also say \u2013 sorry, Lauren. I would also say that \u2013 to what Andreas was talking about is, when you look at our win rates this year compared to our win rates last year, we feel good about where we are in both businesses. Volume erosion in the Q1 was above average, and as I said, I think we still expect to see pressure in the first half of this year.","As that works out, we've got \u2013 certainly the situation in Latin America is challenging. We've got key customers there. Two of the key local and regional customers are clearly going through destocking. And again, as I said, we're not expecting that to turn around significantly, but we expect the impact to lessen as we progress through the year.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, on the Ingredients business, so you mentioned that the spread between pricing and input costs, reading the Q, it just doesn't sound like the input cost basket is all that much worse, so it feels like maybe more pricing concessions or raw pressure in the business. So, can you just talk a little bit about that, and sort of plans to combat that dynamic?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. When you look overall, the net of pricing, the input costs is \u2013 as a percent of sales, the net impact in the quarter is little less than a point. Of that, about a third of that is price, so that's principally related to the Ingredients business.","Two-thirds of that \u2013 the other part of that is really, as we talked about in the commentary, it's related to the Fragrance compound business, both the effects of core list agreements and getting on to new agreements, as well as the volume-related rebates. So, it's principally \u2013 those are the two factors in that split.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And is that core list, kind of fee and rebates, is that something that's always been a feature of the business, or has things gotten more competitive, that that's kind of a new dynamic to get access?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","No. I think that's always been there for \u2013 as we get access to more business, I mean, there's a bigger impact to that. But the effect of the global and the large customers using \u2013 requiring that, it's been around for years.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. I'll pass it on; I'll come back if there's time. Thank you.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thanks.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","Your next question comes from Silke Kueck with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good. How are you doing?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thanks, Silke. I'm okay.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good. If you look at your 2% organic growth in the quarter, was it 3% volume, negative 1% price? Was it 4% volume, negative 2% price? Like, how does one think about it?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","As I mentioned earlier, I would say that the new win commercial performance was strong. It's in line with our long-term averages. Pricing was slightly unfavorable, and I talked about that \u2013 just my previous comments with Lauren. And as I also said, volume erosion was a little worse than the long-term averages.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So you \u2013 okay. So, that's a volume erosion, but organic growth, and you think your price were down slightly, so that's down like 0.5%. Is that what slightly is?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","So, if you \u2013 I mean, overall....","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, how do you measure negative price versus the rebate? Because it seems to me, you seem to capture rebates...","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","That's in price. That's embedded in the price number that I gave you.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. In terms of the Fragrance Resources acquisition, I think there was like no benefit from the sales considered added this quarter. Is that just a one-time event, having to do with like the inventory write-ups and then you expect the business to contribute for the rest of the year?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Are you talking about in the 10-Q, Silke?","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, just when I look at the Fragrance results and I look at the acquisition impact, like it looked like there was a sales impact that was positive, but no profit effect. So I was wondering, was that sort of like a one-time issue because you just bought it, you had to write-up inventories and you expect it to contribute to profits?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. There's two factors. One is, we have to write-up the inventory to basically selling price. So, the initial \u2013 as the initial sales of the inventory, we basically get no margin on it, or very little margin on it. I think that will continue probably for at least another quarter.","On top of that, we have, obviously, we have the step up in intangibles which will continue, and we'll have that for multiple years and it really drives the impact, the synergies. Ultimately, as we ramp up the synergies, that's how we get back to cost of capital returns.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I want to touch one more (36:38) like Latin America, because it seems that some of headwinds in Latin America has been \u2013 like when I look back, I think some of these we've seen now for like three quarters or four quarters and so. Like it does seem that by the time we get to the second quarter, your Latin America business should begin to get better.","Well, like it seems you had these headwinds for that time, it's like four quarters whereas headwinds of the consumer side than on Ingredient side \u2013 I'm sorry, on the Fine Fragrance side than on the Ingredient side?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I mean, again, from a business standpoint, Latin America again I think Flavors is performing well. From our Fragrance standpoint, we've got a couple of factors. Again, the macroeconomic factors are certainly impacting the overall region.","As I mentioned earlier, we've got a couple of key customers that their business is under pressure. And on top of that, we know that they're going through destocking. And that's \u2013 until they get to that process, it's going to continue to impact us.","I think the other factor is when you look at our Fabric business, which is our biggest business in consumer. We are a little bit \u2013 we are more indexed to the value-added segment, particularly related to our encapsulation around, say, something like fabric conditioner in a market like Latin America, we see consumers trading down and are not purchasing fabric conditioners as much as they are doing basic detergents. So, that's part of what's dragging the Consumer Fragrance business down and providing the big headwinds that we've seen for multiple quarters.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. The last question I have is, can you just explain \u2013 maybe I missed it \u2013 what the product recall relates to like and like in which region it affected?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. It's North America. There was a contamination issue that we traced back to one of our suppliers. Our own quality control and testing procedures identified the (38:49) contained the salmonella. We notified the customer and the FDA, and they've mandated a product recall. We don't believe it's reached the consumer, and there has been no reported illnesses.","As a result of that, we wrote off our sales related to the inventory, and we wrote off our remaining inventory, and that was the total charge of about $1.8 million in the quarter. We do believe it's probable that we're going to have additional losses and costs, but we can't estimate it at this point in time.","But we don't believe it's going to have a material impact on our financial condition, but it could have an impact on any particular quarter. And we'll also continue to pursue reimbursement. But again, it's very early in the process.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for the explanation. I'll get back into queue.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane.","Heidi Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Hi. Sorry if I missed this earlier. Could you update us on input costs, please? What was the impact in Q1? What do you expect for the full-year? And could you also update us on what you're seeing in vanilla in Madagascar? Thank you.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay. Just a couple of things there, Heidi. Impact in the first quarter was slightly unfavorable. We've got and that's higher input costs for the Flavors business, particularly driven by the naturals and the vanilla that we talked about previously. Favorable on the Fragrance side of the business, but slightly unfavorable in total.","For the full-year, I would say that we're looking probably at this point in the range of 3%. It could continue to go higher, depending upon what's going on with particularly vanilla. Vanilla continues to increase in the market. There's been supply constraints. There's a lot of pressure from a demand standpoint, and we continue to see vanilla prices going up.","Heidi Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","And I guess you have a bit of stop, so you're incubated from these market crisis for a couple of quarters. Would that be the right way to think about it?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. I would say we're more incubated on the David Michael side. And on the rest of our business, particularly in North America and Europe, we're working with our customers on pricing.","Heidi Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, I just wanted to \u2013 morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the pricing. So, we're talking about that our price is going up 3%. Have you \u2013 I know you said you're in the process of having conversations with your customers. Have you sort of gotten any pushback on taking pricing? Has the environment changed at all from previous years?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. So, again I think it's primarily in \u2013 the pricing is primarily in the natural side of the business and more on the Flavors side, as I mentioned earlier. Overall, that's reflected in roughly 3% guidance that I just mentioned earlier, and we are working with our customers on that to recover those costs.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. So, no change. And then just if you could talk a little bit about Ottens? And then I guess more broadly, if you could talk about what the organic growth of the business would've been assuming all of these acquisitions were in the base period?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","So, let me talk about the two acquisitions we did in North America and the Flavors side, Ottens and David Michael. This is all a lot of exposure towards the small and mid-size customers. We see here a good development. We see great new wins going forward, and we see that the performance is certainly outperforming the market.","If we look at our market data right now, we should be the market leader for this segment of the market which was the intent of these two acquisitions to make sure that we increase our exposure towards these faster-growing customers.","In terms of the sequencing, we acquired David Michael in October. So, I would say end of this October, it turns into organic. And Ottens is already organic. So, it's not accounted any longer as an M&A. Let's say, growth number is already an organic number and it's helping us with our organic growth acceleration anyway.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But if you assume that Fragrance Resources and David Michael were in the base, what would your pro forma organic growth would have been?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I mean, as we indicated, when you look at the first quarter, it was about 5 percentage points, worth of growth.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I'll follow-up offline. I mean, the 5 percentage includes the incremental benefit of like the entire sales, right? So, I just want to know sort of on an organic basis how those businesses are doing. But I'll follow-up.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. We can follow-up on it.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Curt Siegmeyer with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Curt.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just a follow-up on unplanned expenses. I know you clarified on the product recall cost uncertainty related to that, but would you expect any costs related to the manufacturing or the bad debt litigation to carry into 2Q or beyond?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Bad debt, no. I think, we might have a little bit of carryover into Q2 on the manufacturing side. The reactor is back up and running, so that's not going to be an issue for Q2. But the other issue where we've ramped-up the new manufacturing process, there will be a little bit of carryover into Q2.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then just on Fine Fragrances in Latin America, the volume erosion that you experienced there. I know that's been an issue for several quarters in a row. But I'm just wondering, when you compare that to the Flavors side that showed really solid volume growth, is there a vast difference in the geographic exposure and that being part of the reason as the economic conditions that impacted Fine Fragrances not \u2013 is impactful on the Flavors side or maybe just some more color around that?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I would say, Curt, that certainly the Fine Fragrances is in a, let's say, in a weak economic environment, more discretionary item and people save on it. But on the food side, probably not so much.","And with all products, in particular, in Latin America, we are let's say exposed to let's say better cost solutions like with the powder drinks, for example. So, that we basically hitting actually an area which has good growth rates.","Unfortunately, that's not the case with the Fine Fragrances and here we have to say as well as particularly two of our local customers where we are very strong, we have very high win rates, still they are suffering volume losses here. So, that's what it is. That actually is the difference between the Flavors and the Fragrance business as well.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","And the destocking that I mentioned earlier.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","And the destocking. Yeah.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. That makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Morning.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Morning.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Maybe a question on customer activity and I know you talked about some, obviously the sales pressures that your customers are facing have been significant especially in Latin America. And you've talked about new business wins start to layer into the portfolio later this year.","Can you talk about the activity level in terms of new briefs and if your larger MNC customers in particular have maybe shifted a little bit out of (47:30) kind of cost containment and are actually trying to accelerate that new product cycle to reinvigorate growth and how that provides visibility to get later into this year or into 2018?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","It's a very, very good question. We see it actually stable for the big ones compared with last year. But we are seeing increasing activity from the smaller customers and particularly on the Flavors side. And that's encouraging taking our strategy into account, while we are increasing our exposure here. But in the big ones, we haven't seen an increased level so far. It's just pretty stable compared to what it was last year.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then on the Fine Fragrance side, in your customers' distribution, it's disrupting, to say the least, with the department stores, especially in North America. Are you starting to see that flow back into your business in terms of the customer , as new distribution channels become much more important to that business?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yes. Absolutely. And you hit the nail here. It is, in particular, North America, where the distribution model that's changing, and particularly on the more Mass (48:43) Fragrance, Fine Fragrance part. And here, it's actually of the essence to make sure that we as well, and our customers, let's say, find the right mix of the products between the prestige, the premium, and the mass and masstige (49:00) market. I think that's really, really important.","Interesting enough, it looks \u2013 at the moment, it's very much a North America issue. Europe looks still different. And if you look at our growth rates, you can reconcile that. But that's certainly a topic for our customers, and ultimately a topic for us as well.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And can you talk about the margin implications of that? Do you see that presenting risks, as some of those Fine Fragrance can be particularly rich in terms of the margins?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. At least not on our end so far. No, we don't see any risks.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. Andreas, I want to talk about, could you give us a rough sense, your split of business between \u2013 across the company \u2013 between the large global companies and smaller regional companies? I know you talked, gave us a little detail about the trends there, but what is that \u2013 how big have smaller regional companies, however you want to customers define that, become within your mix?","It is \u2013 I mean, I know the trends are better, is the cost-to-serve those customers, because of increased complexity, a little bit higher than your larger customers, at least on a marginal basis? And is that maybe part of what we saw this quarter, or is there anything to that? I'd just like to understand it.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Well, it's a good point. So, for us, our exposure, big two, the smaller one is roundabout 50\/50. What we see is, or what you have to do if you serve the smaller customers is that you need a differentiated service model, which creates, let's say, actually a better approach for these customers which is more agile, faster, more nimble, and has certainly, also on our side, probably lesser exposure to cost, because the good thing is, many of these customers are making faster decisions, and you basically get the business earlier and faster than with the bigger ones.","And usually, you don't have a core list exposure where you have to say, bigger rebates to get on this list, for example. And that's the reason why, on the Flavors side here, in the U.S., we are having kind of a standalone facility now serving these customers.","And that's basically everything, the whole operation between Ottens and David Michael, with some of our smaller business together to make sure that we take into consideration a really differentiated service model here. That's the only way that you can become successful in this market segment.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sorry. Go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Yeah. I was just going to say, would you say the \u2013 is there a structural cost to service you here at the margin that it just gets harder \u2013 I mean, a lot \u2013 it seems to me like a lot of your growth in margin over the past five years has been making everything more efficient, focusing on more \u2013 larger briefs for huge customers, and this is a lot of what you've done. And now like a little bit more complexity maybe erodes that at the margin, but maybe brings some other things. So I just like to understand how that margin works structurally?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. So, let me just put some \u2013 a little bit in context. When you look at the year-over-year margin profile for the business, if you take the currency impact out, which is probably 80 basis points, if you take out the effect of the unplanned expenses that I mentioned earlier, which is probably 70 basis points at the margin level, so if you \u2013 absent those two factors, our margin year-over-year will be slightly positive.","So, your cost-to-serve element, there's different components. Andreas talked about the Flavors side of it. If I look at the compound side for Fragrances, the smaller customers, we have less from a cost-to-serve standpoint, because more of that business is going to come off of our \u2013 out of our bank, and we have less of a creative demand related to the local and regional customers.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Hundley with Vertical Group.","Brett Hundley - Vertical Group","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, guys. First, just a quick one. I'm sorry if I missed this, but what is M&A now expected to contribute to currency-neutral sales and EPS growth? Before, it was expected to contribute 4.5% to sales and 1.5% to EPS growth. And I think you guys said that that stepped up a little bit. Did you give those revised figures?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","We didn't. I mean, it's about 1.5% at top line and 2.5% at the operating profit line. So it shifted a little bit, given the strong performance in the Q1 from the M&A business and the unplanned expenses on our Organic business in Q1.","Brett Hundley - Vertical Group","I'm sorry, you said 1.5% top line, incremental 1.5%?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","The M&A impact, about 1.5% top line and 2.5% operating profit.","Brett Hundley - Vertical Group","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then, just for you and\/or Andreas, even with these regionals, these smaller customers increasing as a percentage of your mix, as you well know, M&A is an increasingly greater proportion of your sales growth today versus previous quarters or previous years, however you want to look at it.","And when we talk to other ingredient companies in the industry, other adjacent companies, they are increasingly talking about blends \u2013 ingredient blends as getting more and more in focus from a customer standpoint, being in greater demand relative to just single Flavor and Fragrance compound.","And I know some of these guys are obviously talking their book, because that's what they produce. So, maybe I'll give you guys a chance to talk your book and discuss if you are seeing that as well and maybe how you guys are set up to handle any related shift?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","So, I would not say that you see a trend in that, but we see certainly that this is an opportunity. And if you look at on the Flavor side at our PowderPure acquisition, then this is certainly going into an adjacent part of the business, which could certainly add to that quite significantly.","On the Fragrance side, I'm actually not so sure. I would say on the Fine Fragrance, you deliver the whole package anyway despite the packaging material. But we haven't seen anything else on the Consumer Fragrance side. There's probably more trend we see towards the Flavors and Ingredients business.","And then here, we are taking account of it, but we have to make sure as well as that you keep your margin profile because some of these, let's say, complete solutions are not the most profitable ones, but we have to make sure that we manage that in a very careful way here.","Brett Hundley - Vertical Group","That makes sense. Thank you so much.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","You're welcome.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Brett, let me make one correction to what I just said. At the top line, it's about 4.5%. I transposed currency versus M&A.","Brett Hundley - Vertical Group","Okay.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","So, it's about 4.5% top line.","Brett Hundley - Vertical Group","Got you. So, no change to the top line impact and instead of 1.5% health now on the bottom line, it's 2.5% health?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Correct.","Brett Hundley - Vertical Group","All right. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I was actually going to clarify that so that's helpful. And then the other thing was on reinvestment spending. Another unexpected expenses in the quarter, but I just want to check in where in that bridge which we could find kind of any reinvestment considering there was this quarter?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","It's basically going to get netted in the cost and productivity, but again it's been limited, given the environment. I mean, I think the big part of the reinvestment is going to come as we talked about later this year and into 2018 as we get the full benefits associated with the productivity program.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then also on the bridge, the six-point contribution from volume. Is that inclusive of \u2013 that's including volume from acquisitions I would think, because I thought it sounded like total company volume wouldn't have that much positive leverage to it?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","So, the M&A's impact, all the M&A's in the...","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","...is in the M&A line.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","It is totally separate. So, is this level of volume growth which was \u2013 I would have thought was slightly down total volume. I was just surprised that there was this, again, positive leverage?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I will go back and check it, but...","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","...that's apples-to-apples.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of one question per person.","I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Global Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau - Vice President, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's first quarter 2016 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements.","During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for the full-year 2016. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 1, 2016 and our press release that we filed yesterday, all of which are on our website.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release.","With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Alison Cornell. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have.","I would now like to introduce Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Michael. I would like to start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the first quarter. Then I will provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, I'll ask Alison to cover our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then I will provide some concluding remarks and we'll finish by taking any questions that you may have.","I'm pleased with how we started 2016. Given the volatile global operating environment and against our strong year-ago growth comparison, currency-neutral sales grew 6%, which was comprised of 5% growth in Flavors and 8% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top-line growth benefited by approximately 4 percentage points related to the contribution of our recent acquisitions of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer's Cosmetics. Our organic business, which had stronger performance than we anticipated, grew 2% on currency-neutral basis. The driver of out-performance can be attributed to improved volume trends versus what we have experienced in the fourth quarter 2015. In addition, we also benefited from an increased contribution of commercial performance, as new win growth was strong, particularly in fragrance compounds.","On profitability perspective, we strategically reinvested and our business was simultaneously delivering 7% currency-neutral adjusted operating profit growth and a 20 basis points expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. The driver of our profit improvement was strong gross profit performance driven primarily by volume growth, the benefits of productivity initiatives, and contribution of acquisitions. Currency-neutral EPS improved 11%, as we gained additional leverage from a more favorable effective tax rate and a reduction in shares outstanding.","With respect to Vision 2020, we continue to make progress each quarter. Differentiation through innovation is crucial to our success. With that in mind, I'm happy to report that one of our key R&D focus areas, delivery systems, continued to be a growth driver in the first quarter. In Fragrances, the strong trend from encapsulation-related sales continued as currency-neutral sales improved high-single-digit led by Fabric Care and Toiletries.","In the first quarter, Fabric Care grew high-single-digits on a currency-neutral basis with all geographies posting strong growth, led by a double-digit increase in North America and high-single-digit growth in EAME and Greater Asia.","In Flavors, another key focus area for us is modulation, as sales of our sweetness & savory modulation portfolio continued to post strong growth, improving strong double-digits on a currency-neutral basis, led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage. This is further proof that our innovative solutions are allowing us to meet our customers' demand for healthier and better-for-you products.","In the first quarter, we also commercialized two new flavor molecules and one new natural sweetness modulator to give our flavors more novel technologies to build winning solutions for our customers.","We continue to see accelerated growth in the areas where we are targeting market leadership positions. In North America, we saw 11% currency-neutral increase for the first quarter 2016, driven by our recent acquisitions and strong growth in Fragrances. Within North America Fragrances, Consumer Fragrance improved mid-single-digits and Fine Fragrances grew double-digits, led by strong new win performance.","Leveraging our longstanding presence and in-depth consumer knowledge, we are focused on the Middle East and Africa as a growth driver. In the first quarter, we achieved strong growth across both Flavors and Fragrances to deliver a double-digit improvement on a currency-neutral basis.","The mid to high single-digit growth trends we have seen in recent years in Consumer Fragrances continued into the first quarter of 2016. Within that segment, Home Care, a strategic area of focus for us, grew mid-single-digits on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Latin America.","In Flavors Latin America, we delivered 8% currency-neutral sales growth or 14% on a two-year average basis, based on our continued success leveraging innovation with key customers.","We continue to position ourselves to be a customer's partner of choice and to-go supplier. In the first quarter, IFF | Lucas Meyer's Cosmetics won a Silver Innovation award at the In-Cosmetic Conference held in Paris for Miniporyl. For those of you who have not had a chance to experience this product, Miniporyl is an active ingredient which is extracted from a red clover flower and is a natural pore minimizer designed to rebalance skin conditions responsible for pore enlargement.","Because of our continued commitment to sustainability and focus on weaving it into all aspects of our business and corporate culture, we were rated gold and ranked a top supplier by EcoVadis. EcoVadis aims at improving environmental and social practices of companies by leveraging the influence of global supply chains.","During quarter one, we also joined the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which is an organization of forward-thinking companies that stimulate the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. We are excited to be part of an organization that works together across sectors, geographies and value chains to explore, develop and scale up business solutions to address the world's most pressing sustainability challenges.","In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, I'm happy to report that our two recent strategic acquisitions continue to perform well. IFF | Lucas Meyer's Cosmetics achieved double-digit growth on a standalone basis and IFF | Ottens Flavors posted solid growth for the quarter on a standalone basis, led by regional customers. We believe their performance is a good indication that we are putting our capital towards long-term value-creating opportunities.","Let me conclude by saying how pleased we are with the strategic progress we have made so far this year. We look forward to building on this momentum as we progress through the balance of the year.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Andreas. I would like to reiterate our strong financial performance for the first quarter. I am pleased that we were able to deliver sales growth of 6%, adjusted operating profit growth of 7%, and adjusted EPS growth of 11%, all on a currency-neutral basis. Our performance can be attributed to improved volume trends, which we believe includes the timing of orders from fourth quarter of 2015 to first quarter of 2016, and strong new win performance.","I would also like to take an opportunity to provide commentary on our adjusted EBITDA, given M&A has become a larger component of our strategy and is a key indicator of comparison to our largest competitors. We continue to see profitability and margin progression as our adjusted EBITDA grew 6% versus the prior-year period, inclusive of currency. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded a very strong 120 basis points, principally driven by volume leverage, the benefits of cost and productivity initiatives, and mixed benefits resulting from the inclusion of IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics and IFF | Ottens Flavors.","Turning to business unit performance. Flavors currency-neutral sales increased 4%, primarily driven by approximately 4 percentage points relating to the acquisition of IFF | Ottens Flavors. It is important to note that this growth was on top of strong 9% currency-neutral growth in the first quarter of 2015. The improvement was led by high-single-digit increases in North America, inclusive of our acquisition of IFF | Ottens Flavors, and Latin America, reflecting double-digit growth in Savory, Sweet and Dairy. Greater Asia posted low-single-digit growth, as increases in India and Thailand were more than offset by softness in China, although trends in China improved sequentially.","Within Greater Asia and on a category perspective, growth was driven by new win performance, particularly with relative strength in Dairy and Sweet. Europe, Africa and the Middle East decreased 1% against 9% growth from the comparable year-ago period, as softness in Western Europe more than offset a strong, high-single-digit improvement in the Middle East and Africa.","Flavors currency-neutral segment profit grew approximately 1%, primarily resulting from the contribution of IFF | Ottens Flavors and strong benefits from productivity initiatives.","Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 8%, including approximately 4 percentage points associated with the acquisition of IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics with all regions posting growth, led by a double-digit increase in North America and high-single-digit growth in Latin America.","From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances improved 7% as a result of a very strong pipeline of new wins, led by North America which achieved strong double-digit growth followed by mid-single-digit growth in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and low-single-digit growth in Latin America. Consumer Fragrances grew 6% with broad-based growth across all sub-categories. Technology-driven innovation in Fabric Care and Personal Wash contributed high-single-digit increases.","Within Consumer Fragrances, on a geographic basis, all regions delivered growth, led by a double-digit increase in Latin America and a mid-single-digit increase in North America, both on a currency-neutral basis. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 15% driven primarily by the acquisition of IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics.","Our base Fragrance Ingredients business, which as a reminder are the external sales that we do not use for our internal compounds production, remains soft, reflecting continued challenging market conditions as well as our prioritization of capacity to further strengthen our internal Fragrance Compounds business as evidenced by our mid-single-digit Fragrance Compounds growth.","From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency-neutral segment profit was very strong, growing about 15% year-over-year, driven by robust volume growth, the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives, and more favorable mix. This performance led to over 130-basis-point improvement in currency-neutral operating profit margin.","Our operating cash flow in the first quarter was $32 million compared with $31 million in the prior-year period. Our core working capital levels were challenged, principally driven by the timing of payables. We expect this impact to normalize as we progress throughout 2016.","From a capital structure standpoint, we spent approximately $23 million in expenditures, and continue to believe we will spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As noted on our year-end call, this increase will principally be driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia, primarily related to a new Flavors manufacturing plant in China, which was disclosed on our Q4 conference call, and investments in technology expansions.","With regard to China, I'd like to provide some additional commentary as it relates to our Fragrance Ingredients plants. We, as well as other chemical plants in the same industrial zone, received a request from the Chinese government to relocate our Fragrance Ingredients plant in Zhejiang. Currently, we are in discussions with the government regarding the intent, purpose and timing of the request of relocation. If we were ultimately required to move, our company and government authorities would need to agree upon the amount and nature of government compensation, including adequate timing and financial support.","This is similar to a move required a few years ago when we worked in partnership with the Chinese government to relocate one of our Fragrance Ingredients plants from one industrial park to another over an extended period with minimal business impact. Please note that the relocation request is an evolving situation. We will continue to keep you updated.","Regarding cash returned to shareholders, in Q1, we spent approximately $45 million on dividend payout and $40 million on share repurchases. Given these levels and our outlook for the rest of the year, we expect to meet our total payout ratio objective of 50% to 60% of adjusted net income.","Looking to the balance of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. While there are some indications that the global environment has marginally improved, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic with respect to achieving our previously-stated financial guidance for 2016, given the persistent volatility in the market. And it is still early in the year, and we believe that the first quarter 2016 partially benefited from timing of orders from Q4 of 2015 to Q1 of 2016. We do not think it is prudent to extrapolate results.","In the second quarter, I'd like to remind everyone that we are comparing to a low effective tax rate in the prior-year period when we benefited from the timing of an R&D tax credit. That benefit is not expected to repeat itself again this year. As a reminder, for the full year 2016, we expect 3.5% to 4.5% currency-neutral sales growth, including approximately 1.5 percentage point of contribution from the acquisitions of IFF | Ottens Flavors and IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of a 1.5 percentage point contribution from M&A. Currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, led by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program.","Given the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I would also like to address the impact of currency on our financial results. While our currency-neutral guidance has not changed, we have updated our guidance to reflect the movement of the U.S. dollar to other world currencies since the beginning of the year. As I have discussed in the past, the euro is clearly the largest driver in terms of our currency basket, representing approximately 35% of our profit exposure. Previously, we expected the devaluation of the euro versus the U.S. dollar to represent approximately 4 percentage point out of our original 5 percentage point headwind to profit in 2016. Now, given the euro-USD exchange rate in Q1, the fact that we are hedged approximately 75% at $1.14 in 2016 and assuming a spot rate of $1.13, we expect about a 3 percentage point impact from the euro as our expected weighted average exchange rate for 2016 is $1.135 versus our average rate of $1.25 for 2015.","The rest of the currencies within our basket have improved versus our original guidance and now are expected to effectively offset one another on a profitability basis. As such, we expect currency to have a 2-percentage-point impact on sales versus 2.5 percentage points previously assumed. We expect a 3 percentage point impact on operating profit and EPS should current rates remain constant for the balance of the year.","The increased volatility in duration of the currency movement continues to have a significant impact on our reported results. We measure the impact of currency on various fronts, including translation and transaction impacts as well as timing effects associated with our supply chain and inventory movement.","We recognize that there are potentially different approaches that can be used to measure this impact and that the methodology differs amongst our industry and peer group. We regularly review our methodology to determine if either a more refined or simpler approach is warranted in order to ensure that we provide investors increased insight to our underlying operating performance, greater alignment with how the business is run, or information that is more usable for comparison purposes. While we are in the process of our current review, we believe that if we were to adopt a different methodology, it would likely have a positive impact on our currency-neutral adjusted operating profit growth in 2016.","With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Alison. In summary, I am pleased with how we started off the year. Financially, the entire organization collectively achieved strong results as evident by our 6% sales growth, 7% adjusted operating profit growth, and 11% adjusted EPS growth all on currency-neutral basis.","As Alison just commented, we are on a pace and have increased confidence to achieve our previously stated currency-neutral financial guidance for 2016. Simultaneously, we continue to be focused on the execution of Vision 2020 as we believe our emphasis on building great differentiation and accelerating profitable growth will create incremental shareholder value over the long term.","With that, I would now like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, and good morning, everybody. I appreciate the color on the benefit to first quarter results from the 4Q weakness in terms of some of the pull-forward or push-back. I guess, modeling-wise, is there anything we should be aware of that would impact the two-year stack in sort of thinking about how the second quarter trends would be shaping up? And if you don't want to specifically comment on that, how do we think about progression relative to 4Q\/1Q levels through 2016, would be helpful.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks for the question, Mark. So, from a second quarter perspective, we do not plan to comment on second quarter. If we think about the fourth quarter, fourth quarter especially if we neutralize for the 53rd week was abnormally low. We did have relative strength in the first quarter, our volumes improved sequentially, we had strong commercial performance. But despite that, as you look at the relatively low performance in Q4 to Q1, we do think that it was impacted. So, with respect to Q2, we think it's too early to talk about it as we're only one month in and especially given the volatility in our customer order patterns. Having said that, though, we do expect growth to accelerate as we progress throughout the year and remain committed to our guidance.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And just to follow up on that, if you look at the two-year CAGR average 4Q 2015 to 1Q 2016, it's somewhere in the high 2%s. So, I guess, the question is, A, that's relative to 2% to 3% that you've talked about for the year organically. But in that context, what does it say about the current end demand general in terms of what you see from a customer standpoint, maybe even specifically comment on global versus local\/regional. You've talked about that dynamic in the past. And then, if you could tie it into the acceleration needed to get back to your long-term targets of 4% to 6%, will be helpful.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I think if we step back, coming into 2016, we noted that our organic business would be softer than our long-term targets overall given the macroeconomic conditions, customer order volatility, limited volume growth from our customers, as indicated. Having said that, if we bifurcate first half versus second half, we expect our growth to accelerate throughout the year as we exit our 2016 business based on additional access to new business, strong new win performance that we know that we already have that will manifest itself in the second half and also the benefits that we're seeing from our innovation, continued benefit. And so, feel good as we exit 2016, going into 2017 and believe that we are on target to deliver our long-term targets that we indicated.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. First, I was wondering if you could comment, though, overall on market growth trends. Throughout last year, acknowledging it was very choppy, there were points at which you felt that local customers were still kind of performing relatively well and their consumption was up versus the global. So, where do you think things sort of stand now in terms of market growth?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Lauren, This is Andreas. Thank you for the question and, unfortunately, we believe that the global environment is still pretty volatile and choppy, as you were saying, because we see in some areas of the world, we see actually very good growth trends. We just came back, Alison and myself, from the Middle East and Africa. We see good double-digit growth in the region despite the political unrest. We have other areas, for example in China, where we are seeing basically a slowdown in growth. So you see from the geographic point of view, it's very volatile at the moment and even in the U.S., it's not super consistent what we are seeing.","On top of it, we see differences in between the different categories. Let me give you an example. If you look, for example, to modulation, our sweetness modulation, that's something which is certainly facilitating our growth, because we see more countries moving in towards sugar tags. UK just did it. South Africa is going to bring to do it. So that's something which is driving growth in the category. But in other categories, we don't see as much growth because it goes against it. So it's a very complex picture, and that's the reason why we say we really have to deal with that kind of volatility around the globe. So we believe that the market probably has a growth for Flavors and Fragrances between 2% and maybe 3%, but that's very much on the high end. On the active Cosmetics, we still see much higher, higher growth trends between, let's say, 5% and 6%. So it's a pretty difficult picture at the moment.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, if you could offer a little bit more color on North America Flavors performance, both excluding Ottens, organic still down as expected. But at what point do you think that turns? I believe there have been some big wins on sweetness modulation around this time last year, so maybe we are starting to lap tough comps. And then also on Ottens, I think the language in the deck changed, that previously you have been talking about that business growing double-digits and now it's sort of, quote, solid. So, anything that changed there would be helpful as well.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let's talk about the organic business first. We believe it will change in the second half of the year, so that's very, very clear. And Ottens is still performing, let's say, above our business case, and we have actually pretty tough comps here as well on the Ottens business. And what we have said before is that we see, in particular with the customer base we have with this business, a higher growth rate than with some of our more bigger and more established customers.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just one last one, if I may. Latin America was just very strong seemingly across the board. And in the press release, anyway, you didn't specifically mention Beverages. I believe that had been \u2013 the Beverage encapsulation had been a driver of the Flavors growth there. So if you can talk anything more specifically about what's driven Latin America to be so strong in obviously such a very tough macroeconomic environment would be great.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Absolutely. So we still see it in the Beverage category for us on the Flavors side, and we're actually pretty proud, because it looks like this category in particular is a certain delivery system for powders. It's helping us because it facilitates growth in a population category, which is lower middle class and lower income, which is really helping us to drive our growth there. And we see it basically on the modulation as well. And here again, the scene comes back. I just touched on it with the sweetness modulation. So, replacement of sugar and helping with sweetness modulation is something which is a big trend and which helps us with our sales in that category.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks so much.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice start to the year. Any thoughts on when you think Flavors can sort of turn the corner in total for currency-neutral sales growth this year, excluding acquisitions?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's second half, very, very clearly.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And back to the kind of normal growth rates we've seen historically, and what's driving that?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say normal growth rate depends on how you define the normal, because what we are seeing is a bit of a slowdown in market, and I think that's what you hear from many of our competitors as well. The new normal might be, let's say, 2.5% market growth and we believe that we can outperform the market. But the question is how much it is at the end. And we see certainly a softer trend in greater Asia, which is certainly driven by China, because remember, we had for many years, we had high double-digit growth rates in China. And these times might be over. And Western Europe is certainly also not a super bright spot here. So we are probably back to the new normal.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just one quick follow-up. Acquisitions seem to have worked out well for you this year and just in general. How is the environment, particularly in the Cosmetics active? That seems to be an area where there could be a lot of opportunity to buy attractive assets.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, first of all, we are very happy with the two acquisitions we did last year because they are performing very, very, very well and driving revenue growth. So when we look at M&A in general, we look what could provide technology to us, because we really believe that differentiation comes through technology and through innovation. So that's something. We really look whether it could provide us access to customers and regions where we are right now not very well representatives. And we're certainly looking at adjacencies. And you just mentioned the active Cosmetics, and that's certainly one of the areas where we ventured in and where we want to build our position, first of all, through high organic \u2013 double-digit organic growth, but through some more M&A activities here as well. We are certainly screening the market as usually and we are conducting due diligence on a number of potential opportunities and, if it makes good sense, like last year, we are moving forward. And we certainly have a good financial discipline, but Alison might comment on that one.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So in addition to the strategic filters that Andreas went through, we also have a series of financial filters, one being EPS-accretive year one, and then economic profit positive in years three to five. So to the extent it meets the strategic filters and the financial filters, we would potentially move forward. But we do those things in tandem.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Faiza.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just wanted to talk about your trends to-date relative to what your guidance was three months ago. So, clearly you have exceeded your plan for the first quarter. So, maybe if you could just go through what were the specific areas, whether it's countries or categories where you exceeded your expectations for the first quarter. So what was surprising to you on the upside?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I think Fragrances clearly did well across all regions, all categories, all geographies. From a Flavors perspective, we had strength in Sweet, Savory, Dairy, but we had volume strength, volume leverage. Along with that from a bottom line perspective, we also had cost productivity initiatives that benefited us. We also had net price to input costs favorability. And so \u2013 but I think the main driver of our strength in the first quarter was clearly Fragrances.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What do you think...","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In consumer.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. What do you think drove that strength? Do you think it was more -was there a recovery? Just the impact going from Q4 2015 to 1Q 2016 was just more than you had expected? Or was there something sort of underlying in the market that drove that upside?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. So I think it's a number of things, so one item being the shift between \u2013 of course, possibly timing between Q4 and Q1. Another is stronger commercial performance and so we had less erosion combined with stronger commercial new win performance that contributed to the overall strength in the quarter.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Hi. So you've been talking about how you report organic growth or currency-neutral growth differently from your peers, and I think this is what you are alluding to in Alison's last slide. If we were to adjust the 6% growth rate, in line with peers, do you know what that number might be?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, from an organic perspective, I mean, we don't have exact calculations, but I would double it.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","So, 12%?","Michael DeVeau - Vice President, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Organic.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Organic.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Organic is double? Okay. So, 4%.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","And then would you have the equivalent number for full-year 2015?","Michael DeVeau - Vice President, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","It's roughly 5%. This is Mike, Heidi.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I apologize if this got asked earlier since I just jumped on the call late. But some of your major customers have been implementing zero-based budgeting. Do you need to go to something like that model as well?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, we as well are implementing a zero-based budgeting. We are in the early stages. We actually started \u2013 I would say we dipped our toe in the water last year as we did our 2016 budget, but are moving forward with that on a broader scale in 2016.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So basically for the budget, John, this is Andreas, for the budget 2017.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then could you remind us of the split in business between local\/regional customers versus global customers in both the Flavors and Fragrance segments? And was the gap in performance between those kind of two categories several percentage points difference in growth or was it much smaller than that?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It is \u2013 actually the difference in growth, I start with the last one, is smaller because we have seen one or two of our big customers was really, really good and nice growth rates in the first quarter. The business is still split by 50:50 roundabout for us between the two categories, local\/regionals and global customers. And actually it's a split we really like, because as you well know, it's also the split in terms of emerging markets and mature market is 50:50. Flavors, Fragrances, almost a 50:50 relationship. That helps us in these volatile times actually to balance our business fairly well.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Silke Kueck with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Do you have a sense for what the size of your sweetener modulation business is by now? Is it like in the tens of millions or is it larger than that?","Michael DeVeau - Vice President, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Silke, this is Mike. Let us come back to you on that. Traditionally, the way we have to go back on our systems to kind of proportionately allocate it to determine what the actual size is. We talked about our encapsulation size on our CAGNY Conference when we were in CAGNY this past February. But on the modulation, we have to dimensionalize in terms of size. Let us come back for that one.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And secondly, I was wondering if you knew how much favorable price cost contribution was to your gross margin.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, from a net price input, it was very small. About 10 basis points.","Michael DeVeau - Vice President, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Yeah.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And my last question is, is the Lucas Meyer acquisition, does that contribute anything to EPS growth in the quarter? Or will it this year?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Michael DeVeau - Vice President, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","It's accretive","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. It's accretive.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Okay. Thanks very much.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And your next question is a follow-up with Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Glad I got back in. So I did have a quick question about vanillin. I know that the relationship with Evolva is changing. I believe they're kind of taking that back and the commercialization didn't really go maybe as well as planned. It'd be great if you could just articulate why. What are kind of the learnings from that experience, particularly as vanilla was cited as an area of potential cost inflation this year? That'd be just really interesting to learn about. Thanks.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So we're taking the vanillin from Evolva for our own internal consumption, so not so much to sell it externally. And you are right; the vanilla prices are pretty high. We will see how the price trend will go on over time, but I can't make projections right now. I think for the rest the year, we should be fine because we think we have everything in stock we need, we are covered. But for 2017, we will see how the price trend moves on, but it's hard to predict right now.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And was the expectation that this was going to be \u2013 I mean, what changed I guess in the expectation that this was going to be a product you could commercialize more broadly externally than is proving to be the case?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It depends actually, Lauren, on the price because whenever we do \u2013 in this industry, when you do something in the biotech space, you try to get, let's say, stable supply to a certain price. And if the raw material is not any longer \u2013 let's say you can't buy enough, then the biotech version kicks in or if the price really goes through the roof and you have a good manufacturing price in place. And that's what helps us to balance these kind of movements.","So as soon as if the price would go up even further, then there might be an opportunity to commercialize that, but that's not the case at the moment. So for us, basically it's a supply backup solution.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Hi. So Symrise's CEO was talking on an interview recently that the M&A multiples are far too high and they're choosing to focus on CapEx. Are you still confident on your guidance of CapEx to sales falling through to 2020? I wondered if you don't find any accretive deals, is there scope to develop new technologies or even enter adjacencies organically or do you actually need to acquire to get into these new segments. Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Heidi, for the question. I certainly can't comment on Heinz-J\u00fcrgen's comments here. But what is clear for us is that in the last couple of years we have invested a lot in CapEx. You know we have built new manufacturing plants in Indonesia, in Turkey, in China, and that helped us a lot. On our agenda, as you well know, we have still India and a second plant in China, but that's basically built into our plan for the coming years. So we believe we might spend between 4.5% and 5% for the next two years, maybe three years on CapEx and then CapEx will go down to more of the maintenance level of 3.5 percentage points. So nothing has changed on our side.","In terms of the valuation of M&A targets, I agree they're usually high, but they were high last year as well and we are very happy with the two acquisitions we have done. So I think it always depends what kind of targets you find and for what kind of price you can close and what kind of strategy you apply then afterwards to make the business grow. So I would be more optimistic that you still can find good targets, and you know we are not doing anything outrageous here. We really want to make sure that we are financially very disciplined with what we acquire.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","And you have a question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for the follow-up, all. Two questions unrelated. One, could you talk about the price-cost relationship over the balance of the year in terms of what anticipated benefit you might get from pricing versus what potentially happens from an input cost standpoint? And then secondly on China, following up on the question, I guess the last question, CapEx-wise. So there's been a bunch of moving parts even since last June's Investor Day about goings on in China. How much is incremental in terms of what the CapEx spend is going to be for potentially one, two new facilities? What's your current capacity utilization in that market? And how do you think about it when the dust settles in terms of what the ultimate number of facilities will be relative to what your needs are and relative to your competitors from a positioning standpoint?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Maybe I'll start with a very macro picture on China. First of all, what you see in China is nothing very specific to IFF. You have seen it through basically all of our competitors and many of our customers and other companies. So it seems to be the way you have to operate in China. That's number one.","Number two is that we have made a decision that whatever we do in China was exceptional of our Ingredients plant for Fragrances, everything is for the local demand. We are not going to export out of China. So we do basically our manufacturing in China. I think that's important to know as well. It's not a big, let's say, export hub for us.","And now, Alison can talk about the financials.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So you asked about incremental CapEx associated with China, at this point, it's $45 million that we've assumed. From a capacity utilization perspective, it's about 50%. But we're considering the second site as more of a contingency or backup site. So that's essentially how we're using it as needed. Your first question in terms of price-cost input, we expect it to be favorable for the remainder of the year.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","At this time, I will now turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you very much for all of the questions. And in summary, I would say we are on track for the year and we are on track for Vision 2020. Thank you again and talk to you soon. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"11637":["International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed our press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements.","During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our full year 2017. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 1, 2016 and our press release that we filed yesterday.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday.","With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have.","With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Michael. I would like to start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the full year. Then, I want to provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Rich to cover our financial results in greater detail, including a comprehensive review of our fourth quarter, cash flow statement and cash return to shareholders. Then we will both provide commentary as it relates to our outlook for 2017 and finish by taking any questions that you may have.","Starting with a financial review of our consolidated results for the full year 2016, I am pleased to report that consolidated currency-neutral sales grew 5%. Both business units successfully delivered growth, with 6% in Flavors and 4% in Fragrances.","Overall, top line growth was supported by our organic business, which grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis, as we continue to benefit from strong new win performance. In addition, Ottens Flavors, Lucas Meyer Cosmetics and David Michael contributed 2 percentage points of growth.","For the full year 2016, consolidated adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis increased 4%, led by volume growth, productivity initiatives, and the contribution of acquisitions. This improvement in currency-neutral adjusted operating profit when combined with a more favorable effective tax rate and a reduction in shares outstanding led to a 6% increase in our currency-neutral adjusted EPS in 2016.","On a full year basis, we continue to make strategic progress. Starting with our Innovating Firsts pillar, in 2016, we commercialized four highly-anticipated captive fragrance ingredient molecules, which was 2 times our historic leverage. All four molecules had unique and distinctive characteristics to give our perfumers a competitive edge and creating the next great fragrance for our customers.","The strong growth trend for encapsulation-related sales continued in 2016 led by Fabric Care. For the full year 2016, Fabric Care was our highest growing category in Fragrance, led by a strong double-digit growth in North America and Greater Asia.","We also set a new benchmark for fragrance sustainability with the release of our first-ever Cradle to Cradle Certified Fragrance: PuraVita. The fragrance is an innovative approach to sustainable fragrance creation that aligns well with our circular economy strategy. PuraVita is a model for what can be achieved from perfumers pair creativity with sustainable design principle.","From a Flavors perspective, sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continue to produce strong results, as well improving strong double-digit in 2016. Growth was broad-based, led by Savory, Beverage and Sweet, an example that we are providing our customers with innovative solution that win in the marketplace with the consumers.","In 2016, we also launched and commercialized four new flavor modulators to further strengthen our capabilities and give our flavors a greater palate to work with.","I also would like to recognize that IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics won two silver innovation awards in 2016. They've won a silver innovation award at the in-cosmetics Conference held in Paris for Miniporyl and a silver innovation award for Defenscalp at in-cosmetics Asia. Both are fantastic achievements and we look forward showcasting at our dinner next week at the CAGNY Conference.","We continue to see accelerated growth in the areas where we are targeting market leadership position. While leveraging our longstanding presence and in-depth consumer knowledge, the Middle East and Africa continue to be a growth driver for us, as the currency-neutral sales improved strong double-digits in 2016. Strong growth was achieved across both Flavors and Fragrances.","In North America Consumer Fragrance, we saw an 8% increase in 2016, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in both Fabric and Home Care, a direct correlation to our industry-leading technologies.","Home Care also improved mid single-digits globally, led by robust growth in North America which I just mentioned moments ago. In 2016, in North America, we further strengthened our number two market share position in Flavors with the acquisition of David Michael, which I will touch on shortly.","In addition to the strides we have made from a market share and innovation perspective, we continue to position ourselves to be our customers' partner of choice and to-go supplier. Throughout 2016, we expanded our business access through gaining core list status with two multinational customers. This is a significant achievement as it will ultimately lead to more growth longer term.","I'm also very proud of the recognition we received from our customers in 2016. Over the course of the year, we won several awards across both businesses, showcasting our collaborative work and inspirational session with our customers.","As a committed global citizen, we became the first flavor and fragrance company to join the World Economic Forum in 2016 to partner with other leading organizations dedicated to creating positive, lasting changes in society. In addition, to leveraging new relationships, our collaboration with the Forum allows us the opportunity to engage with many of our large customers in new non-traditional ways.","Our business strategy is built on the enabler of creating a sustainable future. This directive led us to launch an enhanced sustainability strategy in Vision 2016 that focuses on positive transformational changes toward our regenerative, healthy and abundant world.","Under this umbrella, we opened an on-site wind turbine at our Tilburg, Netherlands facility that is unique to the flavors and fragrance industry. We're rated gold and top suppliers by EcoVadis and identified as a global leader for our action and strategies regarding climate change.","For the second consecutive year, we're also honored by being awarded a leadership position on the CDP Climate A List for advances in carbon management and disclosure. As part of our efforts to further fortify the cross-sections between sustainability and business, I was elected to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Executive Committee in 2016. This CEO-led organization of forward-thinking companies works to accelerate the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment, qualities that are parallel on our own commitment to eco-effectiveness.","In 2016, we also partnered with Unilever for Vetiver Together, a program designed to enhance the lives of smallholder vetiver farmers in Haiti by sustainable improving food security, increasing yields and diversifying income while working to support women's empowerment and environmental conservation.","In line with our ambition to accelerate growth and increase shareholder value, we are proud of the progress we have made in terms of acquisitions. During 2016, we added approximately $160 million of future annual revenue with the acquisition of David Michael and Fragrance Resources, the latter of which closed in January of 2017. David Michael is well-known for its vanilla expertise, strength in the Dairy and Beverage categories, and relationships with dynamic, faster-growing middle market customers. Whereas Fragrance Resources, which increases our participation in specialty fragrances, is a faster growing subcategory with Fine Fragrances and strengthening our market share position with a regional customer base.","These two acquisitions as well as the 2015 acquisition of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, are expected to add approximately $265 million in annual revenue, putting us on track to achieve our $500 million to $1 billion goal by the end of 2020.","We also announced that IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics made a strategic investment in Bio ForeXtra in Quebec City, Canada-based R&D laboratory, highly specialized in the development of active cosmetic and botanical extracts. This investment expands IFF-LMC's access to raw materials for the cosmetic active business. We believe the access we will gain to sustainable sourced extracts from Boreal Forest of Canada will provide us with a competitive edge.","Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we have made in 2016.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Andreas. The fourth quarter came in consistent with our expectation as all of our key financial metrics accelerated sequentially versus the third quarter. Currency-neutral sales growth of 7% was driven by new wins across both businesses, with improved volume trends on our historical business and the benefits associated with our recent acquisition. Our acquisition of David Michael contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth to the fourth quarter results.","From a profit perspective, consolidated adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis increased 6%, as volume growth, the benefits of productivity, and the contribution of M&A drove results. Bottom line, currency-neutral adjusted EPS increased 6%, as we had lower shares outstanding versus the prior-year period, driven by a share repurchase program, offset by higher tax rate.","Turning to business performance for the fourth quarter, Flavors currency-neutral sales increased 14%, driven by broad-based growth across all categories as well as the contribution of sales from David Michael.","From a regional perspective, I'm pleased to say that each region delivered double-digit growth. North America grew 22%, reflecting additional sales related to the acquisition of David Michael as well as strong double-digit growth in Dairy.","EAME increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis as growth was led by new win performance with strong double-digit growth in both Beverage and Sweet. Africa and Middle East continued its impressive growth trend, improving strong double-digits in the fourth quarter.","Greater Asia posted 10% currency-neutral growth, led by strong double-digit growth in India, ASEAN and Indonesia, plus low single-digit growth in China. On a category basis within Greater Asia, we achieved broad-based growth amongst all our categories, led by strong double-digit increases in Savory and Beverage.","Growth in Latin America continued, improving 13% on a currency-neutral basis, led by strong double-digit increases in both Mexico and Brazil. Flavors currency-neutral segment profit grew approximately 27%, led by volume growth, the benefits from productivity, and to a lesser extent the contribution of David Michael.","From a Fragrance perspective, fourth quarter currency-neutral sales grew 1%, driven by growth in Fabric Care, Home Care and Fragrance Ingredients. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances declined, driven by abnormally high volume erosions, weak economic conditions in Latin America, and the portfolio transition of two large customers.","Consumer Fragrances grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home Care and high single-digit growth in Fabric Care, partially offset by Personal Wash.","On a geographic basis, we achieved double-digit growth in North America and high single-digit increases in EAME. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 2% on a currency-neutral basis, as strong growth in EAME was offset by softness in North America and Latin America.","From a profit perspective, Fragrance's currency-neutral segment profit was flat year-over-year, as volume growth and benefits from productivity were offset by mix and unfavorable price and input costs.","Before moving on to cash flow, I'd like to take a minute to provide you greater insight with respect to our full year 2016 organic top line performance, including foreign exchange-related pricing to provide a better comparison with our peers.","As a reminder, when reporting, we exclude the indexation effect on local currency invoicing from our currency-neutral sales growth calculations. This is different from our competition and can impact performance comparisons.","For 2016, adjusting our currency-neutral sales growth calculation to a basis similar to our competition reports, our consolidated organic currency-neutral sales would have increased by 1 percentage point to approximately 4%, Flavors would have increased to 5% versus 3%, and Fragrance would have been up 3% versus 2%.","From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels to continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percentage of sales, as our five-quarter rolling average figure through the end of Q4 was down about 50 basis points to approximately 28.4% of our annual 2016 sales. This change was driven by core working capital level improving versus the year-ago period, principally driven by improvements in accounts receivables and inventories.","Operating cash flow for the full year was $535 million. This increase was principally due to lower core working capital requirements, higher depreciation and amortization, and lower pension contributions. Operating cash flow increased 23% to $535 million or 17.2% of sales, an improvement of 280 basis points versus the full year 2015. Capital expenditures for the year finished at $126 million or approximately 4% of sales, as we continue to make investments to support new technologies and infrastructure.","We delivered on our commitment to return cash to shareholders in 2016. Dividend payments were $185 million, reflecting a 15% increase in August as we look to provide a more competitive yield while simultaneously balancing our growth objectives. Supplementing our dividend, we spent $127 million in share buybacks. Over the course of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares and lowered our diluted shares outstanding by approximately 900,000 to 79.9 million shares. When combining both dividend and share repurchases, we achieved a 71% total payout ratio of adjusted net income, exceeding our target range of 50% to 60%.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Rich. In large part to our industry-leading innovation and the ability to provide our customers with superior product, IFF has a history of strong sales growth, proven profitability, and industry-leading returns.","Over the past two years, however, we have seen the global operating environment become more volatile as the global consumer staples volumes are soft, currencies are fluctuating, and raw material costs are on the rise. To put this in perspective, we have seen top global consumer product companies volumes decelerate from an average of 2.5% in 2013 to an expected average of 0% in 2016.","We have seen emerging market GDP growth slow significantly from 7.5% in 2010 to 5% in 2013 and to approximately 4% in 2016. Key markets such as Brazil and China have been under pressure.","The U.S. dollar has although continued to strengthen versus many global currencies. As the U.S. dollar strengthens, many global customers increased pricing in the emerging markets, which has an adverse effect on end market volumes. In addition, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has an adverse impact on multinational organizations domiciled in the U.S.","Raw materials have also exhibited inflationary pressures. On the natural side, the demand for all natural products has driven the cost of natural ingredients higher over the past few years. This can be best seen in the vanilla and citrus markets where increases have been two- or three-fold. More recently, we have seen synthetic raw materials rise off their lows.","With that as a backdrop and fully recognizing the changing landscape, we are taking action to continue to deliver winning solution to our customers while achieving sustainable profit growth. The start was the launch of multi-year productivity program to allow us the flexibility to invest in the business to drive greater competitive advantage and deliver the target financial results we set out to achieve.","Over the course of the next few years, we expect to unlock savings through the application of enterprise-wide zero-based budgeting, elimination of open position, streamlining of our organizational structures, and the optimization of our global network. Once fully implemented, we expect savings from this productivity program to reach an annual run rate between $40 million and $45 million by the end of 2019.","We believe that by taking these steps, we should be a stronger, more successful company for our customers, employees, and shareholders. To provide additional insight into our expected profitability goal for 2017, we want to highlight the main drivers of change. In the table, we anchored on full year 2016 adjusted operating profit and build out a reconciliation to bridge to 2017 operating profit.","Starting with the second bar, you will note that we expect approximately 3.5-percentage-point headwind related to the reset of our incentive compensation costs. In the third bar, we have included the projected growth of our organic business, including our standard cost on productivity initiatives. This takes into account the external factors that I mentioned moments ago.","To ensure we continue to deliver an improved profit performance in 2017, I want to focus on the fourth bar where we have highlighted the potential benefit related to our multi-year productivity program. As you can see, the contribution from this program expects to yield 4 percentage points to 4.5 percentage points of growth in 2017. To round this out, we also expect 1 percentage point contribution from our recent acquisition of David Michael and Fragrance Resources.","Looking at 2017 holistically, we're optimistic that all of our financial growth rates should accelerate versus our 2016 performance. From a top line perspective, we expect 7.5% to 8.5% currency-neutral sales growth, inclusive of approximately 4.5 percentage points related to David Michael and Fragrance Resources acquisitions.","From an organic perspective, growth is expected to accelerate, largely driven by improving trends in Flavors North America, as volume erosion improves, and a return to growth in China Flavors following the order issue we faced. In addition, we expect Fragrance Ingredients to continue to improve, a direct result of our revised strategy and Fine Fragrances to return to modest growth, driven by strong new wins.","As I already shared, operating profit is expected to improve 5.5% to 6.5% on a currency-neutral basis. It should be noted that we expect raw material prices to increase low single-digits in 2017, with vanilla continuing to rise to very high levels. We are in pricing discussions with our customers and are confident we can recover these increases.","Currency-neutral EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5 percentage points to 7.5 percentage points, led by a modestly lower effective tax rate and a continuation of our share repurchase program.","In terms of foreign exchange, for 2017, we expect currency translation to impact sales by approximately 2.5 percentage points. For adjusted operating profit, we expect to benefit from our euro hedging program, which we are approximately 70% hedge at $1.12 for 2017.","In terms of the impact on operating profits and EPS, we expect currency-reduced results by approximately 2 percentage points and 2.5 percentage points, respectively.","So, in summary, we are pleased that we have achieved currency-neutral growth across all metrics in 2016 while also executing against our Vision 2020 strategy. As we look ahead to 2017, recognizing the reality of today's market environment, we're optimistic that our financial growth rate should accelerate versus 2016 performance. We are also taking proactive measures to allow us the flexibility to invest in the business, to drive greater competitive advantage and deliver the targeted financial results we set out to achieve \u2013 in particular, achieving our long-term financial targets in 2018.","By leveraging our strengths, innovation, consumer insight, talent and diversification, we will continue to strive for improved growth and increase in profitability to deliver our long-term sustainable value.","With that, I would now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks and good morning, everybody.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hi.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I wanted to ask what is implied in your organic sales guidance range of 3% to 4% for 2017. In other words, what has to happen to achieve the high end and the low end of the range? For example, is there any improvement embedded in emerging markets, which I think you'd mentioned last quarter? And then, if you could also give the composition of sales from volume and pricing, especially given your commentary on input costs, that would be helpful?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay, Mark, absolutely. So, as you well know, we have faced a couple of challenges over 18 to 24 months largely in North America Flavors where we believe that we're over the volume erosion and we normalized to historical levels and we are stronger than we ever were in North America, which is important.","We anticipate a return to growth in China Flavors where we had the issue with our manufacturing facility and we believe as well that the Fine Fragrances will return to modest growth, driven by strong new wins. So, all in all, I believe these factors are \u2013 if they turn out as we have them right now in the plan and we're optimistic they will, we will deliver on the growth rates. But probably Rich can talk a bit more about the composition of the sales.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah sure. And, Mark, I think when you look at the improvement and where we were in 2016 versus 2017, primarily \u2013 the primary growth and improvements of the, let's call it, the midpoint of that range is going to be volume. Pricing, there's a couple of different aspects going on there. We've still got some of the carryover impacts from the 2016, particularly on the Fragrance Ingredients side that's going to have a drag on it. On the other side, we're going to clearly have to have pricing, particularly in the Flavors business with what's going on with the input costs there. So, it's going to be substantially all that of the growth that we're projecting for 2017 is volume-driven. It's both wins and more stable \u2013 I'll call it more stable volume erosion with a slight impact on pricing.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Just to clarify then. So, is there any incremental impact in our expectation from pricing in 2017? And then just a separate follow-up. I wanted to ask about, given the new productivity initiative, what your thoughts are on long-term gross and operating margin? Expansion, is \u2013 let's call it, 30 basis points to 50 basis points of margin expansion is still reasonable? And then what's embedded for reinvestment in 2017 since I don't think I explicitly saw that in the chart?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","All right. So, again , from a pricing standpoint, it's not a significant amount. So, it's not significant on either direction. I think from a long-term profitability standpoint, I think you heard in Andreas' comments, 2017 puts us on the right trajectory, and I think we are confident on our long \u2013 as we exit 2017 and we deliver upon the results for 2017, we're going to be in a good position to deliver on our long-term profitability targets. And that's really how we're looking at the business.","From there on, on a long-term basis, as the volatility stabilizes, we'll be in a better position to make choices on how much and where the investment opportunities are and how much falls to the bottom line and how much gets reinvested in the business.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. First, I just want to follow up again on the productivity program. So, one would be, Rich, in that bridge, the amount that you're showing, is that the benefit of the small program announced in last year's fourth quarter and then some portion of what you've announced today? But just in my mind, it seems like a bigger benefit from productivity than I would expect, given this announcement. So, maybe it's something you were already working on. So, first I just wanted to ask about that.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. So, the first column of productivities, which is I think is the third column, is our normal ongoing productivity activities where we work through \u2013 it's our organic business. Most of that is productivity. When you take into account volume growth, net of input cost and pricing net of our ongoing cost increases for merit, carryover head count that's slightly favorable, the vast majority of that third column is our ongoing productivity initiative.","The fourth column is really what we've talked about today in terms of long-term \u2013 the productivity improvement from the program from today. And that includes both the organic piece of that or the existing piece plus the value creation coming from the acquisitions.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Great. And then I wanted to also talk a bit about the fourth quarter performance in Flavors overall. So, really broad-based improvement, I know the kind of two-year comparison is in line with where the trend has been. But if I recall, in the beginning of the year, you guys had talked about the potential, some significant new wins that could fall in the back half of the year and I think it was reformulation activity maybe around naturals or health and wellness-type stuff. So if you could just talk about whether or not any of that was in this quarter's numbers or if that's still something to look forward to in next year? Thanks.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","So, what we have seen, Lauren, this is Andreas. We have seen an improved commercial performance, which resulted into new wins as well. So, that's actually on a very, very high level right now on the Flavors side. So, that has helped us as well.","Another factor, which is partially organic from this year onwards, partially not organic, is the companies we acquired like Ottens Flavors and David Michael, they have a bit of a higher organic growth rate than our core business. And with all the, let's say, improvements we are taking, the profitability will be good as well.","So, these are, let's say, two extra engines for our Flavors business here as well, which will yield us some results. And now, the acquisitions are becoming a bit more of a bigger piece of our whole business that will help us going forward.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Lauren, let me just add one thing. From a profitability standpoint, I think the other thing is a favorable mix. We started the year in the Flavors business with a weaker sales mix. We ended the year with a stronger sales mix. So, that's another factor that contributed to the fourth quarter performance.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's great. Okay. And then, just on Fragrances side of the business. So, can you talk a little bit about any kind of incremental investment that you have planned? I mean, obviously the Flavors, like you just described, the Flavors' momentum is great. But as you've been talking about in your 2020 Vision, your 2020 Plan, is there also some incremental investment built into the 2017 plan?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","So, first of all, let's start with the fundamentals, which is always, let's say, research and development and new molecules. We are on an all-time high in terms of coming out with new patent-protected molecules, which is actually a great progress. It's actually double the rate we had before. So, I think that's important. The encapsulation is helping us as well. That's the reason why Fabric is growing so well.","And then, in our Fragrance business now, we have Lucas Meyer for the whole skin care and active cosmetics, which has per se a higher growth rate as well. So, that's helping us actually pretty much. So, we did an investment on a newer extension of our Singapore plant for encapsulation. So, that was something for business, which will come over the couple of the next years. So, all in all, there's optimism as well.","And if you look at the whole business, the Consumer Fragrance still grow very strong business; Ingredients, and you know we talked about this for many, many quarters, is finally back and it's turning positive. The problem for us, let's face it, was Fine Fragrances, and that we have to fix, but there is nothing, let's say, structural, I would say, it's blocking and tackling to get this back on track.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hi. Good morning. So, I just had a couple questions. First of all on the productivity program and just the margin bridge in general. So, you've talked about accelerating value realization of recent acquisitions. So, are those fixed synergies? I know, you talked about like David Michael and Ottens sort of both being in Philadelphia and sort of consolidating those operations. Is that part of the productivity program?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, out of the overall productivity program that we've announced, it combines both factors, right. It's looking at our existing structure, streamlining our organization, doing things more efficiently, standardizing it. And the other part is accelerating the benefits coming from the recent acquisitions.","I'm not going to get in \u2013 we still have a lot of work to be done in terms of where the specifics come from, but there's a lot of logical opportunities that when you look across the footprint that we will take advantage of where it makes sense to do that. Both of the businesses provide tremendous opportunity, particularly in the local and regional customers, and we want to be able to continue to maximize that. But there's opportunities in some of the procurement and some other activities which we are able to leverage in while continuing to grow the business.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then \u2013 so your largest competitor, Givaudan, had talked about increasing high \u2013 investments and growth this year in particular and they talked about specifics sort of R&D labs and things like that. Do you feel like from a global point of view, you're well-placed or do you think you need to make more investments? And maybe as you answer that, if you could also just talk about like your cash flow guidance and what you expect for CapEx this year?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","So, Faiza, I would say we are very well-placed in terms of innovation and because we put basically money behind the programs where we really think we can make a difference, as for example, modulation, encapsulation, even the active cosmetics because with some small acquisitions like Bio ForeXtra, we are really building a competitive advantage. And actually we have done quite a bit on CapEx investments in our facilities, not just in buildings, but in robotics for example, which help us actually to increase the output from our R&D labs quite significantly. So, if you're asking me whether we are well-positioned, I believe we are actually very well-positioned and we feel strong about the future.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. Faiza, I mean, from my perspective, I think two comments. One, I'd say, again, the intent of this program is to ensure that we're competitive and we drive improved results after a challenging 2016. I think as the benefits associated with these programs take hold in both 2017 and 2018, it gives us the flexibility to then selectively go back and reinvest and increase our investments in the highest opportunity and highest probability activities, and we'll look at that during the course of 2017 and 2018. And, as I said earlier, we'll manage that dynamic between bottom line and growth opportunities on a case by case basis.","In regards to cash flows, CapEx, as I said, 2016 was about 4%. I see 2017, 2018 being the peaks of probably 5% of sales for those two years as we get to the last legs of some these investments, particularly in Greater Asia and then trending down towards, I will call it, a 3.5% level, which I considered a long-term level that's sufficient to support the business, but we'll start trending down off of that number.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hi, Silke.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Doing good. Hi, Silke.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'll start with your restructuring first, if that's okay. Of the $30 million to $35 million in cash costs, how much of that will you accrue in 2017 and how much will you actually pay out in 2017?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","It's about \u2013 I think it's about two-thirds of that is people-related costs. The other third of it is facility-related and integration-related activities and support activities. I think the bulk of those amounts will be paid out in 2017. There may be a small amount of carryover into 2018 more on the facility side, but I think the bulk of that will be paid out this year.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And in terms of run rate savings of $40 million to $45 million, where do you think you're going to get to in 2017? What's your target for 2018? If you \u2013 like it seems if you'd plan to pay most of the cash cost out in 2017, like I'm expecting it seems like that a lot will get done in year one and so can you get to like a run rate of, I don't know, $30 million in year one and ramp up pretty quickly? What are your internal targets?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. So, I mean, if you take the $40 million to $45 million, it's about 7%, right? So, we've said it's about 4 percentage points to 4.5 percentage points. The bulk of the remaining amount will come in 2018. There may be a small amount, again, mostly facility-related or footprint-related is the way I would call it. That's the better way to think about it. That may spill over into 2018. But the bulk of it \u2013 the vast majority of the remaining savings, we should see in 2018.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Then I have a question about your cost of goods sold. Like what percentage of your domestic raw materials do you actually have to import? Is it like 10%, 15%? Is it like 20%? Is that sort of like the ballpark order?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Off the top of my head, I'm going to have to get back to you. If you're trying to get to a question around the...","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Border tax.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","...the border tax.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Right.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","You see. We're reading your mind.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","We've taken a look at it. And based on, I'm going to call it, the Congressional plan, and I would say that \u2013 when you look at both materials and services, it's basically a negligible event for IFF just based on our current estimates. Again, a lot depends upon where the legislation comes out. But if you look at the overall portfolio, it would be basically breakeven to slightly positive. I mean, slightly positive.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That as well. Yeah. So, let's see when finally there's like some wording around how this will all work out. But you think in terms of the amount of materials that you have to import in the U.S., it's a negligible amount?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","No, I'm not saying that. Because, I mean, there's...","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, what's that percentage? Because nobody knows how the regulations will work.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I don't want to give you a percentage because I got to look back over the specifics to North America. I looked at the values of what we sell out \u2013 what we export. I looked at the values of what we import. And again, when you add all that up, plus our service fees around the world, it's a net to slightly favorable.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Then my last question that I have, maybe it's more like a comment, but that's really also a question. So, what are the \u2013 it's like the business model for IFF for many years has worked in a really nice way where if you had mid single-digit sales growth, you would have double-digit earnings growth. So, just like before any benefits from share repurchase and which was just like a testament, like nice high incremental margins. And so in 2016, total sales grew 3% and, I guess, your net income before share purchase grew 3%. And next year, you think your sales are going to grow all-in 5% to 6% and your earnings are growing 4% to 5% with share repurchase. So, are we going to go \u2013 is like the business model impaired in some way or do you think we're going to get back to a period where \u2013 when your sales grow 5%, your earnings grow double-digits? Or what needs to happen for things to get better?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","For me, Silke, the fundamentals of the business are still quite strong and we believe strongly in the fundamentals of the business. There's no doubt that 2016 was a challenging year. As you said, the fundamentals when we're growing mid single-digits between 4% and 6%, particularly when you go up on [higher-end range], the leverage in the business is tremendous. But when we're growing 2.5% \u2013 between 2% and 3% on an organic basis, the opposite happens.","And so, I think when I look at 2016 and we have an incentive comp reset that we've highlighted. If you take that out and you say all else is equal, then there's pretty good \u2013 I consider very good profit growth, if we have a stable environment going forward. So, I think I feel confident that, as we said in the call earlier, both myself and Andreas, we feel confident that we can \u2013 our long-range targets are still achievable, particularly as we get traction and fully realize the benefits associated with the programs that we've discussed today.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I would say as one final remark, Silke, is the business model is still intact. The only thing what has changed is the volatility in the environment. And with the action we are taking, we are taking care of the volatility because we are creating flexibility for ourselves to deal with that in a best possible way. So, that's how I would describe it.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for your comments. I'll get back to the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks very much. Couple of questions, small picture and big picture. Small picture, on the Flavors side, how much of this pickup is related to either cross-selling new Ottens or David Michael capabilities or new customers associated with them cross- selling in that direction?","And the big picture is, somebody already asked about border tax, what about the regulatory environment globally? I mean, that seems like such a no-brainer of a positive backdrop over the past five years and now with regulation seemingly in the crosshairs for food, the household products, everything, does that slow down what had been a key driver of your business? And have you had any communication with your customers about regulatory mandated reformulations and that sort of thing? Any sense on that? Thanks very much.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Well, Jonathan, I'm taking the broader, bigger question first. Indeed, we have seen a tightening of the regulatory environment across the globe. And I can tell you, the regulatory costs for the industry went up. I see it even in our own cost center here as well because we want to be best in class in regulatory because we believe it basically creates a competitive advantage.","Let me explain. What we see in our industry is that some of the smaller companies have a hard time to catch up with the regulation and to invest as much as we do, which creates actually opportunities for us in the business and in the M&A space as well. So, I don't expect that the regulatory pressure will go down, probably not even in the U.S. despite the new President. We are actually prepared for a tough regulatory environment, and we believe it could create a competitive advantage for us as a company. So, that's number one.","Number two, on the Flavors side, we have not seen too much cross-selling opportunities right now. It's too early. But this is exactly what we want. I'd give you just one idea here. We had just two weeks ago, the first sales meeting for the combined entity for the middle market, which is ex-David Michael's, ex-Ottens, the sales force, and they have their territories in place and they are now rolling. And now, we have basically a force for the big customers and a force for the smaller and mid-sized customers and I think you will see a lot of that because we can deliver now to the smaller customers, not just the service but we can deliver innovation as well and I believe that will create a great advantage for us.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I think we know many of the raw materials that are up: vanilla, citrus, acetone. Are there any raw materials that are down significantly? It's such a diverse set of raw materials that you bought is usually something going down when something is going up.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","You would think.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","One would hope.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah, right. Rich, you take it.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","No. John, I mean, I think you've highlighted where the pressures are in citrus, in vanilla and some of the naturals. I think when I look at 2016 as an example, input costs were basically up slightly but very negligibly. So, it's more around what's going around those specific buckets that's what's driving the upward pressure. But there's nothing significant that's going the other way.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And when the petrochemical raw materials, in particular, rise, usually we see the customers start to reformulate because their bulk ingredients like surfactants go up even more, and then you get to reprice on the reformulation. So, are we seeing any product reformulation acceleration and activity because of the rise in raws?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I don't know if I would characterize an acceleration. I mean, to me, it's a constant part of our business that it helps us manage our relationship with each of the customers where we help them and they help us deal with these pressures on both sides. And probably the one exception is vanilla where it's gone so much in such a relatively short period of time that those are where a lot of the customers are looking for other alternatives.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Hi. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions from my side, please. First on Flavors and the strong performance there. You mentioned it was very broad-based the growth rates there. I suppose that's a comment on the regional split. Can you just give us an idea what the split on the customer base, especially the MNCs versus the regionals were? And also you just noted that the Flavors division's performance was on improved commercial performance and new wins. Is that something you see continue in 2017, please?","And the second question I've got is on the raw materials. Has the split between synthetic and natural raw materials changed in any way over the last few years and if you run rate the acquisitions that you've made recently as well? Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","So, we're just getting ready for all the questions, Gunther, but let me get started. First of all, on the customer base, what we are seeing still kind of a 50:50 between globals and local and smaller customers. But it's a good question because with our exposure now in U.S., which is a big market or region to some of the smaller mid-sized customers that that might change over time because we see good growth rates here.","On the commercial wins, we have seen a good and great performance, and we started well here as well. So, we see a continuation of what we have seen last quarter. I think that's really, really good as well.","Raw materials, Rich, you take it.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, one additional comment on the Flavors growth, I mean, that as you said, wins are solid where we want them to be. Volume erosion, as I alluded to in my comments, was better than what it had been, and so it was stronger than the long-term average. So, volume erosion was better in Q4. That's obviously and clearly one of the most volatile components of our business. And so, that's one of the factors to keep in mind for Q4.","In terms of raw materials, I think it's more on the \u2013 as we've talked about, it's more on the natural side, particularly on the Flavors business where we see more of the focus and more of the demand on that is on the Flavors side.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","What you well know, Gunther, is that we are putting a particular emphasis on modulation. And what is really working very well at the moment is the sweetness modulation. Certainly, it's a sweet spot literally because many of our customers try to reduce sugar, and we have seen actually an unprecedented flow of wins coming in for that technology.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","That's really helpful. Thanks. Maybe I can sneak one more in. Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, would you be able to give a growth rate for that business?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay. 10% for the full year.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Curt Siegmeyer from KeyBanc Capital.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Curt.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Curt.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just a clarification on the productivity program. So, it seems your guidance implies, let's call it, roughly $25 million to $28 million in savings in 2017. How should we think about that by quarter? And then how much of that is head count reductions in 2017 versus some of the other things, streamlining and integration savings?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. I think it will accelerate as we go through the year. I think the bulk of the benefits associated with the position-related asset savings and people-related costs are going to be Q2, Q3. There'll be a piece that \u2013 but I think the bulk of that will probably in those two periods. I think the footprint type of benefits are really going to take longer. That involves us figuring out where the right locations are and how do we best optimize the footprint. So that's the part that more drags into and has a bigger component that's going into 2018 versus 2017.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then could you guys maybe give a little more color on your expectations for Fine Fragrances? As we move further into 2017 here, do you expect North America and Latin America sort of the headwinds that you're seeing there to improve, get worse, sort of remain stable at kind of low levels? And then any other color on EMEA as well?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. Sure. I mean, I think several comments to that question. One, I think we're still, as I mentioned on the third quarter call, I mean, the pressures that we're seeing that are related to Brazil, Latin America as well as the customers working out their portfolio, we still expect that to continue in the near term.","Also, keep in mind that Q1 was a very strong quarter last year. So, from a comparable standpoint, it's going to be our most challenging quarter. I think for the full year, we expect, as Andreas commented earlier \u2013 I think for the full year, we expect it to be \u2013 I'm not going to call it a strong growth engine, but it's going to be positive as opposed to a significant tailwind in the past. So, I think it will improve \u2013 not tailwind, headwind. The improvement will come later in the year. Q1 will be challenging.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","We have good visibility in terms of the new wins, but you never know how the new wins play out in the marketplace. So, that's how we'll describe it.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. So, the pipeline and wins are \u2013 we feel very good about the pipeline and wins. It's the timing of when those things actually get launched by our customers that we still have to work through.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brett Hundley with Vertical Group.","Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning.","Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Just wanted to stay with Fine Fragrances real quick. Certainly, given some recent commentary from some larger customers, it does sound like some existing challenges maybe remain in place, especially for the early parts of 2017. You just talked about visibility of new wins. But I'm also curious about any visibility related to existing business picking up potentially as we move into the back half of 2017 and into 2018.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Again, I think what I can tell you is, from my perspective, we have to wait a bit \u2013 I mean, the customers \u2013 the two big customers have to work out the inventories and make those decisions, so we're on hold. We know that they've been bringing down inventories and that's been a significant drag in terms of volume erosion. I think we feel Latin America is getting a bit better, but I'm not going to consider it a huge opportunity. So, I think we're expecting improvement, as you said, as we get to the latter part of this year.","Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. And then just one other for me, if I may. You guys have started to pick up M&A in recent years. You've been able to do so. Is there anything on the horizon as we've moved into 2017 here that makes it any harder for you to add to your portfolio the M&A? Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","No. Actually, as you well know, the cost of M&A went up over the last couple of years, and it's getting a little harder to find good assets. What I have to say is the assets we have added in the last two years, we are very, very pleased with what we found in terms of the quality of the assets and what they do for us after we have integrated. So that's good. So that makes me optimistic actually looking forward that we may find some other assets here to add as well. We are constantly looking, but I can't be more specific on that one.","Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Understood. Thanks, guys.","Operator","That is the last question. We will now turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Very good. And thank you very much for participation and the good questions.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Shelley Young, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Shelley Young","Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call.","Earlier today, we distributed a press release announcing our third quarter results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at www.iff.com. This call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website.","Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statement, which I will read out loud. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2014. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 2013 10-K filed on February 25, 2014, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items which we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today and is on our website.","With me on the call today is Andreas Fibig, our CEO; Nicolas Mirzayantz, our President of Fragrances; Matthias Haeni, our President of Flavors; and Kevin Berryman, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Shelley. And good morning, good afternoon to everyone. This is my first earnings call as CEO of IFF, and I wanted to say how I -- pleased I am to be part of this great organization.","During my first 2 months, I've had the opportunity to travel to many parts of the IFF world visiting customers and employees in Latin America, Europe and the United States; and just returned from an exciting trip to India and the Middle East, where I saw firsthand how we combine our core values of passion, creativity and expertise to partner with global and local customers to provide them with products that will delight their consumers. I've also had the chance to speak with several of our analysts and investors, and I look forward to meeting you all in person in due course.","I also want to acknowledge our former CEO and current Chairman, Doug Tough, for providing a seamless transition. His insight, guidance and advice have proven beneficial, and I thank him for all of his support.","As you may know, my career has been devoted to biopharmaceuticals, a different industry but one with many similarities to the flavors and fragrance industry. Both industries operate on a global scale. Both depend on constant innovation to deliver success. Both demand consistent focus on productivity and excellence in implementation. And both require extremely close collaboration with customers and consumer insight.","IFF is a company with extensive global reach, a successful culture of innovation, strong financial results and passionate employees. I personally believe we can continue to improve our long-term business performance and increase shareholder value by executing our 3-pillar strategy of leveraging our geographic reach, strengthening our innovation platform and maximizing our portfolio.","We are currently refreshing our strategy to make sure we have the necessary road map to drive our future growth. To put this in context, like any healthy company, we will regularly pressure test our priorities. All that being said, IFF has a strong foundation, and therefore, you can expect an evolution of strategy, not a revolution, as we look to how we can best work in close collaboration and partnership with our customers and their brands, continue to win in the marketplace and provide value for our shareholders.","Turning to the agenda of today's call. I will provide an overview of the third quarter results for consolidated IFF; followed by Nicolas and Matthias, who will provide their perspective from the performance of our Fragrance and flavor business segments. Then Kevin will provide you with a financial overview of our third quarter and first 9 months of the year, and he will then turn the call back over to me for balance-of-year outlook and some concluding comments before opening the call for your questions.","Turning to the third quarter of 2014.","We continue to report solid growth, thanks to the diversity of our business and continued momentum in the emerging markets, where we now have 50% of our sales, more than any of our competitors. Our local currency sales growth of 4%, which includes a point of growth relating to the Aromor acquisition, was in line with our expectations and similar to the second quarter.","Fragrances reported local currency sales growth of 5%, while Flavors reported local currency sales growth of 2%. We achieved solid growth in every region, with the exception of North America where we continued to face a challenging environment. In general, the trend on volume erosion improved over the prior quarter, but new win performance was at the low end of historical levels. Latin America was our best-performing region, increasing 9% in local currency. Flavors continued its very strong momentum, posting double-digit growth, while Fragrances grew high single digits in the region.","Greater Asia increased 4% in local currency. Double-digit growth in Fine Fragrances and improved flavor results drove our performance in this region. EAME was up 6% in local currency as a result of strong performance by both business units in the Middle East. North America continues to be challenging market for both Flavors and Fragrances.","The adjusted operating profit increased 7%, reflecting an increase in gross profit dollars, combined with reduced research, selling and administrative expense, while third quarter adjusted EPS increased a percentage point faster than our adjusted operating profit, growing 8% to $1.32.","On a year-to-date base, our local currency sales increased 5%, reflecting 6% growth in the emerging markets and 1% in the developed markets, in line with our long-term sales growth targets of 4% to 6%.","Our business unit Fragrances was up 7% on a year-to-date base, in part due to the Aromor acquisition, while Flavors had local currency sales growth of 3%. Our fastest-growing regions on a consolidated basis for the first 9 months in 2014 were Greater Asia, Latin America and EAME, which were strong growth in many emerging market countries around the world which are large markets for IFF.","Sales growth, combined with year-to-date gross margin improvement, resulted in the company's adjusted operating profit increase of 9%, at the upper end of the range of our long-term target of 7% to 9%. Our adjusted EPS of $4.01 is up 13% year-over-year, reflecting our expanded gross and operating margins, as well as lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate.","Overall, we feel we are very well positioned versus our full year forecast as we head into the fourth quarter.","I would now like to turn the call over to Nicolas and Matthias so they can provide greater details on Fragrances and flavor results and operating performance.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Thank you, Andreas. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone.","Fragrance local currency sales growth this quarter was 5%, including 2 percentage points of growth from Aromor. The overall performance reflect growth in all regions, except North America due to market challenges. The emerging markets continued to be a driver to our growth, up 7% overall. And 51% of our fragrance compound business, which include Consumer Fragrances and Fine Fragrances, were to the emerging markets more than any of our competitors in the industry.","Our performance validate the continued work on the part of our teams globally to collaborate and partner with our global, regional and local customers to provide them with innovation and fragrances that will delight their consumers; as well as our investment and expertise in consumer insights. In addition, we continued to benefit from our diverse portfolio of end use product categories, geographies and customers. In that way, new wins in one part of our portfolio can offset challenges in other areas.","Our compound business was up 3% in local currency, led by 6% growth in Latin America, 5% growth in Greater Asia and 4% growth in EAME.","Turning to our end use categories.","Consumer Fragrances increased 4% in local currency this quarter, with widespread growth across all regions led by 7% in EAME and 5% in Latin America. The overall increase was primarily driven by double-digit gains in our Fabric Care category, further solidifying our leadership position in this category. Our strong performance in Fabric Care, in large part, reflects market acceptance of our unique encapsulation technology, which has been a strong driver to our consumer fronts business for many quarters","Home Care and Toiletries also experienced growth this quarter.","It is also important to note that, on a year-to-date basis, Consumer Fragrances is up 5% in local currency, with growth in all of our end use categories due to our strong consumer insight, partnership with both global and local customers and our pipeline of new products.","Moving into Fine Fragrances. Local currency sales declined by 1% this quarter. Strong growth in Latin America and Greater Asia was offset by market weakness in North America, which is facing challenges. On a year-to-date basis, Fine Fragrances is up 3%, which is above market growth in volume.","Turning now to our ingredient business. Fragrance Ingredients delivered growth of 16%, including sales from Aromor. Ingredient organic growth was 2%. This performance reflects strong growth of specialty ingredients, including Aromor; as well as key IFF product families, including naturals. On a year-to-date basis, Ingredients are up 20%, including sales growth from Aromor.","In summary, we achieved good growth this quarter fueled by the emerging markets and double-digit growth in Fabric Care.","From a profitability perspective, productivity improvements and cost-savings initiatives were marginally offset by mix due to a decline in our Fine Fragrances sales. In addition, our operating cost reflects lower level of incentive comps. The net result was positive, as segment profit increased 7% or $5 million year-over-year and segment profit margin expanded 20 basis points to 20.9%. On a year-to-date basis, our segment profit has increased by $38 million or 17%.","I'd like to add more color on the state of our business before turning to our forecast. I am pleased to report that we gain entrance into a new core leased in North America, reflecting months of work by our teams. We made progress on our Fragrance Ingredients Rationalization plan that started in the second quarter of 2013. We closed our Augusta, Georgia ingredient manufacturing facility during the quarter, and we are beginning to see the cost savings, which we -- are being used to offset the startup cost associated with our newer plants.","We also made progress on our sustainability journey this quarter. IFF was identified as a leader in climate change reporting, and we will now be included in the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index as part of the Carbon Disclosure Project. You may recall that, over the summer, we opened the largest solar installation in the flavors and fragrance industry in our facility in Hazlet, New Jersey. This put us at the forefront of using renewable energy in the flavors and fragrance industry.","We continue to make progress in our integration with Aromor. We are meeting key milestones, and we are pleased with the collaboration and progress, especially on the innovation front.","Turning now to our fourth quarter outlook. We are comparing to a very strong Q4 in 2013, which was driven by double-digit growth in Fine Fragrances and high single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrances. Against this comparable, we are expecting to have modest organic growth in the fourth quarter.","I will now turn the call over to Matthias, our Group President of Flavors.","Matthias Haeni","Thank you, Nicolas. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone.","Against a challenging global environment that many of our customers have commented on, Flavors had local currency sales growth of 2% this quarter, up sequentially from 1% growth in the second quarter. The overall performance reflects new wins, which continue to be healthy but were offset by higher volume erosion on existing business.","The Flavors business delivered local currency sales growth in Latin America, in Greater Asia and in EAME. The performance in these big regions was offset by a sales decline in North America. Thanks to the emerging markets, our growth drivers to the business increased 6%, while sales to the developed markets declined 2%.","Looking at each region in greater detail.","EAME had favorable local currency sales growth of 3% this quarter, a sequential improvement over Q2. High single-digit growth in Beverage and low single-digit growth in Dairy were only partially offset by declines in sweets and in Savory. Greater Asia also experienced a sequential improvement over Q2. Local currency growth of 3% was led by high single-digit gains in Savory, only partially offset by declines in Beverages and in sweets.","Our performance in North America improved sequentially this quarter due to lower volume erosion in Beverage, as we communicated last quarter. We also saw double-digit gains in Dairy this quarter in North America. Latin America continues to be our strongest-performing region, up 12% in local currency sales. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to a very strong level of technology-driven wins in Beverages.","Our performance overall reflects our strong collaborations with our customers as well as our focus on health and wellness solutions.","Our segment operating profit declined 2% to $79.7 million this quarter. Our segment profit margin was 22.2% compared to its 23.2% in the third quarter of 2013. The decline in segment profit and profit margin was driven primarily by weaker operational performance, including less-favorable absorption and new plant costs. Our operating costs reflect a lower level of incentive comp.","Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect a positive local currency sales momentum in the fourth quarter, with positive growth in North America. Our expectations for improved growth in Q4 is indicative of the positive trends, especially when comparing to the very strong performance of 7% growth in Q4 of 2013.","As you know, over the last few years, we have made significant commitment to step up our investments in the emerging markets in order to provide us with the critical capacity-creation capabilities in sales offices to successfully compete in these faster-growing markets. In keeping with these plans, in 2012, we opened a new facility in Singapore, and last year, in the third quarter, we opened our Guangzhou, China facility. With our new investments in manufacturing capacity in Gebze, Turkey and in Jakarta, Indonesia, we will have substantially completed our investment activity. These investments will support our growth for the foreseeable future and position us well with customers in the regions. Due in part of lower sales growth this quarter, we were not able to fully absorb the additional costs related to the startup and opening of our China facility. Given the expected improvement in Q4 sales, the impact of these incremental costs will be reduced.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin, our CFO.","Kevin C. Berryman","Thank you, Matthias. And good morning and good afternoon, everyone.","Net sales of $774 million were up 4% on a reported basis and also 4% on a local currency basis, which excludes the effects of foreign currency impacts. Our consolidated sales include the results of Aromor, which added a percentage point to our growth.","This quarter, Fragrance comprised 54% of our sales, and Flavors comprised the remaining 46%. Our continued growth in a turbulent, economic and customer environment is again a testament to the strengths and diversity of our portfolio in terms of regions, end use categories and customers. Our diversity and capabilities allows us to realize growth in both challenging and more robust times. The emerging markets grew 6% this quarter and the developed markets declined by 1%, reflecting continued challenges for both Flavors and, Fine Fragrance in North America during the third quarter.","Regarding gross margin, productivity and cost savings in the quarter, including the benefits of the closure of our Augusta facility, were offset by the impact of unfavorable mix and operational performance, including lower absorption benefits and new-plant-related costs. The slight decline in gross margin was more than offset by ongoing control of our research, selling and administrative costs and lower incentive compensation costs versus the prior year, reflecting lower top line and operating profit growth versus plan. As a result, our adjusted operating profit increased 7% to $153 million and our adjusted operating profit margin improved 40 basis points to 19.8% this quarter.","Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter of 24.5% was favorable to the prior year's rate of 26.2%. The tax rate reduction reflects higher earnings from lower-tax jurisdictions, favorable provision to return adjustments and lower loss provisions, partially offset by higher repatriation costs and the absence of the research and development tax credit in the U.S. in the current quarter. We fully expect the drivers of our lower tax rate, including the greater mix of earnings from lower-tax jurisdictions, to continue to be a driver to our improved effective tax rate for the full year versus year ago.","Our operating profit growth and lower effective tax rate drove the year-over-year improvement of 8% in our earnings per share, bringing our adjusted EPS to $1.32.","Turning to our 9 months year-to-date results. Note that the growth in all of our metrics for the first 9 months of 2014 are within or above our long-term growth target ranges. Our net sales of $2.3 billion increased 5% on a reported and local currency bases, including approximately a point of growth for Aromor. Supported by improved gross margin, our adjusted operating profit increased 9% in the first 9 months of 2014, reflecting, in part, lower incentive accruals. This equates to a 90 basis point improvement in our operating profit margin to 20.1%.","Finally, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 13% to $4.01 for the first 9 months of 2014, a performance level that is well positioned versus our long-term growth target.","Turning to our research, selling and administrative costs. RSA as a percent of sales decreased 60 basis points from 24.8% to 24.2% of sales. The decline as a percent of sales was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense, partially offset by several discrete items and the addition of Aromor. We have instilled discipline in our cost controls so that we can continue to invest in research and development and position ourselves for continued acceleration in the development of our innovation pipeline.","R&D investments will remain a focus to spend remaining above 8% of sales.","Here you see our customary chart showing the change in the strength of the euro relative to the dollar, as the movement in the euro represents the largest foreign exchange variable relative to the impact on our results. As noted earlier, foreign exchange movements had a negligible impact on our top line growth.","As it relates to our adjusted operating profit and EPS results for the third quarter, year-over-year currency impacts were slightly positive. And at the operating profit line, we continue to proactively manage our gross margin profile through our cash flow hedging programs.","As a reminder, the U.S. dollar strengthening versus the world's currencies does not materially impact IFF in many emerging market countries, as 2\/3 of our sales are tied to harder currencies in the emerging markets, including the U.S. dollar.","Relative to the recent weakness in the euro, as you may know, the euro declined nearly 5% during the month of September and reached a low of $1.25 on October 6. Due to our hedging activities, however, where we've hedged to the euro at a rate of $1.32 for the full year 2014, the majority of our exposure remains protected in 2014. And as a result, the results in Q3 were not again materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. And importantly, for 2015, nearly 60% of our euro exposure is now hedged at a rate of $1.34, close to the effective year-to-date average for 2014. This effectively significantly reduces our exposure for 2015. At current rates, we believe the impact to earnings in 2015 to be immaterial.","Our operating cash flow in the first 9 months of 2014 was $318 million or 13.6% of sales compared with $257 million or 11.5% of sales in the prior year period. The increase in cash flow from operations was driven by an increase in net income in the first 9 months of 2014, lower amounts of Spanish tax payments this year versus last, lower year-over-year pension contributions, which were partially offset by higher incentive compensation payments in 2014 versus 2013. Importantly, our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales, as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q3 are down 90 basis points to 29.8% of our trailing 12-month sales versus the same metric year ago.","Turning to our capital structure and our uses of cash. As you know, capital spending for growth and infrastructure and newer technology continues to be our most important use of cash. Over the past 3 years, we have been investing approximately 4.5% of sales on adding capacity where it's needed to optimize our geographic footprint and to ensure that our proprietary technologies are available to our customers around the globe. We would expect that our spending will again be in the 4% to 4.5% of sales range for the full year 2014.","Regarding our share buyback program, on a year-to-date basis through Q3, we have spent approximately $52.5 million on share buybacks. Clearly, we now expect to spend well above our buyback program spending of $51 million in the prior full year as we will continue to buy back shares during Q4.","Finally, as noted, we continue to evaluate M&A opportunities. We are targeting those opportunities that would provide us with access to new technology, geography or a business adjacency that would make strong, strategic sense and leverage our expertise in science and technology. We have the financial flexibility to invest in both these external business development activities as well as support our core organic growth programs such as our \"high value at stake\" initiatives and other programs designed to drive growth, all while still providing meaningful returns of cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.","I will now turn the call back to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Kevin.","As you've heard from the team, we've had a solid first 9 months of the year with local currency sales growth of 5% and adjusted operating profit and EPS growth of 9% and 13%, respectively, all very much in line with our long-term targets.","Our emphasis on R&D has resulted in a stronger pipeline of innovation. Coming from a pharmaceutical background, I understand how important that is, and I support our continued investment in our key R&D platforms and the programs that support them. Our strong cash flow position provides us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest in growth-enhancing R&D. We have a strong pipeline of innovation that will continue to fuel our growth.","We are also studying shifts in the industry in both of our business units to anticipate the future of food and beverage and the future of scent in everyday products so that we can continue to focus our R&D efforts on future-going trends to position IFF well as a strong partner to current and future customers.","While our overall performance this quarter puts us on track to deliver our most recent full year estimate of 4% to 6% top line sales growth and double-digit growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share, our outlook for top line growth for the fourth quarter is similar to the third quarter. And given the strong 7% growth we had in total in both business units in the fourth quarter of 2013, our outlook is indicative of improving trends, especially in Flavors. The fourth quarter will also benefit from an additional week in our 2014 financial calendar. We continue to leverage our innovation and technology to sustain our long-term growth performance.","So our key takeaways from this quarter results are as follows.","Our quarter 3 sales growth of 4% was driven by continued momentum in the emerging markets and solid new win performance. The strengths and diversity of our portfolio in terms of our customer mix, regions of operations and end use categories provides us with greater stability and allows us to drive growth in challenging times. We continue to expand our operating profit margins due to our culture of passion, creativity, expertise and innovation, and the solid execution of our 3-pillar strategy.","We have leveraged our geographic reach, making emerging markets increasingly more important and valuable. This quarter, our emerging markets contributed 50% of our sales growth. We are on target to continue to see this percentage grow. We have opened new manufacturing facilities in China and Singapore and have added new creative centers and sales offices in India and Dubai. As Matthias mentioned, we will be opening additional flavor plants and creative facilities in Turkey and Indonesia.","Our global footprint is bigger and better. We intend to win in the emerging markets.","IFF is strong on innovation. Our delivery technologies across both businesses continues to expand, with strong commercial acceptance.","Aromor and IFF have helped each other more than originally envisioned. We are commercializing innovative solutions, such as our proprietary FlavorFit brand and our fragrance encapsulation technology. We are also partnering with biotech firms to have accesses to sustainable source of cost-effective ingredients in both Flavors and Fragrances. We have continued to support our technology investment priorities by spending a good portion of our money in a very disciplined manner to secure the future and make certain we remain at the forefront of our industry by fueling a pipeline of growth and innovation and making continued investments in consumer insights.","Over the past 5 years, under Doug's leadership, IFF has been building its current position of strengths. We are now poised to take advantage of new opportunities for growth across our divisions and markets around the world. We have heard from many of our customers that they are struggling in the current environment. We are continuing to grow in line with our expectations. Our continued volume growth is a testament to the innovation, creative capabilities and consumer insights. We continue to deliver innovation to our customers in both good times and more challenging times. It is an honor and privilege to be part of this wonderful organization, and I'm looking forward to meeting each of you on the phone or listening via webcast.","A final note before I close. I'm very pleased to tell you that IFF will be participating at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York, or CAGNY conference, which is the largest consumer conference in the world. It is held in Boca Raton, Florida during the third week in February. IFF will be presenting on Thursday, February 19, and co-sponsoring a dinner that evening. This will be my first investor conference as CEO, and I'm looking forward to meeting many of you there.","We are also conducting our biannual Investor Day on June 2, 2015, to be held at a venue in New York City, and we are already gearing up for that event. You will be hearing more about it in the coming months.","We will now open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Silke Kueck, for Jeff. A couple of questions. The first is, what gives you the confidence for like positive volume growth in the fourth quarter in Flavors given that you're running up against 7% local currency growth? But even if you could do flat growth, it would be pretty good.","Matthias Haeni","This is Matthias speaking. Thank you very much for your question. While we are still early in the quarter, we see definitely a very positive strength for the fourth quarter, and we are confident that we will further build on the momentum which we have built on already in Q3 over Q2. We see a positive momentum in North America. As you may recall, in Q3 we shared with you that we will see some continuous pressure in Q3 in North America, particularly because of Beverages, yet we also see improvements. And we are confident that we will see a continued momentum going forward.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Can you quantify what the effects are of the extra week, like, either by the segments or for the company as a whole? Because normally, at the rate of sales per week, this is probably something like $55 million. And even if it's the very end of the year and you used half of that amount, like -- that's like 3% or 4% of growth right there. Is that the reason why you're more confident about the fourth quarter sales growth? Or maybe you can just give some thoughts around that.","Kevin C. Berryman","Sure, Silke. This is Kevin. A couple of comments to make as it relates to the last calendar week in any particular year: The sales that normally occur in that last week are very, very limited. The reason is a variety of things, one of them being the fact that, oftentimes, our customers aren't even open to be able to receive shipments that we would be wanting to make. So the last week of the year, of the calendar week in any year is the smallest week by far as it relates to the particular issue that you're alluding to. Having said all of that, it's somewhat volatile because it's kind of depending upon which customers will need an extra top off in inventory, which don't, and so there is a volatility in the numbers. And so the benefit is certainly probably less than what you're alluding to. I would say, in general, as both Nicolas and Matthias have already outlined, our comparables for year-ago fourth quarters certainly are very, very strong, and so that's going to place some overall headwinds as it relates to how our numbers will look for Q4 this year. Having said all of that, we do fundamentally believe that the improving trends in the business, as certainly outlined by Matthias, combined with any other potential benefits associated with the extra week, which are probably a lot smaller than what you're suggesting, all of that translates into an in-line quarter, let's say, versus what we've been showing over the last couple.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. If I can ask a last question, and I'll get back into queue. Do you have any view yet on what your corporate expenses may look like in the fourth quarter? Do you expect a similar ramp-down of incentive comps of a couple of million dollars?","Kevin C. Berryman","Well, perhaps we can take it, a more detailed question, offline, if you'd like to go, but I would say that Q4 is -- probably, if you're talking about the unallocated piece, it's probably somewhat in-line, as we will show lower incentive comps in Q4 versus a year ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I just wanted to ask a question about North America and the relative weakness there, in particular in Fine Fragrances. I know Nicolas mentioned that the category has been weak, but we haven't really been hearing that too much from any of the large beauty players, so I'm wondering if there is a timing issue there or what your sense of -- what your sense is of Christmas. And then just generally, I think Andreas had mentioned that the new win level in North America were lower than historical levels, so if you could just expand on that a little bit, that would be great.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Yes, this is Nicolas. And thank you for the question. You're right. There is definitely a sequential performance that we have to take into consideration. If you look at our Q1, North America in Fine Fragrance grew by 29%, which is definitely far above the market performance. So some customers had ordered early, so I think that we need to take this into consideration because, on a year-to-date basis, Fine Fragrance in North America is still positive, growing by 1% and globally by 3%. In addition, I think it is fair to say that some of our customers are facing challenges in different type of channel distribution. And also, one key component for us, we had some disappointing results on a very important launch that took place in 2013, where we did not see the repeat purchase that we had expected. So if you take the 3 components into consideration, it gives you a better perspective on the performance in Q3 in North America more specifically.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, so do you think Q4 is going to be -- is going to improve relative to year-to-date trends?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","In North America, I mean, Christmas -- were you asking some questions about the Christmas performance? As you know, it's too early to anticipate what consumer will be doing. It will be starting soon. So I think that, versus the performance that we had in Q3, it will be an improvement.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then do you think your -- I think, what do you think of your new wins level in Fine Fragrances?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","It is strong. I mean now that the pipeline of new product is for next year so we have a strong pipeline for 2015 and even 2016. And so we're strengthening strategic partnership with some of our customers, and the pipeline of new wins of what we have already secured so early in the period is actually quite strong.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just generally, like I said, Andreas had mentioned that new wins have been below historical levels in North America, so can you just talk about which categories that might be in?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","I mean, if you look at the performance of Consumer Fragrances, it has been still very, very good in North America, so if you look at the year-to-date performance. So I think that it's -- if you look at North America, for year-to-date, it's a plus 7%, so I think it shows to the strengths of the portfolio. We have in some pockets in different parts some lower volume of wins, so it's not so much the win rate but the size of the business which has been secured. So I think that we need to see the absolute performance and relative performance. And so we're still very confident about the pipeline of new product and the win rate in relationship to the business we're working on.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, Kevin, if I can just ask about the gross margin. I think it was lower than what we had expected, and it was down year-over-year. So is there -- can you just update us on input costs? I know you'd previously mentioned that you were looking to take some pricing next year. If you can just update us on that, that would be great.","Kevin C. Berryman","Yes, probably not a lot of new, news here. Things are trending as we would have been saying over the last couple of quarters, actually. So I think, at the end of the day, we do see pockets of items that are showing inflation pressure, and those are the areas that we're certainly going to be having discussions with customers relative to pricing. The inflation that we're talking about is a very different level of inflation than what we experienced back in 2011 and 2012, so again we're talking more modest levels and well within our ability to work with customers on a fact-based discussion relative to pricing needs to help offset some of those pressures. As it relates to Q3 and Q4, we always said that our improvement or gross margin profile was going to be moderating in terms of the year-over-year improvement, and I think you saw that obviously in Q3. And now it's further challenged in Q3 specifically because of some of the operational items that were alluded to by Matthias. So at the end of the day, we still feel good about our ability to continue to drive gross margin longer term, but there is certainly some things that we're going to need to work on as it relates to pricing to help offset some of those pressure points that would -- will be further developing as we enter into 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So I wanted to follow up on the last question, gross margins, and just sort of think about it bigger picture, longer term. So oil prices down, obviously a positive. The natural piece, I would suspect, doesn't really change that much, but maybe talk about puts and takes of those two, relatively speaking. And then more broadly, what needs to be done longer term to achieve gross margin expansion going forward 2015 and '16 and '17, beyond the measures that you've taken already? And so sort of holistically, how do you think about gross margins from here and step progression? And then price increases that you've previously discussed, I think that was probably more in the natural side. Related to the first part of the question on oil versus naturals is, if you get some relief there, do you have to give back some of that pricing? Or is that going to offset prior input cost pressures that you've talked about historically?","Kevin C. Berryman","Let me take that, Mark. This is Kevin. So a couple reactions to your question and specific comments: First thing, you're right. Oil has been falling in terms of price points, where I don't know what the numbers are today but we've gotten close to the $80 figure. So that will ultimately provide some benefits, hopefully, to us longer term as it relates to synthetics that are oil derivatives, but keep in mind that those oil derivatives are second and third derivatives, and they probably have some impact long term. They don't have immediate impact. Many of our items as it relates to oil, for example, freight and what not, are priced through to customers regardless. So if freight costs go up, customers pay for it. If freight costs go down, they get the benefit, so it's not really -- it's a pass-through cost more versus a kind of item that needs to be priced to. So I think that, summing up kind of the dynamic as it relates to oils, the naturals still are the areas where we see the pressure points developing, which tend to be focused in certain areas that will require the pricing that we've talked about. Wrapping that up into a longer-term comment, as we've said historically, and I think Andreas would certainly agree with the comment, what's going to enable our ability to continue to drive healthy gross margin is healthy innovation. And if we effectively are able to do that, that translates into our ability to have the robust gross margin longer term. All of the other things, opening of plants, all of these other things, will put some pressures potentially on a quarter or 2, but at the end of the day, if we can deliver against that innovation, we will see good gross margin levels long term.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great, and that's helpful, Kevin. And then secondly, so Andreas, welcome, first of all. And I wanted to get your commentary on the M&A outlook. So progressively, the commentary has changed over recent years. The commentary about going into adjacent categories sort of crept through commentary beginning, I guess, last year, more so through the summer. What do you think about that sort of broadly? Obviously, your background is a bit broader than just consumer products, from Kevin and other managers in the business, past and present, so how do you think about what that means? Is that still a focus going forward? And I guess, how do you think about M&A broadly?","Andreas Fibig","Yes, Mark, thank you for the question. First of all, I would say we still have a good runway in terms of growth in the F&F business, which I think is important. But if you look at the F&F business, then you have seen with the Aromor acquisition that we have made a move forward in one of our core areas. And that's certainly always a possibility, and we are illustrating [ph] basically every quarter what kind of opportunities we have. But we are not desperate on this front, so it has to be an opportunity which really makes sense for us from the strategic point of view and from the financial point of view as well. I think that's important. And we will be very disciplined in executing on M&A. We will not do it at every price. So that's in the core area. In the adjacent areas, that's something where we certainly look as well because we have seen that there might be some opportunities and growth. And if you look at some of our competitors, then you have seen these kind of moves, but having said all of that, it has to make sense, sense in a broader picture that it matches with our R&D capabilities. I think that's important. And it should match with our customer segmentation and our customer base as well. So these are there 2 prerequisites for us. So in short, certainly, we are looking. We are evaluating our opportunities, but we will be very disciplined in executing on them.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And I just wanted to follow up on what you mean by saying your R&D capabilities. So what do you think IFF does best? What do you think could be areas for improvement?","Andreas Fibig","I would say, and as you know, we are executing on our 10 R&D platforms, and I think we are doing very well. I have had the chance in my first 2 months to spend time in our laboratories with our R&D people. And we are looking at -- I think it's really impressive, what I have seen here, even with my different background. And I think we are doing very well. And if we look at some of the innovation which came out of the research that -- like the encapsulation technology, I think that's really a best-in-class technology we have here. So I think we are doing very well. And if I'm saying this in the context of an acquisition, then I take just Aromor as an example because, with the collaboration between our chemists and the Aromor chemists, we are coming up now with really interesting solutions. And that's even above what we have expected. So when we go for an M&A target, then it should fit into our R&D capabilities as well. Does it make sense for you?","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","It does, perfect.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I know you talked a little bit about win rates and momentum in the Fragrance business, but I was curious as to the same question in terms of Flavors and if you're starting to see the impact from commercializing the vanillin innovation.","Matthias Haeni","This is Matthias speaking. Thank you for your question. I would like to outline, first we had -- and we always report in the last 2 quarters we have seen significant pressure on our base business, on erosion, and we partly offset it by very strong new wins. And we had wins across the region and also strong wins in North America. These wins will allow us to continue the momentum when we move into Q4. Coming to your question on our technology on natural vanillin, we also outlined that we will not see the commercial performance before Q1 or Q2 next year. We are -- right now, we are working in our labs. We have successfully scaled up in our research labs. And our flavorists, they are working in it and building it into the new recipes for our customers. So coming back to your question, I think we will report back to you when we are meeting again or calling again in Q1 next year.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I also wanted to just ask in general a very broad question around the health of emerging markets. I think, last quarter, Kevin, you'd mentioned some destocking in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. So I just wanted to just check in on that issue. Has that kind of run its course? Have any other markets popped up as areas of modest destocking?","Kevin C. Berryman","This is Kevin. I think that the emerging markets are holding firm versus kind of what we saw earlier in the year. And as a matter of fact, you saw the 6% growth, which was in line or improving actually versus previous orders. So overarching, we feel good about the continued growth opportunities in the emerging markets. Pluses and minuses here and there, but in general, it is still going to continue to be the growth driver, all else being equal.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Curt Siegmeyer from KeyBanc Capital.","Curtis Alan Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the Flavors growth in Latin America with regard to the new business wins in Beverage. That's obviously driven some pretty good growth there. Could you guys maybe give us a sense how that double-digit growth compares to the underlying market in that region? And do you feel like you have enough opportunities in that market to continue to outperform, assuming that you are, longer term? Or should we expect that level of growth to sort of moderate here going forward?","Matthias Haeni","Curt, this is Matthias speaking. We have seen significant new wins; significant success with new technologies which we have launched, started to launch 5 and 6 quarters ago. We saw very good momentum. And we do see continued good, strong momentum, with new wins coming in. I cannot tell you exactly what the underlying market growth will be. We reckon it's going to be in the area of 4%, 5%. And we are very pleased with the performance which we have. I'm confident we will see a strong momentum going into Q4 this year. And we are excited in the approach of [ph] pipeline which we have. And we are really very pleased that we can make a significant difference with our technology programs in Latin America.","Curtis Alan Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just to follow up, if I could, also in the Flavors segment. You talked about the plant costs for you guys that was in the quarter. Do you have a sense where margins would have been, excluding the absorption issues and the new plant costs? And you mentioned sort of a moderation in fourth quarter. Should we maybe expect this to be behind us by the time first quarter rolls around? Or should the issues continue to persist somewhat?","Kevin C. Berryman","Yes, Curt, this is Kevin. Let me take that. I think that, if you think about some of the issues that we saw in Q3, we think there will be a lessening impact as it relates to some of those issues going forward. But certainly, the investments in the new factories and the cost structures that will be coming on board as it relates to those new plants, obviously, that's going to be there. So we still feel good about that long-term historical algorithm relative to gross margin, which again is driven by the innovation comment that we were talking to earlier. That's still a picture that we like and we support and believe will happen long term. There will be some improvements in the short run as it relates to probably some of the items that we saw in Q3 will not repeat and some of the other items that continue -- will continue to be a headwind that we're going to just have to overcome through good productivity and innovation longer term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC","Kevin, you gave us a couple of helpful details, particularly around research and development spending being down a little bit. I'm wondering if your decline in maybe the prospects medium term for developed markets, not for emerging markets but for developed markets, maybe, is that giving you an opportunity to maybe spend a little bit less on R&D over the next couple of years? And was that -- aside from that, are there any other areas of incremental cost savings? And I'm talking just at the margins over the past 6 months that have maybe cropped up because of the underperformance in maybe the prospects for the developed market business in both -- particularly in Flavors but I mean -- really mainly in Flavors but also maybe in Fragrances too, given the weaker consumer environment.","Kevin C. Berryman","Thanks, Jonathan, for the question. Kevin here. I guess the first comment about R&D is the commitment to spend on future innovation remains steadfast. And at the end of the day, while R&D may have been year-over-year not a big increase or maybe even flattish or in the range of that number, the bottom line is that it's driven more by some investments we were making last year relative to some of the R&D initiatives that we had which had milestone payments and not a fundamental change in terms of our commitment level. So at the end of the day, our research and development continues to be an area we focus on. It continues to be an area that we believe is going to be a fundamental driver to our success today and in the future. And so at the end of the day, it's an area that we will continue to support. Now to your bigger question relative to costs, look, I think, at the end of the day, we are always evaluating any ways to be more cost effective and productive as it relates to our spend and to the extent that there are those things we continue to be disciplined in terms of the management of our short-term costs, at the same time, ensuring that we're supporting our long-term growth outlook. So a little bit long winded, but what that effectively means is when we do see pressure points in a short-term basis, we are diligent and disciplined in the management of our costs to recognize those pressures but without sacrificing the long-term growth aspiration, which even for the developed markets, we think, is still robust.","Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC","If I could ask one more detailed question. It seems like a lot of the capital spending and spending in general has been outside the US. You mentioned some repatriation expenses. Could the -- are those typical in your tax rates? Are those typical, or what kind of drove that at the margin? And that's it.","Kevin C. Berryman","As you think about the CapEx, yes. The investments, I'm going to call them, outside of the U.S. is certainly in more emerging markets. So it's more than just being outside the U.S. It's really more emerging market focused, associated with our drive to ensure, as Andreas mentioned, that we're going to win in the emerging markets. So it's certainly a core plank of our strategy, a pillar of our strategy. As it relates to servicing buybacks or servicing dividends, to the extent that we want to do that, that continues to have a requirement that the cash that is generated across the world outside of the U.S., is some percentage of it is brought home and combined with any cash for benefits we have here to be able to supply that. And that's really what it's driven by. So to the extent that we continue to have opportunities to bring that cash home, we do.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Welcome, Andreas. Kevin, I think this is the seventh time the R&D tax credit has initially been dropped, but it's always been retroactively put back in. Assuming that happens again, what would that do for your fourth quarter?","Kevin C. Berryman","I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but it would be certainly a headwind. I would say it's probably at least $0.03 or $0.04.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It would be a tailwind, wouldn't it? You get -- typically, it would go back in.","Kevin C. Berryman","I'm sorry, tailwind.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then how is Aromor itself doing? You talked about how much it's added to there, but if you looked at Aromor by itself, is it up meaningfully year-over-year, or it has much higher margins as part of IFF now that it's being integrated?","Kevin C. Berryman","It is very much in line with what our expectations were. And if anything, the benefits, as we're talking about, relative to technology is about the ability to drive incremental value long term, which is actually very much part of why we did the deal and very exciting. Perhaps, Nicolas, you might want to add a comment.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Yes. It's Nicolas. And also, one of the key benefit of Aromor and the reason for the acquisition is the ability to drive higher win rates over time in our Compounds business because we will gain access to very unique materials at very attractive cost structures. So really, the end game is to accelerate our growth in our Compounds business; and also with the collaboration between our R&D and the very strong R&D team at Aromor, to accelerate the pipeline of new molecules.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then lastly, in fabric softener encapsulation, have the new wins been recent enough that this will carry forward for a few more quarters? Or do we start comping more difficult quarters sometime soon?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","I think that the momentum, due to our expertise in driving consumer preference with our fragrances but also in combination with our unique technology, is providing us a very good pipeline moving forward. It is solid. And now the -- we did give the outlook. It's how do we leverage the technology across all the categories. So the pipeline is strong, the win rate is strong, and we are not expecting a slowdown in that respect.","Kevin C. Berryman","So operator, this is Kevin. Perhaps we can cut it there. We're past our end time. Let me turn it back over to Andreas for any final comments.","Andreas Fibig","Yes, thank you, Kevin. And thank you, all, for your time and the questions. And we will have our fourth quarter earnings release at the 12th of February next year. And I hope that we see many of you during the CAGNY conference the 19th of February in Boca Raton.","So thank you very much for your participation. Thank you, and have a good day.","Operator","This does conclude IFF's Quarter 3 2014 Earnings Conference call. You may now disconnect."],"11875":["International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau","Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Conference Call. Yesterday evening, we distributed press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.","Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for the first quarter and full year 2019. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 27, 2018, and in our press release that we filed yesterday.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release.","For the purpose of this presentation, please note that we've calculated combined numbers by combining our results with the results of Frutarom prior to the acquisition on October 4, 2018, and adjusting for divestitures of Frutarom businesses since October 4, 2018.","With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We'll start with prepared remarks, and then take any questions that you may have.","With that, I'd now like to introduce Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Mike. On the call today, I will give an executive overview of our operational performance for 2018. Once finished, I will ask Rich to give a more in-depth financial review of the business before leading into our integration priorities for 2019 on the Frutarom acquisition. We will then provide an update on our financial expectation for 2019, and then as usual, take any questions that you may have. I'm very pleased to say that 2018 proved to be a historic year in the long and successful history of IFF. As we recently celebrated our 130th year birthday, we delivered on all of our key financial metrics and completed the acquisition of Frutarom, the largest deal in our industry to date, all while successfully navigating a challenging and dynamic market environment. We achieved strong advancements in both top and bottom line results in 2018 that were in line with our guidance range that we set forth.","Highlights include our record-setting sales of approximately $4 billion, which was a 17% increase over last year. This performance was driven by mid-single-digit growth in both taste and scent as well as additional sales related to Frutarom.","We also delivered strong adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization of $6.28 as adjusted operating profit growth and a lower year-over-year effective tax rate more than offset higher interest expense and shares outstanding, both related to the Frutarom acquisition. Throughout 2018, we had many strategic accomplishments that drove significant value creation. To highlight just a few. With the acquisition of Frutarom, we established ourselves as a global leader in taste, scent and nutrition. This combination helps us create a truly differentiated portfolio with an increased focus on naturals and health and wellness. It also provides us opportunities to expand into attractive and faster-growing categories and broadens our complementary and growing customer base.","We believe this plus strong sales and cost synergies will translate into accelerated financial performance as a combined company. Beyond the transaction, we continued to strengthen our innovation platforms by successfully commercializing three new natural taste modulators, two new fragrance molecules, 41 new natural fragrance ingredients and fragrance body care capsules as critical to driving future growth. Through the execution of our Vision 2020 strategy, we were truly the partner of choice as we expanded our core list access with key global scent customers. This expanded access will help fortify our market-leading position and offer significant future growth opportunities as we now can compete on incremental business opportunities. We also leveraged our exposure to faster-growing small and mid-sized customers to drive results as Tastepoint in North America taste continued its strong performance by growing double digits.","Productivity continues to be paramount to our way forward as cost and productivity initiatives once again contributed approximately 5 percentage points of adjusted currency neutral, adjusted operating profit and currency neutral adjusted EPS growth in 2018. And in terms of sustainability, IFF continued its global sustainability leadership as we exceeded already 3 out of 4 of our 2020 eco-efficiency targets. We also established our 2025 goals, which focuses on emission reductions, geo waste to landfill and water stewardship. I'm pleased that we continue to be acknowledged externally for our sustainability efforts.","In 2018, we were named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies, an honor we received again in 2019; and we were named to the Euronext Vigeo World 120 Index, both recognizing companies for exceptional environmental, social and governance performance. More recently, in January 2019, we were once again included on CDP's A list for climate change, our fourth consecutive year. And we received an A for water security for the first time, naming IFF as a global leader in our environmental responsibility.","We also made tremendous progress as it relates to our integration of Frutarom. First and foremost, we instilled an integration management office to provide visibility for all critical initiations and enhanced decision making. This key group of individuals, the best of IFF and Frutarom, have been instrumental in developing go-forward plans and supporting the day-to-day execution.","We also refined and confirmed our plan to achieve approximately $145 million of cost synergies by 2021. Synergies are expected to come from procurement, footprint optimization and streamlining of overhead expenses. In addition, we identified initial cross-selling opportunities to drive incremental growth going forward. These opportunities are expected to provide revenue synergies, which we believe will further value create to the shareholders over time.","As we mentioned last quarter, we've already capitalized on a few quick wins. We integrated Frutarom's North America taste business in our North America business, and we'll leverage our Tastepoint go-to-market strategy for small and mid-sized customers. At the same time, we combined Frutarom's cosmetic active ingredients business called IBR into our Lucas Meyer's cosmetic business. Concurrently, we moved all savory solution capabilities and innovation under a single leader to form Frutarom Global Savory Solutions group. This will enable the group to work together in a unified direction.","From a global footprint standpoint, we've already begun to execute the optimization of our manufacturing sites in order to realize significant cost synergies. This plan has already led to closings in the U.K. as we consolidated our site in Manningtree. While this is a first step in the process and we have much more work to be done, we are moving forward as planned.","Lastly, we're finalizing plans for our next stage of taste integration like we did in North America combining like taste businesses together to build a strong platform, more to be shared in due course.","I would like now to turn it over to Rich.","Richard O'Leary","Thank you, Andreas. I'd like to now give you a more in-depth review of taste and nutrition. Turning to the Taste business. In the fourth quarter 2018, currency neutral sales grew 5% with 3 of the 4 regions expanding year-over-year. This performance was led by mid-single-digit growth in North America and Greater Asia. All categories contributed to growth led by dairy and beverage. Segment profit was challenged due to higher RSA expenses and several other ongoing costs, which I don't expect to be continuing in a more of a one-off nature in the quarter.","For the full year 2018, currency neutral sales increased 5%, driven by growth in all regions and across all categories. Improvements were led by high single-digit growth in North America with strong double-digit growth in Tastepoint; mid-single-digit growth in EAME, led by double-digit growth in Africa and the Middle East; and in Latin America led by strong double-digit growth in Argentina.","Taste currency neutral segment profit on a full year basis grew approximately 6%, led by volume growth and the benefits from our ongoing cost and productivity initiatives. In terms of segment profit margin, we continue to see margin expansion improving 60 basis points to an industry-leading 22.7%. In the scent business, fourth quarter 2018 currency neutral sales grew 3%. Performance was driven by mid-single-digit improvements in Fragrance Ingredients and low single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrances. Fine Fragrances were down slightly year-over-year, reflecting strong double-digit growth in the year-ago comparison.","For the year 2018, currency neutral sales grew 4% with the strongest improvement coming in Fragrance Ingredients, which grew high single digits. This was led by price increases and strong double-digit growth in cosmetic active ingredients. Consumer Fragrances grew mid-single digits, including price as performance was driven by double-digit growth in Hair Care and mid-single-digit growth in Fabric Care, Home Care and Toiletries, all led by innovation platforms. Scent currency neutral segment profit decreased approximately 2% as the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable price to input costs, reflecting unprecedented raw material inflation, including the previously announced citral supply issue as well as highest manufacturing -- higher manufacturing costs due to these supply chain challenges. It should be noted that over the course of 2018, due to external events, we continued to be impacted by incremental pressures in raw material costs.","Our pricing, as expected, accelerated throughout the year and was near 2%, 3% in the fourth quarter. However, it was not enough to cover the cost increases. As always, we'll continue to work with our customers on actions to mitigate the cost increases. In terms of segment profit margin, year-over-year performance was pressured. However, our profit margins remained strong at 17.5%.","Turning to Frutarom. In the fourth quarter, sales totaled approximately $360 million. Please note, and as a reminder, we closed the acquisition on October 4 and the financial results for Frutarom reflect the closing date, and as such, does not include a full quarter's activity. We're pleased to report that Frutarom returned to growth in the fourth quarter as like-for-like sales increased 3%, driven by strong improvements in natural product solutions and F&F ingredients. The core business, which excludes trade and marketing, grew 4% versus the prior year on a like-for-like basis. In terms of segment profit, the Frutarom division delivered $27 million and $66 million, excluding amortization. The margin profile for Frutarom in the fourth quarter was strong at 18.5%, excluding the amortization. This was a strong improvement when you compare it to what they reported in Q4 2017 as a stand-alone company.","In terms of cash flow, operating cash flow increased $46 million or 12% to $437 million compared to $391 million in 2017. The year-over-year increase was driven by increased earnings, depreciation and amortization and lower pension contributions offset by increased inventories. Core working capital was impacted by higher inventory to ensure business continuity during the supply chain challenges as well as higher material -- higher raw material prices. From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $170 million in capital expenditures or about 4.3% of sales, driven by new plant and capacity investments, mainly in Greater Asia.","As we discussed in the past, some of these investments include a flavors manufacturing facility in the Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone, which opened on October 9, 2018; and a Natural Products Research lab located in the Nanjing Life Science Park, which opened on October 15, 2018. The flavors plant is our second in China and is designed to supplement our existing flavors and manufacturing operations in Guangzhou. The Naturals Lab is our first outside of the U.S. China is a critical and component part -- component of our long-term research strategy. The opening of these new facilities will support our efforts to be a partner of choice and grow in this exciting region. Regarding cash returned to shareholders, we paid approximately $230 million or about 50% of adjusted net income in dividend payouts and $15 million on share repurchases.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Rich. I wanted to spend a few moments to highlight our integration priorities moving forward as we end the year 1 of this 3-year journey. As we spoke about earlier, integrating IBR into LMC is imperative to strengthen the product offering and drive accelerated growth and cosmetic active ingredients. As a reminder, cosmetic active ingredients is a very high-growth and high-profitable sector that we have prioritized moving forward. We want to ensure seamless combination of the Global Savory Solutions group to address customer needs by leveraging the technologies and expertise in our various categories.","By establishing a globally coordinated team, we will support strong local presence with global expertise as we offer a full range meat ingredient provider; novel flavors; functionality and technical expertise in texture, color, oxidation, plant protein and aromas to our entire customer base.","We will continue to consolidate the Frutarom taste business under the IFF taste leader as we move to capitalize on efficiencies and drive accelerated growth. The plan is to leverage our strong blueprint of our Tastepoint North America go-to-market approach to strengthen our exposure with small and mid-tier customers in every market around the world. In terms of synergies, which I will touch more in a moment, we plan to capitalize on significant make versus buy initiatives across our spend to drive strong year one cost synergies, and we will continue to execute our global site rationalization for improved efficiency.","Lastly, we will broaden our cross-selling activities and begin the execution on opportunities. A cross-functional global team has been established and is working diligently to generate incremental opportunities to capture a greater value. As I have said previously, I continue to believe this will provide the largest value-creation opportunity in the medium to long term.","Slide 16 provides an overview on the anticipated cost synergies in year one of our three year integration plan. Our integration program is well underway, developing and refining the work plans to unlock these value-creation opportunities. As you can see, we anticipate approximately $30 million to $35 million of expected savings in year one. The $30 million to $35 million will come from accelerating the rationalization and harmonization of our procurement spend. We will leverage higher spend on overlapping direct raw materials and rationalize. We will also leverage production capabilities where we are currently buying materials or intermediates at a higher price. We will also continue to rationalize the global footprint to optimize our global sites. Note that over time the contribution of our manufacturing rationalize will increase as it takes time to work with site closures.","Lastly, we will be streamlining overhead expenses by reducing nonstrategic costs and eliminating redundant expenses. This will ensure that we create an organization that focuses and directs spend to the most value-enhancing opportunities.","I would now like to turn the call back over to Rich, who'll give us an outlook for 2019.","Richard O'Leary","Thanks, Andreas. Over the last few years, we've seen a -- the global operating environment to continue to be volatile. There are several things that have direct implications on our industry and business in 2019 that I'd like to highlight. A clear headwind within our industry is the continued rise of raw material costs. In 2019, we expect mid-single-digit inflation on our legacy IFF business as synthetic materials continue to rise, driven by several supply chain disruptions that we've faced over the last 12 to 15 months. These market disruptions continue to disproportionately impact the scent business and is more -- as it is more broadly exposed to these raw materials.","It should be noted that when you combine 2018 and 2019, raw material cost inflation in the scent division is near 20%. Our strategic priority is to protect our customers business, which we were successful in doing in 2018. However, this comes at an incremental cost. This will require us to continue to work with our customers, taking additional price increases as we move through 2019 to ensure that we ultimately recover these cost increases over time. It should be noted that natural ingredients costs like vanilla and citrus markets remained elevated near historical levels. We expect to see a more muted cost increases for taste in 2019.","From an economic perspective, GDP growth on a global basis remains positive; however, many estimates were recently revised downward. There continues to be geopolitical tension and uncertainties around the world with examples like trade wars and Brexit. All in all, we are optimistic about our top line, but recognize that there is risk given the constantly changing operating environment. The U.S. dollar continues to fluctuate versus the world currency. As we are in generally a strong $environment year-over-year, the euro to $exchange rate is the most relevant to IFF. So you'll see the euro to $exchange rate stabilizing. It is positive.","From a profitability perspective, the euro represents approximately 30% of our profits, including the addition of Frutarom. Our rolling hedging program helps limit any volatility as we're currently hedged approximately 45% at an average rate of $1.21. Lastly, we've seen improved global consumer staples volumes in 2018, which we expect to continue in 2019. At the same time, local and regional customers continue to grow rapidly, a great opportunity as this is more prevalent to our business when incorporating 30,000 small and mid-sized customers that we acquired from Frutarom.","Before reviewing full year expectations for 2019, I want to highlight a few go-forward modeling assumptions. First of all, we will be referencing a combined 2018 result as if all aspects of the Frutarom transaction were retroactive to the start of 2018. First, in 2019, we expect a modest benefit from M&A, and yes, an additional week of sales or 53rd week. Currency is expected to be a headwind in 2019. We expect a headwind of approximately 3 percentage points on a combined sales growth and approximately 2 percentage points on adjusted EPS, ex amortization. We expect approximately $30 million to $35 million in cost synergies in 2019 coming from procurement, operations and overhead expenses as Andreas explained.","Following successful debt raised for the Frutarom acquisition, our debt outstanding is about $4.4 billion. And combined interest expense associated with this debt is approximately $150 million. Currently, we're assuming an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19% for 2019, but the dynamics around this remain fluid. For the purposes of calculating adjusted diluted EPS on a going forward basis, we estimate that there will be approximately 113 million shares outstanding, including 6.3 million shares related to the tangible equity units. Annual amortization of intangible assets is expected to be about $190 million to $195 million, down from our previous estimate.","Given the several moving parts, we felt it was important to give you an overview of the drivers between combined 2018 and 2019 sales. In terms of sales growth, we're targeting to achieve $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion in sales during 2019, representing a combined growth of 5% to 7%. In the chart, as you can see from second bar, approximately nine months of Frutarom adds $1.1 billion to our combined 2018 sales.","In the third bar, we've estimated approximately $45 million of divestitures related to noncore Frutarom businesses in Central Europe and the U.S. that takes us to a combined full year 2018 sales of $5.1 billion. In the fifth bar, we estimate approximately $150 million of headwinds due to currency, resulting in currency neutral combined sales number of $4.95 billion. If you then use our expected 2019 growth of 5% to 7%, you'll get our guidance of $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion in sales during 2019. We expect broad-based growth across all of our segments with pricing driving scent and volumes the key component of taste and food performance.","Moving on to a reconciliation of our 2019 adjusted EPS. We expect adjusted EPS of $4.90 to $5.10 and adjusted EPS ex amortization of $6.30 to $6.50. On the left side of the slide, you can see what we -- you can see that we expect 10% to 15% of growth in 2019 for adjusted EPS to get us to our range of $4.90 to $5.10. For adjusted EPS ex amortization, I'll walk you through the key drivers. Starting with the second bar in that section, $2.06 will be added to our full year 2018 number, representing the first nine months of Frutarom.","On the next bar, you can see that the full effect of the $4.4 billion debt issuance has a negative $0.55 impact. When you add that together with the share count dilution from the equity issuance going forward from approximately 80 million shares before issuance to approximately 113 million shares outstanding, it has approximately $1.71 share dilution impact on full year combined results. Combining that with approximately $0.13 related to other impacts, including tax rate, Frutarom minority interest and lower other income and expense in 2019, it gets you to $5.95 for the combined 2018 year. We expect approximately $0.12 related to currency in 2019 to bridge you to a currency neutral combined adjusted EPS of $5.83.","When you apply the 2019 expected growth rates of 8% to 11%, our guidance for 2019 comes out to be $6 -- $6.30 to $6.50. While we expect to see solid top line growth across the entire business, scent profitability is being adversely impacted by the additional raw material cost inflation where pricing actions take time to achieve the -- to achieve given the nature of our business. As we move beyond 2019, we would expect to see the results to accelerate as raw materials tend to begin to -- trends begin to normalize and we generate the majority of our integrations related in 2020.","Debt payment -- debt repayment continues to be a critical focus of ours. We're committed to reaching a 3x leverage ratio by 2020, down from our current 3.6x. Our intent is to retain an investment-grade rating and our management team's incentives are now aligned with the repayment debt metrics.","With that, let me turn it back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Rich. That was a lot of very complicated slides, but I hope it helps. As we look to the future, we're reconfirming our long-term targets. We expect to deliver between 5% to 7% currency neutral combined sales growth CAGR between 2019 and 2021. We also expect to deliver 10%-plus adjusted EPS ex amortization combined growth for the same period. So 2019 is the first very important step in the journey and the foundation to achieve our long-term targets.","In summary, we're pleased with our financial performance for 2018 as we delivered on all of our key metrics. We made strong advancement in both top and bottom line results as we recorded record-setting sales and adjusted EPS ex amortization. We also build an organization for accelerate -- accelerated profitable growth combining two strong organizations to create a truly global leader in taste, scent and nutrition.","As we look forward, full year 2019, we expect sales to be between $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion, adjusted EPS to be between $4.90 and $5.10 and adjusted EPS ex amortization in between $6.30 and $6.50 as Rich said. The coming together of IFF and Frutarom was a momentous achievement in 2018, and we're excited to be moving forward as one company and pursuing new opportunities that benefit all of our stakeholders around the world.","And with that, I would now like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","I wanted to ask about Frutarom. So sales growth improved sequentially, but was still below longer-term expectations. I guess, given tough comparisons in the business prior to the deal, I assume it doesn't meaningfully accelerate until 2Q. So maybe just verify if that's kind of what you believe? And then what gives confidence that 6% remains achievable, the only thing that you've seen so far that would increase confidence in that? And I guess, sort of related to that, any idea what shipments looked like in that business relative to demand in quarters prior to the deal close, meaning, like, could they have overshipped demand?","Andreas Fibig","Okay, Mark, so first of all, good morning. Let me answer the question. First of all, from the technical point of view, we certainly have much easier comparables in the second half of the year. So that's something which makes us very optimistic. We're also happy that after a softer third quarter last year, the fourth quarter was turning around. People are again focusing on the business after we have done the close on the 4th of October. We have started the integration very, very well, and as we said before, we were happy that we could close the deal a couple of weeks ahead of our original timing and that pays off because everything is going according to plan. So people can go back and focus on the customers. I believe that's super important. Leadership is clear, and we really can make sure that we see the customers and sell. What makes me optimistic is that first of all, we're in some of the faster-growing segments, which is super helpful, and particularly, in the adjacency -- adjacent business. We're with some of the faster-growing customers as well, and particularly, in Europe and in the U.S. And we haven't even tapped into the cross-selling opportunity, but we see already that our teams are generating really good ideas and having implemented a couple of pilots and that makes us pretty optimistic on the Frutarom piece. So all in all, a very, very positive picture from our point of view.","Richard O'Leary","Yes. I think, Mark, from a -- as you said, I think Q1 will be the most challenging from a comp standpoint, a little bit better in Q2, obviously Q3. And the second half, as Andreas talked about, will be -- will see the fastest acceleration. I think the other thing to me was, clearly, North America was one of the challenged markets. I think we've done -- we've put the leadership in place now. There was a vacancy prior to the closing. And I think now we're getting much and much more alignment and integration between Frutarom's taste business in North America and our Tastepoint business. So that I think that will enable us to accelerate growth. I think we've already seen very, very quickly some real opportunities in terms of where we combine our two capabilities to drive growth on projects that the two companies individually weren't able to tackle.","Mark Astrachan","Got it. Okay. So just to be clear, then 6% remains the target? And then I just want to switch to a separate question on free cash flow, Rich. It's diverged from an income in recent years. Does this normalize in your view in 2019? I think you'd mentioned given inventories being inflated given the supply chain challenges. So does the inventory piece specifically improve? And are there any other anticipated items that will impact cash generation in '19 as far as you can tell?","Richard O'Leary","Yes, I think, to your first comment, our expectations in terms of the 6% is certainly our -- still our expectations for the Frutarom business going forward. In terms of cash flow, yes, I think that in the last two years, if I look at cash flow from operations compared to adjusted net income, it was in the 80% to 90% range. '19 was -- or '18 was clearly challenged by the inventories, which were up $130-something million. In '19, I would expect the inventory number to stabilize. I don't think it's going to get better yet. We're going to be challenged with the mid-single-digit cost increases that I alluded to on our legacy business. But I think that's where we see going forward, stabilization in '19 and then improvements beginning in '20 going forward. Overall, I would expect that cash from working capital impacts in 2019 to actually be favorable versus a big outflow in 2018. And overall, I would say, when you take that into consideration plus the increased D&A, I would expect our conversion of cash from operations versus adjusted net income to be above 100%. So much better than what we have been for the last two years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy","To talk about the Flavors business, I think the organic growth of 2% in the quarter was a bit disappointing relative to what it had done in the rest of 2018. So just as you talked about your expectation for the Frutarom business, I'd love to hear how you're thinking about your base business? So Flavors and Fragrances, it seems like you're embedding a bit of an acceleration in 2019. So if you could just break those two components out, that would be helpful?","Richard O'Leary","Yes, Faiza, it's Rich. I mean, I think that clearly, there's been -- Q4 was a disappointment, but I think you also got to keep in mind the prior year comparables and a very strong Q3. I think that in -- with 2020 hindsight, it looks like a portion of the strong growth that we saw in Q3 is some element of inventory because we see -- we saw a positive impact from volume erosion, which was actually favorable in Q3 in the taste business and it turned unfavorable in Q4. So I think there's clearly an element associated with inventory adjustments and movements on the part of our customers. On a two year basis, growth for Flavors is probably around 4%, and on a full year basis, growth rates were -- on a two year basis are probably in the 5% range. So I think, partly, the fundamentals of our taste business haven't changed, our expectations haven't changed. We are clearly seeing, particularly in the fourth quarter, some volume erosion and lower volumes on -- with global customers, the large CPGs. It's hard to say right now whether that's again a continuation in the inventory correction. But I think, overall, our expectations are -- going forward have not changed significantly. I think it's still going to be a challenging year, but the potential of the business hasn't changed.","Andreas Fibig","And on the Fragrance side, we can say we're winning good businesses. We had for the Fine Fragrance business, a very tough comparison for the first quarter. But looking forward, and particularly, if we look at the win rates we have in-house already, we're very optimistic on the Fine Fragrance business. I think for the Fragrance and scent business, it's not too much about the, let's say, the growth rate in terms of sales and the win rate, I think we're doing extremely well here. It's more about managing the raw material crisis, making sure that we can realize our price. And what makes us super optimistic on it is that we have won three more global core list. We never had -- we didn't have before, and that gives us just a more expanded reach of our business opportunities. Whether we can big times already capitalize in '19, I'm not sure because it takes a little bit of time, but on the midterm, I'm very optimistic on this one because these were significant wins the team brought in end of last year.","Faiza Alwy","Okay. So Andreas, you mentioned the -- managing the pricing amid this raw material inflation. Like what is sort of -- what is embedded in your outlook for '19 for pricing? And how much of that pricing have you already taken? And how much do you have to go back to the -- to your global customers and try to get that pricing?","Richard O'Leary","I mean, Faiza, that process is already underway. I think, when you look at the guidance and our expectations for 2019, it's about 1.5% of pricing and all in the scent business. And that process is already underway. I think it's as -- that's the same thing -- it's like rewind button. It's a tough discussion, but Nicholas' team has done -- they understand the importance, our customers understand that we work through the normal mechanisms of price and other activities to do that. I think we did an excellent job in 2018. And our price realization was in line with our expectations. What was the surprise was the cost impact as we progressed through the year continued to increase and accelerate. So I'm confident in the medium- and long-term that we're going to recover the price increases, but '19 is going to be another challenging year.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. And actually, if you compare ourselves to one of our bigger competitors, then you see that the erosion of the EBITDA margin was actually less. So that basically it is a testament for me that the teams are doing a good job here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kate Grafstein from Barclays.","Katie Grafstein","If we could talk a little bit about gross margins for 2019, if you could walk through some of the moving pieces? And how should we think about incremental pricing needing to cover inflation in Fragrances? And can we assume gross margins could actually be up as that pricing comes through in the back half of the year?","Richard O'Leary","I mean, actually, no, I think, as I said, we've got about 1.5% built in to the targets for our objectives for 2019 in terms of pricing. Again, all of that -- substantially all of that in the scent business. I think that on the taste side, it's more flat from a pricing standpoint. From a margin standpoint, it's going to be dilutive because we're going to have the sales and we're recovering -- we're looking to cover the cost increases and we're playing catch-up again versus what we -- the way we exited 2018, and then on top of that, we've got additional increases expected in 2019. So there's going to be a time lag as it has been. And in time, there is a level of this magnitude of 20% over a two year basis. From an overall margin standpoint, I think the other thing to keep in mind is the mix impact between the three businesses. And so you've got Frutarom that's going to represent about 1\/3 -- about 30% of the overall total from a sales standpoint. Their margins or our gross margins when you look at how we report are from the U.S. standpoint -- U.S. GAAP standpoint. They're in the high 30s, about call it 38%, in that range, in that high 30s. So that has a dilutive impact. So our margin year-to-year is going to be -- it's going to be diluted and not going to go up in 2019. I think will help -- some of the synergies will help, but that synergy is going to get split between overhead expenses as well as cost of goods sold. I think we'll get some, but it's not going to be a significant step up from '19 to '18 or '18 to '19.","Andreas Fibig","You will see it probably in 2020 because then the synergies on the manufacturing side start kicking in and taking into -- let's say, taking the assumption, which I think is fair that the raw material inflation hopefully will stop this year, then you -- we will see a significant improvement in 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from KeyBanc.","Michael Sison","In terms of Frutarom, could you walk us through what the expectations should be for sales in '19, I guess, from the $1.1 billion that you noted in the presentation? And then, I guess, when you report operating income for '19, what should that look like, you'll be reporting it with amortization, right?","Andreas Fibig","Correct.","Richard O'Leary","Yes. So if you take the $1.1 billion we've got -- we've adjusted for the -- you basically take out about, as I said, about $45 million of business. That -- we -- the biggest piece of that we sold in the fourth quarter. There is a small piece that will be discontinued. We expect it to be discontinued in early 2019. So then the base is net of those two elements. And then, from there, I would say the 6% that we've talked about is our expectation for 2019. From a profitability standpoint, the amortization will be included in the division results as it is for all three divisions. We do that to maintain. That's how we measure the business performance. It's how we look at it from an incentive comp standpoint. And it's how we keep things tied back to our economic profit principles. And that's why we look at it both -- at a division level on a segment profit basis, including amortization, and on a corporate level, we've added the element of ex amortization from an overall cash flow standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann from Bernstein.","Gunther Zechmann","Mike and Andreas, two questions. Just, can you talk a bit about the sales leverages that we're expecting for the Frutarom business? I think I remember you saying 50 bps per annum. When do you see that really kick in? And also, if you can discuss what the incremental margins are that you expect from that? That's the first one. The second one is pretty quick I have. In the 5% to 7% sales growth guidance for 2019 that you put, is it fair to assume that, that's organic sales growth or is it just local currency with some bolt-ons as well?","Andreas Fibig","Maybe you take the last one, and I think I'll take the other one.","Richard O'Leary","Yes. Do you want me to go first? Okay. So out of the -- in the 5% to 7%, there is, as I said, about 1.5% related to price. There is about some -- a little bit between 50 basis points and 100 basis points or call it a middle 75 of impact related to the 53rd week and a small amount of M&A and the balance is organic volume.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. And on the cross-selling, we will be -- first of all, we will be more, let's say, concrete on it when we do our Investor Day in the mid of the year. But what we see and the teams are working on it that we have the first, let's say, pilots running. We had the first couple of wins, small ones, but we see that they are really good and significant sizable opportunities. So I believe, it will actually start probably at the end of the year, and then going into 2020 that we see an impact on the cross-selling, which is really, really good. And we will make sure on the margin side to answer that question that we go into this more higher-margin business that we'll certainly put our resources behind the areas and categories while we can earn better margin than we have, and we'll probably let some of the lower-margin business go. So that's as an answer, and by the way, on the growth rate, as Rich said in one of his bridges, we have lost a couple of sales as well because we have sold or we are selling some of the smaller business from Frutarom just as an FYI.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts","In the Frutarom shareholder filings, they had a 2018 projected revenue number of $1.75 billion. And so, on Slide 20, if I take your $1.1 billion and add your fourth quarter of $360 million, coming up about $300 million short today, finished the year like the -- was the fourth quarter $300 million below what they were thinking earlier in the year? That seems like way too bigger gap, like the math is wrong here somehow?","Michael DeVeau","Yes, John, its Mike. Just remember, from a Frutarom guidance standpoint pre the acquisition, that was a 2020 guidance, right. So that $300 million was a number they had that was going to go out in another couple of years.","Richard O'Leary","But look, clearly, John, I mean, third quarter built in -- at that point, in the numbers. They were not expecting to have a negative growth in Q3, and they were not expecting -- I don't think those numbers were based on having 3%, 4% growth in Q4. So the second half of the year was clearly weaker than what that was projected. There is a currency element between that and what we built into our assumptions for 2019. And clearly, there is -- I think there was M&A that they had expected to occur during 2018 that has not occurred. So I think it's a combination of all of that that much but it's not $300 million in the fourth quarter that was causing the difference.","Andreas Fibig","No. No.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester from Citi.","Daniel Jester","Just on the cost synergies side, now that you have the asset for a couple of months, can you talk about your confidence level in getting that $145 million target? And if we do see a slowdown from a macro perspective, is there anything you can do to accelerate those cost savings?","Andreas Fibig","Yes, let me take it. First of all, our confidence level on the synergies is very, very high because we see it already on the run rates we have for some of these elements like procurement and even the footprint rationalization. I'm saying run rate because of P&L impact. We had to go circa to inventory in 2019 to make it happen, but confidence levels is very, very, very high. If the economy is going down or is not growing as fast as we saw it in 2019, we have other levels -- levers to play here as well to make sure that we reach our numbers, but I'll give it to you Rich.","Richard O'Leary","I think what built into the guidance that we have for 2019 is investments that we've -- we want to make to drive future growth. I mean, Nicolas -- Andreas talked about Nicolas' business and the new core list that we've gained access to. In order to realize that potential, we've got to invest in resources, whether it's commercial people, boots on the ground, C&A resources, consumer insights and research, that's embedded in that -- in our guidance for 2019. It's probably 300 to 400 basis points of investment. If the year unfolds differently, we can certainly slow that down and make choices as we've done over the last 2 to 3 years as -- particularly in '16 and '17, we slowed back investment and we cut it back to try to mitigate the impacts of weaker top line. That will always be part of our management process and then trade-offs that we have to evaluate. Part of that 300 to 400 that I talked about is really playing catch-up, and while we -- as we progress through 2019, that's the first thing we'll do is say, are we on track from an external in looking viewpoint and what do we do as a result of that?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Just a couple of questions on Frutarom. In your descriptions of the taste and scent business, you talk about local currency growth or currency neutral growth, but in the Frutarom business, you talk about 3% growth on a like-for-like basis. Can you remind me what like-for-like means? And how that factors in acquisitions or currencies or whether it does or it doesn't? And then secondly, Frutarom's sales were much higher in the first and second quarter, they were $385 million and $401 million. Why were the sales for Frutarom so much higher in the first and second quarters than they were in the third and the fourth?","Andreas Fibig","You do the first one.","Richard O'Leary","Yes, let me take -- I'll take the first one, Jeff. You're right, it's a different methodology. I mean, they've always used like-for-like. And we'll evaluate as we go forward if there is a way to combine the two methodologies. Like-for-like represents that if -- what they do is they then back in and say if there is an acquisition that was done in the middle of any year, they take the prior year growth and put it back, prior year sales and compare prior year sales for the acquisition to current year sales for the acquisition. So again, it's almost -- it's measuring on a pro forma basis as if the acquisition -- any current year acquisition was affected as of the first of the prior year. So they're looking at the organic growth of that business plus the organic growth of the existing businesses. So it's a slightly different methodology. It's almost like same-store sales. It is a bit different than what we're doing. But it was the most practical way for the time being for us to look at it on a combined basis.","Andreas Fibig","Okay. And I think that's important that we have to, let's say, bring it all at the same level that we can compare apples-to-apples. Let me take the second piece of your question, Jeff, is on Frutarom first half to second half. Certainly, seasonality plays a role. Second, we had an unfavorable currency situation at the second half of the year as well because it's a lot of euro denomination in their sales. For the consolidation to our numbers, the three days we're missing because we closed on October 4. And then what we should not underestimate, particularly in the third quarter, that there was certainly a distraction of the organization to get the closing of the deal done. We are happy that we closed actually ahead of time, as we said, but that was certainly a couple of weeks or months even of the organization where they were more focused getting the closing done than selling to those customers. And then we're very happy and actually are optimistic because it turned around already in the fourth quarter and that's a very good sign. So that's the explanation for the sales first compared to second half of 2018.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Just a quick one. Andreas, you're on the board, and I know, Rich, you were there, I think, you were controller for a lot of the cultural changes under Doug and Kevin that took place, I think, just focusing on more profitable briefs, like that's sort of business process stuff. Could you compare the culture at Frutarom and the integration challenges or integration opportunities you see just as far as the cultural organizing from most profitable, least profitable and basically risk adjusting, all of that, to what you went through back then? And if there is that kind of opportunity, how that plays into your synergy plan?","Andreas Fibig","I would say, Jon, a very interesting and good question because here are certainly opportunities for us to look at the profitability of the different businesses. And we're doing it even much broader that we look into all categories and all customers right now. And we will present to the board in May by the way to look where we put our dollars behind and where we might walk away or make sure that we don't invest too much money to make sure that we're really going after the opportunities, which are giving us the best yield for our dollar. So that's good. In terms of the culture, what is good is that with the acquisition, we got a lot of energy from the company, which is very commercially focused and that will help us as well to focus on our customers and make sure that we get the best out of the customers and that we have a good service in place here as well. So that will be my answer, but Rich, you please supplement.","Richard O'Leary","Yes. I think, Jon, it's -- in some ways, the fundamentals of the cultural change are similar in the sense that the biggest thing back under Doug, Kevin was a shift in focus and understanding from just top line growth to profitability and margins and accretive business, the whole EP focus. And I think I can clearly tell you that the Frutarom mentality, Frutarom DNA is all about profitable growth. And they focus on margins day in, day out. You've heard me take about their Executive Information System and they live through that day in, day out. They're focused on what are the -- what's the margin expansion, what's the mix improvement. So I think, from that standpoint, it's very similar in terms of we both companies recognize the importance of profitable growth. I think the challenge that we were going to have to manage through as an executive team is, now we have a much bigger business and the choices that we have are much bigger. And so we're going to have to manage through that because we don't have endless resources. So it's both a benefit and a challenge that now we have to allocate those resources and prioritize across a much wider spectrum of businesses.","Andreas Fibig","And that was actually one of the reasons for the acquisition, as we said, we wanted to increase the option space for us because now, as Rich said, we can -- we have natural colors, we have health ingredients, we have food protection, we have flavors, we have fragrances, we've active cosmetics, and that gives us good choices. And actually, it helps us as well to balancing a very weaker global environment as well. So we believe it's good to have options, and we have no more options than we had ever before, probably more options than many of our competitors, and we believe that has positioned us actually in a very, very, very good spot.","With that, I think, Mike, we will close the call for today, but I would like to remind you that we are at CAGNY next week. And we have a CAGNY dinner where we will display all of these new franchises and categories we have now in store, and we'll give you an explanation what we can do with it. And you can experience it, you can taste it, you can smell it, and we believe it will be great. So I hope to see a lot of you next week in Boca actually with much warmer and better weather. And you will see it will be spectacular. Thank you very much. Take care.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.

Then we will be happy to take any questions that you may have.","Starting with a recap of our first nine months performance, growth was strong across our key financial metrics. Currency neutral sales increase 6% year-to-date, with Flavors growing 6% and Fragrances growing 5%. New win performance and price increases to mitigate rising material cost, both contributed to consolidated growth.","From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 4%, supported by volume leverage and our focus to drive greater efficiency throughout our business via cost and productivity initiatives.","Currency neutral adjusted EPS improved 11%, driven by adjusted operating profit growth as well as a more favorable effective tax rate. Our strategic priorities continue to drive overall performance over the first nine months of 2018. Sales of our Re-Imagine Modulation portfolio grew strong double-digit and PowderPure grew an impressive triple-digits, both indicative of our position as a leader in innovation.","Performance with local and regional customers remained strong, growing double that of our global customers, which on a consolidated basis is about 50% of our customer base. In Flavor specifically, our mid-size go-to-market platform, Tastepoint, continued to deliver strong results, improving strong double-digits in the first nine months of 2018. In terms of maximizing our portfolio towards our most margin accretive categories, cosmetic active ingredients continued its robust growth trend by improving double-digits. Also on the Fragrance side, hair care grew double-digits and home care and toiletries improved high-single digits. In Flavors, growth was strong in dairy and beverage, improving double-digits and high-single digits respectively.","We also continue to focus on driving greater efficiencies throughout our business via cost and productivity initiatives, which allows us to reallocate resources to efforts that drive the greatest returns and maintain strong profitability. This yielded strong results in the first nine months of 2018. And so our cost and productivity initiatives, including zero-based budgeting added approximately 5 percentage points of gross to currency neutral adjusted operating profit and EPS growth. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with how well our refreshed priorities are performing and believe better positions us to drive long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich.","[07BDC1-E Rich O'Leary]","Thanks, Andreas, and good morning, good afternoon, good evening to everyone.","Moving on to our Q3 performance, currency neutral sales in the second quarter grew 4%. Growth was led by new wins and price increases to mitigate the impact of raw material cost inflation. From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit increased 3% in the third quarter, as top line growth and the benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives was offset by unfavorable price to input costs, inclusive of the BASF citral issue and weaker sales mix. Pricing was up more than 2 percentage points in the quarter on a consolidated basis.","Despite the sequential acceleration in the third quarter, as expected, it did not offset raw material pressure, as we continue to see a timing lag in the Fragrance business unit. Currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 12%, as a more favorable year-over-year effective tax rate offset higher shares outstanding and interest expense associated with the equity and debt raise during the quarter.","It should be noted that excluding the items that impact comparability, the adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 14% compared to 22.7% in the prior-year period. The year-over-year decrease was largely due to a more favorable mix of earnings, lower cost of repatriation, and the re-measurement of loss provisions, partially offset by adjustments to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the impact of current year transaction costs, including certain non-taxable gains on foreign currency in the prior year.","Looking at the business unit performance for the third quarter, Flavors currency neutral sales increased 7% even against a strong year-ago comparison of 12%, with growth coming in all categories and all regions. On a two-year average basis, growth remained very strong at approximately 9.5%.","North American Flavors improved 10% in the third quarter, led by double-digit growth at Tastepoint and strong performances in dairy and sweet. EAME increased 6% on a currency neutral basis, led by high-single digit growth in Europe as well as Africa and Middle East. Greater Asia grew 4% in the third quarter on a currency neutral basis, as it was led by double-digit growth in India and low-single digit increases in Indonesia, China, and ASEAN. Latin America increased 12% on a currency neutral basis, led by strong double-digit growth in Argentina as well as mid-single digit growth in Mexico.","Flavors currency neutral segment profit grew approximately 7%, led primarily by volume growth and the benefits from ongoing cost and productivity initiatives. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margin, our profile remains strong at 22.1%.","Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 2% on a strong year-ago double-digit comparison, with growth in nearly all regions. From a category perspective, Consumer Fragrances grew 2% on a currency neutral basis, as performance was driven by continued growth in hair, home, and fabric care. Fine Fragrances declined 2% on a currency neutral basis, against a very strong 18% comparison from the prior year. From a regional perspective, Greater Asia increased strong double-digits and EAME increased low-single digits.","Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 5% on a currency neutral basis, led by strong double-digit growth in the cosmetic active ingredients business. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of growth in Fragrance Ingredients. As we continue to successfully execute our refresh strategy and we achieve strong realization of price increases.","From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency neutral segment profit decreased 5% on a currency neutral basis, as the benefits from productivity initiatives and cost management were more than offset by an unfavorable price to input costs, including the previously announced citral issue. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margins, our margins remains solid, yet were under pressure year-over-year.","Before moving on, I'd like to provide some more commentary on the raw material environment, like I did in Q2. As you remember, coming into the year we expected mid-single-digit raw material inflation in 2018, inclusive of the impact of the citral situation, heavier in the business units versus Flavors.","Since that time, cost inflation has picked up following a series of disruptions in the supply chain. Additional market disruptions continue to impact the Fragrance business unit, driven both by environmental considerations and new non-flavor and fragrance market demands for core raw materials. Unfortunately, we see further input cost and pressures in 2019, particularly in Fragrances. Our strategic priority is to protect our customers' business. However, this comes at a significant incremental cost and will require additional price increases as we move into 2019 to ensure we cover our raw material cost exposure.","Operating cash flow was $202 million in first nine months of 2018 compared to $199 million in the prior-year period. This was primarily driven by litigation in the prior-year period. Core working capital was impacted by higher inventory to ensure continuity of supply during unprecedented supply chain challenges as well as higher raw material prices.","From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $102 million in capital expenditures, or about 3.7% of sales, driven by new plant and capacity investments, mainly in Greater Asia. Some of these investments include a Flavors manufacturing facility in the Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone, which opened on October 9, and a Natural Products Research lab located in the Nanjing Life Science Park, which opened on October 15. The Flavors plant is our second in China and is designed to supplement our existing flavors and manufacturing operations in Guangzhou. The Natural lab is our first outside of the U.S.","China is a critical component of our long-term strategy. The opening of these new sites will support our efforts to be a partner of choice and to grow in this exciting region. We continue to believe that we will spend approximately 4% to 5% of sales for the full year 2018 on CapEx.","Regarding cash returned to shareholders, during the first nine months, we spent approximately $163 million on dividends and $15 million on share repurchases. As a reminder, as part of the Frutarom combination, we paused our share repurchase program, as we will prioritize debt repayment going forward. We will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation as we accelerate growth through organic investments and strategic acquisitions while returning significant capital to shareholders.","Before turning it back to Andreas, I'd like to provide some commentary on Frutarom's estimated results for Q3 2018. Please note that this information is for informational purposes only, and they reflect Frutarom's results when it was under the previous ownership and prior to the completion of the acquisition on October 4.","For the third quarter, net sales are expected to be between $360 million and $365 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 21%. Performance from a top line perspective is expected to be up low single digits versus prior year, driven by the contribution of acquisitions and offset by foreign exchange headwinds.","It should be noted that sales growth, while up year over year, was negatively impacted by customer order patterns, specifically in more commodity-oriented businesses such as trade and marketing and Frutarom's citrus processing business, which were both down double digits. Excluding these businesses, growth would have increased mid-single digits on a reported basis, and high single digits if we excluded foreign exchange impacts.","In the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin continued to be solid, improving approximately 40 basis points year over year, led by gross margin improvements as well as expense control. On a year-to-date basis, sales are expected to be approximately $1.15 billion, an increase of about 15%. In terms of profitability, we expected adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 21.5%, which is a strong year-over-year improvement of approximately 175 basis points.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Rich.","I would like now to give you a quick update on our Frutarom combination. I'm very happy to say that on October 4, we completed the combination with Frutarom. This is ahead of our original expectations of six to nine months from May 7 announcement. The coming together of IFF and Frutarom is a momentous achievement, and we're excited to be moving forward as one company while pursuing new opportunities that benefit all our stakeholders around the globe.","I applaud the integration teams around the world that over the past several months have been working to ensure that we capture the best of both companies and create a seamless and efficient transition to achieve both our operational and financial targets for this combination. Together, we create a global leader in natural taste, scent, and nutrition. IFF has now a stronger product offering, broader access in attractive adjacencies, and stronger exposure to fast-growing customers.","We expect to generate cost synergies of $145 million through raw material harmonization, footprint optimization, and streamlining overhead expenses by the third full year after the completion of the merger. Additionally, cross-selling opportunities and integrated solutions are expected to provide revenue synergies to our shareholders progressively over time.","Through this combination, we are confident in the opportunities that lie ahead and the ability of the combination to accelerate financial performance and targeting sales growth an average of 5% to 7% and 10%-plus adjusted EPS growth, excluding total company amortization between 2019 and 2021, all on a currency neutral and pro forma basis.","Let's take a look how the new IFF is positioned now that the transaction has been completed. As you can see from the slide, we instantly have the number two global market position in the industry, with approximately 33,000 customers globally, selling about 150,000 unique product solutions annually. Our organization is fueled by 13,000 hardworking employees in more than 110 manufacturing sites and approximately 100 R&D centers and labs around the world.","This historic combination sets us up to service our customers like we never have done before, being able to offer them a stronger product offering to help them create differentiation in the marketplace. With the addition of Frutarom's offerings, we instantly become a leader and natural capabilities extending across our entire platform.","Our combination creates a highly diversified portfolio, with exposure to fast-growing categories and customers. Being that our product offering is now extending beyond our traditional industry, we have renamed our business segments from Flavors and Fragrances to Taste and Scent respectively.","To ensure we deliver a seamless experience to our newest customers, we intend to preserve Frutarom's best-in-class customer-facing capabilities, which will enable us to maintain the strong relationships Frutarom has built, while capturing this significant cross-selling opportunities we will have as a combined company. As a result, our intention is to report Frutarom as a standalone business unit. Based on projected pro forma 2018 sales, we expect Scent to be approximately 35%, Taste to be about 33% and Frutarom about 32% of our entire business.","And now, looking at our Executive Leadership team, Matthias Haeni and Nicolas Mirzayantz will continue to lead our Taste and Scent division respectively. Leading the Frutarom division, I'm pleased to welcome Amos Anatot, who spent eight years at Frutarom in leadership positions, with his most recent role as Executive Vice President of Global Supply Chain and Operations. He has a great perspective of the taste, savory solutions, flavors and fragrance ingredients, Taura and trade & marketing businesses and that's been actively involved in integration as a leader from Frutarom.","Within Frutarom, I would like also to welcome Yoni Glickman, who will run Natural Product Solutions, which includes health, colors and food protection. He most recently held the position of present Natural Solutions at Frutarom, where he led the company's natural food colors, antioxidants, cosmetics and health ingredients business.","This leadership structure is in place since the 4th of October to run these businesses in a manner that leverage our strengths and supports our customers. Aligned with this approach, we are already capitalizing on a few quick wins. For example, leveraging our Tastepoint go-to-market strategy for small- and mid-size customers in North America, we are integrating Frutarom's North America taste business into our own. As a reminder, Tastepoint is designed to serve the dynamic and faster-growing middle-market customers in North America, a key driver of growth.","By combining the Frutarom North America taste business with R&D, technology and consumer insight of IFF, we are strengthening the innovative go-to-market approach that targets unique needs and expectations of this subset of customers. As you have seen since inception, Tastepoint has been a success, evident by our strong growth with small- and mid-sized customers in North America. This transition should be seamless, as the go-to-market model used by Frutarom's North America flavors business is perfectly in line with what we have at Tastepoint.","Another example is in cosmetic actives. While we are shifting Frutarom's cosmetic active ingredients business into our Lucas Meyer Cosmetics business. Established in 1995, Israeli Biotechnology Research or IBR researches, develops, manufactures, and markets innovative and proprietary natural active ingredients for the cosmetics and dietary supplement industries, mainly for cellular and skin anti-aging, skin protection from UV rays and air pollution, skin whitening, and pigmentation prevention.","By combining these two businesses, we have strengthened our cosmetic active ingredients portfolio sold to some of the world's leading cosmetic companies. We believe this will support continued growth in this highly profitable category. And all of these measures we have started already since the closing of the deal, which is ahead of time.","With that, I would like to ask Rich to provide some perspective for the full-year 2018 financials.","[07BDC1-E Rich O'Leary]","Thank you, Andreas.","Before providing full-year expectations, I wanted to clarify a few go-forward model assumptions. First, following the successful debt raise, our total debt outstanding is approximately $4.4 billion. The annual interest expense associated with this debt is expected to be between $150 million and $155 million per year. Currently, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 19%, more or less the average of the two standalone companies.","For purposes of calculating adjusted diluted EPS on a go-forward basis, we estimate that there will be approximately 113 million diluted shares outstanding, including 6.3 million shares related to the tangible equity units. Annually amortization is expected to be approximately $220 million and subject to change based on the finalization of the purchase price accounting.","In terms of our go-forward reporting, please note that we have modified the way we will disclose adjusted EPS. Previously, adjusted EPS was reported EPS excluding items that affect comparability. In addition to these exclusions, going forward, we will also exclude full amortization for the total company. We believe that this metric provides useful period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operational performance and cash generation capacity.","Looking at the full year 2018, inclusive of Frutarom's fourth quarter estimated results, we are targeting year-over-year advancement in both top- and bottom-line results. We expect our sales to be between $3.95 billion and $4.05 billion for the full year, with similar contributions to Q3 in our legacy IFF business as well as sequential improvements in Frutarom sales performance versus the growth they achieved in Q3.","We also expect our adjusted EPS to be between $6.25 and $6.45 excluding one-time items that may affect comparability and total company amortization for the full year. For reference purposes, we expect 2018 amortization for the full year to be approximately $83 million, made up of $37 million of legacy IFF amortization, $9 million from legacy Frutarom amortization, and an estimated $37 million from the purchase price accounting related to the (00:25:02) transaction.","With that, let me turn it back over to Andreas for his final remarks.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Rich.","In summary, we are pleased with a strong financial performance in the third quarter, as we achieved growth in all of our key financial metrics. Our strong performance in the first nine-months was driven by our refreshed priorities, as we continue to focus on the execution of our long-term strategy, accelerating growth, increasing differentiation and driving cost efficiencies to drive sustainable, profitable growth in the future and maximize value creation for our shareholders.","As we look towards the remainder of the year, inclusive of Frutarom results for the fourth quarter, we expect strong advancements in top- and bottom-line results as noted by Rich.","Looking forward, comes a bittersweet realization that the third quarter 2018 was our final as legacy IFF. We are now embarking on the next major chapter of IFF history. We believe that our combination with Frutarom, the largest transaction of its kind in our industry, is fundamentally going to expand our customer and employee base and product offerings. We will have greater exposure to fast-growing customers, broader access to attractive adjacencies and a very differentiated portfolio, with an increased focus on naturals and health and wellness, as well as more comprehensive solutions.","We believe this will translate into accelerated financial performance as a combined company, with robust top- and bottom-line growth, leading to strong returns for our shareholders.","With that, we would now like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks and good morning, everybody.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Mark.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hi, Mark.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I have heard worse by the way on the last news if that's what you're talking about. So, on the business, though it's helpful commentary on Frutarom for 3Q, I guess, related to that, so what gives you confidence that it can improve in 4Q? And if I'm doing the math correctly, why give such a large implied range of sales for the business? And kind of related to that, if I remember also from Frutarom's results earlier this year, there was some volatility in their trade and marketing business in those results. So thoughts on maybe how that business fits with the new company going forward?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Let me start the first part of the question, and then I hand it over to Rich. So, first of all, we had a solid start and an acceleration in growth with the Frutarom business for the fourth quarter, so that's a good part. And we are actually ahead of the integration. What is the big benefit for us is that we have closed the deal earlier than we sought. The teams were well-prepared. The leadership structure is in place. And most of the insecurity is gone, which we usually have when you embark in such kind of a deal. And that, let's say, fills the optimism for the fourth quarter and the year going forward.","So good start, as I said, financially. Secondly, we have the organization in place to perform and we see that people are very motivated, leadership structure is there. They're going after it. We are talking already about cross-selling opportunities, which I always said is probably mid- and long-term, the biggest value creation opportunity we have here. We have the first small signs of cross-selling successes, which is fantastic, and that, I would say, fuels the optimism of the organization that the fourth quarter will go in the right direction. But in terms of the guidance...","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah, Mark, in terms of the guidance range, I wouldn't read too much into that. It's probably the simplest answer is I didn't want to have to go out to three digits in terms of the range, and so we picked basically a $50 million range around that. There's nothing more than that. As Andreas had said, I think that the first \u2013 the fourth quarter, the start to the first quarter is in line with what we expected. We've seen the improvement in Frutarom's performance into the start to Q4. I mean, I think we do believe that a big piece of the Q3 performance was driven by specific incident-related items, whether it's the trade and marketing or whether it's customer order patterns in a couple of businesses.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then on the trade and marketing, any thoughts on how that fits with the business going forward? And on the implied EBITDA, from a run rate standpoint, first half of the year I think was maybe a little bit stronger than kind of 21-ish. Is there anything within those numbers that perhaps makes them less sustainable going forward or were there \u2013 how much was contribution from acquisitions, for example, and is 21% kind of a good run rate to use going forward?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay. I'll take the first part. For the trade and marketing, it's probably too early to tell, and it's part of a service we are providing with this business unit to some of our customers. It's certainly not a focus area where we want to invest, but we will evaluate it what we want to do with the business. But so far, it looks like a smart solution to have it in place, but not put too many resources behind it. Rich?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Mark, from an EBITDA margin standpoint, I think it's \u2013 within the Flavors business, probably there's some mix impact, probably there is a little bit of mix impact within Natural Product Solutions. I think there are a couple of projects in terms of productivity things that are about three or six months behind schedule, that were already underway within the Frutarom business. So that's probably a little bit of what we're seeing in the second half.","So I think overall, we don't see that there's any fundamental changes. Obviously, with the strong growth rates we saw particularly in Q1, the leverage component is much more advantageous in the first half than what we've seen in the third quarter.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. Thanks, guys.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. My first question was just around the go-to-market approach that you talked about in terms of leaving Frutarom to report independently. That was definitely different from what I had anticipated or expected to be the case. So I guess first, could you talk about, one, will you be giving us pro forma historicals that could just help us in terms of forecasting?","And the second thing is, it was just interesting to me that it looks like in terms of you're going to be rolling in the Frutarom North America flavors business into Tastepoint straight away. Is the approach going to be that piece by piece, Frutarom will be integrated into Taste and Scent? And this is just to create almost a bridge platform to go slowly, such that the Frutarom piece of this is independently reported will just be going down over time?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay. Rich, you get started.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","In terms of pro forma information, Lauren, we will on the year-end call, once all the numbers have been finalized, we'll provide a full-blown full-year pro forma for both the combined companies, so that represents the reference point going forward to the three-year guidance that we've talked about earlier. So we will provide that on the next call.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","And on the organizational setup, let's talk about the Natural Product Solutions, which is probably the most, let's say, adjacent businesses we have here at hand. That certainly is important to leave this as it is for now to make sure that we really capitalize on the growth opportunities because many of these businesses have higher growth in our core business and good profitability as well. So that's number one.","Number two, on the Frutarom business unit, we said we won't organize it like that to make sure that we don't lose speed and we don't lose our customer focus to these high-growth smaller and mid-sized customers. And over time, we will decide what part of the organization we are moving to the Taste solution on our side.","And it's right that the North America Taste business from Frutarom is mainly with smaller and mid-sized customers, so that creates for us a great opportunity to bring it together with our Tastepoint platform because it basically has the same business mechanics. And we believe that we can grow it significantly over the next couple of years when we house it in that area because, as I said, the mechanics are the same. And because we have already an approved model how to be successful in the North American market, we said this is probably the best thing we can do.","And we are very happy that with the early close, the integration is already underway, which is way ahead of the time we sought, because we \u2013 actually I was thinking that we might close at the end of the year, and then you have Christmas and it takes a while. Now we are already in full swing integrating this business. Okay?","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then my second question was just around the pricing and raw material environment commentary that Rich offered. So just where do you stand in terms of your sense of the incremental pricing you're going to want to be taking? Where do you stand in terms of those customer conversations? Do you have visibility for how that starts to flow through, or should we be thinking about it more as it will be gradual throughout 2019, so that you'll probably still see some gross margin pressure as you play catch-up throughout the year?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Lauren, a couple things. I think there is \u2013 unfortunately there's always a time lag as we go through this process.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I think we've talked about that in the past about certain contracts and arrangements have windows for that. But we are already having conversations, the businesses certainly are starting to have the conversations around what is going to be necessary. We're going to expect to see \u2013 on an overall basis, I would expect to see mid-single-digit increases next year, again, skewed heavily towards the Fragrance business, given the continued supply chain interruptions that we're dealing with there. The teams are already having those conversations with and teeing those things up with the customers, but I would expect to see some continued pressure during the course, but I also fully expect to see progress quarter by quarter going forward also.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that's great. Thank you so much.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Faiza.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So two questions for me too. One is just to follow up on the raw material and pricing commentary. Could you give us more color in terms of where you're seeing the most raw material inflation? I know you said Fragrances. But just more specifically, is it the naturals? Is that synthetics, petrochemicals? Where are you seeing more of that? And then do you think that you're going to be able to recover the entire raw material inflation, because it looks like you talked about two points of pricing this quarter, but you said that you still haven't offset the entire inflation. So do you anticipate being able to offset that as you go through 2019?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","So, Faiza, remember, a portion of that is related to the BASF, so that's something that still is being worked through. We're doing everything we can to mitigate the effects of the citral stuff. Some of it doesn't show up in pricing because we'll go through and work with customers on reformulations to adapt the cost base, so not everything is going to show up exactly. But I do expect over time that we will be able to recover this. We've got to protect our customers' business, but we also have to protect our bottom line. It's not easy. I'm never going to say it's easy. So I do expect, as I said to Lauren's question, I do expect us to see further pressure and continued focus on price realization in 2019.","In terms of where is it coming from, it's very much in the core feedstock type of ingredients for the Fragrance business. Again, in my comments, I mentioned that we've had supply chain interruptions. We started the year and we were at mid-single digits including citral. We've had issues in suppliers in India. We've had fires in India. We've had shutdowns in China on some of the core ingredient suppliers \u2013 chemical ingredient suppliers. More recently, more environmental-related supply chain restrictions, and we're also starting to see situations where demand is coming from non-F&F markets for the same raw materials, which is creating a supply and demand pressure point, and we don't expect new capacity come on in the short term.","So I think we're going to have to deal with it. Our customers understand what's driving it. We spend a lot of time walking them through the details, and then working with them in terms of how do we mitigate the impacts on both sides. So, it's going to continue. Unfortunately, we're in a period where it seems every six months something else is popping up and we're having to deal with it with our customers. We're probably going to have the third round of conversation with customers in a very short period around price increases that are necessary for us to protect our bottom line in the long run.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And then just my second question is around Frutarom again. I guess, I'm still not convinced that this is \u2013 like, I guess, I'm looking for more comfort from you in terms of how much of the Frutarom sales issue this quarter were timing related? And perhaps if you could update us on what your outlook is for like the Frutarom sales and EBITDA for fiscal 2018? So how much of a snapback are you expecting in the fourth quarter? So, were the timing issues more just the first half was better or are they going to come back in the fourth quarter?","And then related to that, now that you've owned the business for maybe a month, are there any surprises outside of the revenue shortfall in the third quarter? What are some of the key \u2013 biggest integration risks that you see around Frutarom? Just more color around that would be really helpful. Thanks.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sure, Faiza. Obviously, it's hard to pinpoint it exactly. What I can tell you is we've been able to, as I said in my comments, so if we look at some specific issues, the colors business has a pricing issue related to changes in the underlying raw materials. But that's had a big impact in that business. I talked about the timing of orders and order patterns, both in the citrus business as well as part of the savory business. So I think that's part of the reason why we believe it's a unique circumstance. Undoubtedly, there is \u2013 one of the biggest challenges any company that's going through this type of combination has to deal with is distraction.","We always do our best to try to keep everybody focused on both sides, but I can't \u2013 it's hard for me to sit there and say specifically how much of what we saw in Q3 is that. But I can tell you, again, if you take out these three or four specific items that we know what was driving it, we were more in line with the long-term expectations of that business of mid-single digit growth on a currency neutral basis.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","And then, as Andreas and I talked about in terms of the outlook and where we expect to see Q4, we are seeing and we do expect to see growth in Q4, probably not all the way back to where we would think it long-term, but certainly a marked improvement from what we saw in Q3.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","And that's actually very comforting, and particularly in the start into the quarter, which is really, really good. And again, I believe this early closing of the deal gives us a great opportunity to be ahead of schedule with our integration, because we just can \u2013 we have named our leaders already, the organization is in place and we can drive the performance. So, that's good.","What have we learned during the months we owned the business? Actually nothing which is a super big surprise to us. Maybe the only thing and that's more positive is when I listened to the teams which are working together on the cross-selling opportunity, and I said it in the last couple of months, but it solidified my view that the opportunity we can cross-sell their products and vice versa into different customer bases with the technology is probably a bigger opportunity than we had sought at the beginning, and that really can drive value over time.","And it will take some time, but the first signs are actually very, let's say, very encouraging. We had the first win actually on a West Coast customer where we helped the Frutarom team with our vanilla technology and vanilla formulation and that has led to a $3 million order, which they probably would never had received if we would not have helped out here, just to give one example. It's small, but it started earlier than I sought it. So that's how I would describe it.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Silke Kueck with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. How are you?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning. Very well. Thank you, Silke.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So there were a couple of acquisitions pending under Frutarom. And so I was wondering whether you can quantify what the \u2013 that maybe in like dollar terms, like, what the acquisitions of Frutarom added to Frutarom sales in the third quarter. What you expect for the fourth quarter and what you expect to \u2013 they may add in 2019?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Look, Silke, I think given that those \u2013 that the third quarter results are their numbers and we don't \u2013 I'm not comfortable disclosing that. I think in terms of M&A for \u2013 I mean we just continue to work together as you've heard Andreas and I talk about that we keep continue to work together on the pipeline. We've now reprioritized the comp \u2013 the two team's standalone pipelines into to a refined list based on our priorities and our needs going forward. We look to continue to execute against that pipeline. But I'm not \u2013 I really don't feel comfortable given the standalone nature of their results in Q3 coming in on the individual components of it?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","What you have seen so...","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, but...","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry. If I could add on this, Silke, what we have seen is that there were no acquisitions made this year during the process of the, let's say, the deal, let's say, the pre-deal months. But we have \u2013 as Rich said, actually we have a good pipeline of very value and technology-added opportunities. And I would not wonder if we could hopefully close two of these deals until the end of the year. They are smaller ones, but they would fit exactly into our wheelhouse. So, you see we're at a bit of a pause during that period. But now we are basically taking the combined pipeline with the new priorities and then going after it. And I think it will be a big success going forward.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I was just, like, interested in knowing what sort of, like, the acquisitions added that were already announced, not even like the things that may have happened between when the transaction was announced and at closing, just sort of like what was announced prior to acquiring Frutarom, of things that may have closed? I was just wondering what those acquisition benefits were for the quarter and what they may add for next year?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Look, again, they're going to disclose their results in the next two or three weeks. And then, we'll be in a better position to answer any questions at that point in time. I don't feel comfortable covering it right now.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. In terms of the DNA, and I apologize because I'm not as familiar with Frutarom as I could be. I thought that for the past two quarters that the D&A at Frutarom was something that was close to, like, $17 million a quarter, and what you said is you thought maybe it's something like $9 million a quarter?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Because we're just doing the amortization, not the D&A. So it's just adding back amortization.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, so amortization is $9 million of that, okay? That's helpful.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","That's correct.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then D is like another $8 million, okay. The last thing is more of a comment rather than a question, but I thought rather than having an aggressive accounting treatment on earnings, maybe it's helpful to just provide the EBITDA aspect of it because I get a separate EPS estimate rather than including all amortization, which just seems like an aggressive treatment.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I would disagree that it's an aggressive treatment. It's looking at the underlying profitability. But then, again, bridging \u2013 it's a simple way to bridge it back to cash flow generation. We've seen this done on several of the acquisitions of similar sizes. So I don't consider it aggressive. I'm trying to keep it, \u2013 the number of metrics that we have to communicate and monitor going forward to keep it simple.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hi, John.","Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","John.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","John?","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Can you hear me?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah, now we can.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yes. We can now.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. On slide 18, are we going to get operating earnings for four segments or three segments?","Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Only three.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Three.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","You're going to have Scent, Taste and then Frutarom.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then in terms of sales granularity reporting going forward, will we get the same granularity on Fragrances that we currently get, the regional plus Fine and Ingredients? And will we get any additional granularity on sales underneath the various Frutarom and Taste segments?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Look, John, we're going through that right now. But I would tell you that where I expect this to end up is we're going to report it the way we manage the business. So, on the Taste side of the business, we'll report along the regions, that's the way that business is run. On the Scent side, we'll report around the categories. And on the Frutarom side, I think we're getting around the regional numbers. Directionally, that's where we're headed.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Maybe just, I want to make sure on the guidance, that you can just clarify, the underlying IFF business, as we think about the fourth quarter and\/or where the previous constant currency or currency neutral sales growth was, has that expectation changed in anyway? I know there was an embedded deceleration in growth in the prior guidance based on the tougher comps and you slowed a little bit this quarter. But I just wanted make sure I am understanding kind of what the assumption is on both the top line and then constant currency operating profit for the legacy business for 4Q?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","No, no, nothing significant in terms of change, in terms of the legacy business, both in terms of top line and overall profitability. We're on target.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just as we think about 2019, on the Frutarom side, again, going back to some of the questions on the decel implied in 3Q, I mean it's a pretty \u2013 the constant currency growth looks like they were up in the high-single digits, kind of the 8%, 9% range in the first half of the year. And I don't know \u2013 we don't know exactly where it was for 3Q, but it looks to be kind of flat to up slightly organically. I mean, the confidence of that is this is really just a timing of order patterns and are not something kind of more serious that would it impact the revenue growth into the next year, just some additional thoughts there?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","No, actually not. Because the good thing is that fruit, the fruit business has a very wide and broad customer base, and it will be very unlikely that all of these customers also for the different categories decide all of a sudden not to buy. I think that gives us a great comfort that we will reaccelerate in terms of the growth. And we are in the middle of the budget process right now, and I hope in the next two or three weeks we will see how the numbers come out. But no big surprises here on this side, I would say it's actually what Rich alluded to, a couple of timing topics and on color, certainly the pricing topic. And then it were the weeks and the two months before we were doing the closing, and that certainly impacted the business as well. As we see, we are coming back right now and that's comforting for us. So that's how I would describe it.","And I think it's important to see, because the portfolio has such a wide range of different portfolio topics, plus the broad customer base, that gives us actually good protection against downside movements in the mid and the long term. And that's the reason why we are reasonably optimistic here for the future.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Adam, just a quick follow-up on my side. Again, I don't see anything in the discussions with the team around the third quarter or any expectations that would change our long-term expectations for the business. I think you're right. As we look into 2019, certainly the first half and the first quarter in particular are going to have tougher comps, stronger growth in the first half than what we expect to see in the second half in 2018.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Gunther.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Gunther.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Hey. Just a clarification on the amortization, the $220 million that you mentioned, just to make sure this includes also the non-Frutarom part of amortization that you're now including there. Thinking of David Michael, I think it was $7 million or so, and Fragrance Resources a few, so you're taking all of them together. And also on the amortization schedule, is there anything you can share at this point or when would you be able to give the phasing and the details around how to model that over the coming years? That's the first one.","And the second one on free cash, more a longer-term question, you've been run-rating with the IFF legacy business for a number of years now very consistently around the 12% free cash flow to sales level per year. I appreciate that you have cash outflows as you integrate the business. But as a run rate, is there any reason to believe why the cash profile should be different from that?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Let me start with the first question, Gunther. In terms of the $220 million, it's really roughly $36 million for the historical Frutarom, $37 million roughly for legacy IFF amortization, and then the incremental \u2013 the difference to that to $220 million, which is call it $147 million, is our current estimates of what the step up is going to be. I don't think Bob has finished the calcs yet, so it's going to take us a while. I would certainly expect that to be the basis for 2019, but we'll have more clarity, I'd say midpoint of 2019 at the earliest, but we'll update everybody if anything changes materially.","In terms of free cash flow generation, given the incremental step up, I would expect that ratio to go up. As we begin to see improvements on the IFF side in terms of working capital, we get through some of the inventory pressures that I've talked about earlier, both from a price and a supply chain issue, I think we will be able to drive further improvements from a working capital standpoint on legacy IFF businesses, and I think we see a significant opportunity, particularly on the payables side for the Frutarom business. So I think there's upside to the historical numbers that you were talking about.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Absolutely. And then if you go mid and longer term, also the CapEx will be ramped down, because we have on legacy IFF businesses, as you might know, still to finish our plant in India and in China and two big creative centers here in the U.S. And when we have done that, then the structure is actually in place. We need some CapEx investment on the legacy fruit business to absorb some of all our capacity here as well. But this is all done in the next two years, then CapEx will go down significantly. We had actually a CapEx discussion last Friday, and that will generate more free cash flow going forward as well. So that's how we see it, and it looks like it will go in the right direction.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","And that's all on the organic side. How do you think about providing capital to the Frutarom business to pursue acquisitions, and also what about the IFF legacy business looking for acquisitions longer term?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","It's in the business plan.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","I think as I said earlier, we don't look at it anymore as Frutarom's historical M&A and our historical legacy M&A. It's now one combined pipeline that's based on this strategy and the prioritized segments that we see going forward for the combined businesses. We're not done with all that work yet, but there are things that are in the pipeline that we are confident with, and we continue to work to pursue those.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Andreas's comment about CapEx, on a combined basis, I do see that coming down to probably somewhere between 3% and 3.5% on a combined basis after we get through 2019 and 2020 with all the integration work.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Yeah.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","So we have built into our cash flow projections, we have built into our leverage ratios incremental M&A over the next three years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning, thanks very much, a few quick ones. First, can you characterize the margin differential between Fine Fragrance and Fragrance ingredients? Is one materially higher than the other, and any comment about that?","Second, what can you \u2013 there was just a lot of great discussion about CapEx relative to depreciation. Can you give us a full-year run rate depreciation number, and then roughly what a full-year CapEx number looks like pro forma right now, depreciation versus CapEx for 2018 for the combined businesses on a full-year basis?","And third and finally, how did you get a $9.8 million settlement from a supplier related to a prior recall? I haven't quite seen that before. Thank you.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Okay. Let me start with the Fine Fragrance versus Fragrance ingredients, and I'm going to put \u2013 I'm going to take the cosmetic actives out of that comparison. I think on a gross margin basis, there's a significant difference. On a return on sales basis, it's much closer to \u2013 they're much closer to each other, given the relative overheads of those two businesses. So they're both attractive on an accretive basis, but gross margin wise, if you think about mix, Fine Fragrance is significantly higher than the Fragrance Ingredients business.","CapEx as a percent of sales, I have to come back to you on that one. I think for \u2013 let me come back to you on that one. I don't want to guess and do my math in my head over the call.","In terms of the insurance recovery, again, this is related to the product recall issue we settled with our customer last year. We wrote the check in early part of 2018. And then, we've gone back to the vendor's insurance company and worked on getting reimbursement from them, because they had their own product liability insurance and that's where the money came from.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Got you, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Lambert with Raymond James.","Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.","Good morning. Thanks for taking a few questions, very simple. Could you quantify a bit the parts of Frutarom that are getting into Taste and Scent? I think IBR is pretty small, but I don't know to model the flavors North America. If you could help us in that?","And the second is regarding again the modeling of integration, in particular, the cost that you will incur in restructuring. I think you commented on the overall amount, but if you're a bit more clear on when the timing of the spending in Q4 and I guess 2019? Thank you.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Patrick, could you just repeat the second part of that question, because I'm not sure I got it?","Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.","Yeah. I was \u2013 can you hear me?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead, sorry.","Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.","Yeah. Just I guess like everybody were trying to fully integrate now Frutarom in our model. And I was trying to forecast the integration costs that you've mentioned at the time of the acquisition. And if you had a bit more precise picture on the timing of the spending already in Q4 and 2019?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sure. No problem. So on the internal transfers of IBR and the North American flavors, it's really, it's small. So it's insignificant, again. So, it's not a big number. It's not going to impact the regional numbers much at all. In terms of the integration costs spend, I think it's what Andreas said earlier, I think the bulk of that, the CapEx as well as I would expect that the bulk of those things to be both in 2019 and 2020...","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yes.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","...with a slight lag, I would say in terms of the severance costs by a quarter or two. But I think the bulk of it's going to be in 2019 and 2020.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for closing remarks.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you very much for all these great questions.

Welcome to IFF's second quarter 2016 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our website.

I would like to start with an executive overview as usual of our operational performance for the second quarter. Then I will provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, Alison will review our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then I will provide some concluding remarks and we will finish by taking any questions that you may have.","I'm pleased to report that all our key financial metrics for quarter two came in as we anticipated with currency-neutral sales improving 4%, comprising 3% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited by approximately two percentage points related to the contribution of our acquisitions of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our organic business grew 2% on a currency-neutral basis driven by new wins across both businesses.","From a profitability perspective, we strategically reinvested in our business, while simultaneously delivering 7% currency-neutral adjusted operating profit growth and a 70 basis points expansion and adjusted operating profit margin. This was driven primarily by volume growth, the benefits associated with our cost and productivity initiatives, and the contribution of acquisitions.","Currency-neutral EPS improved 5% as lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program were offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.","Turning our attention now to Vision 2020, as we celebrate the first anniversary of its launch, this is a perfect time to review the progress we have made thus far. We are pleased with the performance we have made relative to our strategic priorities and remain focused on execution to drive long-term growth. Since inception, we have seen strong currency-neutral sales growth across all our key platforms, including modulation, encapsulation, delivery systems, and naturals; proof that we're executing our plan and delivering what we believe is industry-leading innovation to our customers.","With that in mind, I'm happy to report that delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrances continued to drive growth in the second quarter. In Flavors, sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continued its trend of strong double-digit currency-neutral growth, led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage. In Fragrances, encapsulation-related sales also continued its strong trend of growth, improving double digits in a currency-neutral base, led by Fabric Care and Personal Wash.","In the second quarter, we also launched a new flavor modulator and a new natural flavor molecule to continue to give our flavors a superior pallet to work from to ensure we continue to build winning solutions for our customers.","We also set a new benchmark for fragrance sustainability with the release of the first-ever Cradle to Cradle Certified fragrance, PuraVita, a fragrance which has noted (sic) [notes] of green apple, wood, apricot and vanilla, is a proof of concept for an innovative approach to sustainable fragrance creation. PuraVita is a model for what can be achieved when perfumers pair creativity with sustainable design principles.","In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, we are continuing to see accelerated growth. In North America, we saw 5% currency-neutral increase for the second quarter of 2016, driven primarily by the contribution of our acquisitions. Within North America Fragrances, Consumer Fragrances improved high single digits, led by solid new win performance. Strong growth trends in the Middle East and Africa continued through second quarter, as currency-neutral sales improved mid-single digits with strong growth coming from Flavors.","Another strategic area for us, Home Care, grew mid-single digits on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in North America and EAME.","We continue to position ourselves to be our customers' partner of choice and go-to supplier. In the second quarter, we launched an enhanced sustainability strategy focused on leading positive transformational changes toward a regenerative, healthy and abundant world.","As an enabler of IFF's Vision 2020 business strategy, creating a sustainable future is essential to IFF's long-term growth. As such, our new sustainability strategy's centered on three main aspects; Positive Principles, Regenerative Products and Sensational People. Through this strategy, IFF is committed to engage its people and partners to ask what if, and to tackle complex challenges by reimagining what is possible when sustainability, innovation and passion combine.","We also achieved core list status with key customers in the second quarter. With this core list status, we are the one and only core supplier with 100% briefing access. This is a great accomplishment as it is a clear key competitive advantage, helping to drive future growth in the years to come.","We're also happy to announce that we have partnered with Unilever to improve the lives of vetiver farming communities in Haiti. The partnership, Vetiver Together, aims to sustainably improve food security, increase yields, and diversify income, while working to support women's empowerment and our environmental conservation. Haiti produces some of the best vetiver in the world and many farmers rely on cultivating of the root for their entire source of income. But, due to the economic pressures, farmers often harvest the roots before they are fully mature, leading to low prices, poor oil yields, deforestation and soil erosion. The partnership will help farmers address these challenges as well as provide training to community members, including in crop and livestock production, soil conservation and nutrition to help improve social conditions and diversity of farm production and food security.","Finally, in quarter two, we also deployed the industry-first onsite wind turbine at our Tilburg, Netherlands facility. The turbine, which has an output of 2.4 MW, will produce the clean energy equivalent of what is needed to power 1900 households. It is estimated to provide up to 30% of the site's electricity needs and when combined with purchased green electricity, the facility will be powered by 100% renewable electricity.","In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, I'm pleased to report that our two recent strategic acquisitions continue to perform well. IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics achieved double-digit growth on a standalone basis and IFF-Ottens Flavors continued its solid growth trend.","We believe these results are good indications that we are putting our capital to work to drive accelerated performance both in terms of growth and return.","Following the end of the second quarter, we also announced that IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics made a strategic investment in Bio ForeXtra, a Qu\u00e9bec City, Canada-based R&D laboratory, highly specialized in the development of active cosmetics and botanical extracts.","This investment expands IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics access to raw materials for the cosmetic active business. We believe the access we will gain to sustainable sourced extracts from the Boreal Forest of Canada will provide us with a competitive edge.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Andreas. Our financial results for the second quarter remained solid and were consistent with our expectation. Currency-neutral sales improved 4%, including approximately two percentage points relating to the acquisition of IFF-Ottens flavors and IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics.","Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins across both businesses. If we include foreign exchange-related pricing in our Q2 growth rate, our currency-neutral sales would have increased approximately 6% and on a two-year basis, would have increased 7%, which is ahead of our competitors.","Adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis grew 7%, as we achieved gross margin expansion that when combined with volume growth benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives and the contribution of acquisitions translates to a 50-basis point improvement in currency-neutral adjusted operating profit margin.","Currency-neutral adjusted EPS improved by 5% as lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our repurchase program were offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.","As we are now at the midpoint of 2016, I thought it would be appropriate to highlight our first half results as well. Our currency-neutral sales growth in the first half was strong at 5% with 4% growth in Flavors and 6% growth in Fragrances.","Adjusted operating profit grew 7% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong sales growth, benefits of our productivity program and contributions from acquisitions. The net result was positive as our currency-neutral adjusted EPS increased 8% in the first half of 2016.","Turning to business unit performance for the second quarter, Flavors currency-neutral sales increased 3%, including approximately one percentage point related to the acquisition of IFF-Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth with the strongest growth in Savory and Dairy.","From a region perspective, growth was led by mid-single-digit increases in North America, Europe, Africa and Middle East, and Greater Asia. North America increased 4% on a currency-neutral basis, inclusive of our acquisition of IFF-Ottens Flavors.","Europe, Africa and the Middle East increased 4% on a currency-neutral basis as growth was led by new win performance, particularly in Dairy and Beverage. Africa and the Middle East continued to outgrow Western Europe, improving approximately 7% in the second quarter. Greater Asia posted 6% currency-neutral growth, led by strong growth in Indonesia, India, and ASEAN.","On a category basis, we achieved double-digit growth in Sweet and mid-single-digit growth in Savory. Growth in Latin America in the second quarter was disappointing, decreasing 7% on a currency-neutral basis, based on a strong 14% currency-neutral prior year comparable growth rate.","From a country perspective, Mexico grew strong double digits on a currency-neutral basis, however, was offset by challenges related to customers reducing their inventory positions due to the softening of import restrictions in Argentina.","Flavors currency-neutral segment profit grew approximately 9%, primarily resulting from volume growth and the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives. Segment profit margin also expanded 120 basis points on a currency-neutral basis.","Fragrances currency-neutral sales improved 5%, including approximately three percentage points associated with the acquisition of IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, led by a double-digit increase in Greater Asia, high single-digit growth in North America and low single-digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa.","From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances decreased 1% on a currency-neutral basis, as strong double-digit growth in Latin America was offset by softness in North America and Europe, Africa and the Middle East, where new wins did not compensate for erosion of existing business.","The growth trend in Consumer Fragrances continued, improving 4% on a currency-neutral basis driven by broad-based growth across all subcategories, led by a double-digit increase in Personal Wash, strong contributions from technology-driven innovation in Fabric Care and mid-single-digit growth in Home Care.","On a geographic basis, in Consumer Fragrances, growth was led by double-digit increase in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in North America, both on a currency-neutral basis. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 14% driven primarily by the acquisition of IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics.","As expected, trends in our organic Fragrance Ingredients business remain challenged and should improve in the second half of the year. From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency-neutral segment profit increased 7% year-over-year resulting from volume growth, benefits from cost and productivity initiatives and the benefits of the acquisition of IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics.","As a result, currency-neutral operating profit margin improved 40 basis points. From a cash flow perspective, our operating cash flow in the first half was $155 million, compared with $166 million in the prior year period.","This change was driven by our core working capital levels being challenged, principally by the timing of payables within our year-over-year period. As communicated previously, we still expect this impact to normalize as we progress throughout 2016.","From a capital deployment perspective, capital expenditures through the first half totaled $43 million or 2.7% of sales and we continue to believe we will spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As previously noted, this increase will principally be driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia and investments in technology expansion.","Switching gears to cash return to shareholders. In the first half, we spent approximately $89 million on dividend payouts and $72 million on share repurchases. Last week, our board of directors authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.64 per share of the company's common stock, an increase of 15%, to bring our dividend yield to around 2%.","This marks the sixth consecutive year that the board approved a double-digit increase in our dividend. This increase in our quarterly dividend demonstrates our confidence in IFF's long-term growth prospects and commitment to returning 50% to 60% of adjusted net income to our shareholders.","With the first half of 2016 now behind us, we remain cautiously optimistic for the balance of the year. We are reiterating our previously stated currency-neutral financial guidance for 2016 of 3.5% to 4.5% currency-neutral sales growth, including approximately a 1.5-percentage point contribution from the acquisition of IFF-Ottens Flavors and IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics.","From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of a 1.5-percentage point contribution from M&A. Currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5% supported by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program.","In terms of modeling the second half, please note that our fourth quarter and 2016 growth rate is expected to be the strongest, given our more favorable comparable to prior year period. In addition, we also expect currency-neutral operating profit to grow less than sales rate, given the timing of some of our planned reinvestments.","While our currency-neutral guidance has not changed, we have updated our EPS guidance to reflect the FX gain we benefited from in the second quarter. The net result is that the impact of currency on sales and profit remains the same, at two points and three points, respectively, and the impact on EPS is lower by approximately one percentage point. At this point in time, we are hedged approximately 80% on our euro profit exposure at $1.14 in 2016 and hedged at approximately 40% of our 2017 exposure at $1.13.","As we discussed on our first quarter conference call, we said we were reviewing our currency-neutral methodology to determine if either a more refined or simpler approach is warranted, in order to ensure that we provide investors increased insight into our underlying operating performance, greater alignment with how our business is run and information that is more usable for comparison purposes.","While we are still reviewing our current methodology, any changes determined will not be implemented until the beginning of 2017 since our employees' in-year compensation is linked to our current methodology.","With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In summary, I'm pleased with the second quarter and first half of 2016 from a financial and strategic standpoint. Despite the volatile global operating environment, we are on pace to achieve our previously stated currency-neutral guidance for 2016. Simultaneously, we continue to be focused on the execution of Vision 2020, which is geared towards accelerating our growth and increasing differentiation, which in turn should lead to sustainable, profitable growth.","With that, I would now like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, thanks and morning, everybody. Wanted to ask about sales growth. So you're still guiding to growth for 2016 below long-term targets, so want to understand how the business is performing relative to the going-in beginning of the year plan. And then more broadly, want to understand how we should think about returning to 4% to 6% long-term sales growth targets. Is that predicated on improving end demand, IFF specific share gains, acquisitions, et cetera?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Mark, thank you for the first question. Let me talk about 2016 first. And it's true that the performance first half of the year was a good \u2013 actually a very good growth rate and a great performance. But we have all witnessed that there's great macroeconomic and political volatility over the course of the year. And we will see it in some of our geographies which are important for us. We will have elections in the U.S. We have seen the Brexit. And we have seen other events like Turkey for example, where we have to be cautious. And that's the reason why we reiterate our guidance and we believe we are on track to make it. But the volatility is certainly unprecedented.","Talking about 2017, I can't talk in detail about 2017. I believe that needs some more time because we have first of all to finish 2016. But we will return and we are optimistic to return to our long-term guidance because what we see is actually a couple of things. First of all, we have an unprecedented pipeline strengths in terms of new molecules for Fragrances, for example. We see great progress in some of our other R&D platforms like modulation and naturals. And that will help us to gain share going forward. And that's the reason which makes me cautiously optimistic for the years to come.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then just following up, another question, want to ask about M&A and sort of how the company is thinking about bolt-on versus larger scale deals. There's clearly a little bit more cash on the balance sheet than there has been in recent years. I don't know if that really means anything, but just sort of broadly you've done a couple of bolt-on deals. So is that still the path or do you think now learning's from that allow for larger scale?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mark, as you know, many of these deals are, let's say, opportunistic at the very end because you never know whether you'll get the asset you want. But I can reassure you that our M&A pipeline so far is pretty well filled. We have made great progress in identifying the right targets. And it might be a mix going forward in terms of bolt-ons and more bigger acquisition and we certainly as you have alluded have the fire power to do these kind of deals. So we are on a path and the good thing is the year's not closed.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I want to talk first about the North America Flavors. It looks like the organic was up a little bit and it seems like probably an acceleration coming next quarter. Can you just talk about what's sort of driving the improvement you're starting to see in North America Flavors?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll probably take it. Lauren, first of all, it's Andreas, great question. In North America, we have actually seen good movements in some of the smaller accounts we are having. That's the reason why our IFF-Ottens has actually very, very good performance here. But we see a recovering of some of our bigger accounts as well. We have a better win rate. And we are cautiously optimistic for North America. But we have to take into consideration that the North America market as a market is not a high growth market. So we always have to take this into perspective.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then also on Asia, I was actually surprised to see Asia both Flavor and Consumer Fragrances being so strong, both because of the macro in the region and usually kind of looking at your trend as a little bit of a leading indicator of where your customers expect sales trends to go and also knowing some of the manufacturing challenges you were dealing within China. So if you could talk about I guess market growth and also some of the manufacturing things in China, that would be great.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Lauren, it's Alison. So, first, while we had continued challenges in China, what we saw was growth in Indonesia, India, across Greater Asia. And that was a function of our technology, our delivery, so encapsulation, our delivery systems, very strong pipeline, strong win rate and so all those things are combining to deliver a strong performance despite our challenge in China. As we talked about China previously, we have taken corrective steps in China in terms of the odor-abatement issue as well as announcing our second factory in China. We've also modified our commercial strategy that we're targeting I'd say higher growing categories.","As you know, in order to commercialize things in this space, it takes time. So, fortunately in the interim, we're experiencing strength in the other areas in \u2013 or the other geographic places across Greater Asia.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So, that's great. So, in China, this \u2013 sorry \u2013 excuse me, in Asia, the strength wasn't even yet showing that China's starting to come back for you other than any kind of recapture of some of the lost business?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Exactly.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's great. Thank you so much.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Silke Kueck from JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. This is Silke Kueck for Jeff Zekauskas. How are you?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great. Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're very well, Silke.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I was wondering whether you can shed a little bit of light on the gross margin expansion in the quarter, like what was the benefit from favorable buys over costs, were there any hedging gains due to productivity improvements?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, so there were, I'll say, several benefits. So we had first, starting with volume, so that was about 120 basis points. So it's cost productivity initiatives, another 120 basis points, and that was offset by other items like unfavorable price to input costs, higher incentive compensation, higher RSA and then slightly negative mix, but the biggest drivers from the favorability, volume and cost.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","As you think about the back half of the year, do you think a 46% (29:00) gross margin is something that's sustainable?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. There or thereabouts.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, what you'll see, though, is it will be somewhat weaker in Q3 and that's relative to the timing of our cash flow hedge and then stronger in Q4.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In terms of the SG&A line, so the SG&A grew 7.5% on sales that were up 3%. And can you discuss what was due to the strategic investments and how much was due to the acquisitions and maybe higher amortization expense?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So let me start with amortization expenses. So amortization expense in the quarter was $3.3 million. From a strategic investment perspective, that was $4.5 million or call it, three percentage points of growth. That splits $700,000 in Fragrances, $600,000 in Flavors, and then we had $3.2 million that's associated with cost and productivity initiatives. All of those initiatives are in line with our Vision 2020 strategy.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And what do you think the level of investment of strategic investments will be for the second half, like it sounds like that that level of spending is going up, if I understood it right?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say it's consistent with the run rate, if not slightly higher. Again, what you'll see is in Q3 the timing of our \u2013 you'll see greater spending in Q3 associated with strategic initiatives and that's really just due to the timing of the projects versus Q4. So at a macro level, it's consistent with run rate but it does have a quarterly spread.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And so when you look at your operating margin as a whole for the third quarter, do you think the margins would expand or would it be more flattish due to the timing of the investments?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say they'd be flat in the third quarter and improved in the fourth quarter.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then my last question, I was wondering what your expectation is as for the new flavor modulator that you launched. If you look at it over like, I don't know, like a one-year period or a three-year period or a five-year period, like how big of a market is there for that product and what do you think \u2013 what revenues do you expect over time on it?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Silke, it's very early times for the new modulator, and we can't give you any specific guidance on that one. But we might come back when we see more, let's say, in-market sales here.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Do you have a hope of what you may achieve?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have always great hopes, but I can't give you anything in specific here.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And thanks very much. I'll get back into the queue.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Hi, I wanted to ask about LatAm. Was the weakness just in Argentina or are you seeing weakness in other countries as well because we're hearing from some customers that Brazil is getting quite bad and potentially worse in the second half. Perhaps you could talk us through trends that you're seeing in the key countries you're exposed to in LatAm, please. Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Heidi, thank you for the question. It was basically Argentina for us which was really bad, and here I would say my interpretation is that there's a lot of changes in the policies as well in import and export and we will see how that straightens out over the course of the year. Actually on Brazil, in terms of the Fine Fragrances business, it was doing very, very well. So we can't see the weakness here. And we have another hope that we'll see Olympic Games probably using \u2013 people are using some more personal wash, but you never know. I'm sorry.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning and nice quarter there. Andreas, interesting, every time I see a commercial these days they talk about reformulating into naturals, both fast food and some of your consumer products companies. Can you sort of walk us through how this movement to more natural ingredients continues to impact your business, and do you think it potentially accelerates over the next couple of years?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Actually our planning or our belief is that we might see even more of an acceleration. We get already on the Flavors side more than 50% of all briefs (33:45) on naturals or organic. And so this is a clear trend, and I think it goes with the trend of health and wellness as well. So that this is basically the ask from the consumer. That's what we see in our consumer surveys as well. So that will be something which will stay strong over time.","And here what we see, particularly also on the modulators, and you know we do on savory, on sweetness modulations, they're basically all-natural right now in what we are doing. That's another indicator that this trend is probably here to stay. Okay, Mike?","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then in cosmetic actives, I think every quarter you report it's double digits. So, can you help us understand maybe what's driving that? Is there some end market drivers there? And is that something that can continue for quite some time?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So first of all, the business we have acquired here had already in the past a very solid track record. But what we see right now for us is that first of all the whole market has a higher growth rate than our core market, with probably 4.5%, which is basically double, almost double what we see in our core market.","And then we see that we come up with good solutions which are really needed by the customers, plus we find new customers as well because \u2013 and that was the idea of the acquisition, that we can open some doors for the active cosmetic sales teams to make sure that we introduce them to some of our clients we have already for many, many years. So that's a classic top line synergy we are playing here.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then last one, in terms of your outlook for the second half of the year, if conditions kind of stay where they are now, would you be similar to the first half? Meaning that you kept your guidance despite doing better in the first half, you would need sort of a deterioration in the environment from here to be at the lower end?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look, Mike, we reiterate guidance here. That's where we stay, because you never know how things are playing out.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hi. Thank you. Good morning. I was just wondering, Andreas, if you could give us some more background on \u2013 you talked about the new core list that you have gotten on recently that you weren't on before. If you could maybe give us some more background around that, sort of what led to that? Was it your technology? Was it customer relationships? Sort of just a little bit more on that.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Faiza, first of all, good morning. Unfortunately, I can't give you any more details on the core list. But it's a significant customer for us which is, I think, that's important to know, has a good volume. And what helped us here is certainly technology. So the technology we are providing to this specific customer has helped to gain access. The second one is certainly our, let's say, focus on the customer and being a partner of choice, as well to working with them very, very closely together in many, many areas, and that has helped us to gain access here.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then I just want to push a little bit more on Latin America because it sounds like you do have difficult comps going into the third quarter also, and I know we talked about it a little bit with respect to Argentina. But is there anything else? Is that expected to continue into the back half? And are you expecting a recovery there in the back half or do you expect trends to be similar to where they were this quarter?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I think overall, we're going to see a slight recovery in the Flavors space, but from a Fragrance perspective, I'd say we remain cautious for the second half.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, okay. And then just one last one, Alison, you have that great chart as part of the Q4 presentation where we talked about the profitability improvement in 2016 and you highlighted Vision 2020 investments were going to reduce operating profit by 3.5% and then fund the journey was going to help by 5% to 6%. I know you talked about where we are in terms of the investments. Can you talk about some of the savings that we've seen so far? Have those come through, or are those expected in the back half?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, so I would say, Faiza, that we're tracking with our plan, both on the investment side as well as the fund the journey, productivity cost savings initiatives and so those are in line with our plan.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask, I'm not sure I understood just to be clear on your answer to Lauren's question, Alison, what would \u2013 that mid-single-digit growth in North America Flavors, I think the Ottens business is fairly heavy in North America. Could you just give us a sense what that would have been without the acquisition?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So organically in the second quarter we were flat in North America. Having said that, through the second half of the year, our organic business by itself, excluding Ottens Flavors, improve, and that was based on the pipeline, strong wins and so forth through the second half of the year.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thanks. And forgive me if you'd mentioned this before, but would the margin profile of Ottens Flavors be likely similar to your overall margin profile?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then I guess just one bigger picture question. The capabilities you build through Meyer and Ottens, I mean how much of this is specific to a set of customers and how much of this is building competitive advantage relative to the other big three global players?","Do you feel as if this is a race and all these companies are sort of building your capabilities and you're positioning IFF to be stronger, or is this sort of \u2013 are these sub-niches that you're trying to maybe stake out while the other three, big three sort of stake out other niches?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, actually if you look at the two acquisitions, quite a different approach. On the active cosmetic ingredients, we were looking at an adjacent business to our Fragrance business and we entered into this business because we believe that we have great top line synergies here in terms of the customer coverage and we are playing in the premium segment of that market, which gives us an extra profitability and certainly a good growth as well. So that's important to understand. That was the reason why we ventured into that business.","On the Flavors side, different approach because as we said and probably many of our competitors are telling you that as well is, that you see some of the smaller, mid-sized companies with higher growth rates and we needed kind of a differentiated service model for that part of the market as well. And that was the reason that we acquired Ottens, to use it as a platform in that segment because this way usually customers who were not reaching out as much as we would like to have it, and now we have the platform, we're filling the platform and we are pretty happy with it.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much, Andreas and Alison.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just a quick follow-up on M&A, I mean, Andreas, you've talked about like the pipeline and opportunities that are available, so I was just trying to figure out like what's preventing you from closing on some of those deals? Is it just that those assets are very pricey, and you have to make sure they make sense financially or is it just a matter of time? Just wanted to figure out like what the opportunities are?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Edlain, it's actually more a matter of time because you really have to work through the pipeline. You have to figure out what is the real value of these assets and do they make sense from a strategic point of view. So we are certainly not, let's say, under pressure here to do it. We're really taking our time to look at these assets and then make the call at the time as time is ready to do it.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","That makes sense. And one last one, you've highlighted the markets where you're doing well and in some of the markets where you're seeing weakness, Latin America and some other products in other places, like do you believe it's temporary? And if it's not, like are there steps you can take to address that to make sure it doesn't have like a significant impact on results going forward?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I actually believe in particular in the emerging markets it's temporary, because in the mid-term and long-term you will see still, let's say, very significant population growth and people are trending towards middle class, lower middle class. And these are all potential customers for our products. If you look at the numbers, for example Africa, Middle East is an area which is expanding double-digit for us and you will see a doubling of the population in Africa until 2050. So it will happen. We always see these kind of spikes or lambadas (44:10) going forward. And I'm actually very optimistic in a long way and said these will stay good growth areas for us.","And the good thing was in IFF is as you might know is that we have 50% of all our business in the emerging markets and 50% individual markets and so that will help us when we see these markets returning to good growth here.","Whether we will see like to see in a China again double-digit growth over years, I doubt it. But even if you see let's say 6% or 7% growth I think it's still a pretty significant one.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","You have a follow-up question with Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Heidi?","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Sorry, sorry about that. Could you tell us what the organic growth rate might be if you included LatAm currency effects like your peers do, please? Thank you.","Michael DeVeau - Vice President, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Yes, Heidi, we don't have the specificity at this point. This is Mike. I can follow up with you offline. It will be significantly higher, because that's probably where the most concentrated effort would have been in terms of the differential in reporting differences respect to pricing late FX.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","All right. Thank you.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to speakers.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much for all your questions. And have a great day. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Investor Relations Manager. You may now begin.","Michael DeVeau","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. With me on the call today are Doug Tough, our Chairman and CEO; Hernan Vaisman, our President of Flavors; Nicolas Mirzayantz, our President of Fragrances; and Kevin Berryman, our Executive Vice President and CFO. This call is being recorded and will be available for playback on our website.","Please keep in mind that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance particularly with respect to the first quarter and full year of 2012. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, I ask that you refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today's 8-K filings with the SEC as well as our 2010 10-K filed on February 24, 2011.","Some of today's prepared remarks will discuss non-GAAP financial information, which excludes those items that affect comparability. These items are laid out in our reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures, which are also available on our website.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Doug.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, and good afternoon, everyone.","From a local currency sales basis, we are pleased with our full year 2011 performance in light of the 13% growth we reported in the year-ago period. Our strong growth in Flavors and the emerging markets continue to provide us with the ability to grow on top of last year's strong performance as local currency sales improved 4% year-over-year for the company. In Fragrances, results were less strong particularly in the second half. However, it must be taken in the appropriate context, considering the very challenging 16% year-ago comparison, which included a record level of new wins as well as restocking benefits across all categories.","While gross margin declined due to significant raw material cost inflation of 10%, our ability to raise prices approximately 2.5% for the full year and our cost control efforts allowed us to deliver 11% adjusted operating profit growth and a 70-basis-point improvement in operating profit margin. This strong operating profit performance led to an 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share to a company record of $3.74.","Analyzing our performance over 2- and 3-year periods to include the heightened volatility of 2009 and 2010, you will note that we have either met or exceeded our long-term financial targets over a 1-, 2- or 3-year basis. We think this is a positive sign given the challenging environment we have been managing through over the past 12 months.","Before turning it over to the IFF senior team to take you through the details of our Q4 performance, I'd like to discuss our progress against the strategic priorities we outlined at our 2011 Investor Day.","Stemming from the in-depth analytical review of our business, we identified opportunities where we felt we could improve our financial performance, particularly our planned focuses on accelerating growth in attractive markets, mainly the emerging markets; aligning innovation to drive profitable growth; focusing on differentiation or offering our customers something that our competitors cannot; and improving returns by fixing underperforming businesses based on economic profit analysis.","Starting with our Global footprint, we felt that we could leverage our geographic reach to capture the attractive growth rates in the emerging markets. In 2011, our local currency sales growth in the emerging markets was approximately 8%, significantly faster than the developed markets. Key emerging markets now represent 46% of our total company sales, which can be considered among best in class for our industry.","Accordingly, earlier in 2011, we began construction of 2 manufacturing facilities in China and Singapore. As our growth in the Greater Asia region continues to accelerate, it was important that we align our infrastructure to support our projected capacity requirements. The Guangzhou site will be dedicated to Flavors while the facility in Singapore will be used for both Flavors and Fragrances. Located near existing IFF sites, both new facilities are ideally suited to ensure a smooth transition with experienced in-house talent.","On the heels of the investment into our creative centers in Shanghai and Mumbai, we believe these facilities underscore our long-term belief in the region, the strength of our local teams and IFF's dedication to serving the present and future needs of our customers as they expand in this region.","In November, we announced the opening of a new state-of-the-art Flavor and Fragrance facility in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The new site houses creative and application labs as well as sales and marketing offices that support all categories for the unique and fast-growing Middle Eastern market. We believe that by having our creative and technical teams work very closely with regional customers in our ultramodern labs, it will significantly shorten the innovation process and increase speed to market, leading to incremental business.","And more recently, we announced that a portion of our Functional Fragrance resources are being reallocated to Singapore and Mexico to more effectively serve the growing presence of our customers in those markets.","Strengthening our innovation platform continues to be most critical for our future success. In 2011, we fully evaluated our entire research and development investments across all existing and new platforms. Our disciplined approach designed to improve our return on investment was predicated on the insight gained from our consumer research program. We then evaluated our ability to deliver innovation for each opportunity, taking into account the technical likelihood of success, including the research, development and regulatory phase.","During this step, we also looked at the likelihood of the commercial success, which means even if we develop a solution that meets the consumers' needs, can the technology be commercialized at an attractive customer and consumer price? This was then followed by a full evaluation of the technology's degree of fit within our current strategy and the opportunity cost of not pursuing the project. Finally, we determined the resource requirements and prioritized the highest-return projects to maximize our investments.","To track our success, we have developed important internal milestones to help ensure we are achieving our stated goals. At each milestone, we evaluate our success and failure rates to determine if any adjustments are needed in an attempt to achieve the greatest efficiency possible, thus increasing return on investment.","To complement this new process, we recently formed a new scientific advisory board comprised of 5 scientific talents in the key research and development areas we identified in our strategic review. We believe this advisory board will provide us with external perspectives on IFF's R&D programs. They will raise scientific issues and opportunities, help us identify appropriate research partners, provide background in specific areas of expertise and assist in the identification and development of key R&D personnel. We anticipate that this will give us strong competitive advantage not only by tapping into the minds of the scientific advisory board members, but by leveraging their access to a global network of academics, high-level industry members and their associates.","By maximizing our portfolio, we believe we can enhance overall profitability by improving our less-attractive portions of the portfolio to capture the previously announced $50 million operating profit opportunity within a 5-year horizon. In 2011, we began having fact-based conversations with our customers regarding appropriate pricing actions to improve our returns. We also had conversations regarding supply chain opportunities where, by optimizing our agreements, we could drive greater efficiency for both ourselves and our customers.","Focusing internally, we evaluated resource allocation by category, by customer and by region across both of our businesses, thereby appropriately aligning resources behind our advantage portfolio and reducing the costs associated with negative economic profit businesses. This was most evident in our recent announcement where we realigned our Functional Fragrance responsibilities and reduced our workforce in Fragrances as well as other parts of the organization.","We believe this initiative will strengthen our expertise and our ability to win in key categories and markets while simultaneously simplifying our decision-making process, improving our resource allocation and enhancing collaboration. It marks a significant step towards improving the underperforming areas of our portfolio that we have identified in our strategic review as we expect to realize pretax cost savings of approximately $9 million in 2012.","In those areas where we were unable to improve our underperforming businesses through the aforementioned initiatives, we made the difficult decision to exit some businesses, totaling approximately $8 million of sales in 2011.","And finally, more recently, we have instituted economic profit, or EP, as one of our long-term incentive compensation metrics. As part of our strategic review, we began including EP in the evaluation of relative performance across our business portfolio. We believe that evaluating EP helps us identify the resources and the drivers of value across various businesses and it is linked to the creation of shareholder value.","While we are only in year one of our plan, we believe that we have made solid progress against our strategy. And while the significant raw material inflation in 2011 required us to shift our attention to more immediate needs, we never lost focus on our long-term strategy. For that, I would like to acknowledge the IFF's team's ability to adapt both strategically and operationally during very difficult times to deliver our solid results.","Once Hernan, Nicolas and Kevin conclude their prepared remarks, I will give you some perspectives on the outlook for 2012, and then we will take any questions that you may have. With that, I would like to introduce our group President of Flavors, Hernan Vaisman.","Hernan Vaisman","Thank you, Doug, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone.","I am happy to report that the strong trends we have seen over the course of 2011 have continued in the fourth quarter as we achieved 8% local currency sales growth, led by a double-digit increase in Beverage and high-single-digit increase in Savory.","In North America, we continue to post solid growth on top of our most challenging year-over-year comparison. The majority of our success continues to come from health and wellness portfolio, as our sweet and sodium modulation technologies drove double-digit and high-single-digit growth in Beverage and Savory, respectively.","Despite comparing to a 10% increase last year in EAME, our performance in Q4 accelerated versus Q3 as Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East grew double digits and Western Europe grew mid-single digits.","In Latin America, growth of 1% was below our expectation as the softness we noticed in Mexico last quarter continued into Q4. Brazil, on the other hand, remained quite strong, growing high-single digits.","Our best performing region in terms of both dollar growth and percentage change continues to be Greater Asia. Performance in this region has improved every quarter this year, growing over 10% in Q4 as every category reported a strong growth, highlighted by Beverage and Confectionery where we achieved double-digit growth. To some extent, it should be noted that the timing of the Chinese New Year did provide a benefit to our results, pulling some growth from Q1 2012 into Q4 2011.","Consistent with the previous 3 quarters, the impact of exiting low-margin business in Q4 was approximately $1.5 million in local currency sales and a total of $6 million for the full year. As we have indicated before, in 2012 we expect the impact of exiting underperforming business to increase between 1 to 3 percentage points of Flavors total local currency sales growth for the full year, as we believe it is our best option to maximize shareholder's value. It should be noted that, while top line may be impacted, our gross margin should show a corresponding improvement.","Looking at the geographic breakdown of our sales, the emerging markets continue to grow double digits for the ninth consecutive quarter. The BRIC countries continue to be the primary driver of growth, increasing mid teens and led by 20% flat growth in China.","Turning to profits. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 18% or $10 million to $63 million. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 170 basis points versus the prior-year period to 19.6 percentage as volume growth, pricing action and cost control more than offset the impact of higher raw material cost.","Before providing commentary in 2012, I would like to provide an overview of our full year performance. Local currency sales increased 9% in 2011 on top of the 10% we reported in the year ago, indicating continued strength in our Flavors business. The strongest growth was achieved in North America and EAME, both growing double digits as we continue to deleverage of our innovative health and wellness portfolio. The effect on profitability was profound as adjusted operating profit increased 17% or $42 million to $184 million.","As a result of this strong top line performance, which included both volume and pricing growth as well as continued cost control disciplines, operating margin improved 90 basis points year-over-year to a company record of 21.1%.","Looking ahead to Q1 2012, while we are comparing to our strongest growth rate on 2011, 12% growth, we are expecting a solid start to the year as new business wins remain strong. Profitability is expected to remain healthy as we continue to capture price increase to offset raw material cost and control our own costs.","With that, I would like to introduce our group President of Fragrance, Nicolas Mirzayantz.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Thank you, Hernan, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone.","Local currency sales in the fourth quarter, while down 3%, improved sequentially versus the third quarter, with 5 out of our 7 categories delivering year-over-year growth. In Fine Fragrance & Beauty Care, local currency sales declined 6% against a 16% growth rate in Q4 2010 as new business wins and price increases were more than offset by volume declines.","When evaluating Fine Fragrance independently, it is important to note that the pipeline's few links [ph] associated with last year's new win was abnormally high as Fine Fragrance grew greater than 20% in the year-ago period, particularly in Europe and Latin America, where we grew way in excess of 20%.","Beauty Care, which include Toiletries and Hair Care, did post strong high-single-digit growth as the team was successful willing -- winning new business and capturing price increases.","Functional Fragrance results were strong as all categories reported positive results. Highlight within Functional Fragrance include double-digit growth in Home Care and high-single-digit growth in Fabric Care, both led by the emerging markets and Europe.","It should be noted that the strong growth, when combined with our recently announced realignment initiative, should drive improved returns as we continue to grow our business. It should also be noted that top line performance for our fragrance compound in Q4, which exclude Ingredients, was up 2%. And excluding both Ingredients and Fine Fragrance, the rest of our business was up 7% in Q4.","Fragrance Ingredients continue to be the most challenged part of our portfolio in Q4 due to price-driven volume declines. Like in Q3, the adverse effect on volume was greater than historical correlations and therefore had a greater impact on our results. While sales decline, our Fragrance Ingredients margin remained stable as the loss of sales were associated with lower-margin businesses, thereby reducing the impact on profitability.","Going forward, we expect market dynamics and our performance to improve as we progress through 2012.","From a geographic perspective, emerging market growth did mitigate the weakness seen in the developed markets. In our EAME region, double-digit growth was achieved in Eastern and Central Europe and the Middle East. In Greater Asia, China was a standout, growing mid teens. While not surprising, given our strong year-ago comps and the current economic situation, it should be noted that Fine Fragrance and Ingredients in Western Europe decreased particularly in France, Germany and Spain, something that we will continue to monitor given the region's economic uncertainty.","Despite a challenging second half, it is worth noting that 2011 was a record year in our fragrance compound business and is on top of 16% growth in 2010.","From a profitability standpoint, as expected, adjusted operating profit declined by $9 million as double-digit increases in raw material cost and volume declines more than offset higher prices, the benefit associated with the European restructuring and cost control initiatives. As a result, adjusted operating profit margin decreased 230 basis points to 11.5% versus the year-ago period. It is important to note that the significant pressure that raw materials placed on gross margin was reduced by increased pricings actions in Q4, over 4%, and cost control initiatives, including lower incentive compensation expense. In addition, our previously announced restructuring in Europe provided approximately $4 million of saving in the quarter that further helped to reduce the impact of raw material price increases.","As Doug mentioned, we recently announced that we are reorganizing our Functional Fragrance group to align with the Global category approach of our Fine & Beauty Care and Fragrance Ingredient businesses to simplify the business structure for greater efficiency. We believe these changes will have a positive effect by improving our speed to market, cross-category synergies and one consumer knowledge.","Part of this realignment involves a reallocation of creative resources to support investment in innovation and growth opportunities, primarily to strengthen our leadership in the emerging markets of Latin America and Greater Asia, aligned with our customer strategies and investments. Our decision to proceed with this plan is a clear indication of our commitment to our strategy and continuous improvements.","Looking ahead, we expect top line performance in the first quarter to remain under pressure as we continue to experience price-driven volume declines in Ingredients and softness in Fine Fragrance due to a strong year-ago comparison of 15% growth.","Beyond that, we are encouraged by our continuing strong level of new wins and believe that our pipeline of new business resulting from greater access to core listings and large projects should position us well as we progress beyond the first quarter of 2012. In addition, we continue to have incremental pricing discussions with our customers to reduce the impact of higher raw material costs.","With that, let me turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin C. Berryman","Thank you, Nicolas, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone.","Reviewing our quarterly results, local currency sales growth improved sequentially versus Q3 to more than 2% in the fourth quarter as pricing approached 3.5%. While gross margin remained under pressure due to a 10% rise in raw material cost, improved leverage and sustained pricing benefits in Q4 helped reduce the impact on gross margin versus a year ago, as compared to Q3, with our Q4 gross margin down 220 basis points from the year-ago period, improved versus the 330-basis-point decline that we saw in Q3.","We also continue to exhibit strong cost control, including benefits from lower incentive compensation provisions, and execute against our cost savings initiative to drive 8% adjusted operating profit growth, which led to a 70 basis points improvement in operating profit margin.","With interest expense down $1 million and a $3 million benefit from other income, we were able to overcome the very low effective tax rate in Q4 2010 to drive 7% adjusted EPS growth versus the year-ago period.","Turning to raw material costs. As expected, raw material costs continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter. While both businesses faced significant cost pressure, it was most significant in Fragrance where strong increases in naturals, petrochemicals and feedstock ingredients drove double-digit increases in our input costs. Flavor input costs, which were up high-single digits, continue to be impacted by higher year-over-year cost increases in items such as citrus oils and mint and menthol.","Looking ahead, based on current prices, we expect to continue to see modest low-single-digit raw material cost inflation in 2012. This is the case even though some raw materials have come down from their market peaks. At the end, our costs in 2012 are still expected to be above our 2011 levels and sharply above historical levels. This requires continued pricing discussions with our customers.","From a 2012 calendarization standpoint, we expect raw material cost inflation to be greatest in Q1 of 2012, as we are comparing to our lowest cost period of 2011. Beyond the first quarter, our comparisons will become less difficult due to the double-digit raw material cost increases we experienced in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2011.","From an overhead cost standpoint, adjusted RSA expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 290 basis points year-over-year to 23.8%, reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and continued cost discipline. Within RSA, it is important to note that we continue to make R&D investments to support our long-term strategic growth initiatives. Excluding incentive compensation expense from both periods, our comparable R&D spend increased year-over-year.","Regarding foreign currency dynamics, foreign currency movements in the fourth quarter had a limited impact on both our top and bottom line performance.","Looking ahead to the full year 2012, we have hedged approximately 2\/3 of our euro-dollar exposure at rates which average approximately 1.40, effectively equal to the rate we saw in 2011. While the rationale for our hedging program is to protect our cash flow exposure, i.e., the transactional impact, the mechanics of our program produced similar benefits for our translational exposure. Net-net, our exposure to euro FX volatility in 2012 has been reduced by approximately 2\/3 as the result of our hedging efforts. As such, if currency rates stay where they are today with the euro at $1.33, we expect foreign exchange impacts to be only a modest headwind to EPS for the full year of 2012.","While first half 2011 cash flow had been impacted by a rise in payables, driven by a large reduction in payables associated with our 2010 annual incentive compensation payout and tax payments, both the results of IFF's strong 2010 financial performance, second half cash flow dramatically improved versus the year-ago period. Our cash flow from operations in Q4 specifically improved $72 million from Q3, even when including the $40 million payment associated with the patent litigation settlement. As a result and as expected, our operating cash flow dramatically improved over the second half of the year.","From a use-of-cash standpoint, capital expenditures, as expected, finished the year near 5% of sales as we made incremental investments in manufacturing capacity in the emerging markets and technologies. We expect that our investments in 2012 to also approximate 5% of sales.","In addition, over the course of 2011, we have paid off $124 million of our outstanding senior notes and, importantly, renewed our credit revolver, both of which we believe will optimize our financial flexibility, going forward.","Finally, as part of our commitment to return cash to our shareholders, we announced in July an increase in the quarterly cash dividend, raising it 15% from $0.27 a quarter to $0.31 a quarter, which we believe underscores our strong financial condition and excellent cash flow position.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug for his perspective on 2012.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Kevin, Hernan and Nicolas.","Looking ahead, we expect local currency sales growth in 2012 to be in line with our long-term targets, albeit at the low end of our 4% to 6% range, as we plan to accelerate the exit from some of our underperforming businesses, more particularly in Flavors. As such, we believe that our team's ability to continue to win new business will be an important driver of our results, going forward.","We do expect some input costs to rise low-single digits in 2012, which will require continued pricing conversations with our customers. It is our expectation, however, that we should reach a gross margin inflection point if raw materials remain at current levels as we approach the second half of 2012.","From an RSA standpoint, we will continue to exhibit disciplined cost control. It should be noted, however, that as our incentive compensation program resets, it will be a headwind should we perform in line with our current targets. In addition, we also plan to make incremental investments in R&D to support future high-value, at-stake initiatives identified in our strategic review. These investments are vital to sustain our long-term growth.","And finally, as Kevin mentioned, if currency rates stay where they are today, with the euro at $1.33, we expect foreign exchange will be a modest headwind for the full year as a result of the hedging program.","Nonetheless, I remain confident in our ability to continue to navigate through these uncertain times as we strive to achieve the long-term targets in 2012.","Looking towards the first quarter, we expect Flavors to deliver good growth, even as they exit low-margin businesses, and Fragrances to be challenged as we continue to see softness in Ingredients and pressures in Fine Fragrance due to the strong year-ago comparison. While we continue to expect greater pricing benefits, the gap between raw material costs and price increases is expected to remain as we are comparing to the lowest-cost period of 2011, although this will improve versus Q4 2011.  As a result, profitability and earnings per share will be under pressure as cost control initiatives are not expected to fully offset our gross margin pressures.","To wrap up. At the beginning of 2011, we expressed optimism that we would continue to perform well despite macroeconomic challenges and unprecedented raw material cost increases. Our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets for the second consecutive year demonstrates the team's aptitude for successfully executing the strategy and navigating through a challenging operating environment.","We continue to leverage our geographic reach to capture the growth potential of the emerging markets, strengthen our innovation platform to deliver differentiating products to customers and maximize our portfolio to improve the underperforming areas of our business.","I'm proud of all of our employees, each of whom played a role in achieving our results, and I remain confident in our ability to continue to remain agile and work with our customers and our internal resources to achieve our long-term targets in 2012.","Longer term, our strategic review has provided insight to management as to the opportunities to further enhance our performance, going forward. Our plan embeds these insights to address the opportunities identified, all of which, we believe, will maximize shareholder value.","And with that, we will be happy to take any questions that you may have. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess, just to start on the Fragrance business. So a little bit better but still negative versus some easier comps. I heard what you said, Nicolas. I guess, maybe just a bit more color there, in particular on some of the places of underperformance and how you go about improving that. And I guess, in particular if you put it in the context of some of the recently announced initiatives, why focus on the Functional piece which seems to be performing better than the other 2 categories?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Mark, regarding 2011 performance, it is important to take into context of the very strong growth we reported in 2010. I mean, it was 16% growth, which was greater than any year in the business, it really was a record year, and also significantly higher growth rate than the industry. If you look at it, it was seventh consecutive quarter of growth and obviously some pressure in the second half. Unfortunately, the difficult comparison as well as price-driven volume declines in Ingredients did put some pressure in the results and especially also in fine, where we had the strongest comp in 2010. So I think that, overall, if you put this thing into perspective and if you look at a 2-year average, I think it's indeed a very, very strong average for the business, being at 8% growth, so in excess of the market. I think what is important as well is our ability to secure new business and also to have access to additional growth potential by entering new colleagues or strengthening our position into some new colleagues. So yes, challenged in the second half, but we believe that most of the key driver was a strong comp. And if you remember also, in Q1 of this year, we were still having some strong growth in the business units and very strong growth in Q4, so therefore, we believe that we have an abnormally high level of pipeline, which affected some of the volume dynamic in the second half.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So just to clarify then, one, just could you comment on why the Functional business in terms of the restructuring? And two, do you consider yourselves share gainers, share losers in the Fragrance category?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","So to your first question regarding Functional Fragrances. First, we wanted to realign the business with the priority of our business -- of our customers and to continue to find innovation. At the same token, we also wanted to build upon the learnings from the strategic review that we did and building upon the economic profit learnings as well. We wanted to make sure that we were improving the performance, the margin performance across our portfolio. So that was really the first question. Remind me of the second. Can you remind of the second one, Mark? I'm sorry.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The second is, do you consider your Fragrance business a net share gainer or share looser, or not all?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","We are a, we have maintained our share. We have maintained the level of share, the significant increase in share that we have gained last year and we believe that we have maintained it.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And just one clarification, Doug. First quarter EPS being under pressure, does that mean down year-on-year? Does that mean below long-term targets? Just a bit of help there would be appreciated.","Douglas D. Tough","I think it'll be, in the first quarter, south of the year ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the Ingredients business because, if I look at the, what you reported by region, it actually looks like most regions got quite a bit better sequentially, with the exception of Europe. And so I, maybe I'm going  a step too far, but do you think that the Europe softness had more to do with macro demand and then maybe you are certain to see some stabilization elsewhere? And knowing that a lot of contacts seem to, my understanding, is reset Jan 1, how is that looking in terms of stabilizing and starting to win some business back?","Kevin C. Berryman","Lauren, it's Kevin. Look, I think that, certainly, we are watching carefully the dynamic in Europe, with all of the economic uncertainty relative to the discussions on, in the news that we hear everyday, and I think that we're monitoring that closely. The Ingredients business, in general, is more oriented around both Europe and North America because of where the business ultimately is utilized by our customers. And so that is one area that we are specifically monitoring closely at this particular point in time, so no more news other than that and we'll continue to adjust as appropriate to the extent that there is any other insights that we gain as it relates to that dynamic.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. But the other regions, even North America, did get better or at least didn't get materially worse sequentially? I just -- and maybe you are trying to tell me, sorry, that Latin America and Asia just aren't that big and so seeing it go from down mid teens to down low-single digits. I shouldn't be reading anything into that being a sign of stabilization?","Kevin C. Berryman","No, look, I think it's the material part of the businesses in the developed markets, both North America and Latin, so that -- excuse me, North America and Europe. And so effectively, that's going to be the driver to the numbers that we see for the business...","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then any news on contract resets and kind of 6-month window for these contracts? And any renegotiating that you've done? Or are business coming back to you because alternative sources of supply weren't sufficient?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Lauren, it's Nicolas. Today's market dynamic still remain centered around pricing and pricing being a key driver for customer decision-making versus security of supply at this stage, so our price negotiation for the first half of 2012 were heavily centered around the lowest price. So going forward, when incorporating all the new trends and market dynamics to readjust our portfolio, but as we progress through the year, we have to watch the market dynamics and understand the implication for our portfolio. So as we have done in the previous quarter, we're constantly evaluating the different options. And this is also one of the reasons why, in 2010, we took the decision to the partial closure of our facility in Europe. So we're constantly adapting all resource and our assets to the market dynamics.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Aaron with RBC Capital Markets.","Asher Cronk - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Guys, this is Asher Cronk sitting in for Ed. This one's for Kevin. Kevin, how much did incentive comp benefit operating expenses in the quarter on a year-over-year basis? And how much of a headwind should we expect next year as you accrue to a more normalized level?","Kevin C. Berryman","Look, I think, as you know, our compensation plans are really aligned with the creation of shareholder value. And while we certainly met our long-term targets for the year, we fell short of what the expectations that we have set for ourselves. And as a result of that, that has an implication relative to the incentive compensation levels for 2011. I think, importantly, we should take and understand our compensation expenses, the key business operating expense associated with performance. So there is a certain amount of variability associated with that item. As we perform, that number will go up. As we don't, it will go down. In terms of the quarter, it was a material benefit for our performance, although I continue to rather talk to the number versus what I would consider to be a normalized level. And I think, in 2011 fourth quarter, that number is plus or minus: I'll give you a general number, it's around $15 million in the quarter versus a normalized level of compensation expense, so there was a benefit to that extent. To your question on 2012, we have provided some insight, and Doug has commented, as it relates to our desire to strive for the long-term financial targets. And certainly, that number that is in there relative to incentive compensation expenses embedded into that kind of direction that we're providing for the 2012 figures. So it's embedded into that figure.","Asher Cronk - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-on, what are your relative inflation expectations sort of in the Flavors versus Fragrances next year?","Kevin C. Berryman","Well, we haven't really talked a lot about that, but we think that the numbers are certainly significantly less than what we saw in 2010 but remain above historical levels...","Asher Cronk - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then presumably, we would expect Fragrances to be higher than the low-single digit, and Flavors, lower?","Douglas D. Tough","Help me understand the question a little bit.","Asher Cronk - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just the relative inflation expectations by, in Flavors versus Fragrances on a consolidated basis, expecting low single digit. How do we expect Flavors versus Fragrances to look?","Kevin C. Berryman","Look, I think that there's probably a little slighter, higher number in Fragrance than Flavors at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In terms of your expansions in Singapore, are there tax implications to that expansion?","Kevin C. Berryman","Jeff, it's Kevin. Yes, yes, there is opportunities that we have worked through with the local officials and local regulatory bodies that provide us some tax benefits.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and when would they begin?","Kevin C. Berryman","They would begin as we start to operate the facility. That's the expectation.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And forgive me, when's that?","Kevin C. Berryman","We're expecting that we'll get to the point where it's going to be over the course of this year, probably [indiscernible] 2013.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, in terms of your raw materials, I would imagine they were pretty high in the third quarter and they came down in the fourth quarter and they're going up in the first quarter. But are first quarter raw materials, on average, higher or lower than third quarter of '11 raw materials?","Kevin C. Berryman","Look, the percentage increases are up versus the same period a year ago, right?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I know that, yes, but I'm wondering the third quarter of '11 versus the first quarter of '12.","Kevin C. Berryman","I would say it's probably at a level that is, because third quarter was the high mark in terms of our percentage increase, so I think that there's probably, it's probably pretty [indiscernible]. I'll have to get it and confirm that with you, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm sorry, what did you say? It's probably...","Kevin C. Berryman","It's probably close, but I'll have to get back to you to confirm that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, in local currency terms, you, Flavors grew about 9% this year and Fragrances was negative 1. So when you think, if you had to guess as to what the global market growth rates were in Flavors and in Fragrances, what do you think they were in 2011?","Douglas D. Tough","Go ahead, go ahead.","Hernan Vaisman","This is Hernan speaking. It's very difficult really to have a precise figures, but our estimation for Flavors is that it's around 4%, 5% for 2011.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","And it's also too early to say in Fragrances. We will need to monitor some of the result that will be published in the next few weeks, but we believe it's in, like, maybe 1%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of your outlook for 2012, you noted that you have roughly $9 million in pretax savings coming from product rationalization. Do you have any additional sort of restructuring savings that kick in next year?","Kevin C. Berryman","Mike, the $9 million is relative. I'm assuming you're talking to the Fragrance realignment initiative that we announced earlier in January, right? That is associated with the commentary that Nicolas had where we had a, the restructuring, the realignment work where we took the charges, $10 million, and we expect savings of about $9 million.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, and so I might have mixed that up, I apologize. So other savings coming from product rationalization efforts in '12?","Douglas D. Tough","No -- I'm not sure what you mean by product rationalization, Mike. The rationalization...","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of the $50 million, the, to improve the portfolio, but maybe, are there increasing pricing walking away from products?","Douglas D. Tough","Well, certainly, the walking away is envisioned as part of our numbers for next year, but other product rationalizations really aren't factored into our 2012 plans.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the $9 million gives you 2% operating income growth in order to hit the 7% to 9% growth that you are looking for on a long-term basis. Does the rest just come from volume growth?","Kevin C. Berryman","Well, look, I -- Mike, there's a variety of things. Clearly, we're expecting to see some growth. We're continuing to see some pricing. That will be offset, certainly, as it relates to some incremental input costs. And of course, we are also talking about the incremental investments in R&D to support the long-term growth initiatives. So there's a series of things that will translate into our ability to deliver, again, the long-term financial targets, objectives that Doug has alluded to.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. Do you need -- do you hit the 4% to 6% sales growth goal to get there this year? It sounds like you have a lot of other things to help you out in terms of meeting those goals besides sales.","Douglas D. Tough","Let me just talk to that. I think, Mike, I think you're right. And there are 2 things that are on ongoing basis, one of which is just ongoing efficiencies, reformulations, elements like that which are part of the portfolio. And they're just, they're ongoing, a significant part of the puzzle. And the other is just the opportunities associated with new briefs and new technologies where we would look for margin expansion as a function of bringing superior benefits. And Hernan and Nicolas have talked about the new wins in the pipeline. All of those, we would look for, would bring superior products and margin.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, yes. So 2012, really, the focus should be on your internal execution, which should allow you to meet the earnings growth goals, and maybe, the sales growth goals take a backseat as you walk away with some products and maybe still have some issues in ingredients near term.","Kevin C. Berryman","Mike, I don't know that I'd characterize that. We're not planning on the growth. The numbers that we've talked about being at the low end of the range incorporate the other business that could potentially be eliminated relative to the discussion, specifically in Flavors, with certain customers. So we're still expecting some growth and get [ph] the profit algorithm, certainly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Sjogren with Morgan Stanley.","Erik Sjogren - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's Erik Sjogren from Morgan Stanley. Could you comment a little bit about the brief pipeline as you see it right now in terms of innovation levels, [indiscernible] companies and so on? Are we seeing any kind of trend changes here?","Hernan Vaisman","Erik, it's Hernan. We haven't seen, I mean, big changes in the pipeline. I still -- I mean, the companies are looking for innovations and it's the same things that we have discussed in the past. And they're looking basically for, I mean, a balance of their way -- well-being to the health and wellness and naturals. So basically, it's what we've seen. I mean, having to say that doesn't mean that we'll be changing beyond certain things as they're becoming more evident in the market. So to really, I mean, answer your question, no, we still have, I mean, are receiving this kind of project that they are basically innovation driven.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","And it's Nicolas. A very similar trend for Fragrances, and still, the focus on innovation, focus on the emerging markets. And also, one discipline for us is adding, gain additional access to colleagues' potentials, so which increase our pipeline of new projects.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Maybe a question for Nicolas. But on the Fragrance side, in Ingredients and fine, what's your sense of inventory levels out there? I mean, beyond the tough comps, I would assume that you saw some significant customer destocking. Is that, has that all played out? And related to that, how important is Valentine's Day to the Fine Fragrance business? I know, historically, Christmas and Mother's Day are big events, but how significant is Valentine's Day? Do you see a typical inventory build leading up to that? And depending on how sales goes, what are some of the repercussions in terms of 2012, positively or negatively?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","So in terms of inventory, it is difficult for us to have visibility at this stage, and we'll expect probably a correction. And as we saw the 2010 and '11, we saw a buildup of inventory, our customers. I wanted to make sure in Fine Fragrances that we're not missing any growth opportunities. I think that the mood right now is that people have been positively encouraged by good Christmas results. But at the same token, the brands are staying very cautious about the developments, especially for Europe, but still maintaining a good pipeline of new introductions. So it will take us a little bit more time. I think, like, in Q2 we will have a better understanding of the pipeline and the stock inventory at our customers. Regarding Valentine's, it is a growing period for Fragrances but nowhere near Mother's Day and Christmas at this stage. So I think that people will try to build on the momentum that was created around Christmas, but probably, too early to say.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. And just a modeling question for Kevin. The, so I think this question was asked before, but, related to the incentive comp, but what's -- is there kind of a ballpark normal run rate on global expenses that we can assume? This quarter was a little light, but is it kind of running at $12 million to $15 million a quarter, is that a good number to plug in?","Kevin C. Berryman","Well, it's not that, it's, no, not a particularly bad one. But as you know that we register and recognize the competition expense again relative to our performance, so to the extent we overperform, the number will be higher. And to the extent that we underperform versus our expectations, it will be lower. So I caution you not to be so prescriptive as it relates to what that number is because it is going to be pay-for-performance, so to speak.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Sure. And your CapEx spending has increased over the last 2 or 3 years or so. In 2009, you spent $69 million -- $67 million. In 2011, you spent, let's see here, close to $125 million. The D&A hasn't really moved around too much -- $28 million, apologize for that. The D&A has actually come down somewhat. What's really driving that? And is that just a time lag issue? And we would like to understand that better.","Kevin C. Berryman","Look, as we are embarking upon sort of large expenditures, certainly, the depreciation would not occur for those items until which time you're operational. So certainly, the spend that we've talked about and the significant spend in terms of capacity needs and emerging market focus to ensure we have the ability to continue to drive the growth in those attractive markets. Certainly, we'll, at some point in time, as we start to depreciate those assets when they become operational.","Operator","And you have a follow-up question from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So 2 questions. One, Kevin, could you just give us an update on the use of capital structure in terms of potentially looking at increasing flexibility for share repurchase or things like that? And then second, on the guidance again for 2012 or the outlook versus long-term expectations, however you want to look at it, could you give a bit more color? Like, by my math, it would seem that the gross profit line is going to be pressured and that what allows you to get to the 7% to 9% operating profit longer term is more on the SG&A side. And sort of like related to that, are we using 2010 SG&A expenses as the base given what happened in the incentive comp in 2011?","Kevin C. Berryman","Mark, I think that, if -- the first question, again, Mark, was...","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Capital structure, share repurchase, what increased the flexibility to do something like that?","Kevin C. Berryman","We've been fairly consistent in terms of what we have talked about relative to our use of cash, Mark. And effectively, the, our overarching desire is to be able to maintain a level of financial flexibility. And certainly, we are focused and we'll continue to be focused on the needs that are going to be necessary to support our growth initiatives and that includes CapEx, obviously, in terms of supporting the business. We are also certainly being more proactive in our evaluation and monitoring of corporate development initiatives, including M&A activity. And I think that, at the end, we will continue to ensure that we have a tax-efficient use of our cash, including those opportunities where they might involve a return of cash to shareholders. So at the end of the day, we're focused primarily on our internal growth initiatives, as well, continuing to be proactive in terms of the monitoring of other potential growth opportunities. As it relates to the 2012 item, look, I think that Doug has highlighted the fact that there is certainly some uncertainty as it relates to 2012 environment, which we will be operating, that we feel as if we're targeting our desire to reach the objectives, but there certainly is some uncertainty as it relates to the environment in which we will be operating. I think all the elements are important, as it relates to the financial algorithm necessary to deliver against the objectives. Certainly, top line growth is going to be important, some pricing is going to be important, the management of or the delivery and the savings associated with the recently announced initiative. All of these items are going to be important for us to be able to deliver against the targets that we've -- are going to be striving for in 2012. I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as one or the other.","Douglas D. Tough","Let me just build a little bit, Mark, because, way back early on, you had something which suggested that it wasn't going to be sales, the results might not be sales achieved, they would be achieved through RSA management. And we have talked about and, I think, are relatively, are disciplined in the context of that. But the investments that we have in the strategic projects defined in the past are underway and we call them high-value at-stake inside the company. They are being progressed. The focus on R&D and an increased investment in 2012 in R&D is already earmarked. So the growth in the top line will contribute to the results. We did indicate in the early parts of the year we're going to be under some margin pressure as a function of the costs that we've had, raw material costs, cost in inventory until such time as pricing and efficiencies and other measures capture the margin we need. But it's really, as Kevin said, all parts of the algorithm that are going to get us there but it's really not going to be at the expense of investing in those items that we've deemed critical for the long term, i.e., R&D and some of the innovation and expansion into emerging markets and so on. They're all part of the mix this year.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks?","Douglas D. Tough","My appreciation for the all the attendees on the call, the comments. And we look forward to talking to you in a few months. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"11872":["International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. Participants will be announced by their name and company. In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request that you limit one question per person.","I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau","Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website.","Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2018. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty.","For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 28th, 2017 and our press release that we filed yesterday.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release.","With me on our call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have.","With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Mike. As usual, I will start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Then I want to provide some key highlights of our strategic progression in regards to our long-term Vision 2020 strategy.","Once finished, I will ask Rich to cover our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow dynamics. Then we will both provide commentary as it relates to our outlook for 2018 and finish by taking any questions that you may have.","Starting with the financial review of our consolidated results for the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to report that we had strong operational performance resulting in consolidated currency-neutral sales growth of 10%, currency-neutral adjusted operating profit growth of 4%, and currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth of 16%. Rich will take you into greater detail on the fourth quarter later in the presentation.","On a full year basis, 2017 was another notable year in regards to our financial performance. Consolidated currency-neutral sales growth grew 9% as both business units successfully delivered strong growth with 10% in Flavors and 9% in Fragrances.","Overall topline growth was supported by our organic business, which grew 4% on a currency-neutral basis, in line with our long-term financial target, as we capitalized on strong new wins as well as improved volume trends on existing business.","In addition, David Michael, Fragrance Resources, and PowderPure provided approximately five percentage points of additional growth. Led by volume growth, the benefits associated with growth of productivity initiatives and the contribution of acquisitions, consolidated adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis increased 5% for the full year 2017.","This improvement when combined with a more favorable year-over-year effective tax rate and a reduction in shares outstanding led to a 9% increase in our currency-neutral adjusted EPS.","We also continued to advance our long-term strategy that will enable us to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Some key highlights. Sales of our Sweetness and Savory modulation portfolio continued to grow strong double digits across all our categories, led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage.","To ensure we maintain these robust growth dynamics, we successfully launched three new natural taste modulators. Encapsulation-related sales continued to grow, led primarily by Fabric Care and Personal Wash.","In delivery systems, the encapsulation platform remains paramount to future growth, which is why we made strong advancements to extend this technology into even more categories.","In the Middle East and Africa, we continued to grow our business up mid-single-digits, with growth coming in both Flavors and Fragrances. To ensure we continue to strive in this exciting and dynamic region, we opened a fully renovated and expanded facility in Cairo to better serve our regional customers and strengthening our market presence.","In North America, we launched Tastepoint, a fully dedicated organization with -- in IFF designed to serve middle-market customers. This new and innovative go-to-market approach targets the unique needs and expectation of this target customer base, who call for speed, agility, and resourcefulness. And it is powered with technology that drives differentiation.","Tastepoint performance in 2017 was very strong, improving double-digits. Cosmetic Active Ingredients also remained a growth driver in 2017, as Lucas Meyer's Cosmetics, acquired two years ago, continued to grow double-digits.","In terms of sustainability, IFF continued its global sustainability leadership as we earned a Gold Status designed -- designation by EcoVadis and A-list acknowledgment by CDP for the third year in a row.","We were also named to the Euronext Vigeo U.S. Top 50 Index and saw an improvement in our Dow Jones Sustainability Index score. More recently, we were named Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies, an index launched in February 2018 as we joined the ranks of 99 other leading companies assessed by performance in key stakeholder categories.","In terms of capital allocation, we spent approximately $129 million in capital expenditures or about 4% of sales. This was primarily driven by our previously announced strategic investments in operations, including China and India, and creative and application centers globally.","We also invested $205 million of capital for two strategic acquisitions. We fortified our Fragrance business with an acquisition of Fragrance Resources, increasing our participation in specialty fine fragrances and strengthening our market position with regional customers in North America and Germany.","We also purchased PowderPure to further expand our expertise in Flavors by offering clean-label solution that do not compromise taste, nutrition, and color. The combination of these two acquisitions should add approximately $90 million of expected annual revenue.","We returned approximately $264 million or 56% of our adjusted net income to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases, increasing our annual dividend 8% and announcing the extension of our existing share repurchase [technical difficulty] ","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich.","Richard O'Leary","Thank you, Andreas. I'd like to now turn our attention to the business unit reviews for the fourth quarter. Flavors currency-neutral sales increased 5%, led by strong growth in Savory, Beverage and Sweet. It should be noted that on a two-year average basis, growth was strong at approximately 7%.","From a regional perspective, all four regions delivered growth, led by 9% improvement in North America, primarily driven by strong double-digit growth in Savory. EAME increased 5% on a currency-neutral basis, with the strongest growth in Beverage.","On a geographic basis, the Middle East; Africa; Central, Southern and Eastern Europe all reported strong growth. Greater Asia grew 2% on a currency-neutral basis, principally driven by robust growth in India and the Asean region. And in Latin America, sales growth was 6% on a currency-neutral basis, as growth was led by the Southern Cone region, specifically Argentina.","In Q4, on a currency-neutral segment profit basis, Flavors grew approximately 10%, led by volume growth and the benefit from productivity initiatives. In terms of currency-neutral segment profit margins, we achieved year-over-year margin expansion of approximately 90 basis points to 21.3%.","Fragrance currency-neutral sales improved 15% in Q4, as growth was broad-based and very strong with approximately 10 percentage points coming from our organic business and approximately 5% coming from acquisitions. Regionally, growth was broad-based as all regions increased double-digits. It should be noted that Brazil has stabilized as we saw a rebound in overall volume performance.","From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances improved 27% on a currency-neutral basis, including Fragrance Resources. All regions achieved strong double-digit growth inclusive of acquisitions.","Organically, sales on a currency-neutral basis grew double-digits, led by new win performance as well as improved volume on existing business. Consumer Fragrances grew 12% on currency-neutral basis, including Fragrance Resources.","Organically, our performance was driven by double-digit growth in Personal Wash and Home Care as well as high single-digit performance in Toiletries. Please take note that Consumer Fragrances continued to perform well relative to the first half of 2017, as volume on existing business has remained positive in Q4.","Fragrance ingredients sales were up 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven primarily by double-digit growth in Latin America, North America, and Greater Asia. And as Andreas noted, Lucas Meyer's also continued to perform well in the quarter with double-digit growth.","From a profit perspective in Q4, Fragrances segment profit remained constant on a currency-neutral basis. Volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives were offset by unfavorable price to input costs and an increase in research, selling and administrative expenses, which includes higher incentive compensation expense, and an increase in amortization cost associated with the acquisition of Fragrance Resources. This had a corresponding impact on year-over-year currency-neutral segment profit margin, which finished at 16.6% in the fourth quarter.","Turning to next slide. We show the year-over-year pact -- year-over-year impact in terms of contribution of Q4 operating profit growth on a consolidated basis, expressed as a percentage of our restated fourth quarter 2016 adjusted operating profit. Starting with the second bar, you can see that volume added approximately 13 percentage points to overall operating profit growth.","In the third bar, you can see that we continued to benefit from our cost and productivity initiatives through the likes of procurement savings, our restructuring program savings. Overall, we delivered approximately six percentage points of benefit year-over-year.","Moving on to the next bar, through disciplined cost management, including components of zero-based budgeting. RSA contributed two percentage points of benefit to the fourth quarter adjusted currency-neutral operating profit growth.","Overall in the quarter, mix had a negligible impact. From an M&A perspective, M&A -- from a headwind perspective, M&A was a slightly drag of one percentage point. We also at various times went against this in the quarter, which represented about two percentage points of headwind.","Net price to input costs was unfavorable by about three percentage points and was predominantly driven by higher raw material costs in Fragrances.","Lastly, incentive compensation was unfavorable by approximately 10 percentage points year-over-year. In terms of year-over-year comparison, we had a large delta, as we compare to a lower-base period in the prior year due to underperformance versus a plan compared to strong performance in the current year quarter.","As a quick reminder, we are highly incentivized to deliver our financial commitments. From time-to-time, there are variations in incentive comp as it is based on our performance relative to our plan.","If we achieve our financial targets, we'll receive 100% of our designated payout. Should we over or under deliver versus the plan, our incentive compensation is adjusted higher or lower. In the case of 2017 -- 2017, incentive compensation expense was higher than 2016, as we exceeded our 2017 targets.","Moving on to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $391 million for the year, which compares to $550 million last year. Our 2017 performance was adversely impacted primarily by the ZoomEssence litigation settlement, higher working capital requirements, acquisition-related activities, and restructuring charges.","It should be noted that while working capital requirements year-over-year was unfavorable, it improved significantly in the fourth quarter from where it was at the end of the third quarter, mainly due to improved accounts payable.","As Andreas mentioned, from a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $129 million in CapEx or about 4% of sales and believe that we will spend between 4% and 5% of sales in 2018. With the current expectation, it will be at the higher end of the range.","Regarding cash returned to shareholders, in 2017, through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, we delivered a total payout of 56% of adjusted net income, consistent with our 50% to 60% targeted range.","With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Over the last two years, we have seen the global operating environment become more volatile. Fortunately, several of the factors in which we highlighted in the past have started to see modest improvements.","To put this in context, we have seen global consumer staple volumes starting to stabilize and show signs of improvement. While it's early in the year, expectation is that the consumer staples volume will improve in 2018, increasing approximately 2%. This compares well to what we, as an industry, have seen over the last three years and where the average was flattish to up slightly.","From an economic perspective, GDP growth on a global basis is expected to improve modestly. A key driver for this improvement is expected to come from stronger GDP trends in the emerging markets. This should provide a relative improvement over the last few years in terms of our topline performance, as approximately 50% of our sales are through the emerging markets.","U.S. dollar continues to fluctuate versus the world currencies. And as a global organization with nearly 30 currencies, there are many moving parts. Most relevant for IFF, the strengthening of the euro versus U.S. dollar is favorable as approximately 30% of our profits are euro denominated.","However, please remember that the impact on profitability will be limited as we have a rolling hedging program and our hedge about 80% at $1.15 for 2018. This compares to an average euro to U.S. dollar rate at $1.12 for the full year 2017.","While we are optimistic that the operating environment has improved modestly, the one area that remains headwind is raw material cost. On the natural size, the demand for all natural products continues to drive across all natural ingredients, as has done over the past few years.","This can be best seen in vanilla and citrus markets, where prices remain at historically high levels, and turpentine and turpentine derivatives, particularly gum turpentine, costs have increased significantly.","In addition, synthetics materials are directly and indirectly from oil are exhibiting inflationary pressures. For all of these instances, we have been continue to have active discussions with our customers to recover our cost exposure via pricing.","With that as a backdrop, I would like to highlight several notable items that we expect to impact our financial results in 2018. One of our key suppliers, BASF, had a fire occurred at their manufacturing plant in Germany during quarter 4 2017. This impacted their production of citral, a very common ingredient used in many formulations in both Flavors and Fragrances.","In addition, they declared Force Majeure, which impacts both supply and cost of the key import for the entire Flavor and Fragrance industry. Based on their public statements, the startup for that plant is not expected to occur until the end of March 2018. We anticipate that the supply chain will not fully normalize until the second half of 2018.","With that, I would like to turn it back to Rich.","Richard O'Leary","Thanks Andreas. Let me take the couple of more technical items. At the end of 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax reform. Key changes include, but are not limited to, Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax, executive compensation deduction limits, and the elimination of certain special deductions.","For us, we accrued a provisional net charge of $139 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which primarily includes a transition tax on the company's historic unremitted foreign earnings and the reevaluation of the company's net deferred tax assets to reflect the new lower statutory tax rate.","As we think about 2018, based on our current assessment and understanding of the Tax Act in our current global operating restructure, we believe that our effective tax rate in 2018 will be approximately 21%.","Lastly, in March of 2017, the FASB issued an amendment to the compensation report -- retirements benefits guide and effective in 2018, interest costs, asset returns, and the amortization and gains and losses will now be recorded in other income and expense versus operating profit under the previous accounting rules. The impact was approximately $31 million in 2017 and $15 million in 2016.","For modeling comparison purposes, our pro forma adjusted operating profit for 2017 will now be $616 million, and other income and expense will be $40 million, of which $31 million is for the pension change and $9 million is other regular income and expense items.","Given the several moving parts, we felt it was important to highlight the drivers of currency-neutral adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS for greater transparency. Before doing so, I want to highlight the expectation for sales performance. We expect 3% to 5% currency-neutral sales growth as all categories are expected to contribute to growth.","In terms of expected operating -- adjusted operating profit performance in 2018, please take note that our starting point following the pension accounting change is $616 million for 2017.","In 2018, we expect the profitability of our core business to accelerate versus the growth we achieved in 2017 from approximately 5% to approximately 7% to 9%. We expect the performance to be driven by the combination of volume growth and the benefits of cost and productivity initiatives, which include our standard program plus advancements in zero-based budgetings and savings associated with the multiyear productivity program that we announced in the early 2017.","Net price to raw material cost is expected to be neutral, as we're taking action to cover our cost exposure.","In the fifth bar, we isolated the impact relative to the citral Force Majeure. While we are pleased to say that we can believe we can meet the demand of our customers, the challenge, however, is that the total financial impact in 2018 is quite large at approximately 7%.","Fortunately, we have and continued to work with all of our possible mitigation options, and currently believe the impact should be limited to approximately two percentage points.","Inclusive of the impact of the citral situation, we expect raw material costs will rise mid-single-digits in 2018. Please note that this is very fluid situation and is based on how we see things today. Our objective is to fully offset the BASF impact, as we're pursuing all options, both internally and externally. I'll review the impact of currency in more detail shortly.","Moving on to EPS, as you see from the second bar and similar to our previous slide, our core business remained strong. We expect 6% to 8% growth in 2018 from our core business. As I discussed moments ago, the Force Majeure situation is expected to adversely impact results by approximately two percentage points.","Looking at tax, based on our current assessment and understanding of the Tax Act and our current structure, we believe that our effective tax rate in 2018 will be 21%. And it's inclusive of the net -- the impact of the tax reform net of mitigation and planning opportunities that we've identified today.","The ultimate impact of the tax impact may differ from this estimate due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by taxing authorities, as well as our operating and structural changes that we may take into result -- take into account as a result of the Act. We expect currency-neutral EPS to be between 4% and 6%.","In terms of foreign exchange, for 2018, we expect currency translation to be a favorable impact on sales of approximately three percentage points. We expect currency to be favorable by approximately 1.5 percentage points on adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS, respectively.","Net-net, our 2018 guidance all-in is 6% to 8% sales growth, 6.5% to 8% for operating profit, and 5.5% to 7.5% for EPS.","With that, I'd like to pass it over to Andreas for some closing comments.","Andreas Fibig","In summary, we're pleased with what we have achieved so far across all key financial metrics in 2017. As we enter 2018, recognizing that uncertainty remains in the operating environment, we are targeting growth across all of our key financial metrics.","We're doing so by taking action to accelerate sales growth in advantage categories, deliver innovation that is truly differentiated, and generate higher returns via continued cost and productivity initiatives, and generate strong returns for our shareholders. And we have started the year 2018 well with growth across both business units.","With that, I would now like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. ","Mark Astrachan","Yes, hey, good morning everybody.","Andreas Fibig","Good morning Mark.","Richard O'Leary","Good morning Mark.","Mark Astrachan","Wanted to ask first about the sales growth outlook. So, if you keep the two-year constant, it would imply growth at least at the midpoint, maybe even a little bit stronger than that. So, I guess, I'm curious why are you including a wider range at least compared to last year? And what if they happen to come in at the low end and at the high end?","Andreas Fibig","Yes. Look, Mark, first of all, we are certainly optimistic for 2018. But with all the volatility we have seen in the last, let's say, two years in the market, plus the citral situation we are having at hand right now, we said it's more prudent to go in with a wider range and then probably update over the course of the year. So, that's our view on it.","Richard O'Leary","I think, the other thing for me, Mark, is as we talked about on the last call, I mean, we're still -- it's still unclear to what extent the improvement we've seen late in 2017 and how much of that is going to be volume impacts and inventory at our customer levels and restocking. So, I think that's why -- some of those factors are why we use a wider range this time.","Mark Astrachan","Got it. And just to elaborate on that, and then I want to ask the second question. Six weeks into the first quarter at this point, so I guess, maybe color as it relates to your last bit of commentary would be helpful in terms of sort of how you're seeing things so far.","And then just switching a bit to growth margin. So, your ability to take pricing given, obviously, higher input costs now, the BASF issues and the commentary from last call about slightly pushback from customers in terms of the ability to take pricing or at least their pushback on needing to hit their own internal earnings target.","How do you think about the puts and takes that where we are? And how do you think about the longer term ability to grow growth margins relative to the level where you were at the end of 2017?","Andreas Fibig","Yes. Okay, I'll take that. So, as we said, the start into the first quarter was a very, very good start, what we have seen so far. So, -- and we are closing in February next week, which is good, good data point.","On the pricing, we are certainly in negotiation with our customers. We believe that we can recover our pricing. As you well know from the past, it will take some time to recover the pricing. You always had a -- have a time lag in it, whether it's based on inventory or the negotiation of the contract you have in place, but we are fairly optimistic that we get it done.","But we have to recognize all. It's a very complex situation for us right now, because on one hand you have the raw material prices, on the other hand, you have the BASF situation, which are completely two different animals. And I think that, that's not easy to explain. But I hope when we are through the whole situation BASF situation, it's easier to show where we are. That's pricing.","And growth margin, on the fourth quarter what you have seen probably a bit of a mix impact and the raw material, but we certainly want to make sure this year that we work on the mix to make sure that we are really very well in place and about the raw material and the pricing we talk. But I don't know, Rich, whether you want to add on this?","Richard O'Leary","Yes, sure. I mean, I think it -- I mean, just to echo a couple of Andreas' comments. At the end, I think it was a -- it has been a good start to the first quarter from a margin perspective. We've had some -- in Q4, some productivity, some one-off items that we saw in the quarter.","As I think about 2018 margin relative to 2017, as you said, Mark, we're going to have pricing increases to cover the normal input cost increases. On top of that, we've got BASF. So, that by definition is going to put pressure on margins for 2018. We've got some of the carryover pricing more in the first half, obviously, in the second half from our customers. So, that's going to put further pressure, I think, in the first half of 2018.","And then, as you saw in the operating profit bridge, I mean, the two percentage point net impact that we currently believe is achievable in 2018 for BASF is going to have a direct impact on margin. So, when I look at in total, I'd say that our expectations for margins in 2018 are probably flat to maybe down slightly.","Mark Astrachan","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kate Grafstein with Barclays.","Katie Grafstein","Thanks. So, just looking back at your initial expected profit bridge for 2017 that you gave last February, I was wondering if you could talk about what performed better or worse than you initially expected? And did you achieve the four to four and a half points of benefit from productivity and cost savings?","Richard O'Leary","Sure. Thanks Kate. No problem. There's a lot there, but let me try to stick with the highlights. I think top line growth was better than what we expected. So, overall growth in the business was better than what we expected.","I think you've heard us talk throughout the year, M&A, particularly, the Flavors, Tastepoint business performed well and probably exceeded expectations. Price input cost was -- I would say is unfavorable. We've had the pricing pressure on, particularly in Fragrances that we've talked about since the middle of the year. So that was a negative.","Mix, particularly, in the middle part of the year was a big drag that we talked about on the second and third quarter calls. From a productivity standpoint, I think we were slightly ahead of our goals for 2017 in terms of the profit improvement program. The components may have shifted a little bit, but we're slightly ahead of where we expected to be.","Katie Grafstein","Thank you. And just one other thing on the strength of North America Fine Fragrances. Just wondering if it was due to any one customer, in particular? Or if -- and then, like, the split between existing business and new wins.","Andreas Fibig","It was actually not one customer. So, it was more across the Board was broader, which is good. And the volumes went up as well, which was driving it. So, all-in-all, very, very positive, because it's not a one-off and it's just not one customer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael Sison","Hey guys. In terms of the BASF situation, does it affect Flavors more or Fragrances? And maybe can you talk about the core growth in each of those segments in 2018 based on your outlook?","Richard O'Leary","Yes. And Mike, it's primarily Fragrances in terms of BASF. The principal impact on Flavors is on menthol. But the vast majority of the impact is on the Fragrance side, because it's used in so many different formulas.","In terms of growth in the two business units in 2018, there is -- I think, it's pretty similar growth expectations for both businesses.","Michael Sison","Okay. And for the citral situation, is it more your inability to get the raw material versus the higher prices? And are there other ways to may be source some of these materials?","Richard O'Leary","No, I think, Mike, we're -- we actually feel very good. And I think you heard it in Andreas' comments that we're actually well-positioned and we feel good that we've been able to maintain continuity of supply to our customers.","However, to do that, we're having to deal with increased input costs and the market pricing has driven dramatically in late -- beginning in October and November when the -- when BASF had first made the announcement.","We've had to make choices internally and shift internal capacity. We're vertically integrated. So, part of the impact that we're seeing is we're having to give up external sales on Ingredients in order to give preference to our customers, though it's a variety of factors. Most of that is the input -- the actual cost of the input, cost and some incremental manufacturing expenses to get the product in the right place, some work in terms of Nicolas' team from a creation standpoint to be able to adapt with changes that the customers are asking us for.","Michael Sison","Great. And then last one. Andreas, when you think about the trend to naturals. Can you maybe just give us an update on where we're at there? Are you start -- are you continuing to see a lot of momentum in new product development from customers? And what inning do you think we are in that trend longer term?","Andreas Fibig","No, Mike, absolutely. The trend stays and it's gaining even momentum. We have it, as you well know, on the Flavors already, because 90% of our, let's say, briefs in North America in Flavors are basically for naturals. So, you see -- and that's why we're catering with our PowderPure acquisition as well. So, we are strengthening even our position here.","But now we see it more and more on the Fragrance side as well, and not just on the pure fragrance, also on the active cosmetics. That's a natural element, plays much, much a bigger role. And I don't expect that this will go away. So, that's something -- a trend which is still pretty much intact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck","Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you?","Andreas Fibig","Good, very well. Good morning Silke.","Richard O'Leary","Good morning Silke.","Silke Kueck","So, my first question is just a question of clarification. So, what you said is that there was $15 million pension-related benefit in 2016 that you now will capture in other income. And there was an even higher pension benefit of $30 million in your 2017 operating income, which will now become part of other income, so, effectively, your operating income in 2017. So, it's like, we're really at a slower rate, right? So, it's, like, went from $605 million to $616 million, is that correct?","Richard O'Leary","Yes, I mean, it's part of our normal pension expenses and what we have to deal with as a company year in, year out. I mean, for a long time, the cost was going up every year, and we were having to absorb it, particularly, post-Lehman crisis when asset returns were hurt significantly. So, it's a function of the overall economics of the business that we've had to deal with over the last several years.","Silke Kueck","Secondly, how do you think about incentive accruals in 2018? Will that be headwind, the benefit, do you have some thoughts about that?","Richard O'Leary","I'd say, it's going to be -- it should be flat to slight benefit.","Silke Kueck","And in terms of your tax rate, there's various change that's taking place. Will there be a change in your cash tax rate? Or can you tell us what your cash tax rate was in 2017 and what you expect it to be in 2018? As best as you can tell with the information that you have today.","Richard O'Leary","What I can say is that I don't have my cash tax rate off the top of my head. I mean, obviously, if you think about the charge we recorded, it's a $139 million, about $100 million of that is the transitional tax, the remaining part of that is a reevaluation of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. That $100 million, the actual amount we're going to have to pay over the next eight years is going to be, probably call it, two-thirds of that number, because of credits we have available.","So, from a cash standpoint, that's going to hurt us in 2018 versus 2017, because we're going to have to start to make that payment spread over the next eight years. So, I would expect our cash effective tax rate to be worse than it was in 2017.","Silke Kueck","And I've got a final question on the Fragrance business. Like, the underlying -- like, even if I strip out the acquisition, it looks like Fragrance sales in North America were really exceptionally strong. So, I was wondering whether you can sort of, like, talk about the Fragrance business in North America. What it may -- what rate it grew at in the individual divisions, excluding the acquisition and what was behind that?","Richard O'Leary","Yes. So, I mean, it's overall -- I mean, the effect of -- I mean, big part of that on the compound business in total would have been -- it's about half of the compounds, a little bit, call it one-third of the growth, it's about 10% growth, double-digit growth in compounds in total, and their balance is going to be Fragrance Resources.","Fine Fragrance grew -- again, on an organic basis, grew high single-digits, Consumer Fragrance grew low double-digits. So it's pretty strong across the entire business in North America. Win rates were pretty consistent with what we've seen, but the big piece was volume recovery on existing business.","Andreas Fibig","Yes.","Silke Kueck","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Andreas Fibig","Hey, good morning.","Richard O'Leary","Good morning.","Faiza Alwy","So, just one or two questions from me. First of all, can you talk a little bit more about the pricing pressure that you are seeing from your customers? Is this something new in terms of because the competitive environment changed.","Because historically, the view was that Flavors and Fragrances are such a small percentage of products overall costs, that there isn't a lot of pushback from customers, but that's clearly changed over the last, I'd say, year or so. Can you just, Andreas, maybe give us a little bit more perspective on perhaps if the competitive environment is having an impact on that?","Richard O'Leary","Sure, Faiza. I mean I think there's a couple of things to keep in mind. I mean we've talked -- they are customers, particularly, our global customers. We've talked about this for the last several calls about having significant productivity improvement programs in their business. So, we're not immune to that.","We talk about how we deal with that in terms of a combination of pricing, reformulation, substitution, tradeoffs. So, I mean, I think, the pricing pressure was more significant in the middle part of the year.","If you look at pricing in Q4 for Fragrances, it was slightly positive. So, I think we talked about during the course of the year that we -- it was going to get better. I think, as I said, I expect to see some carryover impact in early 2018. But it's never easy. I'm never going to sit here and look at Nicolas or Matthias in the face and tell him it's easy to raise prices in their teams. It's a lot of work. It takes a lot of focus and discussion.","We've got contracts we have to deal with in terms of when the windows open up, what the thresholds of the increase have to be. So, it takes, I think, over the time and we've shown that pretty consistently over the last 10 years that we can get there. Sometimes, it takes a little bit longer than we want to.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. No, I'm fairly optimistic on this one as well. I think we know how to deal with it. We know how to operate in that environment. And this year, as we said before, it's a little bit more complex because we have to distinct between the raw material price increase and the BASF situation, which makes it not easy. But we're fairly optimistic that we can do it as we've done it before.","Faiza Alwy","Okay, okay. And then, Andreas, can you talk a little bit more about your M&A outlook strategies? What are you focused -- most focused on in terms of targets for -- especially for 2018? And then just, Rich, the cash flow, as you mentioned, was pretty weak in 2017. Do you have any targets or goals that you're looking for in 2018? Thank you.","Andreas Fibig","No, look, Faiza, as we have done it in the last three years, we have all our list we're working on. We are actually very happy that all the five acquisitions we have done in the last three years are actually performing all very well. And actually all above the business case, which is a very, very good thing.","And there's nothing extraordinary what I can announce right now. But we are certainly, let's say, going forward with our strategy, which is described in our Vision 2020, where M&A is an active pillar of our strategy. We're certainly looking at a couple of exciting technology moves as well, but it's too early to talk about it.","Richard O'Leary","From a cash flow standpoint, Faiza, I mean, clearly 2017 was not a good year. We're down about $160 million year-over-year in cash flow from operations. I mean some of the pieces you're already aware of and everyone is aware of; the litigation settlement, $56 million; working capital was about $45 million higher. It's an increase in terms of cash outflow. I mean we did improve as a percent of sales by about 20 basis points on our core working capital, but it was well below what our expectations were.","On top of that, there's probably about a $25 million-or-so impact on our cash flows this year -- or last year, 2017, related to the productivity-improvement program, the acquisitions and the integration costs related to that.","So, the balance of it, call it $30 million or so is really around indirect taxes, prepayments, some of the more normal day-to-day stuff. Expectations for next year, obviously, is going to be significantly improved. If you take out just the two -- I'll call them more one-offs, the litigation and the integration-type things and productivity program, that's $80 million in itself.","And then we're going to have the increased profitability of the business, and we're certainly targeting improvements in working capital this year. I think, it's going to be -- working capital is probably going to be back-ended, because we're going to have to deal with inventories and pricing associated with citral in the first half of this year. And we'll get the pricing in the second half of the year, as I talked about earlier. So, I think, it's -- the improvement's going to be back-ended.","I am happy to say that, if I look at the fourth quarter alone, cash flow in 2017 was only slightly below what we saw in 2016. So, it was a tough start to the year undoubtedly. First nine months of the year was where most of the gap in cash flow generation occurred.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Thank you. How much of the sales growth in Fragrance Ingredients was priced to pass through the higher raw materials? I think that segment is the most impacted and fasted impacted with raw materials.","Andreas Fibig","It's true. John, that's Andreas. Good morning. It's true, but not yet. It's too early that the pricing will come down in the first half of the year.","John Roberts","So, that was mostly volume then?","Andreas Fibig","It was basically -- you might remember up to two years ago, we were not growing in Fragrance Ingredients and we had to turnaround the business and came up with a turnaround strategy. And now the team is basically executing on the turnaround strategy and has a lot of innovation in the pipeline as well, which means new molecules we can offer to our customers and that's yielding right now. So, there's basically no pricing up to now.","John Roberts","Well. And then, Rich, given 80% of your sales are outside the U.S., I was surprised that you were able to lower tax rate as much as you did. Is there anything significant beyond just statutory U.S. rate decline?","Richard O'Leary","John, there's -- there are so many moving pieces. I think, obviously, that's the biggest piece of it, because I mean we've got executive complements that are headwind we have to deal and manage through the Base Erosion Tax, the BEAT Tax. So, -- but if you the -- if you sort of boil it down on one thing, it's going to be the rate reduction.","John Roberts","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein.","Gunther Zechmann","Hey everyone. Can I just ask on multinationals versus regionals in your customer group? Is that still 50-50 or has that shifted because the number of the acquisitions that you've made are targeted towards those faster-growing local champions? So, could you give an update there?","And then in the slide deck, you expect, on page 14, an acceleration of CPG companies from three-year average of 0.4% to 2% in 2018. What's that based on please?","Richard O'Leary","Sure. Probably, I'll start with the last one. For the CPGs, it's basically street expectations, which we talked. So, Mike extracted that and we put it in. And on the customer side, we are around about still 50-50, but certainly would have better growth rate on the smaller customer. So, it probably will tilt a bit towards this over the next couple of months.","Gunther Zechmann","Okay. And can I just check on the 2% of the CPG companies. I know it's early in the year, but is that something that acceleration that you're observing in your orders as well?","Andreas Fibig","Yes, we do. Absolutely. And then we saw already with the volume, because the volume is helping in the fourth quarter.","Richard O'Leary","Second half of the year. I mean--","Andreas Fibig","On second half of the year you can say, in particular. For Fragrance, it was actually a pretty strong turnaround.","Gunther Zechmann","Very clear. Thank you.","Andreas Fibig","I'm sorry, Q1, I forgot about this, but we see it in the first couple of weeks here in the new quarter as well.","Gunther Zechmann","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Fintan Ryan with Berenberg.","Fintan Ryan","Good morning gentlemen. I just have a question in terms of some of your key geographies. Wondering could you give a bit more color on what you're seeing on the demand side in Brazil, Latin America and China within the Greater Asia region? They have been areas of relative softness over the recent quarters.","And I guess, the outlook for 2018. Do you see the emerging markets acceleration driving the sales growth? Or do you expect growth to be sort of broadly split between developed and emerging markets? thank you.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you for the question. I'll start with the last one first. We see actually a broad-based growth over all regions for 2018. In specific on Brazil or LatAm, we see -- or we have seen that it turn around Brazil for the Fragrance business actually in the second half, which is a good sign, because it's a very important market for Fragrance and it looks like it will stay like this for 2018 as well.","On Asia, we see very, very strong growth in India, very double digit. And you might have seen that we have announced the building of two new factories, Fragrances and Flavors, actually the biggest one in that case in India.","In China, it's still a little bit of a rough patch. You might remember two years ago, we had the incident in our Flavors factory. We are building a second backup plan, which will be inaugurated probably end of third quarter, fourth quarter this year, so that we are over this hump as well and can produce against good growth coming out of China.","But again, the emerging markets are coming back, which is great, but what we have seen is actually very good growth out of the United States, as you have seen and also Western Europe. We shouldn't underestimate that and that's still a pretty significant piece of our business.","So, all in all, a pretty broad-based approach. With a couple of pockets where we believe good growth comes on, like Brazil, for example, or India.","Fintan Ryan","Okay. Thank you for the clarity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thanks. good morning everyone. I was hoping to go back to the sales growth guidance and just to be clear. So, 3% to 5% currency-neutral growth, the company did 4% organic, a little bit -- couple of basis points above that in 2017, so middle of the range.","You've talked about your customers expecting an acceleration in volume growth in 2018. You've talked about your orders being healthy at the start of the year. And there is an expectation that pricing will be accelerating as you move through the year to recover raw materials.","So, I'm just trying to think about that organic sales growth guidance and why there wouldn't -- what's decelerating in the mix to get to the 3% to 5% range if you have those kind of pieces moving where they are actually right now?","Richard O'Leary","Sure, it's Rich. Let me try to give -- I think, you heard our comments earlier around -- there's still a fair amount of uncertainty in the market. And so given that, we took a wider range.","I mean, I think certainly as we look at the components, we probably have about a 1.5 of growth embedded in the guidance related to pricing. The remaining is the volume impact, but I certainly hope that we can be at the higher end of the range and beat that.","I think as Andreas talked about earlier, we've had a good start to the first quarter, but six weeks don't make a year or seven weeks don't make a year. The situation -- the supply situation and the pricing impact and the impact that's going to have as we work that through in both businesses is probably the key drivers on why we've taken a relatively cautious approach in terms of our guidance for 2018.","Andreas Fibig","But we certainly can give you more details as soon as we know when the BASF plant is up on stream online again. And then in our -- what is it, second quarter -- first quarter call, we can give you a good update where we see things panning out.","But I would echo Rich's comments here. It's a lot of moving pieces right now and that's the reason why we said, let's be prudent here and then come up with that guidance.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. And then just a quick clarification on the EPS guidance, the 4% to 6% currency-neutral against the 5% to 7% operating profit currency-neutral growth range. Tax rate's flat year-over-year. What below the line would be causing EPS to grow slower than operating profit?","Richard O'Leary","Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean, I think there's a couple of things. I mean tax is slightly unfavorable, so that's going to be a piece of -- it's a little bit. In 2017, when there is elements of other income that we don't forecast or beat, sort of the miscellaneous items or one-off items really the only thing we embed into our guidance for the current year, i.e. is going to be the interest income component of it. The rest of it, miscellaneous sales and gains, we do not include in that guidance.","And then the last piece, there is the -- given what's going on in terms of our pension plans, interest rates, the amortization schedules on the unrecognized gains and losses, the benefit in 2018 versus 2017 for the pension change is a slight headwind also.","Interest expense, we're forecasting -- that's the other piece, we're forecasting to be higher in 2018 versus 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hundley with The Vertical Group.","Brett Hundley","Hey, thank you. Good morning guys.","Andreas Fibig","Good morning Brett.","Brett Hundley","I joined the call a little late, so I apologize if you guys already talked about this. But on the Fragrances business in Q4, that year-on-year margin declined. I think, it was roughly 200 basis points, if I'm not mistaken. Did -- can you or did you parse out the margin impacts by group, mix being one, price recovery of inputs being two, and then just three, higher core operating cost?","Richard O'Leary","We don't -- when I'm breaking out the individual components, I would tell you sort of the big buckets. I mentioned in my comments, Andreas' comments, we talked about unfavorable -- higher input costs in Q4 for the Fragrance business. Pricing was up slightly, but not enough to offset the increased input cost.","We've got the negative impact principally related to incentive comp reset and the performance of the business. And to a lesser extent some -- I'll call them, selected investments in RSA. Those are probably the three biggest drivers.","Brett Hundley","Okay, that's helpful. Sorry if you had to repeat that.","Richard O'Leary","No, it's okay. And the amortization -- sorry and the amortization cost is the other piece of it, which I didn't have to recall.","Brett Hundley","Okay. Maybe hanging on to the raw material discussion. So, we understand that a fair amount of the drive higher in synthetic raws is related maybe to a stance by the Chinese government where it's becoming a little bit more focused on manufacturing in certain regions in country.","And I'm just kind of curious what you are seeing from that region. I know you have a couple of plants there and you're working to make some consolidation efforts. If you are just seeing any disruption or if it's kind of just business as usual for you guys?","Andreas Fibig","No, I would say, it's business as usual, in particular in the materials we are buying. So, there's nothing extraordinary. But--","Richard O'Leary","No, I mean, I would probably say, it's -- I'm not sure I would have called it business as usual, given the investments we've had to make over the last several years in moving plants to work as good partners with the government, both on the Flavor side and our Ingredients business.","We talked about that on the -- in the third quarter call, our two Ingredients business. But I mean, we feel good about our ability to operate going forward. I think there's probably been some small intermittent issues where local players are going to have to may be dealing with the government coming down on them. But I wouldn't say there's anything significant from a supply chain issue that we are seeing.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein.","Gunther Zechmann","Hey, guys, just a follow-up. Can I check on Dairy? And what happened there in Q4? It's still in the area you don't explicitly split out this contributing to growth. And I thought that's the one area where the vanilla pricing be passed or have passed on should contribute to organic growth.","Richard O'Leary","I think part of it -- I think probably the biggest driver, Gunther, is the prior year comp being quite strong.","Gunther Zechmann","Okay. So, the outlook for 2018 is unchanged?","Richard O'Leary","Yes, it's positive. Yes.","Andreas Fibig","Yes.","Richard O'Leary","There's nothing fundamental in the business has changed.","Gunther Zechmann","Great. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you very much for your attention and the questions. And we certainly will follow-up by one-on-one calls. Thank you very much and have a good day.","Richard O'Leary","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

You may begin.","Shelley Young","Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to IFF fourth quarter and full year 2013 conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our website at iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Before turning the call over Doug Tough and our senior management team, I'd like to read our forward-looking statements.","Please keep in mind that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the fourth quarter and full year 2013 and our outlook for 2014. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 2012 10-K filed on February 26, 2013, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today on our website.","For those of you who are new to our conference call, I'd like to introduce the participants on today's call. With me on the call is Doug Tough, our Chairman and CEO; Nicholas Mirzayantz, our President of Fragrances; Hernan Vaisman, our President of Flavors; and Kevin Berryman, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Tough.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Shelley, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Our focus on the call this morning is to provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year operating performance, give you an update on our strategy, take you through a review of each of our business units and provide our current outlook for 2014.","After the prepared remarks, we will have some time for questions.","Now I would like to provide you with an overview of our performance in quarter 4 of 2013. Our local currency sales growth in Q4 was 7% and reflects strong growth in both our Flavors and Fragrances business units. The emerging markets grew at 11%, which is the highest quarterly growth rate achieved this year. On a consolidated basis, the emerging markets grew at 5x the level of the developed markets in the quarter, and 50% of our sales were to the emerging markets. The overall growth was supported by positive volume on existing business and a steady level of new business wins, reflecting the collaboration among our creative, research and development, and consumer insights teams to provide our customers with products that will continue to delight their consumers.","At the same time, we achieved continued margin expansion, which was supported by a moderate decline in our input costs and the many strategic initiatives that we have discussed all year, including productivity savings, mix and volume leverage. As previously forecast, in the quarter, there was no material impact related to the exit of low-margin sales activities in Flavors. As a result of the strong volume growth, combined with continued margin improvements, we were able to grow our adjusted operating profit by 13%, even as we invested close to 10% of our sales in R&D and absorbed costs related to increased incentive compensation expense. As a result, earnings per share increased by 11% to $0.92, and for the full year, our EPS increased by 12% to $4.46.","In summary, all of our key growth metrics, including local currency sales growth, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share grew above our long-term targets. We are especially pleased with the strong performance, given the very strong Q4 results of last year that we were comparing to.","The strong end of the year in Q4 has capped an excellent year of performance in 2013, especially when noting the still volatile global economic environment. We achieved local currency growth of 5% and, adjusting for the exit of low-margin sales activities in the Flavors business earlier in the year, we achieved like-for-like sales growth of 6% for the full year. This is the fourth consecutive year that we have achieved growth of at least 4% to 6%.","In over the past 5 years, we have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 5% plus, at the higher end of our long-term growth target of 4% to 6%. Our top line growth continues to benefit from our geographic footprint, our focus on innovation and our ability to use our core expertise to provide our customers with creative feeling products that their consumers enjoy. Our strategy is grounded in 3 strategic pillars and benefits from product diversification, and we believe the diversity of our business leads to greater stability and consistency of earnings. The vast majority of the products we make are those essentials that consumers consider part of their everyday lives, and that gives us confidence that consumers will use our customer's products in good times and in challenging times.","Benefiting from the leverage in our P&L, our 5% increase in local currency sales resulted in adjusted operating profit growth of 11% and an EPS improvement of 12%. All of our profit metrics were above our long-term growth targets of 7% to 9% on adjusted operating profit growth and 10% adjusted EPS.","At IFF, we have a well-articulated growth strategy that we believe will enable us to achieve our desired goal of profitable growth. I will briefly comment on our progress against our 3-pillar strategy.","Here is the progress we have made in executing our strategy over the past year. Emerging markets accounted for 50% of our sales in the fourth quarter, the first time ever the emerging markets have represented 50% of our sales in any quarter. For the full year, emerging markets represented 49% of sales.","We opened our Flavors manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, China and expanded our laboratories in Isando, South Africa and Hilversum, in the Netherlands. We continue to expand our facility in Gebze, Turkey, which will open in the first half of 2015. We have already completed Phase 1 of the expansion. The new complex will include additional capacity and a new creative and application center for the developing markets of Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We announced construction of a new creative applications laboratory at our existing facility in Jakarta, Indonesia, as well as a new manufacturing facility on the outskirts of Jakarta.","Our capital investments in new capacity, technology and creative application laboratories in Singapore, China, Turkey and Indonesia will approximate $250 million.","Turning to innovation. We have accelerated the introduction of new molecules on both sides of the house to provide our perfumers and flavorsists with a broader palette from which to choose and provide them molecules that are high performing and cost effective. We're developing the next generation of our proprietary encapsulation capsules for use in new applications such as Hair and Personal Wash, in addition to Fabric Care. We are continuing to invest in biotechnology and are either on plan or ahead of plan regarding our biotechnology partnership initiatives with Amyris and Evolva. And earlier in 2014, we acquired Aromor, a privately held manufacturer and marketer of complex specialty ingredients, that are used in Fragrances and Flavors, with strong R&D capabilities. We are very excited about their portfolio of cost-effective specialty molecules, which will complement our existing Ingredients portfolio and provide a better array of molecules to our perfumers.","In short, our commitment has never been stronger to innovation, as evidenced by the fact that over the last 3 years, we have increased our basic R&D expenditures by over 40%, or compound annual growth rate of nearly 13%. We are investing for the short, medium and long term. We are a commercial enterprise that continuous to focus on finding ways to enhance our returns to provide more value to our shareholders, and we have made continued progress regarding our third strategic pillar, maximizing our portfolio.","More specifically, we concluded the exit of $60 million of low-margin sales activities in Flavors over the past 6 quarters, which further enhanced our consolidated margins by over 40 basis points. We have enhanced many internal process disciplines, such as our cost to serve and our go-to market models that make our processes more efficient and better align our resources with commercial opportunities.","Economic Profit continues to expand within the organization and continues to provide a foundation for our disciplined approach to both investment and evaluation of business progress. Today, we believe our return on invested capital is the highest in the industry at 18.3%. And importantly, we improved the economic profit profile of our portfolio. Today, 94% of our portfolio is now economically neutral or positive, versus 65% in 2010.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Nicolas Mirzayantz, our Group President of Fragrances.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Thank you, Doug. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. 2013 was a strong year for Fragrance, building on the developing momentum we achieved in the second half of 2012. Fragrance delivered solid top line growth in every quarter due to a consistently high level of growth from new business wins, combined with lower erosion on the base business. We increased colleagues' participation with global, as well as regional customers. We ended the year with record levels of revenue, we improved our product portfolio and we are better positioned for future growth.","Turning to fourth quarter results. The Fragrance business unit achieved strong local currency growth of 7%, which was on top of the 13% growth achieved in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our Fragrance Compound business had local currency growth of 9%, which more than offset the decline of 3% in Ingredients due to the transition of some volume from Ingredients to Compounds. Excluding the transition, Ingredients would have been positive for the second consecutive quarter. We are seeing continued signs of stabilization in our Fragrance Ingredient business and believe the steps we have taken to reduce costs, while increasing the specialty segment of that portfolio, will improve our company disposition and increase our win rate in Fragrance Compounds.","Fragrance Compounds growth of 9% in this quarter is on top of the 15% growth seen in the year-ago quarter and was supported by a strong level of new wins in every category and every region. Our new business wins in 2013 are testament to our innovation and go-to-market capabilities and show good collaboration on the part of our consumer insight, sales and creative teams. The emerging markets continued to be a strong growth driver and accounted for 52% of Fragrance Compounds sales. This market grew at 9% and accounted for approximately 60% of the growth in the Fragrance business this quarter.","In Fragrance Compounds, all regions had a very strong momentum. Greater Asia at 16% growth, followed by EAME with an 11% growth, Latin America grew by 7%, totaling a 27% growth in the prior year, and North America also experienced positive growth.","Fine and Beauty Care had growth of 9% on top of 17% in the prior-year quarter, with 24% growth in EAME and 12% growth in Greater Asia. The fastest-growing subcategory was Fine Fragrance, led by double-digit growth in EAME. Growth of 10% in Functional Fragrance, on top of 10% growth in the prior-year quarter, was driven by double-digit growth in Fabric Care. Home Care and Personal Wash had solid growth, supported by strong results in Latin America and North America.","Turning to Fragrance Ingredients. We've made a lot of progress this year in reshaping our portfolio and reorienting the business for growth. Earlier in the year, we made the announcement that we will close our Augusta manufacturing facility. We have also made progress with our investment with our biotech partner, Amyris, reaching milestones faster than originally expected. In mid-January, we announced the acquisition of Aromor, which has been a supplier to IFF of specialty ingredients over the past several years. And I will provide additional insights on Aromor at the end of my presentation. On a full-year basis, Fragrance revenues grew 6% on both a reported and local currency basis.","Fragrance Compounds grew by 8%, equally balanced between Fine and Beauty Care and Functional Fragrance due to our creation capabilities, combined with our consumer insights and research and development teams.","Fine and Beauty Care grew 8%, with growth in every subcategory. Both Fine Fragrance and Hair had high single-digit growth due to strong growth in the emerging markets. Toiletries also had solid growth due to strong growth in the emerging market as well. Functional Fragrance grew by 8% in large part due to double-digit growth in Fabric Care, which was supported by our encapsulation technology. The momentum in Ingredients has improved throughout the year, and we believe we have stabilized the business. All of the softness in the top line in the second half of 2013 was due to the transition of some volume from Ingredients to Compounds. If we exclude this volume, Ingredients would have seen positive growth in the second half of the year and flat for the full year.","Turning to profitability. The 7% sales growth and combined with gross margin improvements due to both the net benefit of pricing versus input costs, as well as there are many strategic and productivity initiative, translated to operating profit growth of 16%, or $9 million. The improved profitability more than offset increased R&D and incentive compensation expenses. Our segment profit as, a percent of sales, increased 110 basis points over the prior year and was driven by moderating input costs, but still remaining ahead of elevated levels, productivity initiatives and volume and manufacturing leverage.","Turning to the full year. Fragrance local currency sales growth of 6%, when combined with gross margin improvement and cost discipline, resulted in segment profit growth of 19% to $283 million. The segment profit, as a percent of sales, increased 200 basis points from 16.5% to 18.5%, as a result of the same factors that partially impacted Q4 results.","Looking ahead, on the heels of a very strong Q4, we expect to see growth more in line with our long-term targets and more moderate than our growth in the fourth quarter. Although our Ingredients business has turned the corner and we're expecting positive growth in Q1, we're expecting the Fragrance Compound growth to be more moderate than our growth in the fourth quarter. Let's say we are tightly controlling our costs and expect to see operating cost improvement. In the last 6 months, we introduced 3 new substance and fragrance molecules through our creative teams, and we're ending the year with a strong pipeline of new ingredients.","Before turning the call over to Hernan Vaisman, I wanted to provide some additional insights on our recently announced acquisition. As you may know, on January 16, 2014, we announced the acquisition of Aromor, a privately held manufacturer and marketer of complex specialty ingredients. We have been buying specialty ingredients from Aromor for many years. The acquisition brings numerous benefits to IFF. We have been evaluating our Ingredients business and looking to augment the specialty segment of our portfolio. Aromor's portfolio of specialty molecule is very complementary to our portfolio. At the same time, it strengthens the portfolio and position us for stronger and more profitable growth in Fragrance Compounds.","Aromor has a very strong organization of world-class chemists, they have strong expertise and knowledge and know-how, and we will be investing in their capabilities for future growth. Collectively, we will be able to provide Aromor specialty ingredients to our perfumers who will have an extended palette of cost-advantage molecule, which will enable them to increase our win rates.","Aromor has a strong financial profile. They have been growing quickly to $35 million of pro forma sales in 2013. They will, therefore, add a percentage point of growth to our 2004 Q revenue growth. Due to the specialty nature of their portfolio, their EBITDA margins are in line with our own and are expected to be accretive to our EPS in 2014. We are excited to welcome the entire Aromor team to IFF, and we are looking forward to be working with them to strengthen our Ingredient platforms. We are very pleased to announce this transaction and believe it will be value-enhancing to our Fragrance Compound business and will strengthen our portfolio of and leadership in Fragrance Ingredients.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Hernan Vaisman, our Group President of Flavors.","Hernan Vaisman","Thank you, Nicolas. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone.","Flavors finished the year strong with another solid quarter of positive growth of 7%. This marks our 32nd consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth and our fourth consecutive year of growth in the range of 6% to 9%. Emerging markets, up double-digits, made the biggest contribution to our growth and accounted for 53% of total sales in the fourth quarter. This growth was led by Latin America, which I will discuss in a minute.","Sales growth benefited both from a solid level of new business wins, as well as sales growth from existing businesses. This quarter, there was no material impact on our sales related to the exit of low-margin sales activities.","Looking at our growth on a regional basis. Latin America had a strong double-digit growth of 19%; EAME grew by 13%; and Greater Asia, our largest region, increased by 9%. The growth from these regions more than offset a decline in North America of 8%, in part to strong new launches last year in Beverage and very challenging comparable of 15% like-for-like growth in Q4 2012.","We are very pleased with our strong performance in Latin America this quarter, where we experienced new business wins in the Beverage and Sweet, primarily driven by our delivery systems, our proprietary FlavorFit portfolio of health and wellness solutions and new molecules from our Citrus platform. On a category basis, all our category experienced growth. Savory, Beverage and Sweet all experienced mid- to high-single digit growth, and Dairy, although not as high, was positive. We continue to work with all our customers to provide creative solutions that result in long-lasting business for IFF. Customers appreciate our creative expertise and ability to translate trends into winning products.","Turning to the full year. Our local currency sales growth was 4%, and excluding the impact of the exit of low-margin sales activities, our full year growth was 6%. This year, we exited approximately $25 million of low-margin business, resulting in an improvement to our portfolio and a 40-basis-point impact to our margins.","Emerging market had growth of approximately 9%, or nearly twice the level of the developed markets, which has solid growth of approximately 5%, excluding the exit of low-margin sales activities. The emerging markets made the biggest contribution to our 2013 growth, especially our customers in China, Indonesia, Argentina and Thailand. The contribution to growth in these markets validates our decision to build capacity in this important markets, which continue to provide a runway for growth for many years to come.","Over the past year, we successfully opened a new state-of-the-art facility in Guangzhou, China. We continue to expand our facility in Gebze, Turkey, and announced a $50 million investment in the new manufacturing and creative facilities in Indonesia. This investment express the company's commitment to provide innovative product solutions and ensure rapid supply to our customers in this market. And we are committed to further expanding our strong presence and capabilities in emerging markets. That said, we believe the potential in the developed markets for Flavors is just as high, if not higher, than the emerging markets. We are working with our customers in these more mature markets to provide them with products that will appeal to their consumers, such as our expanded FlavorFit portfolio that provides innovative approaches to address the challenges of health and wellness trends.","During the year, we experienced a consistent and strong level of new business wins, reflecting the strong level of innovation in the business. In order to train the next generation of Flavors, we also launched our Flavor School [ph].","Turning towards profitability. Flavors gross margins continued to expand due to the net impact of price versus input costs and other strategic initiatives. When combined with the volume gains this quarter, it resulted in 12% segment operating profit growth, or $8 million to $17 million. Our segment profit margin increased 130 basis points to 20.3%, up from 19% in the prior year quarter.","Turning to the full year. The gross margin expansion was due to the positive impact on margin of the exit low-margin sales activities and the net impact of price to input costs, combined with other strategic initiatives to reduce costs. The increased gross margin more than offset increases related to R&D investment and higher incentive compensation expense related to our full year performance. On a full year, our segment profit margin was at an all-time high of 22.7%, up 110 basis points from 21.6 in the prior year. Our segment profit totaled $324 million versus $298 million in the prior year, or an increase of 9%. The improved segment profits reflect strong volume growth, combined with the product gross margin expansion, which more than offset investment in R&D and increase in incentive compensation expenses.","In short, 2013 was a year of strong performance while we also put plans in place to strengthen the Flavors organization for the future. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2014, we expect our local currency sales growth to be more moderate versus Q4 and more in line with our long-term targets.","I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman, our CFO.","Kevin C. Berryman","Thank you, Hernan, and good morning, good afternoon, everyone, on a snowy New York day. Turning to the fourth quarter, I'd like to view some key metrics and provide you with perspective on the importance of each.","Our local currency sales growth in the fourth quarter was 7%, following 8% growth in the fourth quarter of 2012. On our third quarter earnings call, you might recall we were more cautious in tone, given the challenging comparison to the fourth quarter of 2012 when we delivered 15% growth in Fragrance Compounds and 7% like-for-like growth in Flavors. This quarter's growth of 7%, on top of 10% like-for-like growth in the prior year, speaks to many important things about IFF, not the least of which is our ability to harness the power of our creative, sales and development teams to deliver products that customers value.","The emerging markets continue to be a strong growth driver and it's important to maintain perspective on the strengths of these markets, given the growth in the consumer market and the strength of the demand for products, which are rapidly becoming part of their emerging, more consumer-oriented lifestyles.","Our margins expanded an additional 160 basis points in the quarter, based on moderation in input costs, combined with the strength of our strategic initiatives. I will touch on this later, as we still face an overall headwind to our margins due to the strong inflationary environment we faced in 2011 and 2012.","The margin expansion and volume gains resulted in adjusted operating profit growth of 13%, or $13 million, on top of 9% growth in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our adjusted EPS improves 11% this quarter on top of 11% growth in 2012.","I've shown this slide before, and I think it's important because this shows our continued progress in capturing the growth in the emerging markets. A key component of our growth plan is to capture the benefits of the wealth creation that's occurring in the fast-growing emerging markets. The slide highlights our increasing strength in the emerging markets over the last 3 years. Our percentage of sales in the emerging markets has increased from 44% in Q1 2010 to 50% in the fourth quarter of 2013. We believe our index to the emerging markets is the highest in our industry and is reflected in our strong organic growth rates.","Over the last 3 years, our compound annual growth rate in the emerging markets is nearly 9%, and we believe that the emerging market opportunity remains largely intact given the long-term trends of 1 billion-plus new consumers entering the market to purchase consumer packaged goods for the first time.","Turning to the next slide, I have also shown this one before, which provides insight to our gross margin progression in light of historically high input cost increases. This slide demonstrates that even though we are seeing margin gains of 210 basis points in 2013, the net impact of historical rising input cost on our margins continues to be a headwind. If we look at the period full year 2010 to full year 2013, you will see the factors that are leading to the gross margin improvement between the 2 years. We chose the full year of 2010 since that is the last comparable full year period prior to the large increase in input costs that we saw and experienced in 2011 and 2012.","Over the 3-year period, the net impact of pricing and input cost has been a negative 130 basis points on our gross margins, as evidenced by the red bar. As you know, we proactively worked with customers to implement pricing increases to reduce the strong pressure from these higher input costs and limit the inflationary pressure to the 130 basis points noted on the slide.","However, the importance of the execution of our strategy, where we adopt numerous measures to improve our margins, including the exit of low-margin sales activities, cost-savings initiatives, innovation enhancements, manufacturing efficiencies and restructuring and other gross margin improvement efforts, cannot be overstated. These strategic improvements had a 340-basis-point improvement positive impact on our margins over the 3-year period, as shown by the green bar on the chart. This more than offset the negative 130-basis-point reduction from the net impact of input costs and pricing.","Importantly, going forward into 2014, we are seeing some input costs increasing, which will require us to have selective and targeted discussions with some customers regarding price increases.","Turning to our RSA costs. Our adjusted RSA, as a percent of sales, increased 70 basis points from 27.6% to 28.3% of sales. The higher RSA reflects additional incentive compensation provisions related to our strong performance in 2013 and other miscellaneous costs, including acquisition-related costs of Aromor. For the second year in a row, our strong performance in Q4 triggered higher incentive accruals to our AIP program, and as a result, we have higher provisions in Q4 2013 versus Q4 2012.","Other incremental costs we incurred in the fourth quarter are related to nonstructural expenses that add approximately $5 million to $6 million to fourth quarter RSA costs. We also incurred higher R&D expenses this quarter, related to our investments in innovation. R&D increased 13% year-over-year and, as a percent of sales, increased to 9.7% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2013, up from 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012. If we're to exclude these non-structural costs and additional incentive compensation accruals from RSA, then our sales and administrative costs would have increased more in line with inflation, and this would have resulted in our RSA, as a percent of sales, falling versus the year-ago quarter.","Again, we remain disciplined in our approach to spending, and going forward, cost discipline will be a continued focus while we strategically invest in research and development and other business development opportunities.","A foreign currency translation this quarter had a minimal impact on our reported sales. The more limited volatility in the euro-dollar exchange rate, combined with hedging activities with the euro, has resulted in foreign currency impacts having an insignificant impact on our operating profit results. The operating impact on our full year results was also muted. For 2014, we are nearly 80% hedged against the euro at levels that approximate $1.32 per euro -- euro per dollar, effectively consistent with the average exchange rate levels for the full year 2013. At current rates, the operating impacts on our 2014 results is expected to continue to be benign.","Given the recent volatility we have seen in some emerging market currencies, I would like to remind those on the call about our emerging market foreign currency profile. As you know, IFF sales into emerging markets are significant. Importantly, while 50% of our sales are through the emerging markets, a significant portion of these are not subject to foreign exchange risk to the extent that you might imagine. More specifically, much of our sales in the emerging markets are subject to commercial arrangements that significantly reduce the currency volatility on our results.","Specifically, various commercial terms allow us to better align our foreign exchange exposure on sales with developed market currencies or harder currencies such as the euro or U.S. dollar. Therefore, as you can see in this chart, of the 50% of our sales that are to the emerging markets, approximately 2\/3 are aligned with U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, leaving less than 1\/3 that are fully exposed to local currency volatility.","Turning to our cash flow. As you know, our business is very cash-generative, and we are pleased with our improved operating cash flow performance this year. For 2013, our operating cash flow was $408 million, or 13.8% of sales, versus $324 million, or 11.5%, of sales in 2012.","There are some large items impacting our comparability that I would like to discuss. First, last year, we had a cash outflow of $105.5 million related to our Spanish income tax settlement for the 2004 to 2010 years. This outflow was included in our 2012 full year number; number two, in 2013, the company made $30 million of contributions to our qualified U.S. pension plans, or an incremental $15 million versus normal levels; and finally, number three, also in 2013, we made $33 million in payments related to Spanish tax assessments for the 2010 to -- excuse me, 2002 and 2011 tax years. If we exclude these items to make the year-over-year comparison more representative, then our cash flow would have improved from $430 million to $456 million, or an increase of 6%.","Turning to our capital structure. We are making progress on our share buyback program. Through the end of the year, we repurchased approximately 656,000 shares at an average price of $78 per share. We spent approximately $51 million on this effort, meeting our expectations for the year. And given current market dynamics, we would expect to spend a minimum $75 million in share repurchases in 2014, effectively offsetting any share count pre-associated with option grants.","Our current quarterly payment dividend of $0.39 per quarter based on our 2013 net income provides a payout ratio of approximately 35%. And this is versus a payout ratio of 30% associated with our previous quarterly dividend of $0.34, which we had at the beginning of the year. Per our normal process, our evaluation of an increase in our quarterly dividend level will be completed during the third quarter of this year.","Turning to our long-term financial targets. These targets, as you know, provide our view on the expected growth of our business for 3 key metrics. Our targets call for 4% to 6% local currency sales growth, 7% to 9% adjusted operating profit growth and 10-plus percent adjusted EPS growth. I would like to benchmark our actual performance on a 5-year, 3-year and 1-year basis against these targets.","First, looking at our local currency sales growth, our long-term targets call for growth of 4% to 6%. If we look at our 5-year compound annual growth rate, our local currency growth was 5%. On a 3-year basis, we experienced growth of 4%, and on a 1-year basis, our growth was 5%, reflecting our strong performance in 2013. It is also important to remember that on a like-for-like basis, our growth would have been 6% in 2013.","We have met our local currency sales growth targets on a compounded 5-, 3-, and 1-year basis. And importantly, our growth from new wins in 2013 was at a 5-year high, which is a good foundation of that growth that we saw this past year.","Turning to our adjusted operating profit growth. Our long-term growth targets call for adjusted operating profit growth of 7% to 9%. On a 5-year basis, our compound annual growth rate was 8%. On a 3-year basis, it was 8%. And looking at our 1-year growth, we achieved adjusted operating profit growth of 11% in 2013.","Consistent with our performance against our local currency sales growth target, we have met our adjusted OP growth targets on a compounded 5-, 3- and 1-year basis. For 2013, there was a clear acceleration in our profit growth.","Finally, turning to our adjusted EPS growth targets. On a 5-year basis, we achieved a compound annual growth rate of 10%. On a 3-year basis, it was also 10%. And for the full year 2013, we achieved growth of 12%. And again, we have met our adjusted EPS growth targets on a compounded 5-, 3- and 1-year basis.","Importantly, we have met all of these objectives while remaining committed to our investment in innovation with R&D expenses nearing 9% for the full year 2013 and 9.7% in the fourth quarter.","Let me now turn it over to Doug to provide some comments regarding our 2014 outlook.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Kevin, Hernan and Nicolas for the remarks on the company's performance.","2013 was a very exciting year for us as we continued to execute on our 3-pillar strategy while investing in the future growth and profitability of the company. We are pleased with the momentum on both sides of the business and believe that we are well positioned for growth due to the many steps we have taken to augment our profitability and strengthen the company.","We are expecting continued success in 2014. We have the right teams in place to continue to provide customers with superior customized products that deliver improved performance to their consumers.","We expect to deliver local currency growth in the range of 5% to 7%, reflecting the addition of Aromor, continued new business wins and volume growth in the faster growing and more mature markets. This includes our organic growth rate range of 4% to 6% with an additional point of growth associated with our acquisition of Aromor.","We also expect to see strong levels of adjusted profit and earnings per share growth in 2014 as our business continues to see top line and operating momentum and we benefit from the reset of our expected incentive-based compensation expense to a 100% target level in 2014. As a result, operating profit growth is expected to be up double digits with EPS seeing commensurate strong improvement.","Regarding our first quarter of 2014, as Nicolas and Hernan pointed out, we expect more moderate -- modest top line growth in Q1 following a strong Q4 and, hence, performance more aligned with our long-term growth rates in Q1. Regarding EPS, we expect a muted level of growth through the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2014, which was reinstated in Q1 2013. Regardless of these impacts in Q1, we believe our full year outlook is achievable.","I thought I would wrap up with a brief summary of our investment theses. We partner with the world's leading global consumer companies. Our flavors and fragrances are the key component in the world's finest perfumes and best known consumer brands and are often the key reason behind a consumer's purchase decision. Yet our products only contribute 1% to 4% of the overall cost of a finished product, creating a great value proposition for our customers.","We are geographically diversified. Our focus on the fast-growing emerging markets is not new. We have had footholds in many of the developing markets, such as India, for more than 50 years. As our customers in the emerging markets grow their businesses, they have the ability to leverage our long-standing presence and our extensive market knowledge to help drive growth in their brands.","The company generates healthy cash flows, which allow us to reinvest back into the business as we strive to reallocate resources towards higher return activities while still maintaining financial flexibility and returning capital to shareholders. Lastly, we have an experienced and a talented employee base whose dedication and commitment drive the company forward in line with their strategic plans.","In conclusion, we are very well positioned in the market for continued success. Our investments in Asia and EAME are proceeding as planned and are vital to sustaining our long-term growth and delivering the best service to our customers. Our strong growth reflects the ability of our people to collaborate effectively and leverage our R&D, creative offering and geographic footprint to create solutions for our customers.","And finally, we were able to achieve all of this through the strengths of our business model and the expertise of our people. This year, we are celebrating our 125th anniversary at IFF. Our employees continue to drive our success by creating exceptional products and providing superior service. We share this milestone with our customers, our partners and our shareholders.","I thank you for your participation this morning. I will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the split between pricing mix or contribution from pricing mix in the fourth quarter, and then also get a sense of expectations for contribution in 2014 to input costs. I hear what you said. I know one of your largest competitors they talk about also seeing or having some expectations for pricing. So maybe just give us a bit of -- a sense of how that worked out in 2014, and then just what the housekeeping numbers were in third -- '14 -- '13.","Kevin C. Berryman","Mark, this is Kevin. I'll take a stab. I will tell you that pricing in 2013 was muted, certainly in the back half of the year especially. So you can consider that the growth dynamic associated with Q3 and Q4 was largely a result of our strong new wins. You heard the mention that our 2013 year, as it relates to growth from new wins, was a record. So very, very strong level of performance in 2013. For 2014, we are seeing selective areas where input costs are increasing, and we would expect to have targeted and selective discussions with customers to have pricing, but we don't see that as being a material dynamic in the overall kind of picture for our growth in 2014. Overall, we don't see a significant acceleration in our input costs, but we see -- are seeing some specific ones that we're going to need to take some pricing actions on.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one follow-up. Nonstructural expenses in RSA, what are those? And what was -- or how should we think about that going forward?","Kevin C. Berryman","Well, we specifically called it out, Mark, because we don't expect that those are going to be seen to ultimately recur on an ongoing basis. But effectively, we have some costs associated with our acquisition of Aromor. That's clearly in the Q4 numbers. We had some legal project costs. We had some tax costs that we incurred relative to our emerging market presences. So if you look at those kind of items that -- well, making up the bulk of those, clearly the call-out is to suggest that we shouldn't necessarily see those levels of expenses going forward in Q4 2014.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So just to be clear, so that is in the adjusted numbers in the fourth quarter then?","Kevin C. Berryman","Yes, it is.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to know if you guys can, one, give us any news that you're at or ahead of schedule on all of your partnerships. Do you have an update on Evolva and vanilla -- vanillin being available to your flavorists and when that starts to impact flavor business trends. And then also just on Aromor, Nicolas, you talked a little bit more about sort of existing portfolio and why it was interesting but didn't really mention much the -- anything specific or -- maybe to put in layman's terms to the R&D capabilities that, that business brings in? But I think there were some things in the press release or whatever you got on Aromor so far that suggests there's something a little bit more interesting there, and I'd love to hear your perspective on that.","Hernan Vaisman","It's Hernan here. Regarding the natural vanillin, as I mentioned in the previous call, I mean, we just finish this quarter, in fact in January 1, is scaled up. It was successful. Now the next step is to get these materials throughout all the creation centers in the world in order to get the flavorist, application teams familiar with it. And we plan to start going to present to customers and show it in the markets in the second part of the year. So we expect to get the first, I mean, revenues coming from these initiatives by the end of this year.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","It's Nicolas. Regarding Aromor, without going into the specific, well, the key takeaway is that first of all, in terms of capabilities, they have complementary capabilities to ours. And therefore, our ability to develop new molecule is strengthened when you put our team and their team, number one. The number two is it's a complementary portfolio. There is no overlap in our portfolio of ingredients. So it's very incremental to us, both for our external sales of ingredient, but, most importantly, they are really critical ingredients I -- in fact specialty ingredients for perfumers to use in their creation. We know these ingredients very well because we are the -- a partner to Aromor for a very long time. So our perfumers know these ingredients very well and can use them rapidly at a higher level in their new creations moving forward.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a bigger question on R&D spending. Is it -- is this the right way to think about it? I know there's obviously a payback as you spend. But just curious, do you think there's sort of a mass level where you'd want to be spending as a percentage of sales? Or is it just as long as gross margins are expanding from some of your productivity and mix initiatives, that we just should always think about money going back into R&D just as we'd see your customers always spending back into their advertising budget. Is that sort of the right way to think about the financial model long term?","Douglas D. Tough","Lauren, I think it's partly right. I mean, I think the analogy to investing in your business with advertising is a good one. We've certainly been over 8%, but I don't think it's as simple as just will it expand gross margin. There's a pretty disciplined approach within both the business units in concert with R&D and another units in the company that takes a look at the size of the price, the likelihood of getting the margin, the cost and use, the likelihood of regulatory approval, the time required and so on. So there are a number of factors that go into it. Now we evaluate all the projects that are on the docket with a view to which ones we think we can fund. And I'll have to say that where we are now in the disciplined approach that's really been brought to bear by a number of constituents in the company helps us understand where we think there's a really good return. So I'm very happy with where we are at our investment level. Clearly, if we have the opportunity to enhance that, we can do so. But the projects all go through a pretty disciplined rigor to be approved, and so we're not -- we're certainly not underspending but, frankly, nor do I see us overspending at this point. And we have quarterly reviews which document the probability, likelihood and the expected returns we're going to get.","Kevin C. Berryman","Lauren, just one additional comment.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes.","Kevin C. Berryman","This is Kevin. We did have an accelerated milestone payment for Amyris in the fourth quarter. So that bumped up the fourth quarter numbers specifically higher than what would probably be determined to be kind of an ongoing level. So you should be aware of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Sison from KeyBanc Capital.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You did a nice job generating good margin expansion in the strategic initiatives. Clearly, you're going to have some momentum in 2014. Can you just help us maybe get a feel of how much improvement you can see next year? And what are the areas that will drive that?","Kevin C. Berryman","I think if you go back -- let's start from the foundation of what our 3-pillar strategy is. And obviously, the footprint, the -- leveraging the geographic footprint, strengthening our innovation and managing the portfolio are all our -- are opportunities that will allow us to continue to hopefully drive our gross margin progress going forward. So it's part of our strategic vision that, that happens. Having said all of that, Mike, we saw some great advancements in 2013. We would not expect to have that same level of improvement in 2014. So I think we're going to be looking at a more normalized level of gross margin improvement in 2014. And of course, that will require us to take some pricing actions into those specific areas where we're seeing some acceleration in input costs for our respective businesses. And I think that at the end of the day, there's an inherent dynamic relative to the innovation that the teams are bringing to their portfolios, which should afford us gross margin enhancement over the long haul. And so that's a critical part of our strategy. We still think that, that strategic pillar is well in place, and that is our intent, to try and drive that. But it will be at levels that are less robust in 2014 than in 2013 in terms of level of improvement.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Doug, you talked about your return on capital being at very industry level -- industry high levels. That's certainly a great level to be at. But is there a way to deploy that capital a little bit more aggressively to maybe enhance growth? Or you start to get worried when your returns are too high, right, in terms of being able to generate growth. Any thoughts there and maybe using your balance sheet more aggressively, too, to add more growth to the company?","Douglas D. Tough","Certainly, Mike. We look at a number of ways that we might be able to attack that issue. And we publicly stated certainly that the focus will be on continued growth and investment. But certainly, the balance sheet and the opportunities for capital, we look at M&A-type opportunities. We've done a small recent deal with Aromor. The company's aspirations would be greater than that, but they will also be well disciplined in the context of the financial rigor that M&A has to bring. Certainly, other capital issues, whether they're buybacks and so on, we've done small ones. But I'd say the overall earning objective here is how can we get growth, that profitable growth. So we hope we have more M&A opportunities ahead of us, and -- that would be deploying the capital.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Of the 5.8% sales growth that you reported in 2013, was more than half of that mix or price mix?","Kevin C. Berryman","No. In 2013, no.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes.","Kevin C. Berryman","It was largely associated with new wins associated with the efforts by the BUs in driving innovation into the portfolio. So it's largely volume related. Now some of that is mix because you might have innovation that brings mix benefits to it. But we don't break that out necessarily separately. So think about it as volume-mix driven.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, because the puzzle is your cost of goods sold went up $15 million or less than 1%. And if your volume on a ratable basis, maybe your cost of goods sold was flat, raw materials would have gone up, I don't know, $65 million. And even with cost initiatives, it seems difficult to pull that much out. So there must be a very large mix benefit in 2013. Is that right or no? Or why is the growth in cost of goods sold so slow?","Kevin C. Berryman","I think there's a variety of factors that are driving that. Certainly, the strategic initiatives that we talk about a lot, Jeff, are a driver to that. And if you think about the exit of the low-margin Flavors activity, that's worth probably 80-plus basis points to Flavors, 40-plus basis points to the company over that period of time. You have the mix benefits of our innovation coming out of that higher margin levels. We did -- we're able to realize a moderating level of input costs. All of those things add up to something that looks very attractive from a margin progressive. And we think that the thesis underlying that strategic kind of plank of innovation and margin enhancement is certainly going to play forward as well. There was also, and I would say this especially in Fragrance in 2013, a lot of productivity enhancements as well, which related to our ability to drive a reduction in ingredients that support those new opportunities of wins. As well, you know that Nicolas and his team have done some restructuring efforts over time to ultimately drive incremental margins as well. So a broad array of efforts, and it will always continue to be a broad array of efforts because we need to be efficient, productive and innovative in terms of driving the business going forward.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. And then lastly, your Latin American results were very, very strong for the second successive year, and I imagine that, that's largely Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. Were there differences in the growth rates in those 3 countries? Or were they smoother? And in general, for many companies, the North American growth, with the growth in the economy, is really the strongest element. But for you, especially in South America, you've grown especially well with very, very weak economies. Can you talk about that feature?","Hernan Vaisman","Okay, I'll take a stab, and it's Hernan here. You're right. I see the type of situation when you read the newspapers on the real economy there, that they are really -- almost all economies except Mexico and Brazil [ph], mainly, Argentina and Brazil. And really, we're performing really, really well, and this is basically from what I mentioned before, the high level of new wins that they have there in this area. In some countries, for example, you can think that Argentina we will never grow and there's a bit of pressure on this country, well, our growth is more on the 20%. And this is really coming from the new wins. So we -- usually, you can say that the economies and the growth of our business should be somewhere correlated. But we stated that the correlation will be a big difference between whether the country will grow and when you're winning by yourself. Organically, actually, we're not growing, but our new wins there should accelerate the growth in that region. And your question is almost in all countries, in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","It's Nicolas here. Very similar to what Hernan was saying, we -- well, we've been saying that first of all, emerging markets, especially in Latin America, is that -- where we had a leading position for many decades already. So it speaks to not only the strengths of our portfolio, the strengths of the relationship, very high market share, very, very strong consumer insight and really understanding what is driving consumer preference. So we engage on a position of strength and knowledge and expertise, which is augmented by our innovation pipeline. And the growth was really driven by new wins. So very, very strong growth for the portfolio and a very strong growth last year. Yes, the economy is where we're seeing some signs. We have to monitor the situation. But at least the pipeline of introduction for the Q4 was very strong, and we will have to keep monitoring as the situation progress. And as far as countries are concerned, very, very strong growth in Brazil and Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, really driving the growth in Latin America.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rohini Nair from Deutsche Bank.","Rohini Nair - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to touch on Fragrances. And I'm wondering whether you can give us a bit more color around what you're seeing there. Functional seems to be doing pretty well uniformly across your markets. Fine fragrance growth also good but maybe limited to certain regions. So if you could address those dynamics. And then along with that, do you have a sense that you may be benefiting from new product wins maybe more so than your competitors?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","It's Nicolas here. First of all, I would like to provide a perspective. There's 2 components to take into account. First, comp versus last year. So if you take here North America [indiscernible] minus 6, but it was on the heel of plus 17%, which was significant growth and far higher than what the market was experiencing. So I think that the comp is playing an element. And then if you look at our growth of 24% in the EAME, one thing that is important to take into consideration is a large majority of our customers, while European based, are manufacturing in Europe for the rest of the world. So probably definitely, as we know, part of the 27% growth in Europe, which is far above the market growth, is also then being exported to the U.S., but we cannot record it as U.S.-based sales. So it's difficult for us to track. But definitely, the 24% in Europe were from very strong -- new wins, a pipeline that are shipped in different parts of the world. And then there are things about Latin America. Minus 1. I just would like to remind everyone that last year, in Q4, we grew 59%, which is also very far in excess of what the market was going. So if you look at the 2-year average, it's still a double-digit growth and above the market growth.","Rohini Nair - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. And just to follow up on that, if we think about profitability on the Fragrance side, it seems that with the increased specialization you're getting from Aromor, your ingredients rationalization, you have good opportunity for improvement over time. So I just want to get a sense of how you may be thinking about those margins longer term, whether we might eventually see those margins approaching the level of Flavors at some point.","Kevin C. Berryman","It's Kevin. I'll take a crack at that. Look, I think that certainly, both of our business units are very strongly economically profitable, and both represent fantastic growth opportunities. We do think that there were some significant opportunities to enhance economic profit within the context of the Fragrance business. And you can see, given their margin profile, well, some of that improvement is coming to light. Whether or not we openly get to a level where those 2 businesses are equal in terms of margins, we don't think about it that way necessarily, but we do believe they both represent very, very strong opportunities to have profitable growth. And specifically, because of the things you called out in your question, there are some things which will afford us perhaps an ability to further reduce the difference between the 2 margin profiles of the business units. And of course, depending upon, at the end of the day, our ability to drive innovation into our portfolios, that will ultimately determine where we fall out in terms of margin profiles in my mind.","Douglas D. Tough","And certainly, Aromor brings us strength with the opportunity to use those molecules. You can see, we're, using more of them in order to win new businesses will give us perhaps long-term margin improvement, not necessarily short term. But I'd echo what Kevin said, both businesses are attractive. But while we look at the comparisons to each, the real comparison needs to be within the BU and the comparisons to their competitors and what we need to do to win against competitors, not to win against each other. But both are attractive, and we pointed that out both at the Investor Day and in the overall financial results.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Janney.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask specifically, just having gotten off a few of the CPG calls, specifically as it relates to Flavors, do you -- or is there any concern about in -- a slowdown in developing markets affecting innovation plans? And I know you made some comments about this, but just more detailed specifically about how specific customers, like Monde at least, talked about a little bit less spending in emerging market this year. If you had a customer that was in that situation, how does that affect your business? On what kind of lag? And are you seeing any kind of that activity right now even upstream from what you might be feeling directly at the revenue line?","Hernan Vaisman","Thank you for the question. I just came -- it's Hernan here. I just came from Asia, and it's been a long trip there. And as I was mentioning last call, we saw some slowdown in India. I mean, definitely, the economic situation is impacting the overall of the business. But I just came and I -- even now, the sentiment is, in some ways, different. I mean, they see may see some, they say, light at the end of the tunnel by the second [ph]. So our real concern in the third and fourth quarter was India. We see some improvement. Having said all that, I mean, the incentive is clear. I mean, the pace of growth that they used to have, I mean, the developing markets in Asia, the one we're focusing, is different. I mean, when we talk about 2 or 3 years ago, the growth was almost in the double digits, and now you're talking in China 10%, India 6%. So there is a kind of slowdown there. Having said that, the potential is huge. I mean, we've got so many consumers, they -- buying and getting the new cars. So the [indiscernible] the timing [indiscernible]. How it's impacting, I mean, the customers, yes, in some customers that's really impacting in those markets. But again, I mean, we are not only working with one customer, we are working with many customers in one of these markets. And as I mentioned before, domestically [ph], it has a perfect correlation between a customer, between countries and our, I mean, growth. If we are really putting effort there, as what we are doing, a lot of investments, they are really creating good products, that they are really gaining the consumer preference. We can have -- even though it's kind of a lower base in growth [ph], we can have the possibility to grow faster than even of many of the customers in the countries. So in short, the pace of growth in emerging markets is down, but we have the fundamentals in place really to keep on outperforming the market growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edward Yang from Oppenheimer & Co.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just following along the other questions on emerging markets and your ability so far to decouple from some of these more troubled economies, are there any sort of canaries in the coal mine or leading indicators that you would look to, to let you know that trouble is coming down the pipe?","Douglas D. Tough","Well, I mean, I guess the comments we get from customers, the customer interaction we have is ongoing across both sides of the business. I think the one thing that -- there is what we would call defensive and offensive briefs. And the opportunities to go forward to customers with a view to understanding their portfolio and providing solutions to them and recommendations on innovation has really been well received on a number of the globals. So the leading indicators, the way you've called them, can be some softness, which Hernan has just touched upon. But the way we have to deal with that is our customers are still looking for innovation and the opportunities for innovation. And we've ramped up our game, continued to do so. So not withstanding there may be some slowing down, we've been able to counteract some of that through proactive activities. And that would continue to be the thrust that we would do.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, and thanks for that color, Doug. Kevin talked about how although you have half your sales from emerging markets, only about 1\/3 of that half is non-dollar or non-euro denominated. Do you have any plans to hedge out that remaining exposure? And in markets like Indonesia or Argentina or you hear nowadays about Venezuela having some -- putting into effect some capital controls and your ability to repatriate that cash, when you do have sales in the local markets, how frequently do you bring that cash back? Or do you wiggle in those markets?","Kevin C. Berryman","Well, to a large extent, Ed, that's -- that was a mouthful of a question because as you know, it's a complex area. But I will tell you that certainly, in general, we have a belief that we'll continue to reinvest back into the emerging markets. And so to a certain extent, there is an ability for us to use that cash by reinvesting back into the businesses. And that's good for us. That's good for our customers. That's good for their consumers ultimately. Having said that, we do need cash back in the U.S., and we look at all available means to provide opportunities to bring that back to help fund our needs on debt service, share buybacks, dividends, whatever the case may be. So we have very proactive discussions ongoing with our teams around the globe, and the treasury group does a very, very nice job of working out with our teams to facilitate our ability to get the cash where we need it and when we want it. There are challenges. Clearly, Argentina is one. There are others that I would call out, which are bigger challenges actually just because of the magnitude of it. But at the end of the day, some of our FX structures that we have in place and its ability to match our costs with our -- with the more harder currencies is a benefit to us probably versus many of our competitors and\/or customers.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on reinvestment, just finally, you talked about R&D spend. What's your expectation for CapEx for this year?","Kevin C. Berryman","We've continued to say that we're in the neighborhood of 4.5% to 5% probably until the year 2016 when we will probably start to trend down to, let's call it, a lower level, more consistent with history.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It was just a quick clarification. Hernan, when you talked about the growth rate you were seeing in Argentina north of 20% and that's attributable to new wins, I just want to be very clear that, that does not include any kind of inflationary -- material inflationary pricing.","Hernan Vaisman","You're correct, this is through dollars. It's not including any kind of inflationary impact.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","Douglas D. Tough","Well, thank you all for your participation. I think this morning, you got a sense of the -- how IFF needs to operate and the diversity of the business, whether it's the 2 business units, the regions, the categories. But managing that diversity, we think, leads to our success. We look forward to talking with you in early May for the Q1 results.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release.","With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; our Executive Vice President and CFO, Alison Cornell; our Group President of Flavors, Matthias Haeni; and our Group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz and our Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Rich O'Leary.","We will start with prepared remarks from Andreas and Alison and then the entire team will be available for any questions that you may have.","With that, I would now like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mike. I would like to start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter. I also want to take this opportunity to reiterate our Vision 2020 strategy for those of you who were not able to attend our recent Investor Day, and then provide an update on the execution of our four-pillar strategy. Once finished, I will ask Alison to review our financial results in greater detail, including the specifics on each business unit, and take us through our outlook for the balance of the year. Before opening the call to questions, I will come back to finish up with some comments.","Our financial results for the second quarter remains solid as we delivered results in line with the guidance we provided at our recent Investor Day. Currency-neutral sales improved 5%, including approximately 1 percentage point relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins, which remains strong as both businesses reported solid growth.","Adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis grew 7% as we achieved gross margin expansion that when combined with lower research, selling and admin expense led to 40 basis points improvement in currency-neutral adjusted operating profit margin.","Currency-neutral adjusted EPS improved by 10% as we gained additional leverage below the line with a lower effective tax rate and a year-over-year decrease in average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program.","As we are now at the midpoint of 2015, I felt it was appropriate to highlight our first half result. As you can see on the slide, all our key metrics are at or above our currency neutral long-term targets of 4% to 6% sales growth, 7% to 9% operating profit growth and 10% EPS growth.","Our currency neutral sales growth in the first half was strong at 6%, with 8% growth in Flavors and 4% growth in Fragrances. Adjusted operating profit grew 9% on a currency neutral basis driven by strong sales growth, benefit of productivity programs and manufacturing and RSA cost leverage. The net result was positive as our currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 11% in the first half of 2015.","At our Investor Day in June, we unveiled our Vision 2020 strategy which focuses on building greater differentiation, accelerating profitable growth and increasing shareholder value. Our strategy has four pillars, the first one, win where we compete. Our goal to achieve the number one or two market position in key markets and categories and with specific customers.","For example, the North America our home market, we have an opportunity to increase our market share. We also identified that we want to win in Africa and Middle East, a new frontier in the emerging markets, relatively small now but one of the fastest growing areas in the world. There are also categories such as Home Care and Fine Fragrances as well as several customers which I cannot name but are growing well.","The second pillar, innovating firsts. We are also looking to strengthen our position and drive differentiation and priority R&D platforms. During our strategy review process, we evaluated our investment in both existing and new platforms. The disciplined approach starts with our ability to determine the market size and based on the consumer need states.","Next, we have (5:52) our ability to deliver innovation for each opportunity, taking into account a technical likelihood of success and commercial potential.","We then conducted a full evaluation of the technology's degree of fit was in our strategy and made the decision to focus on the highest return opportunities. This includes doubling down and focusing on key initiatives such as delivery systems, modulation, new molecules and naturals across both businesses.","The third one, become our customer partner of choice, IFF has always been committed to growing our customer intimacy. In Vision 2020, our goal is to take that one step further, so that we obtain commercial excellence by further providing our customers with in-depth local consumer understanding, industry-leading innovation, outstanding service and the highest-quality product. This, in turn, should allow us to become an essential partner and ultimately lead to incremental business opportunities for our customers as well as IFF.","The fourth pillar is strengthen and expanding the portfolio. As you have seen over the past couple of months, we have actively pursued value-creating, pursue partnerships, collaboration and acquisition, both within our industry and adjacencies. These opportunities, some of which I will touch on in a moment, will allow us to tap areas of expertise beyond the walls of IFF, leading to more innovation and ultimately, additional growth.","The three enablers to the strategy include: talent and organization with investment in our people and R&D; continuous improvement with a relentless focus on finding efficiency and screening processes to invest in the business; and sustainability, strengthening sustainable practices and becoming the leader within our industry.","While we are still early in days of execution, we are seeing that our identified strategies, imperatives, are the right ones.","In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, we are seeing accelerated growth. We continue to leverage our longstanding presence in the emerging markets as they grew 7% on a currency neutral base, led by 22% increase in the Middle East and Africa, and strong growth in India, Brazil and Argentina.","We also improved our market share in North America, achieving the number two position in Flavors after successfully closing the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. Home Care, another strategic priority for us, has increased high-single digits globally on a currency neutral basis.","Delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrances continue to drive growth. The strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverages continued in the second quarter, led by our encapsulation technology in fragrances and proprietary delivery system in flavors.","In Fragrances, Fabric Care grew mid-teens on a currency neutral basis driven by our encapsulation technology. We are expanding this technology into other categories, such as Toiletries, Home Care, and Personal Wash, which all grew double digits in the second quarter. In Flavors, Latin America continued its double-digit trend for the seventh consecutive quarter, led by our proprietary delivery system.","We are very pleased with our sales of Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio improved strong double digits, an example that we are providing our customers with innovative solution that win in the marketplace with consumers.","Our continued commitment to provide our customers with in-depth consumer understanding, superior innovation, outstanding service, and highest quality product allow us to capture the growth potential of faster-growing regional accounts, most noticeably in Flavors in the second quarter which outpaced the growth of global accounts. We broadened our product offering, expanding it to more rapidly growing cosmetic actives with the recent acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics offering our customers greater option to support the strategic growth initiatives in skin and hair care. In addition, in Fragrance Ingredients, we launched and marketed Amber Xtreme, an unique and innovative olfactive ingredient that was previously captive for the exclusive use of IFF perfumers and is now available for broad use within the fragrance industry.","In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, we successfully completed the Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics acquisitions. We recently signed a partnership with Duke University, focusing on finding effective flavor modulators that are novel to our industry, and we are collaborating with University of Liverpool to enhance our delivery system capabilities and fragrances.","Before turning the call over to Alison, I wanted to provide some additional commentary on our recent acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Lucas Meyer Cosmetics is headquartered in Quebec City, Canada with operations in France and Australia. They develop, manufacture and market innovative ingredients for the cosmetics and personal care industry. Their products are designed to maintain the body's natural reactions, strengthen its defense against environmental aggressions, delay the signs of aging, and address other contemporary cosmetic challenges.","Some of the benefits of the active ingredients include; wrinkle reduction, skin firming and protection from free radicals, among others. We target Lucas Meyer as a partner as it is an award-winning company with strong proprietary portfolio and great customer relationships. We believe they have a strong fit with IFF's core competencies and strategic assets, including a similar customer base allowing us to build greater customer intimacy and drive penetration into the skin care and hair care businesses, soon expanding product offering.","Innovation is critical to both industries and we expect that we can cross leverage shared expertise and analytical research, sensory signs, and consumer insights. We also can combine IFF's industry leading natural products, LMR with Lucas Meyer Southern Cross Botanical platform. And they have a strong brand recognition, one that stands for the highest level of quality and trust.","The acquisition will allow us to enter an attractive and fast-growing market with approximately $44 million in annual sales and EBITDA margins much higher than in the flavors and fragrance industry, we believe Lucas Meyer Cosmetics is sustainable on a standalone basis, and also a great foundation for further consolidation in cosmetic actives. It's truly a great business and we are excited to have it within the IFF portfolio.","With that, I would like to turn over to Alison.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Andreas. I would like to start out by saying how happy I am to be here at IFF. It is a great time to be part of a company with the history that IFF has, especially as we embark on Vision 2020, where we are looking toward building greater differentiation, accelerating profitable growth, and increasing shareholder value.","I've been fortunate enough to speak briefly with some of you, but for those of you who I have not met, let me quickly go through my background. I joined IFF from Covance, a global drug development company with $2.5 billion in sales and 12,500 employees located in 60 countries where, as the Chief Financial Officer, I was responsible for all financial management, including financial reporting and analytics, capital allocation and strategic planning.","During my tenure, there are several areas I'm proud of, but most notably is the fact that we accelerated revenue growth, improved operating performance, streamlined processes and developed talent. These are all areas that I believe are transferrable to IFF, and I'm excited to get started.","Prior to my time at Covance, I spent 19 years with AT&T and held leadership roles of increasing responsibility, among them, leading finance for a $30 billion division as Vice President-Forecasting, Performance and Investment Analysis. I look forward to getting to know many of you over the next few months as I get acclimated to the company and support the execution of Vision 2020.","To provide a greater level of transparency, I thought I would lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to adjusted currency-neutral results, highlighting the impact of currency and showing results with and without the acquisition of Ottens.","Focusing in on the second column, Q2 was a challenging quarter from a currency perspective as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many global currencies. From a sales perspective, the translation impact represented approximately 8 percentage points.","On an adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS basis, despite our natural hedge given our considerable operations in Europe in currency hedging program, the volatility in exchange rates negatively impacted our adjusted operating profit by 8 percentage points and adjusted EPS by approximately 11 percentage points.","Including the acquisition of Ottens, which you can see in the third column, currency-neutral sales increased 5%; adjusted operating profit, 7%; and adjusted EPS, 10%. This included a lower tax rate due to higher earnings from lower tax jurisdictions, lower loss provisions, and lower repatriation costs in 2015 and the benefit of lower shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program.","The acquisition, which only included two months' worth of business, added about 1 point to the top line and was a slight benefit to adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. Excluding the acquisition, our organic business performed well and was in line with the guidance given at our June 2 Investor Day. We managed to achieve good leverage down the P&L, with sales improving 4%; adjusted operating profit up 7%, and adjusted EPS increasing 9%, all on a currency-neutral basis.","Before moving forward, I want to take a moment to note that the amortization of intangibles relating to the Ottens acquisition represented about $1.2 million in the quarter. If we added this back to understand the cash component of the business, growth from a profit and EPS perspective would have improved another 1% to 8% and 11%, respectively.","As we begin to execute Vision 2020, M&A is expected to play a larger role. Going forward, we will continue to provide analysts and investors with visibility to the amortization of intangibles of acquisitions so you have a better idea of what the actual cash generation is of the business. From an evaluation perspective, we hope it provides an understanding of the returns of any deals we pursue.","Turning to business unit performance. Flavors currency-neutral sales grew 7%, including approximately 3 percentage points relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth with the strongest results in Beverage and Savory. Greater Asia was up 6%, driven by mid-single-digit gains in Savory, Beverage and Dairy.","On a country perspective, strong growth was achieved in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. This performance more than offset a slight decline in China, where we temporarily stopped production to install new odor abatement equipment. The plants have since reopened and we continue to ramp up production, working with the government to ensure we are in full compliance. As of last week, our backlog of orders returned to normal levels, and we are either servicing all accounts from our plant in China or other facilities around the world.","Keeping with the subject of China, we have recently been notified by Chinese authorities of a compliance issue pertaining to the emission of odors in our Fragrance Ingredients plant. We are working to address these issues by making investments in additional odor abatement equipment, similar to what we did in Flavors, but expect to operate at a reduced capacity until the equipment is installed and fully operational sometime in Q4. Our full-year 2015 guidance, which I will touch on in a moment, is inclusive of this matter, both from a top-line and cost perspective, based on returning to normal production later this year.","Turning back to Flavors, in our Europe, Africa and Middle East regions, sales increased 6%, led by a double-digit gain in Savory and mid-single-digit growth in Beverage. As Andreas mentioned, the Middle East and Africa reported our highest growth, improving over 20%, driven by strong new win performance.","North America improved 5% as a result of additional sales related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and high double-digit growth in Dairy. Excluding the transaction, the core North American business was soft, as we previously communicated at our Investor Day, principally due to underlying trends with select customers.","Latin America increased 14% as all categories reported positive growth. The double-digit trend in Beverage continued for the seventh consecutive quarter, and Savory and Dairy also grew double digits as a result of strong new win performance.","Flavors currency-neutral segment profit improved approximately 1% as top-line growth, productivity and cost control initiatives were reduced by a year-over-year increase in incentive compensation expense and the inclusion of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. Q2 operating profit margin was also impacted by approximately 50 basis points or about 2 percentage points in terms of growth relating to China. Based on what we know today, we would expect a similar impact through the remainder of the year, which is included in our full-year 2015 guidance that I will discuss momentarily.","Fragrance currency-neutral sales improved 4%, led by double-digit growth in Europe, Africa and Middle East regions and a mid-single-digit improvement in Latin America driven by Consumer Fragrances. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances was up 2% as Europe, Africa and Middle East grew 17% as a result of a very strong pipeline of new wins and volume growth. This strong growth more than offset softness in Latin America where economic conditions, particularly in Brazil, have an impact on discretionary spending. While the economy is soft, we continue to see our win rates remain high, which ultimately will continue to support our market leadership position.","For the 15th consecutive quarter, Consumer Fragrances continue to grow, up 6%, led by double-digit growth in Fabric Care, thanks in large part to our strong encapsulation technology and high-single-digit growth in Home Care. In addition, Hair Care increased high-single digits as a result of new win performance.","As previously communicated, Fragrance Ingredients was weak, down 3% as we made the strategic decision not to engage in lower-margin businesses, and, more importantly, to supply and further strengthen our Fragrance Compounds business as our internal demand for our own ingredients is up double digits. It should be repeated that this weakness is primarily related to one customer whom, if we exclude, the rest of our portfolio would be up mid-single digits.","On a profit perspective, Fragrance currency-neutral segment profit improved approximately 5%, driven by volume growth, continued cost savings initiatives and continued productivity programs. Segment profit margin on a currency-neutral basis increased 20 basis points to 20.2%.","From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percentage of sales as our five-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q2 was down 120 basis points to approximately 29% of our trailing 12-month sales.","Much of our gains came from lower payables as our days payable outstanding increased 15% versus the same period a year ago. The net result of our working capital improvement and net income growth led to an $11 million increase in operating cash flow to $166 million and a 35% improvement, excluding pension contributions.","We're also making progress on our share buyback program. Year-to-date through the end of July, we have spent a total of nearly $60 million on buying back roughly 525,000 shares at a price of $112.","At our Investor Day, we provided an update on our uses of cash. We said we want it to remain an attractive investment for our shareholders for providing a consistent competitive return of cash. Leveraging our strong cash flow generation and commitment to Vision 2020, we increased our targeted cash return to shareholders to 50% to 60% of adjusted net income.","As a follow-up to that, late last week, our board of directors approved a 20% increase in dividend. This increase provides us with a more competitive yield while simultaneously balancing our growth objective. In addition, our board authorized an incremental $250 million share repurchase through the end of 2017 on top of $50 million remaining under the current authorization.","At the current market price, this new program plus the remaining authorization will enable the repurchase of more than 2.5 million shares or approximately 3% of the shares currently outstanding. This combination is expected to lead to approximately 65% payout ratio of our estimated adjusted net income in 2015 while still providing financial flexibility for M&A.","Turning to our outlook for the full-year 2015. We will now provide guidance inclusive of Ottens and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics acquisition on a preliminary basis. We expect currency-neutral sales to grow approximately 6% including approximately 2 percentage points related to acquisitions. Fragrance Ingredients is expected to remain soft as we have two more quarters where we're managing through pressure from the one customer I noted earlier.","In Fine Fragrances, we expect a modest improvement in the back half of the year as economic softness in the large fragrance market of Brazil could have an impact on our results. In addition, we expect to see decelerating trends in our Europe, Africa and Middle East regions versus a strong first half due to order patterns and high erosion rates on last year's wins.","The solid trend seen in Q2 for Flavors are expected to continue in the second half, with an improvement in Flavors North America anticipated in Q3. We expect this top-line growth combined with our continued cost control to lead to approximately 9% adjusted operating profit growth and about 10% adjusted EPS growth, assuming a 24.5% to 25% full-year tax rate, all on a currency-neutral basis. This guidance includes approximately $8 million relating to the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions. If we exclude this impact, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS would grow approximately 100 basis points higher.","Like many U.S. multinational companies, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus many global currencies will impact our results. In this chart, we are highlighting the expected profit impact of key currencies within our foreign exchange basket by multiplying the year-over-year percentage change through July of 2015 by the portion it represents on our operating profit. As you can see, the weakening euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our largest currency exposure, is expected to have the greatest impact.","In addition, several other currency, while small in terms of profitability exposure, have all weakened considerably versus the U.S. dollar and are collectively pressuring profitability. Mitigating this exposure, we expect a gain from our transactional euro-hedging program, which I identified on the last bar of the chart. As discussed in Q1, the benefits of this program will be more back half weighted based on the phasing of our program. The net result is we expect foreign exchange movements to have approximately 7-percentage point impact on sales and an approximately 5-percentage point impact on adjusted operating profit on a full-year 2015 basis.","Incorporating the foreign exchange impact on our full-year guidance, we would expect reported sales to be down approximately 1%, including approximately 7-percentage point drag from currency. Adjusted operating profit is expected to rise about 4%, inclusive of approximately a 5-percentage point headwind of currency.","Before turning the call back over to Andreas, I just want to reiterate how pleased I am to be part of IFF. I look forward to making positive contribution in the coming months as we continue to create incremental shareholder value.","With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing comments.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Alison. I briefly want to reiterate that we have started the first half of the year well as we delivered strong currency neutral operational performance. We increased our cash return to shareholders while simultaneously initiating the executing of Vision 2020. Our strategy is a natural evolution and the logical next step that will provide the fuel we need to accelerate our growth and increase differentiation, which in turn should lead to sustainable profitable growth for the years to come.","With that, I would now like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about North America. So, growth slowed in Flavors, excluding acquisitions, also has remained remaining weak in Fragrances. I know you talked about expecting an improvement in Flavors. So maybe talk a bit about company category dynamics, drivers, expectations over the balance of the year, including that improvement. And did that improvement include the benefit from the acquisition in terms of having a full three months' worth of benefit?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mark, thank you for the question. I give it to Matthias.","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Good morning, Mark. This is Matthias speaking. Excluding the transaction, the core business was soft, as we previously communicated at Investor Day, principally due to underlying trends with select customers.","I also would like to mention here that we have comparables not only relative to last year in Q2, but also in Q1 this year. We were posting a 10% growth in Q1 this year. When it comes to the overall performance by category, we mainly faced some challenges in the category of Savory and we are well confident that in Q3 we are getting back to growth and we will be posting low single-digit growth, and I would be also very confident for the entire balance of the year that we are going to be positive for the year. And this is organically, this is all excluding Ottens. So what we shared with you was like-for-like excluding the acquisition of Ottens.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then on the Fragrances side, maybe talk a bit about that too, please.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Nicolas?","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","Yes. Good morning, Mark. It's Nicolas here. So first of all, I will divide the dynamic between the two segments. North America, for Consumer Fragrances, we had a very, very strong growth last year of 8.2% for the full year. So we knew we had gained market share. Here, we expect to be still positive for this year. And so we will be growing above market. So I think that we have gained market share. Here, we see that we came also after a very, very strong growth of 15% last year in Q2, so we know that the market is not growing at that speed. So it was really difficult comp for Q2.","In Fine Fragrances, we are facing with some of the launch that took place last year that were not as successful as expected. So we had a very, very strong pipeline last year and we didn't have the same reorder leading to these wins from last year. So it's putting pressure on our top line. But obviously, as you know, most of the activity and market share growth in North America is taking place with European brands. And as you can see, we've been able to capture a significant part of the new launches, and we know that all our European-based customers are manufacturing in Europe for the world including North America.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And just following up on that, Nicolas, so the Ingredients piece, weak now for a couple of quarters, you talked about a specific customer. So is it fair to assume that that business doesn't improve until you start cycling the loss of whatever that piece of business is of that customer?","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","Yes. That is correct. We don't expect growth for the remainder of the year, and so we will be still challenged. I think what was important in what Alison shared with you is that if you exclude that customer, we will be up mid single-digits. So that's very, very good. And also regarding the strategic linkage between Ingredients and Fragrance Compounds, overall volume in our plants of ingredient is up double-digits. So you can see that there is a significant benefit of having the vertical integration, and I think that what is really important is that the continued performance and success that we're having in Consumer Fragrances is largely supported by our Ingredients. So the focus of our Ingredients business is really to support our continued growth in Compounds.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And just switching gears, global expenses has been extremely volatile in the last few quarters. How much of the decline year-to-date has been due to incentive comp? How should we think about that in the back half of the year? And then is it fair to assume that assuming the top line trends get back into sort of the midrange of the 4% to 6% organic next year that that resets and potentially is a higher number on a go-forward basis sort of more in line with what we've seen in recent years?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. I'm asking about global expenses. So they have been down a lot year-to-date in terms of that line item. So I'm trying to figure out how much of that has to do with incentive compensation. And then trying to think about how much this year is an exception relative to what should be more of a normalized run rate for that segment going forward?","Richard O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer, International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hey, Mark. It's Rich. Two things, I think. The two biggest \u2013 two big drivers that are in that corporate category. One is the AIP and the incentive comp piece. The second is the cash flow hedging. And so I think there's a couple of things you got to think about. I think the AIP differential, I think the second quarter, that'll continue through the third and fourth quarter relative year-over-year performance. The cash flow hedging impact, as we've talked about, is back-ended, so that'll grow in the second half of the year relative to where it was in the first half of the year. So I think when you look at 2015 as a whole, it is below \u2013 I'll call it below normal, given the incentive comp trends trending below expectations and cash flow hedging being positive compared to prior years where it was negative.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Great. Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you...","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. I was hoping you could bridge the gap for us between reported sales being down 1% and EBIT being up 4%. I'm guessing obviously incentive comp is a piece of it, but even still the implication is some pretty big acceleration on profits and productivity. So if you can give us a little information on that it would be great.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Lauren, it's a combination of incentive comp, as you mentioned. Our raw materials are down. Our productivity savings are up. So those are the main drivers.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I mean, is there anything specific, though, because honestly I would have thought that with the Vision 2020 being laid out that the bias is to invest sooner rather than later. And so the implication for currency-neutral EBIT growth is the high-end of your long-term range. So, I guess, wondering if there's any sort of holding back on some of those investment plans, given how rough currency is. Also, maybe the magnitude of how much the compensation is really driving that swing in expenses? And then also I would have thought there would have been greater expenses given the plant issues, the emissions thing you're putting in, in China, that that would have been incremental expense.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So let me chunk it up a bit. So our forecast for China \u2013 full year forecast plus our second quarter includes everything we know about it at this point in time. So we're closely monitoring what's going on in China. We have plans in place too for the odor abatement as quickly as possible, but everything we know at this point is included in our forecast.","The other items impacting the difference is also hedging, which I neglected to mention, so I want to include that in terms of the things that are positively impacting bottom line performance. But then also I want to address in terms of our investment. I mean, we're fully committed and fully moving forward on Vision 2020 investment, and so there's no holding back associated with that. I think it's really just the combination of multiple factors that are helping the bottom line appear much greater. But nevertheless, I think each item has a support in and of itself. I think it's really just in combination you get the outcome.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then I know it is very early, but knowing what you know today about how your hedges work, if currency stayed at today's levels, do you have a sense for what the drag from currency would be next year? Because I know the hedging kind of gives you a lagged effect.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I would say 3% to 4% headwind.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","On EBIT next year?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","2016, yes.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Okay. Great. At today's spot. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I was wondering whether I could touch one more time on the issues in North American Flavors. And that is if you strip out the acquisition benefit, the North American Flavors business was down, put us back maybe 4%. And I know you grew very strongly in the first quarter. But even if you averaged it out, it means that maybe you grew 3% on a local currency basis excluding acquisitions and last year you were down 4%. And your comparisons in the fourth quarter are becoming difficult again because there was volume growth of 7%. And obviously, there are some implications to the \u2013 to EBIT level as well because your sales \u2013 your overall flavor sales this quarter dropped $3 million, but your EBIT was down 7%. And so, I was wondering whether you can sort of like \u2013 shed some thought on that as like what the issues are in the North American Flavors business and why you're confident that \u2013 outside of cost control, things should be better in the back half of the year. Secondly, I was wondering like how much of your share repurchase program you made complete in 2015 and in 2016.","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Okay. This is Matthias speaking. Let me answer the first question. H1, year-to-date, our number for North America will be up. They are growing at low-single digits. We had challenges in the second quarter, indeed and particularly as outlined before in the category of Savory. We also recognized that the larger accounts, the very large international accounts where we have a very high index in North America they are not growing as fast as the smaller, more agile companies which are probably more the mid-tier manufacturers in the food and beverage industry.","It's exactly the reason that part of the strategic rationale why IFF has a very strong interest and we feel very pleased and privileged to have Ottens being part of our portfolio. It will give us a vehicle where we can differentiate ourselves, where we can keep the agility, the speed, the responsiveness and the ownership for those accounts to make tailored solutions which have a faster growth rate in North America. So overall, I feel confident that we will be posting full-year growth, excluding Ottens like-for-like sales. And I believe together with Ottens, we will further accelerate in the quarters to come.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Share repurchase?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Sure. In terms of share repurchase, for the remainder of 2015, we would expect to spend about $40 million to $50 million and then $100 million each year thereafter.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning. So I wanted to talk about Latin America. I know you mentioned that this was the seventh quarter of double-digit growth in Flavors, in particular. And I know you talked about the delivery systems. So I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. I know the categories you mentioned were Beverages in particular, but it would be helpful to learn more about who these customers are. Are you gaining share or is market growth just as strong, just anything else that you can add to that?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you for the question. I firmly believe we are gaining share in Latin America. It's not a coincidence that we are posting the seventh consecutive double-digit growth. We are really travelling well. Our approach of pipeline is very strong. And when I was referring to our unique delivery system technology, I'm referring here to a product which increases authenticity, naturalness of the taste and it's mainly used, not only, but mainly used in beverages.","In addition, we have a lot of great inroads we made in other categories such as Savory, thanks again to our technologies in Savory Modulation. And frankly, I feel very good about our performance even going forward and it makes us feel good that we are investing in Vision 2020 in exactly those areas which are truly differentiating ourselves in competition.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And other customers \u2013 is it a mix of multi-national and local customers or is there more contribution from one of those?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have very strong growth across the account base irrespective whether these are the strategic accounts or the larger accounts or even smaller accounts which are more local in Latin America.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, Alison, just a clarification from you and also the local currency operating profit growth you said was going to be 9% including acquisitions. And then, I think you said it was 8% excluding acquisitions, is that right?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","For the outlook or \u2013 I mean, for the...","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. For the year \u2013 for 2015.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So currency neutral is 9% growth and adjusted operating profit...","Michael DeVeau - VP, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Ex the acquisition...","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Ex the acquisition is 8%.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, John.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Are cosmetic actives sold in a briefing process? And for cosmetic active that's fragrance as well or a cosmetic product that is actives and is fragrance, would a customer brief the actives and fragrances together as a package?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. John, I'll give it to Nicolas. Nicolas?","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","Yes. Good morning, John. You have a briefing process, but the active ingredient is very much innovation-led. So, you really create the opportunity through a consumer insight and really a development of very specific solution leading to the trend in the market. So, you create the growth opportunity instead of really waiting for a brief.","So, it's slightly different than ours. And if you look at the dynamic, because the customer base is very, very similar, we believe that through encapsulation technologies, through our consumer insight, we will be able to actually increase the market access of the Lucas Meyer portfolio and provide additional solution for the future.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","So, just as a follow-up, if you brought a new active for cosmetic product to a customer, will they still brief the Fragrance part of it?","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","It can be. Usually, it's in separate activities. But today, the fact that we can provide a joint solution might create some new opportunities.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And if you could just remind me, the year-over-year increase in the performance comp in Flavors that was primarily because of the year-ago being below plan? It was not really related to a change in the accrual rate for the current year?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, that's correct.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Correct. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Wondered if you could update us on the cross listing, please. What was the rationale, and are you taking any actions to improve liquidity there? Thank you.","Michael DeVeau - VP, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Hi, Heidi. It's Mike. Yes, we absolutely are. As we discussed, we begin trading on, I think early June with our cross-listing in Euronext. I think now we're in the process of working with several banks in Europe based in Paris to see if we can improve our liquidity. We would expect through the balance of this summer to probably have some news in September, probably middle to end of September.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Sison, KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Nice quarter, guys. I wanted to just to ask about in Flavors, currency neutral, operating income growth was up 1% despite currency-neutral sales up 7%, so can you talk about some of the headwinds that sort of took away from the operating leverage? Clearly, you tend to have better operating leverage, so I think you flushed out some, but I don't know if you could share any specifics.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","This is Alison. So there was an impact \u2013 I'd say the biggest impact in terms of offsetting that profitability going to the bottom line was increased incentive compensation. Beyond that, we had the intangible impacts of $1.2 million, was also mentioned. And that was somewhat offset by productivity and cost control initiatives, but that was the biggest \u2013 those were the two biggest impacts. And then we also mentioned China, which is also included as a negative impact from the bottom line.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. And would you think that the currency-neutral growth would be better in the second half for Flavors?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Mike, we expect to have continued additional cost in China also in Q3 and for H2 in general, i.e., it is all factored into our forecast though. They will not be higher than what we had for the quarter in Q2. In terms of productivity, it is very high on our agenda. It obviously stands or falls a lot on how much we can possibly further accelerate our top line. While we are still early in the quarter, I feel good that we will deliver a solid top-line growth that can offset some of the pressures Alison has alluded to before.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Mike, just another comment. So for the second half of the year too, AIP will continue to be a headwind from a profit perspective.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And then, just a quick one on encapsulation. That business sounds like it's really gaining some momentum here. Where do you think you're at in terms of penetration in sort of these other markets like toiletries and personal wash? And is that an area that's going to continue to grow double digits for the next, whatever, quarters or several years?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Nicolas?","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","Yes. Good morning, Mike. As you know, encapsulation has been really one of the key drivers of the continued growth and success in Consumer Fragrances. So I will say the majority of the revenues from encapsulation at this stage are really in Fabric Care. But it's really one of the key pillars of the driver and a driver of our Vision 2020. That's where we are really investing significantly right now in resources and in capacity, and with the goal, obviously, to enlarge the offering to other category. So we have early success in other categories, we're pleased. That's why it's growing fast be it on a small base. So, for the foreseeable future, really the growth will be coming from Fabric augmented progressively with the other categories.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","You have a follow-up question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the follow-up. Two questions. One, Alison, if you could give us an update on interest expense over the balance of the year, inclusive of the two acquisitions. And then just broadly, wondering if you could comment on category growth dynamics. Overall, you plus your competitors seem to have slowed a little bit second quarter relative to 1Q and relative to growth in 2014.","So, I guess, just curious what you're seeing from a customer standpoint just sort of broadly, and then an expectation on a go-forward basis relative to where you were maybe a quarter or so ago? I know you have slightly revised the sales guidance towards the low end. So obviously, within that, what you're sort of seeing today relative to what you were seeing maybe three or six months ago and how you sort of think about that normalizing over time?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Mark, on a total company question for your part two, on guidance?","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So, first, let me answer the interest-related question. There will be a $2 million increase, which was included in our guidance. So that's reflective. In terms of overall outlook, at our Investor Day, we've guided toward a currency-neutral range of 4% to 6%, so we expect this year's performance to be in line with our long-term guidance of 4% to 6%. We still believe that's the case, albeit at the low end of the range due to pressure from ingredients, which Nicolas had spoken about, as well as some uncertainty in Fine Fragrances.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alec Patterson with AGI.","Alec Patterson - Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I just had a couple of quick ones. The Latin America mid-teens growth in Fragrances and Flavors, is it all volume or volume mix? I know you tend to price in dollars, but I just wanted to get clarification.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Matthias?","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Thank you for the question. In Latin America, as I outlined before, we are really travelling very well and very strong. We have a lot of new win. We have also good volume growth, but a lot is driven really by new wins, even new customers. We are moving into new geographies also in Latin America. You may recall that we have opened a new affiliate in Chile, for example. This gives us leverage and we feel very good with the traction which we gain. Thanks to technology, increased customer intimacy and additional accounts.","Alec Patterson - Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC","And just curious, China has been an issue especially for wholesale inventory management for a lot of your customer base. What are you seeing there? And then lastly a question, just could you round out or update us on some of the gross margin drivers, the raw material trends, that sort of thing?","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Talking about China, frankly we see the same, we see challenges as well and we see mainly very large international accounts being challenged. We see volumes decreasing. We see retail destocking and we are (55:22) mainly have a similar symptom as we have in North America that smaller accounts seem to be more agile and probably have a softer, innovative resolutions which are more tailored for the market in China.","As we're aware of it, we try to expand. We work with the commercial teams in China to increase our customer portfolio and to ensure that we are again more relevant in the marketplace. I however would like to remind, as we see challenges in China, we have comparables of what we are comparing to last year irrespective whether it's Q2 or even H1 we are comparing to very solid single-digit growth. So, we mainly had slown down the last three quarters in China.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And in terms of the \u2013 your second part of your question, in terms of raw materials, we expect to see a relatively stable raw material environment for the remainder of 2015.","Michael DeVeau - VP, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Anymore questions, operator?","Operator","You do have a question from the line of Jeff Zekauskas.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Jeff?","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It's Silke Kueck one more time for Jeff. I was wondering whether you can just share your thoughts on sort of like the competitive environment and that is the \u2013 there is obviously now, like, a new entrant in the industry with ADM acquiring Wild Flavors. Like, it seems there's a little bit of like a roll-up on the \u2013 in the food industry, like, Heinz acquiring Kraft, and like, Tyson is acquiring Hillshire Brands. In the fragrance industry, P&G is divesting its beauty care business, and that's going now to Coty. So, I was wondering whether you can discuss a little bit on what the competitive trends are like.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you for the question. I think what we experience these days is what will probably start using a long time ago, we see consolidation on the account base. I think consolidation is such on the accounts is also a great opportunity for us. It's really an opportunity to ensure that we are truly partnering at a very early stage. And I outlined once at the Investor's Day, as soon as we are partnering at the very early stage with our customers, our win rates and the chance that we are really submitting a value creation and value addition to them is much higher. Nowadays, our customers, they are not looking for vendors and suppliers anymore. They are really looking for two partners, and I really see this as a great opportunity.","When it comes to North America, what we outlined with Ottens, we all said that we want to create a vehicle for us to truly differentiate ourselves to keep the agility, the speeds, the ownership. But above all, the very longstanding history Ottens has built here in North America and to back it together with latest technology from IFF. We are firm of the belief that this will help us to accelerate our growth rate to penetrate into a segment that is growing faster of what we believe in the very large account here in North America and see it as a great opportunity. Maybe, Nicolas, do you want to add something, provide some color to Fragrance?","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","Yes. Silke, it's Nicolas. A very similar trend in terms of the customer dynamic moving to strategic partnership. So every consolidation provide additional upside opportunities. And here, it is obviously \u2013 or you need to support and provide consumer insight, and to identify growth opportunities for the portfolios and reaching significant scale. So, we believe it is a positive outlook for us.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.","Operator","We'd now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for closing remarks.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much for the question. As we said, we had a good first half year. We're in the middle of the execution of our Vision 2020 which works very well. We basically finished the two acquisitions for this year as well which will help us to differentiate and accelerate our growth going to the future. So, thank you very much for the questions again, and let me end the call right now. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau","Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF\u2019s fourth quarter full year 2019 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website.","Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for the first quarter and full year 2020. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty.","For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 26, 2019, and our press release.","Today\u2019s presentation include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday and is posted on our website.","With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla, who will begin with prepared remarks, and then take any questions that you may have.","With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Mike. And a very special welcome to Rustom, our recently appointed CFO, who joined us about three weeks ago. We could not be more excited to welcome him to the IFF team, as he brings a strong track record over 30 years of operational and financial leadership across several international markets with significant experience in managing global finance teams, developing strategy, driving efficiency initiatives and completing acquisitions. So, welcome Rustom.","I would like to take the opportunity to thank Rich O\u2019Leary for his service as our CFO and looking forward to his contributions as our integration lead for the DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences combination. He has deep institutional knowledge, insights and perspectives, both financially and strategically and will be enormously valuable as he takes on his new role as our Integration Officer.","On today\u2019s call, as usual, I will give an executive overview of our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, including an update on the progress we are making with the integration of Frutarom. Following the discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide the financial review of the business and take you through our financial expectations for 2020.","We will also recap IFF\u2019s transformational journey and the exciting opportunities we see with our combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences business, which we announced in the fourth quarter 2019. Upon the completion of our prepared remarks, we will take any questions that you may have.","Let\u2019s come to 2019. 2019 was a transformational year in IFF\u2019s history. It can be categorized as a year of great progress, despite some challenges. Over the course of the year, there were many positive accomplishments, including development of our new strategy, strong progress against our integration synergy targets, unlocking incremental access to new businesses via core lists and announcing our combination with N&B unparalleled in our industry as it will broaden our product offerings and create a global leader in innovative integrated solutions.","I\u2019ve also to acknowledge that there were several challenges are like continued raw material cost increases; impactful end market dynamics like destalking, isolated sales pressure, including delayed launches and the dissynergies, as well as the Russia and Ukraine compliance issue, which I\u2019m pleased to say that has now been fully completed and closed.","In that context we surpassed $5 million sales for the first time and expanded adjusted operating profit margin, excluding amortization, a testament to our team\u2019s focus, dedication and commitment to delivering strong results and executing our long-term strategy. We ended 2019 with meaningful growth in the fourth quarter, seeing 7% currency-neutral revenue growth, including the 4 percentage points related to the 53rd week. We also achieved currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth of 23% excluding amortization, led by volume growth, integration synergies, productivity initiatives, the Brazil tax recovery, as well as more favorable tax rate and higher other income.","In the fourth quarter, the team was able to continue to exceed expectations on Frutarom cost synergies, capturing approximately $20 million cost synergies driven by procurement harmonization and manufacturing optimization.","This very sustained focus across the organization ultimately positioned IFF to accelerate our vision through the announced combination with DuPont N&B business at the end of the year. The exciting combination will allow us to develop integrated solutions with greater global scale to meet what our customers demand, high-quality products, innovative solutions and strategic partnerships to deliver growth.","But, let\u2019s take a step back and look at the full year 2019. I\u2019m pleased to say, we delivered solid top and bottom line results in a very challenging environment. We realized sales of $5.1 billion, expanded adjusting operating profit margin excluding amortization by 30 bps to 19.2%. We also delivered strong adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization of US$6.17, principally led by adjusted operating profit growth, realized synergies and improved productivity. Ultimately, we have many strategic accomplishments that built momentum throughout the year and drove significant value creation.","Our investment innovation includes the opening of IFF centers of excellence and innovation hubs in New Jersey and Texas. Specifically, our new Center of Excellence for Food Service and Seasonings in Carrollton, Texas; the opening of our Home & Fabric Care Innovation Center at Bell Works in Holmdel, New Jersey; and the openings of our global service center in Budapest and L\u2019Atelier Du Parfumeur in Grasse, France, reflects our commitment to environmentally responsible real estate development.","In addition, we also modernized our largest Scent creative centers in New York and Paris, and continued our investment in Greater Asia, including two new plants in India and China, which we will complete -- will be completed in 2020.","In June, we took another bold step forward in leading our industry on sustainability when we articulated IFF\u2019s new purpose, to redefine and transform how we live and care for the resources of the world. In line with this mission, we accelerated our global industry leadership in sustainability, opening the industry\u2019s largest solar array of our facilities in New Jersey and signing on to the United Nations\u2019 pledge to help limit global temperature rise. Most recently, IFF was named once again to CDP\u2019s A List for climate change and water security, placing our company among a prestigious group of global environmental leaders with AA distinction. And just a week ago, we were named to Barron\u2019s 100 Most Sustainable Companies List for the third consecutive year.","Throughout the year, we continued to complete important work of bringing our colleagues at Frutarom more fully to the IFF family. We have addressed the most significant outselling challenges related to bringing these businesses together and are now in a position to accelerate growth by capturing new opportunities and delivering the solutions our customers need. But perhaps most importantly, we have continued to achieve significant cost synergies throughout integration process, well ahead of our year one cost synergy target, including approximately $50 million cost synergies in 2019. This is mainly driven by procurement excellence, but we also have made progress on our operational footprint. We have closed 10 sites in 2019. And I really believe we are on track to deliver more than $145 million in synergies, further supporting the business and driving value to our shareholders. We expect to substantially complete the Frutarom integration by the end of 2020.","The efficient operational execution was complemented by solid year one run rate revenue synergies of approximately $15 million. We\u2019ve identified a strong pipeline of cross-selling opportunities of more than 1,000 projects, representing approximately $150 million of sales and plan to build on this momentum in 2020.","We have accelerated expansion of our Tastepoint model to serve the fast-growing local and regional customer segment through increased speed and agility, enabling them to win in the marketplace. We will fully consolidate Frutarom into our legacy IFF business. As we refine our structure and reporting, we\u2019re aligning our talent organization and responsibility based on our new structure. With this in mind, starting in Q1 of 2020, we will report financial results as Taste and Scent, incorporating most of Frutarom within our Taste segment.","Lastly, we continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was up $261 million year-over-year in 2019. We continue to deleverage our balance sheet, improving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 3.6 times to 3.2 times, putting us on track to deliver on our commitment to be below 3 times by the end of 2020.","With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom to take us through our financial performance in greater detail.","Rustom Jilla","Thank you, Andreas.","First, let me say how delighted I am to have joined IFF at this exciting time as we move past the integration of Frutarom to the combination with DuPont\u2019s N&B business, and the many opportunities and challenges this will bring.","For my part, I expect to focus on first, improving execution and accountability; second, enhancing effective collaboration across the business, that\u2019s legacy IFF, Frutarom, and soon N&B; third, strengthening our cost discipline; and finally, delivering solid ROI.","Now, on to the numbers. Reported sales increased by 29% in 2019 with three additional quarters of Frutarom being the major driver. Excluding Frutarom, currency-neutral sales grew 3% with 2019\u2019s 53rd week contributing 1%. I\u2019ll provide more color on sales by segment as we go through those slides.","Our full year adjusted operating profit margin excluding amortization, rose by 30 basis points, driven by productivity initiatives, acquisition-related synergies and a Brazilian tax recovery. It\u2019s also worth noting that in our fourth quarter, our currency-neutral EPS ex-amortization, grew a robust 23%, driven mostly by acquisition-related synergies, volume growth, lower incentive compensation, a Brazilian tax recovery, and a lower effective tax rate, which more than offset a headwind from higher raw material costs and mix.","As the IFF team has done in previous quarters, I would like to highlight the impact of emerging market pricing on our growth rates to better compare to our peers. As a reminder, for a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, or our index to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. So, when reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets. But, this is different from our peers. We believe that our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it\u2019s important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition.","For the fourth quarter of 2019, the stronger U.S. dollar environment plus emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 1% currency impact on growth, if we include emerging market pricing. For the full year, this impact represented approximately a 2% currency impact on growth.","Breaking it down a little further. Let\u2019s move on to Scent, on slide 11. In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 6% to $478.3 million. Fourth quarter performance was strongest in Consumer Fragrance, increasing in the high single digits from the prior year, driven by growth in Home, Fabric and Hair Care. Fine Fragrance grew in the mid single digits year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in both Greater Asia and in Latin America. At the same time, Fragrance Ingredients declined in the low single digits from last year as price increases were offset by volume declines, mainly as a result of industry destocking.","For the full year, currency-neutral sales increased by 4% from 2018 to $1.9 billion with growth across all regions and in all categories, especially those that are a strategic focus. Both Fine Fragrance, with record new win contribution, and Consumer Fragrance grew in the mid single digits from 2018. Our performance in Fine Fragrance was driven by double-digit growth in EAME and Greater Asia, while as in the fourth quarter, Consumer Fragrance was led by strong improvements in Home and Fabric Care. For the year, Fragrance Ingredients improved by low double -- by low single digits, driven by price increases.","For the full year, currency-neutral segment profit grew 6% and margin expanded 30 basis points to 17.3%. Drivers included raw materials-driven price increases as well as benefits from productivity initiatives that ran the gamut from manufacturing, procurement and make versus buy to innovation.","Moving on to Taste on slide 12. In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 8% to $429.9 million. This performance was led by double-digit growth in Greater Asia and high single digit growth in North America. Sales to multinationals, which had been under pressure in the last few quarters, grew mid single digits, indicating an inflection point in Q4. We also saw a much stronger growth from regional and local customers. From a category perspective, we were strongest in Beverage and Savory, helped greatly by strong new win performance.","For the full year, currency-neutral sales increased by approximately 2% to $1.7 billion, driven by high single digit growth in Greater Asia and low single digit growth in EAME. As discussed during the year, we had some challenges in North America and Latin America related to volume declines with multinational customers. And as in the fourth quarter, full year 2019 growth was strongest in Beverage and Savory.","For the full year, Taste posted an industry-leading 22.1% segment profit margin with $383 million in segment profit, which was supported by productivity increases, integration-related synergies and lower incentive compensation expense.","Now, let\u2019s move on to Frutarom\u2019s performance on slide 13. In the fourth quarter, Frutarom currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 6%, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses, which is a sequential improvement in underlying performance. Organic currency-neutral growth for the quarter was 2%, essentially led by our Taste and Savory businesses.","As discussed in past calls, Frutarom experienced compliance and portfolio-related transitory headwinds. Excluding these, organic currency-neutral growth would have been 6%. For the full year, sales were $1.5 billion for the segment, up 3% on a currency-neutral basis from the prior year, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses.","In 2019, organic sales growth was flat. And if you exclude the transitory issues, organic currency-neutral sales growth was 3%, driven by solid growth in Taste and Savory solutions. The fastest-growing categories at Frutarom include double-digit increases in food protection, inclusions and algae.","For the first for the full year, Frutarom\u2019s segment profit was $127 million or $286 million, excluding amortization. And we finished the year with a strong quarterly segment profit increase of 24%, led by acquisition-related synergies. The full year operating margin excluding amortization was 19.2%, supported by delivering on our acquisition-related synergies and by disciplined cost management.","Slide 14 provides some additional color on cash flow. As you will see, operating cash flow for the full year was up significantly from $438 million in 2018 to $699 million this year, a $261 million or 60% increase. This was driven primarily by higher cash earnings from Frutarom -- with Frutarom included for the entire year.","Core working capital, defined as inventories, accounts receivables and accounts payables, improved year-over-year with progress in all three metrics. Inventories still remain at elevated levels, primarily due to raw material cost increases and safety stocks within the Scent division. However, in the fourth quarter, we saw continued positive trends.","For 2019, CapEx as a percentage of sales was approximately 4.6%, which is a significant investment in the future. Throughout the year, we made new capital -- made new plant and capacity investments, mainly in Greater Asia as well as creative centers, and we invested in high-return integration-related synergy projects such as manufacturing optimization. Bringing all this together, we had strong $195 million increase in free cash flow for 2019, representing a 73% increase year-over-year.","Moving on to slide 15. We expect full year 2020 sales of between $5.15 billion and $5.35 billion with adjusted EPS excluding amortization between $6.20 and $6.45.","At this point in time, we expect a modest impact on sales from the recent coronavirus outbreak, but we are unable to quantify this as there are just too many variables and uncertainties. In addition, we have already incurred some relatively modest costs related to the outbreak as we acted to mitigate the impact on our supply chain. Right now, it\u2019s too early to quantify the impact on our results, but we did widen both our sales and adjusted EPS ex-amortization guidance ranges to make some allowance for this as well as for continued volatile operating environment.","The next slide provides some additional color about what we expect to drive our core sales growth for the year.","Looking into our 2020 sales growth expectations and given the several moving parts, we felt it was important to give you an overview of the drivers. As you see from this slide, sales growth for 2020 is expected to be approximately 1% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a headwind of about 0.5 percentage point impact from portfolio adjustments, namely the carryover impact from compliance and CitraSource, and an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year period. Excluding these impacts, our core currency-neutral sales growth is expected to be approximately 2.5% to 6.5%, which includes approximately 2% to 5.5% from the organic business, 0.5% to 1% from cross-selling, and little to no impact from M&A.","Now, let\u2019s move to slide 17 for some additional color on what is driving our EPS growth. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization growth for 2020 is expected to be approximately 3.5% to 7.5% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a headwind of approximately 5 percentage points related to an incentive compensation reset, which is due to our performance versus our internal budget in 2019, an anticipated 0.5% impact due to our due to the portfolio adjustment, and an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year. Excluding those impacts, core currency-neutral adjusted EPS ex-amortization is expected to grow in the range of 4% to 8%. We also expect to have a 6% positive contribution from integration synergies, which when added to our core growth, puts us in the double-digit growth range.","Moving on to slide 18. I\u2019m pleased to tell you that we remain on track to deliver on our commitment to delevering down to below 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2020 while maintaining an investment-grade rating. We are already down to approximately 3.2 times, down from 3.6 times a year ago, and we will continue to focus on improving working capital, tightly managing our CapEx while making the necessary investments and of course growing our cash earnings. To further support achieving this goal, management incentives are aligned to repayment of debt.","With that, let me turn the call back to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Rustom. Very well done.","I now want to spend a few moments and highlighting the evolution of IFF from a traditional leader in the flavor and fragrance space to now as it uniquely positioned to redefine our industry at a time when consumers\u2019 demands are forcing changes across our customers.","With Frutarom, we took the first big step. We can now reach one of the broader set of our CPG customers of all sizes in the world and added critical depth to our proposition as a top provider of flavors, savory solutions and natural taste solutions.","As I mentioned, we are seeing some excellent cross-selling opportunities further supported by our Tastepoint model. With N&B, we take the next leap forward in delivering integrated solutions that allow us to partner with our customers to solve their most pressing problems. It is a truly powerful combination. IFF\u2019s leadership in natural solutions and N&B\u2019s leadership in clean label, including cultures, enzyme and soy proteins, will be a vital component in creating solutions that meet customer needs for better-for-you products.","Our complementary product portfolio will be among the most balanced in the industry. Together, we will have number one or number two positions in the high-value most in-demand ingredients categories across our shared end markets of food and beverage, health and wellness, and home and personal care. Ultimately, what we are doing is strengthening IFF\u2019s position to serve our customers.","We are witnessing powerful trends that are forcing all of us to think differently, and we have received very positive customer feedback about that combination. We will be a very powerful leader with even better R&D and application development capabilities and even deeper and more robust product development pipeline in addition to a portfolio that will be among the most balanced in the industry. Importantly, our shared cultures, led by science and creativity, will drive our strengths to unlock the potential of this combination. And again, it\u2019s really about how we can deliver highly compelling value propositions to all of our customer types. For many of our global to multinational customers, we will bring deep experience with high-growth segments, faster speed to market and very deep consumer insights.","For local and regional organizations, we will provide global reach to support regional and\/or global expansion, paired with a strong local presence and a culture of collaboration. For new brands, we will be their end-to-end partner from idea to production, providing the reliability of scale and the power of global reach. The opportunity before us is clear and compelling, and we are taking the wide steps to ensure that we are positioning positioned to bring these two businesses together as efficiently as possible.","As we announced along with Rustom\u2019s appointment back in December, Rich O\u2019Leary has been named as the lead the N&B integration efforts for IFF. Similarly, Angela Naef, N&B\u2019s SVP of Global Tech and Innovation, will oversee the N&B integration lead. Each brings unparalleled knowledge of the respective businesses and a diverse operating perspective to this team. We believe that their combination of experience and leadership best positions us to bring this combination to life. As I have had the opportunity to meet with leaders from across N&B business, each of these conversations has reaffirmed that IFF and N&B are perfect partners.","While we look forward to hitting the ground running, the deal close is targeted for the first quarter of 2021, providing significant runway for planning and integration-related execution. As you can see, we have already been diligently working on planning to execute our road map to integrate these businesses. On slide 22, we are showing that while our N&B integration planning has started and is working in parallel with our ongoing Frutarom integration work, we do expect the business integration work of Frutarom to be completed in the third quarter of 2020, with 90% of the manufacturing consolidation complete as planned. This ensures that we are ready to begin the DuPont N&B integration. We will tap the combined integration muscle of both IFF and N&B along with robust external subject experts. So in summary, we delivered solid top and bottom line results and took clear and significant strategic steps on our journey to lead our industry as an invaluable partner for our customers.","In 2019, we surpassed $5 billion in sales for the first time and expanded adjusted operating profit margin, excluding amortization by 30 bps. I\u2019m pleased that we ended the year with a significant acceleration in growth, seeing a 7% currency-neutral revenue increase and a robust 23% increase in currency-neutral adjusted EPS, excluding amortization. Reflecting on the year, we have a lot to be proud of. Our key accomplishments include significant integration-related synergies, strong progress in cross-selling, great strides in sustainability and completion of the Russia and Ukraine compliance issue. At the end of the year, in the fourth quarter, we also saw a fundamental improvement in our Taste segment, a key inflection point as we head into 2020. But I also want to acknowledge that not everything went in our favor in 2019.","We experienced significant raw material cost increases across both segments, and sales came in lower-than-expected across all segments for the various reasons we explained earlier. As we look ahead in 2020, leveraging the key learnings from 2019, our priorities are very clear: drive growth and profitability in our business, substantially complete Frutarom integration and lay the groundwork to begin successfully combining with N&B. With continued focus on execution, we will be well positioned to become a global leader in innovative, integrated solutions and be able to deliver value creation for all of our stakeholders. And while we are early in 2020, we are pleased to say that started of the year strong with growth in all segments.","With that, I would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question today from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Astrachan","So, two questions for me. First, on the sales forecast range, so it\u2019s a bit wider than we\u2019re accustomed to seeing. It\u2019s a bit wider, I think, too, relative to some of your peers. I guess I\u2019m curious why you\u2019re giving a wider range. I hear the China commentary, but I was under the impression, it wasn\u2019t particularly large as a percentage of business. So is there something from a macro standpoint? Or is there something from a customer standpoint that you\u2019re hearing or worried about? And then the second question is Frutarom. So I get organic growth for 4Q down about 4%, if you back out the acquisition contribution and the piece of the business from the closing of prior year that you did known for the full quarter, so that gets a full year number down about 1%. So, I guess, the question there is you\u2019ve owned the asset now for a little over one year. What\u2019s a reasonable run rate of growth? You\u2019ve talked about 6% of that target longer term, but it just seems like it\u2019s not the case anymore. So maybe you\u2019re still thinking 6%, but if you could kind of walk through how you\u2019re thinking about it, if that\u2019s the case. Or what are the moving parts today? That would be helpful.","Andreas Fibig","Mark, thank you. First of all, on the guidance range, that was certainly a discussion we had internally. What do we do in an environment where we are in, which is a pretty, let\u2019s say, volatile. It\u2019s on one hand, certainly, the corona situation, I\u2019ll come to that in a second. And then also tariffs, which are not easy to plan. But corona was probably the tipping point for us because it\u2019s very hard to quantify, but we know that it will have an impact. With our manufacturing plants actually closed up to last Monday, Tuesday, well, we opened it. We have relatively soft demand. We will see whether we will make it up. We have seen that we have also modest cost increases already on particularly on transportation.","We have to make sure that we manage our inventory well in this situation because you have, let\u2019s say, disruptions in the supply chain. And one of our bigger customers also said that the travel retail is actually pretty down because people are not traveling too much any longer. Just to give you one very personal example, my family came back from Europe yesterday. My wife told me in Frankfurt that the at the border control, there was nobody else. And the airplane, Lufthansa airplane was a smaller one than before, and it was just half booked, so just as to validate what we are seeing and reading. So we said it\u2019s probably a prudent thing to widen the guidance range because we just don\u2019t know. We hope at least that we will make it up. And as I said, our manufacturing plants are open again, and we are starting to manufacture, and it seems to be all good. But that\u2019s how we see it. And I hand it over to Rustom to talk a bit about the guidance.","Rustom Jilla","Sure. Thanks. Thank you, Mark. Very little to add there except specifically, we didn\u2019t quantify on the coronavirus because it\u2019s too early. It\u2019s just too early to tell and understand it. And but what we did do was widen the ranges, and we can come back at some point subsequent in the year as we know more.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. Let me take now your second question on Frut. We believe when we cycle through, as we said, probably over the course of last year, through some of the onetime effects, we see that this business has good potential of mid-single-digit growth in average, and I come to some of the exceptions here. What we have to cycle through is our compliance issues, we issue we had in Russia. Thanks God, it\u2019s solved on the legal front now. We have to make sure that on the business side, it\u2019s running well. The second thing is the CitraSource, where one of our peer companies lost their big customer, and they are our biggest customer in that business. And then we had the impact on raw material prices on Natural Colors. So we believe that within the second quarter, we will cycle through these effects and we will grow this business around about mid-single digits. We have actually if you look at the different categories, some of these businesses are doing extremely well and have even double-digit growth like inclusions, where gelato is part of it, and the Food Protection business. So we are driving this, and we see also that these businesses are helping us with our cross-selling activities, which is basically reflected in the guidance, by the way. And most of it, it\u2019s a Frutarom business. Okay?","Mark Astrachan","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Mike Sison","I didn\u2019t want to get a little bit of color in terms of what\u2019s driving the growth, the 2.5% to 6.5%. I know you have a nice little color, columns there. But in terms of the organic business, can you maybe walk through I think you\u2019ve won some business in Taste or maybe it\u2019s Scent, I can\u2019t remember. And what gives you confidence that you can actually grow organically in 2020?","Andreas Fibig","Yes, okay, absolutely. And I\u2019ll take it, but please, Rustom, you add here. First of all, as we said before, we have basically access to three more very important core lists on the Scent side. What we see is that the team is executing with the customer very, very closely now on new projects. We will see already some good wins in 2020, but the bulk of it will probably come in 2021. But we see that this is working out very well. And I was myself at the BIC Congress, ACI, the American Cleaning Institute, and I talked myself to many customers. And particularly, the ones where we have won the new core lists, and that\u2019s very positive because they\u2019re happy with the innovation provided by IFF, and the projects are already starting to ramp up. That\u2019s number one. Number two, and that was super important for us last year. We saw the inflection point now with the Taste business. We had basically three, almost four quarters, not so great growth. It was fourth quarter in 2018 and then up to the third quarter in 2019. And we saw that many of our bigger CPG customers had very slow volumes. Not that we were losing businesses but just the volume was very, very low of our business with these customers. And we had on the other hand a very good win rate over the course of the year, and that started to materialize now in the fourth quarter. And we see already a good start into the first quarter as well with good January numbers. So, it looks like that we are coming back on the Taste business to our usually average growth rates. And when I go back here on my spreadsheet, the last three years, the average CAGR was 3.9%, last five years 3.7%. And that\u2019s certainly a number the business can achieve.","Then, on top of it, we look at the Frutarom business, I just gave the answer to Mark. It\u2019s a bit backloaded in general because of the cycling through of the topics I just mentioned. Well, what comes on top of it, we see actually a good activity now on the cross-selling. It started slower than we expected, but right now, we have run about 1,000 projects which have significant value for us, where we see that we can combine our products, that we can cross-sell products into combined customers. And that\u2019s something which is really, really good and gives us confidence that the growth is will be good in our core business over the course of 2020. So that\u2019s how we see it. I don\u2019t know, Rustom, whether you want to add anything.","Rustom Jilla","Just one thing probably in pricing and in Scent, pricing and Fragrance Ingredients. But otherwise, I think you covered it all.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts","Thank you. Welcome, Rustom. That was a good presentation for somebody only on the job a couple of weeks. Now that the year one guarantees have expired for the key Frutarom employees, are you seeing any increase in turnover?","Andreas Fibig","Yes. John, that\u2019s a very, very good question. Let me address it into two parts. The first thing, if I look at total employee population of legacy Frut, we have actually lower attrition rates, voluntary attrition rates than we had before, which is actually pretty good, knocking on wood, it stays like that. And on the key employees, we didn\u2019t lose key employees we didn\u2019t want to lose. And that\u2019s a good, let\u2019s say, message for us as well. Some of them are driving important businesses for us. For example, the leader of the Inclusions business, which is really driving it, the Savory solutions business. They\u2019re all leader from the legacy Frut unit.","John Roberts","And do you have any update on the timing of a filing for the DuPont deal? And just remind us what are the key long lead time critical items on the path to closing on first quarter 2021.","Michael DeVeau","So, it would be -- John, this is Mike. There\u2019s no change from what we communicated back in December. As we progress through this year, obviously, there\u2019s the separation component that the DuPont team is working on from that standpoint. And then as we progress concurrently, we\u2019re working to look at doing the appropriate filings with the SEC, specifically, the Form 4, that will probably come, let\u2019s call it, mid-year. And then after that, we\u2019ll move into the voting discussion.","Andreas Fibig","And closing has not changed. We believe that first quarter next year is very realistic. And we don\u2019t expect any antitrust issues here with the two businesses.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from PJ Juvekar with Citigroup. Your line is open.","PJ Juvekar","One question is on Taste. North America were challenged due to volume erosion from large multinational companies. I thought that destocking in packaged foods was mostly done by end of third quarter. So is there incremental destocking? Or is this issue with underlying demand with these multinational companies?","Andreas Fibig","I think, PJ, good question. We are done with destocking for, let\u2019s say, third quarter last year. Fourth quarter was already done. And I think it has reflected very nicely in the rebound of our business in the Taste division, so we are very happy with that.","PJ Juvekar","And my second question is, one of your priorities was getting IFF\u2019s technology into Frutarom and the cross-selling you had talked about. Can you give us an update on that and if that\u2019s happening through Tastepoint?","Andreas Fibig","Yes. Absolutely. It\u2019s happening through Tastepoint, and we\u2019re doing it for some of the bigger customers as well. What we see here is, in particular, on the Food Protection side, very good sales. So Food Protection is basically antioxidants to increase the shelf life. That\u2019s something where cross-selling works very, very well. We see it in the first examples on Natural Colors and on the Inclusion business, which you see the legacy Taura one. We see it in the number of projects, as I mentioned. We have around about 1,000 different projects running with a value of more than $100 million. Not all of them will hit certainly this year, but it shows the strength. If I would look back maybe one year, 1.5 years, I would have hoped it comes faster. But I have to say now, since we are having a really dedicated good team on it and exploring it more, it comes much better than we have expected. So little slower than I would have wished for but higher in terms of the opportunities than we have seen before. I hope that helps, P.J.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Faiza Alwy","So, I have two questions. One is just on gross margin. It looks like you took a step back this quarter, and I was expecting an improvement. So maybe if you could share with us what some of the puts and takes were there. And how we should think about raw materials and gross margin in 2020? And then my second question is just if you could give us a sense of how we should think about cash flow and CapEx in 2020.","Rustom Jilla","Sure. So, it\u2019s Rustom. So, let me take this. So, in the fourth quarter, our gross margin was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable mix, right? So from what I\u2019ve learned in my first couple of weeks, raw material costs can fluctuate monthly, quarterly due to inventories. And in Taste in Q4, that\u2019s really where we saw it. They were primarily impacted by the timing of raw material cost for the balance sheet, the P&L. And that\u2019s not much different from what happened in the second quarter. We have Scent, raw materials came in much more favorable. And then if you want to think about specific commodities, in Taste, it was primarily vanilla, and incentive continues to be turpentine in China tariffs, right? Capital, you wanted to the cash flow, yes, roughly about 4.5%, next year as well. 4.5% of sales, sorry, 4.5% of sales on capital.","And then, the final part of your question or at least the intermediate part of your question was about raw materials and how that would flow through into next year, right? And look, in 2020, we believe that raw material costs will stabilize, specifically in the Scent division, where we had the largest raw material increases. Our current purchases are stabilizing. And look, it\u2019s important to note, they still remain elevated at levels and that we will, as we always have, work with our customers and actions, including price increases, to cover that exposure. And I think those were your questions, right, it\u2019s good?","Andreas Fibig","Actually, I think that\u2019s perfectly fine. Rustom, fantastic in the third week. No, just one word on the CapEx to give it to contextualize it a bit. As we said before, last year was our highest CapEx spending for all the reasons I said during the call, because we did a lot of investments. We have to finish off this year. And from the next year onwards, the CapEx plan is much lower and it goes more to a maintenance level of 3% to 3.5%. Because we are finishing up India and China this year, the creative centers, centers are done. And then we have just the maintenance investments, which is actually a good sign for us, and it will have a positive impact on the cash flow.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question today from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson","And maybe first, just to clarify on the coronavirus, just impact. And I know the guidance doesn\u2019t officially kind of contemplate an impact, but it also you\u2019ve put a wider range to give some just some room there. Could you just contextualize for us the just to be clear, the China sales exposure? And also, just Fine Fragrance, as far as you can tell, how much you think that actually goes through global kind of duty-free and travel channels? It\u2019s probably the two areas most at risk. And similarly, on the production side, how much of your raw material production do you source from China?","Andreas Fibig","Should I get started? I\u2019ll start. Adam, so we do own about 6% of our combined sales in China. That\u2019s China for China, so to say. On the travel retail, I can\u2019t tell you now because it has usually a time lag. It comes from our customers. But if you look at our one of our big beauty and cosmetic customers, they just made an announcement, and that made us think as well what the impact might be. And then the third piece is that we have, we are sourcing some of our fragrance ingredients out of China. And we certainly have other suppliers in China as well. Here, we feel much better, of course, since the factory is and that specific factory is opened since last Tuesday, we are probably on safe grounds that we can supply our ingredients to the rest of the company. But that was a bit of a worry for us as well, whether we can export out of China. So 6%, China for China. Travel retail, we don\u2019t know. We\u2019re just listening to our customers because they are closer to the frontier. And then on production out of China, we believe we are good on this side.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. And then just maybe following up on the prior question on the gross margin performance in the fourth quarter. And clearly, it came in below your plan. And I just want to be clear. I mean, if it was raw material costs and inventory, just I presumed you would have had more visibility to it. Was there a sharp kind of divergence in sales mix and the decline in Fragrance Ingredients, I would have thought it would have been a tailwind to the margin performance. I just want to make clarify a little bit, just to the surprise relative to your own plan, cycling back a couple of months, it seems like a bigger variance than I would have thought.","Rustom Jilla","So yes, I mean, look, mix sales mix definitely. I mean sales mix was in there. And nothing structural, really, as we look at our and we\u2019re probably going to see gross margins recover as we go into the early part of this year in 2020.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. Absolutely. And it\u2019s more timing than anything else on that one. And the good thing is that the raw material prices are now softening, again, which is helpful for this year. We certainly have taken last year, in a couple of moments, inventory positions, just to make sure that we can supply our customers, but that seems to stabilize.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question today from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.","Lauren Lieberman","Hey. I just wanted to follow up again just a bit on Frutarom. So a few things here. One is that with Frutarom being folded into Taste, to what degree will we really get visibility into this inflection you\u2019re expecting in 2020? Because when I look at Frut in the fourth quarter, even if I can see it and say, the four points, the things that you\u2019re calling transitory are, in fact, transitory, organic was still down 2%, even excluding those things in the fourth quarter. So, I\u2019m just struggling with why mid single digits is comfortable. And how and if will kind of get visibility if that would again being folded into Taste as we get into 2020?","Rustom Jilla","So, Lauren, it\u2019s Rustom. Let me have a crack first at how we\u2019re -- the second part is how we track it and how we manage it. So, yes, we are going to report as two segments, but what we are going to do over the course of the year in 2020 is we\u2019re going to, as much as possible, track the Frutarom elements separately too. Now, remember, as we continue to integrate, there will be some sales that come from Frutarom that now show up that naturally migrate over into the legacy Taste part of the business. Right? So, it won\u2019t be perfect, but we\u2019re going to do our absolute best for ourselves as much as anything else to track and control that. Then...","Michael DeVeau","Yes. I think, the second question and then just as kind of a point for just a reminder perspective, I think Lauren was asking -- looking at the organic growth from a Frutarom perspective, ex the ex the 53rd week, ex the three days, I think the run rate number or the right number is probably flat in the quarter. And so how does that transfer as we go forward, the confidence level at...","Andreas Fibig","I would say, confidence level is pretty high right now that when we cycle through these one-times, and Lauren mentioned it and maybe when we\u2019re next week at CAGNY, we have more time to talk about it. When we go through the Russia topic from the commercial or legally, we are through. When CitraSource is basically cycling through and we see a recovery of the Natural Colors raw materials, then we will see actually good mid-single-digit growth going forward. And we will provide some visibility on this one as well. Where it is tough, and I\u2019m building here on Rustom\u2019s comment on to create visibilities on the cross sales. And you see cross sales is 0.5% to 1% point growth for this year. And most of it actually, it comes out of the Frutarom portfolio and that\u2019s tough to track. But, I think you can model it that most part of it comes out of the Frutarom portfolio, and that should be helpful for you when you model the legacy Frut business. But we are bringing it together with Taste as actually two reasons. One is a very practical business reason. It is helping with our cross-selling activities and bringing the technologies and the people very well together. That\u2019s number one. And the second one is in gearing up for the N&B integration, it simplifies our structure because we will have them in the first quarter next year, another change. And we thought it\u2019s a prudent thing to do exactly that. I hope it helps, Lauren.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Jeff Zekauskas","In your remarks, you said that you knocked out $20 million in costs in Frutarom. But the year-over-year increase in operating income is about $5 million. And even if you compare it to the first quarter of 2019, maybe you\u2019re $3 million up. So why isn\u2019t Frutarom earning, I don\u2019t know, $45 million if you\u2019ve lowered your cost structure by that much? Why is the number so low?","Rustom Jilla","So, part of this would be currency, the currency impact as we go through the numbers. And part of the, I guess, the cost synergies that we have also have been associated with extra cost that we put in as we take out the synergies to, right? Sometimes the double operation of factories and the migration as we consolidate.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. It\u2019s a fair point because we had for some of these, we had double-running costs because when you close down a factory, and basically, the receiving end, you have to ramp up already and to get it into the new one. I think that\u2019s important. And that will go away because we have closed down 10 factories last year. We will do another dozen probably until October of this year. So these double-running costs, at least for the 10 we have closed, it\u2019s gone. I think that\u2019s good. And then we had a couple of smaller divestitures versus previous year as well, and that\u2019s impacting it.","Jeff Zekauskas","So, should your Frutarom operating income grow at least $50 million next year as you realize incremental synergy costs? Or that\u2019s not the right number? I mean, even if the business doesn\u2019t grow at all?","Rustom Jilla","Sorry. I was going to cut in there. That number is the right number, but it\u2019s going to be spread across the three businesses, the business units. Well, 2, as we go into next year.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. Because -- and let me explain why many of the savings are coming from procurement. And we see procurement synergies also in the Scent business because we just get some of the raw materials to better price, transportation. We have significant savings, for example, of packaging material, and that\u2019s the reason why you see it in the different businesses as well. But in general, the number is right.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andreas Fibig for any final or closing remarks.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. Thank you very much for the discussion and the good questions. I hope I will see many of you during CAGNY, next week. That\u2019s number one. And then, we have certainly, as usual, a lot of one-o-ones planned. Have a good day. And see you soon.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time."],"11632":["International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. Participants will be announced by their name and company. In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of one question per person.","I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Global Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau - VP, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening everyone. Welcome to IFF's third quarter 2015 conference call. Yesterday we distributed press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements.","During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2015. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty.","For additional information concerning factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 2, 2015 and our press release that we filed yesterday.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes those items that we believe affects comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release.","With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; our Executive Vice President and CFO, Alison Cornell; our Group President of Flavors, Matthias Haeni; and our Group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz.","We will start with prepared remarks from Andreas and Alison and then the entire team will be available for any questions that you may have.","Before turning the call over to Andreas, I would like to let you know that we continue to explore options to improve our liquidity on Euronext Paris. We remain optimistic that we can enhance our liquidity on Euronext to allow more European investors access to our shares. We will continue to keep you updated on our progress as we move forward.","With that, I would now like to now introduce our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mike. I would like to start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter. In addition, similar how we structured the quarter two conference call, I want to provide an update on the execution of our four-pillar Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, I'll ask Alison to review our financial results in greater detail, including the specifics on each business unit; as well as our cash flow statement and our outlook for the balance of the year.","I'm pleased to report that our financial results for the third quarter accelerated versus our second quarter performance. Both in terms of currency-neutral sales and currency-neutral adjusted operating profit growth, as we continue to benefit from diversity of our business as well as our recent acquisitions.","Currency-neutral sales in the third quarter improved 7%, including approximately 3 percentage point relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Organic top-line performance, which increased 4% this quarter, continued to be driven by new wins, particularly in Fragrance Compounds by the contribution of new wins were the highest level in nearly two years. This was favorable to profitability as adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS both grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis.","On a year-to-date base, results remain strong, as currency-neutral sales growing 6% comprised of 8% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances.","For the first nine months in 2015, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 9% on currency-neutral basis, driven by sales growth, the benefit of productivity programs and manufacturing and RSA cost leverage. Complementing our expansion in gross margin and adjusted operating profit margin, lower interest expense, a more favorable effective tax rate and the reduction of our shares outstanding led to an 11% increase in our currency-neutral adjusted EPS.","From a strategic perspective, I would like to talk about a couple of areas. In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position defined by number one or two market share position, we believe we are taking the right steps to deliver on our ambition of accelerated growth.","North America, the Flavors team has done a nice job integrating our recent acquisition of Ottens Flavors, leveraging their defined go-to-market strategy, which focuses on winning with key regional accounts in the U.S.","Our Flavors North America business was up 19%. In Flavors Latin America, our proprietary delivery system continues to perform well, as evident with its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The third quarter growth was very strong, up 20% on a currency-neutral basis.","Within Fragrance, North America Fragrance Compounds grew 7%, with 8% growth in Consumer Fragrances and a 4% growth in Fine Fragrance. The quarter three sub category performance that we're most notable in North America were Hair Care and Home Care both of which grew double digits, plus Fabric Care which grew high-single digits.","The third quarter, China Fragrances, another area where we have ambitions to accelerate growth grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis, as we continue to have success with many of the strong regional Consumer Fragrance brands. From a category perspective, Home Care, another area of focus for us, improved high single-digits globally, on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in North America and Latin America.","Delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrance continues to drive growth. The strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverage continued in the third quarter, driven by our industry-leading encapsulation technology in Fragrances and proprietary delivery systems in Flavors.","Fabric Care grew double-digits on a currency-neutral basis in the third quarter, with all geographic markets posting strong growth. This is a direct result of our differentiated encapsulation technology.","Given our success in Fabric Care, we have begun to expand into other categories as well. In the third quarter, while still early in terms of strategic execution, we have seen strong results in encapsulation-related sales in Toiletries and Home Care, both which grew double digits.","Supporting the expansion of this technology into more categories, our R&D team developed the next generation capsule technology that allows us to further penetrate personal care applications.","This technology should allow us to efficiently customize solutions to deliver Fragrance at the points desired by consumers.","In Fragrances, building on our legacy of pioneering first, one of our Vision 2020 goals is to launch more new captive molecules to give our perfumers a competitive edge, when creating the next-generation fragrance. Tracking this initiative, we have recently launched two new highly-anticipated ingredients to our perfumers, cosmo fruit (07:48), which is a high impact complex fruity note with spicy undertones and crystal fizz, which is a watery, fresh, aldehydic note to be used internally by our perfumers as exclusive IFF molecules, which we are not selling externally.","And as we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to commercialize two additional molecules, which would bring our commercialized molecules to four this year. If successful, this would effectively put us on track to double our annual Fragrance molecule output average over the past decade, providing us with greater confidence in our accelerated growth ambition. As I mentioned, moments ago in Flavors, our proprietary delivery system continues to perform well.","This technology expanding beyond just Latin America with proprietary delivery system-related sales growing strong double-digits globally. Sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continue to produce strong results, increasing strong double-digits. The categories where we had the most success were Savory, Dairy and Beverage, as our innovative solutions are allowing our customers to meet the demands of the consumers who are looking for better-for-you products, including reduced sugar and salt.","To complement this, I'm pleased to announce that we have also commercialized a new natural taste modulator, the second one this year, which is a sour masker designed to reduce the salt perception without the changing the product's acidity, particularly useful for yogurts and juice applications.","This addition will strengthen our modulation capabilities as it provides our flavors, a more competitive palate to build winning solutions.","Building on our robust technology pipeline is critical. The third quarter is an example that we're making strong progress against key initiatives that will lead to greater differentiation and ultimately accelerated growth.","In addition to the strides we have made from market share and innovation perspective, we also made progress in our never-ending quest to become our customers' partner of choice. To meet the growing trends in naturals, in October 2015, IFF-LMR Naturals received its fourth For Life Social Responsibility designation, this time in cooperation with our Vetiver partner in Haiti. The For Life designation recognizes an organization's adherence to specific sustainability criteria, including transparency, environmental responsibility, fair working conditions and positive relations with producers and local communities.","This recognition comes after the certification of IFF-LMR Naturals for the rose supply chain in Turkey and its patchouli basil supply chain in Madagascar. When it comes to sustainability, we won't accept the status quo. Recently we became the first Flavors and Fragrance company to join TfS and enter into growing consortium of multinational companies committed to ensuring sustainable practices throughout the supply chain.","We also were recognized by the CDP, earning a perfect score of 100 in disclosure and an A in performance for its strategies and actions to mitigate climate change. Sustainability is foundational to our Vision 2020 business strategy, and we are committed to embedding sustainability throughout our business practices and our corporate culture for the years to come.","We also won the North America innovation award with one of our largest Flavors customers, which recognizes partners for their thought leadership. In addition, Est\u00e9e Lauder also presented us with their Supplier Excellence award, an achievement designed to acknowledge their top performing business partners.","I'm pleased to also announce that at the 2015 In-Cosmetics Asia Lucas Meyer Cosmetics won the Gold Award for the Innovation Zone Best Active Ingredients with Exo-P, a patented ingredient designed to rapidly improve dull skin for healthy looking complexion in only seven days.","And also won the Gold Award of Innovation Zone Best Functional Ingredient with Lecigel, an ingredient scientifically measured using various techniques developed by specialists in psychology and neuroscience, which provides a positive emotion upon application. With a focus on the future and in terms of business participation in the years to come, we also reaffirmed and expanded our core list status with key Flavors customers, two based in North America and one globally; and also our largest Fragrance customer in the third quarter.","As you know, core lists are paramount to winning future business within our industry. Being added to a new core list shows that we are able to bring the right R&D capabilities, consumer insights, regulatory requirements and customers' trust needed to create the winning products in the marketplace.","During the second quarter and third quarter, we completed two acquisitions, which focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio. I'm pleased to report that both acquisitions are performing very well. Ottens Flavors' organic sales on a standalone basis increased low double-digits, above our North American base business, which improved sequentially. And Lucas Meyer Cosmetics achieved strong double-digit currency-neutral sales growth on a standalone basis. We believe these results are good indications that we are putting our capital to work to drive accelerated performance in terms of growth and return.","Following the end of the third quarter, we also announced the partnership with Vapor Communications to pioneer the digital future of scent. Combining certain Vapor software and hardware scent platform with IFF scent technology and expertise, the collaboration is anticipated to bring mobile scent experiences to consumers. And while this is an initial step, we believe the technologies developed by Vapor Communications to play an important role in our larger digital scent journey and Vision 2020.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alison, who will take you through the financials in greater detail.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Andreas. Looking at our third quarter results, similar to what I did on our Q2 conference call, I want to continue to lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to our adjusted currency-neutral results. In the first column, which is inclusive of currency, sales contracted by 1%, while adjusted operating profit increased 7% and adjusted EPS grew 5%.","Consistent with what we communicated previously, in the third quarter, we benefited from our euro transactional hedging program, which ultimately protected our euro-denominated profits. Including this benefit, our growth rate in terms of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS accelerated to 7% and 5% versus the 1% and 4% we reported in the first half respectively.","Yet, even with the benefits of hedging, foreign exchange still proved to be a headwind in the third quarter, as the U.S. dollar remains strong against many global currencies. From a sales adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS perspective, currency represented an 8 percentage point, 3 percentage point and 5 percentage point impact respectively.","On a currency-neutral basis, we continued to deliver strong results, achieving leverage within our P&L with sales improving 7% and adjusted operating profit growing 10%. The increase in adjusted operating profit was driven by gross margin expansion and cost leverage, which led to an approximately 50 basis point improvement in currency-neutral adjusted operating profit margin.","Currency-neutral adjusted EPS also improved by 10%, as the year-over-year decrease in our average shares outstanding resulting from our share repurchase program offset a slightly higher effective tax rate and an increase in interest expense relating to both of our acquisitions. The acquisitions we made earlier this year are adding to our performance, evidence that we are investing in strategic value add opportunities that deliver high returns. In the third quarter, the acquisitions of Ottens and Lucas Meyer added approximately 3 points to currency-neutral sales growth, about 2 points to currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, and 3 points to currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth.","It should be noted that the amortization of intangibles relating to the Ottens and Lucas Meyer acquisitions represented about $3.5 million in the quarter. If we add this back to understand the cash component of the business, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS growth would have improved another two percentage points to 12% respectively on a currency-neutral basis.","Pausing here, I would like to provide you with some insight into the trends we saw throughout the quarter. In September, while at a sell-side investor conference, I made some cautionary comments relating to our organic business. Following the Chinese currency devaluation, we saw several customers take a more cautious approach to managing their inventory, which ultimately meant sequential softness as we progress through the quarter. This perpetuated, particularly in emerging markets, which while still positive, up 3% in Q3, was slower than our first half performance of 8%, despite relatively strong performance in Latin America.","And while we remain fully committed to the long-term growth of these key markets, in the short-term, we're working to manage the uncertainty and focusing on the levers we can pull to deliver results and strengthen our business. Fortunately, we experienced strong orders the last week of the quarter, leading to the 4% organic growth rate we reported in Q3, ahead of where we thought we would finish the quarter.","Turning to business unit performance; Flavors posted its 43rd consecutive quarter of growth, increasing 8%, including approximately 4.5 percentage points relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth, with the strongest results in Beverage and Dairy. In our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, sales increased 4%, led by high-single digit growth in Beverage.","Western Europe reported the highest growth, improving 9%, driven by strong new win performance. North America grew 19%, reflecting additional sales related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and high double-digit growth in Dairy.","If we exclude the benefit of Ottens, organic performance improved sequentially versus Q2, up low-single digits. Latin America increased 20%, as all categories reported positive growth. The strong double-digit trend in Beverage continued for the eighth consecutive quarter, led by our proprietary delivery system. Savory and Dairy also grew double-digits, as a result of strong new win performance, which leverages our proprietary delivery system, as well as our modulation portfolio. Greater Asia remained constant, as growth in Indonesia, India, Singapore and Japan was offset by softness in China, which was primarily driven by a challenging economic environment.","Flavors' currency-neutral segment profit improved approximately 9%, as gross margin expansion and cost and productivity benefit more than offset the inclusion of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. This led to a 10 basis point improvement in operating profit margin, despite incremental cost in Q3 relating to the China order issue. If we exclude this impact, our operating margin would have expanded by 80 basis points in the third quarter, or growth would have been 12%. It should be noted, however, that we expect a portion of this expense to continue as we work through this issue. Specifically in Q4, we would expect the similar impact in terms of expense as we experienced in Q3.","Fragrances' currency-neutral sales improved 6%, including approximately 2 percentage points associated with the acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, with all regions posting growth, led by high single-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single digit improvement in Greater Asia.","From a category perspective, Fine Fragrance was up 1%, led by Europe, Africa and the Middle-East, which improved 5%, as a result of very strong pipeline of new wins, including Olympea by Pouge (21:23) from Paco Rabanne; Bosta Scent (21:25) by Procter and Gamble; La Vie Belle Intense by Lanc\u00f4me from L'Or\u00e9al; and Jimmy Choo Illicit by Interparfums.","In Latin America, economic conditions, particularly in Brazil continue to have an impact on discretionary spending and ultimately our Fine Fragrance performance. Yet, while sales were down, they improved versus the second quarter. And even as the economy is soft, we continue to see our win rate remain high, which we believe will support our market leadership position as the economy stabilizes. I also want to put our Fine Fragrance results in Greater Asia into perspective relative to our global Fragrance business.","Proportionately, Greater Asia Fine Fragrances represented approximately 2% of our global Fine Fragrance sales, which means quarterly order patterns can have a substantial impact on growth rates as it did in Q1, when Fine Fragrance in Greater Asia was up almost 40%. And as the market is relatively small in terms of per capita usage now, we believe it will increase over time as we stated in our Vision 2020 strategy.","For the 16th consecutive quarter, Consumer Fragrances continued to grow, up 7% with mid-to-high single-digits in every region in broad-based category growth led by double-digit growth in Fabric Care and high-single-digit growth in Hair Care.","In Fabric, thanks in large part to our local knowledge as a consumer and our encapsulated technology, growth was the strongest in Greater Asia, where we are wining with local customers. And in Hair Care, growth was the best in Latin America, as we have the ability to offer exceptional fragrances in non-traditional categories that meet the consumers' desire for lower-cost alternatives.","Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 6%, driven by the acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, which closed on July 30. Sales related to cosmetic actives grew high double-digits in Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and the U.S., all a result of new wins.","Our base Fragrance Ingredients business, which as a reminder are the external sales that we do not use for our internal compounds production, remained soft, reflecting more challenging market conditions, including our largest Fragrance Ingredients customer rationalizing their portfolio, as well as our prioritization of capacity to further strengthen our internal Fragrance Compounds business as evidenced by high-single digit internal demand growth.","On a profit perspective, Fragrance currency-neutral segment profit improved approximately 15%, driven by volume growth and benefits from cost and productivity initiatives. This performance, plus lower incentive compensation expense, led to over 150 basis point improvement in operating profit margin.","From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continued to show improvement as a percentage of sales versus the same period in 2014, as our five quarter rolling average figure through the end of the third quarter was down 80 basis points to approximately 28.8% of our trailing 12-month sales.","All of our gains versus the first nine months of 2014 came from lower payables, as our days payable outstanding increased 9% versus the same period a year ago.","Operating cash flow from operations at the end of the third quarter was $295 million, including an incremental $27 million pension contribution so far this year. Excluding the incremental pension contribution, operating cash flow would have increased to $322 million, or 40 basis points in terms of adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of sales, from 13.6% during the first nine months of 2014 to 14% for the equivalent period in 2015.","Looking at our uses of cash, capital expenditure on a year-to-date basis have been $67 million or 2.9% of sales, as we continue to make investments to support our growth initiatives. Principally, as we finish our plants in Turkey and Indonesia, and while we are a little low on a capital spend year-to-date relative to our full year guidance, we expect to finish approximately 4.5%, as spending traditionally flows through during the fourth quarter each year.","For cash returned to shareholders, we expect to continue to deliver a total payout ratio in line with our 50% to 60% target, all while maintaining financial flexibility to capitalize upon organic growth opportunities and value-creating M&A.","Dividend payments year-to-date have been $114 million, following our 20% increase this past August. Share repurchases at the end of the quarter were $81 million, allowing us to buy back approximately 726,000 shares at an average price of $111.88 per share.","Please note that as of Friday, we have repurchased approximately $21 million of shares since the end of the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $102 million. From a guidance perspective, we are reconfirming our full-year 2015 guidance, despite the challenging year ago fourth quarter comparison, which includes approximately 200 basis points of growth related to the 53rd week, as well as continued market uncertainty, which is leading to volatility in order patterns for many of our multinational customers.","Despite continued growth in Latin America and Europe, Africa and the Middle East driven by new wins, our core Flavor business is expected to be soft in the fourth quarter. In North America, we expect pressure due to a higher level of volume erosion as businesses we won in previous years are not performing at the same levels as they have historically. We are also seeing general volume weakness in North America, with several of our food and beverage customers reporting volume challenges. In Greater Asia, we expect similar trends through the third quarter as we believe the economic uncertainty in China will continue to impact our business.","In core Fragrances, we expect continued pressure in Fragrance Ingredients, primarily related to the largest customer continuing its rationalization of their portfolio. In Fragrance Compounds, we expect our strong year-ago comparison, the weakness in the Brazilian economy, and our strong year-to-date performance, particularly in Consumer Fragrances will lead to growth moderating in Q4. Fortunately, we expect a benefit from our recent acquisitions, which we believe should lead to moderate currency-neutral sales growth in the fourth quarter.","In terms of profitability, on a full-year basis, we continue to believe we can achieve approximately 9% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The drivers for our profitability performance include top-line growth, benefits of productivity initiatives, lower incentive compensation expense and the inclusion of acquisitions.","Bridging our performance to include the impact of currency, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus many global currencies will have an impact. The weakening euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our large currency exposure at about 40% of operating profit is expected to have the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies were small in terms of profitability exposure as all weakened considerably versus the U.S. dollar and are collectively pressuring profitability. Mitigating this exposure, we expect approximately a 3 percentage point gain from our transactional euro-hedging program.","Incorporating the foreign exchange impact on our full-year guidance, we would expect reported sales to be down approximately 1%, including approximately a 7 percentage point impact from currency, as we do not hedge our translational exposure. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect about a 4% increase, despite an approximately 5 percentage point headwind of currency.","With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Alison. I briefly want to reiterate that despite ongoing volatility in several key markets around the world, we were able to deliver strong financial results in the third quarter, thanks in large part to the diversity of our business, as well as the benefits associated with our recent acquisitions.","Also, based on our strong year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we continue to believe we can deliver 6% currency-neutral sales growth and approximately 9% adjusted operating profit growth both on a currency-neutral basis.","Going forward, continuing our execution of Vision 2020 is a top priority for us. Vision 2020 is focused on increasing differentiation, accelerating profitable growth and creating shareholder value. All three of which we believe are achievable in the years to come.","With that, I would now like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",". And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks and good morning everybody. Wanted to get some clarity on the fourth quarter expectations from a revenue standpoint. So, if you back out the benefit of acquisitions, are you talking about flattish organic like-for-like, however you want to think about it, sales growth? And then sort of more broadly elaborating on sales growth, I know it's early, but how do you think about 2016 just broadly given continued pressure from customer volumes, as well as the tough first quarter comparisons?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Mark, from a Q4 perspective, we expect to be flat to slightly positive. We have our first month of orders in, which are positive and although one month doesn't make the quarter, it reflects positive results there. If we look into 2016, specifically Q1, while we're still in our budget process, remember in Q1 of 2016 we're facing our toughest comps year-on-year in terms of growth comparison, specifically in, say, Flavors where we grew 9% in Q1 of 2015. So at this point in time as we enter the year we're facing our toughest comps and so we expect Q1 to be challenging. But as we traditionally do expect to share more in our February call regarding our 2016 full-year guidance.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Just elaborating on that though, again preliminary as it is, do you expect long-term targets to be attainable given what's going on from a customer standpoint?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, at this point, as I mentioned, we're still in our budget process and we really don't want to comment further on 2016.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Just quickly on gross margin. So ex the hedge gain this year, will gross margin \u2013 would it still be positive in 2015 and then how do you think about expansion on a longer-term basis if you normalize for that and say on a longer-term basis how should we think about gross margins?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Mark, let me talk first about \u2013 so in Q3, our adjusted gross profit margin expanded 170 basis points. And this was driven by our currency heading benefits, as we hedge our raw material purchases to protect our transactional exposure, as well as our cost and productivity savings, volume growth and mix improvement.","In Q3, there was roughly a $9.5 million benefit from our hedge, which was included in the gross \u2013 in our gross profit. This accounted for the majority of the expansion, but there was also benefit, as I mentioned, from cost and productivity savings, volume growth and mix improvement. As we move into Q4, we expect our currency hedging benefit to be a little less than half of the expansion in Q4, with the other half coming from cost and productivity savings initiatives, minus volume growth and M&A. We believe that our \u2013 there is sustainability of gross margin expansion, excluding the FX hedge, as we enter into Q4. As we look in 2016, from a raw materials' perspective, based on what we've seen so far, it's similar to 2015, where we've seen naturals are up, synthetics are slightly down and if anything we're probably flat to slightly up.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. So just speaking following on that question. In the Q, there was a mention of some derivative gains that are going to be reclassified as income next year. So does that also flow through gross margin, so maybe kind of takes the place of these raw material hedging gains?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Lauren, let me talk a bit about that. And so, we indicated on our Investor Day that we intended to finance our M&A activity through balance sheet leverage. And so between Ottens and Lucas Meyer acquisitions, we executed about $500 million in acquisitions. Initially these were paid for using our existing credit facility and on-hand cash, and now we're looking at longer-term financing opportunities to better align our maturities with the nature of those acquisition.","So in September, we entered into interest swaps in anticipation of a long term debt financing and the deferred charges in that table and our 10-Q are being accounted for right now as a hedging instrument, as they are related to these swaps. We still are in the process of evaluating our options for financing and at this point, we haven't finalized the timing or nature of the financing and we expect to have more clarity on that in Q1 of next year.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's great. But is that also \u2013 does that conversation cover, I think there was like $8.7 million that was in comprehensive income that was called out as being reclassified over the next 12 months. Are those the swaps?","Michael DeVeau - VP, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Lauren, it's Mike. It's okay. Maybe just as I go through the Q, maybe we can touch base offline on that, I'm not sure...","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, absolutely.","Michael DeVeau - VP, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","We're following from that point (37:02). Okay.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Absolutely. Okay. And then just on Asia Flavors, so I was surprised that flat just felt very strong to me given the commentary at our conference in September and I know, Alison, you talked about strong orders the last week of the quarter. Was that comment specific to Asia Flavors and what have you seen from those customers in the first month? You said that overall orders were up, but I just wondered about the volatility or choppiness of orders from that particular customer base you've been concerned about.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Lauren, you did comment \u2013 we did experience softness in China, so if you looked at China by itself, as a subset for Greater Asia in Flavors, it was negative growth. Why it looks flat is because there was offsetting growth in Indonesia, India, Singapore and Japan. And so that's really why it looks flat.","I'll ask, Matthias to comment on what we've seen so far in October in terms of the customer make-up.","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Well, Lauren, good morning. We have seen a very similar pattern also in the first month of the quarter. I think we made good in-road with new business in all the markets, Alison just referred to, yet we see also continuous challenges in China. We expect that these challenges will continue throughout the quarter, and we're working very diligently with the team, with our customers to strengthen our business in China. And we're still good and confident that we will see a reverse situation in the quarters to come.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just finally on Fine Fragrance, you called out some of the strength, some of the pipeline still on really great new wins in Europe. So does the outlook sort of assume that all the sell-in is kind of done that would cover holiday sell-through of those wins?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Nicolas?","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","Hi, Lauren. This is Nicolas.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi.","Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances","Yes, you're right, very strong pipeline of the new wins, and as you pointed out, it's really to cover the period of Christmas. So according to the way the sales progress at the retail level, we will see what will be the replenishment (39:17) from our customers.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mike Sison of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Nice quarter.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just trying to getting a feel for the tempo of demand. It looks \u2013 I think you sort of noted that fourth-quarter currency adjusted sales growth will be slower. So what are your customers telling you? Are things actually slowing or stable? Just trying to get an understanding in both Flavors and Fragrances where the tempo of demand is headed.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mike, this is Andreas, I'm taking that. What we see is that for some of our \u2013 particularly our global customers the volumes are slowing, but it's actually not a one-fits-all answer, because we see in some areas like still Latin America on the Flavor side, we see strong growth as in the third quarter, which is really double digit. We see countries in Asia with strong growth for both businesses. And we see Europe at least on, for our business, recovering as well.","So at the end of the day, it's a very mixed picture region-by-region. The only thing which is probably universal is that the volume for some of the global customers is really challenged. So that's how I would comment on that one, so it's very different and it depends also on the technologies and let me elaborate on that. If you have a technology, which helps the customers to grow the business like our Sweetness Modulation for example, which we are selling very well or the encapsulation on the Fragrance side, then the wins are strong and you really can even against the market trends make great strides. I know it's probably not a general satisfying answer, but it's a very diverse picture we are dealing with here.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. I understand. And then your acquisitions have performed really well, it seems. Can you talk about your pipeline given that could be a good use of cash and growth going forward?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, you mean the pipeline for M&A?","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Of acquisitions, yes. Are you seeing good opportunities out there?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So what we do is, we look at with different lenses at the market, what kind of technology would be valuable for us? Second, where do we need, let's say, a local or regional strengthening of our presence or with certain customers, and in general, good quality companies like we have done with Ottens and Lucas Meyer. So we have a good pipeline, I can't comment further on this one, but we are further looking.","And the good thing is that the acquisitions are going very well in terms of the integration. So it means after many years with very little M&A activity, I think, the organization is doing very well to get these quality assets into our portfolio, and they performed actually very well.","Just one remark on the skin care or active cosmetic ingredients side, we are very pleased what we see in this market segment because it has just a higher growth than our core markets. So, all-in-all very positive, we have a pipeline and we will, let's say, continue our path here.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I just want to be sure that I can interpret your results reasonably. So what you said was that your adjusted sales were down 1% and your operating profit was up 7%. I assume that that includes the hedge gains and that if the hedge gains are excluded the operating profit is probably flat to up and in your adjusted currency neutral, where you grow sales 7% and your operating profit 10%, I assume that that excludes the hedge gains and other currency gains. Is that correct?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I'm going to ask Rich O'Leary to answer that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Richard O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Jeff, it's Rich. So, yeah, I think there's two things to think about. When we talk about the margin evolution because the hedge gains are in there on a reported basis, we'll show the year \u2013 we'll talk to the year-over-year impact. When we're going to currency neutral, we did what we basically do is restate last year's to reflect the current year gains. So we're stripping out the year-over-year impact and we're making consistent year-over-year from the cash flow hedging impact.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So the hedges are \u2013 so again, so the hedges and the currency gains are stripped out of currency neutral, but the hedge gains are included in the first presentation, in the sales contracting 1% and operating profit up 7%?","Richard O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Well, on a sales basis, we don't hedge the sales line.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Exactly right. It's really the operating profit that's the issue.","Richard O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So on an operating profit when we talk reported-to-reported, it will have the year-over-year impact of the cash flow hedging, either gains or losses; in the case of 2015, it's gains. When we go to currency neutral, we just reflect the current year impact of the gains, so we're not having a year-over-year impact because last year's cash flow hedging impact is really related to 2013 and so we're stripping that two-year basis out.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And then in the course of the call you talked about a $9 million benefit, but when you go to the Q, it looks like it's something more like a $7 million benefit in terms of the cash flow hedging. Why the $9 million instead of the $7 million or what's the extra amount that's added on to the cash flow hedge benefit?","Richard O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Again, that's the difference between \u2013 it's more or less \u2013 it's the difference between when we're trying to reconcile \u2013 when we're trying to talk to the change year-over-year for example in gross margin. Those are reported-to-reported and that's where you have the year-over-year impact, which is the higher number. When we talk to the operating profit impact, we strip out the last year's impact.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hi, good morning.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael DeVeau - VP, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Good morning, Faiza.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. So I just had a few clarifying questions first. One, I think at the Back-to-School Conference you had talked about local currency sales growth of 6% for the year with even contribution from acquisitions and organic growth. So does that still stand or should we expect a larger contribution from organic growth now?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, when I talked about even distribution at the Back-to-School Conference, I mean, some of it was relative to rounding as well. So, I would think about it as a 3.5% organic, about 2.5% acquisition related, to get to the 6%.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to talk a little bit more about Latin America, particularly on the Flavors side. Some of your competitors have been talking about a potential pricing benefit in Latin America. I don't know if that's because they're euro denominated and it's different for you. So maybe if you could talk about are you able to take some pricing in certain markets or categories to offset currency?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, let me start by making a comment in terms of comparison. And so when looking company-to-company, we need to make sure that things are compared on an apples-to-apples basis, organic-to-organic basis and comparable currency related to FX, because I think as reflected in reports, taken as written, they're not comparable. So I think you need to make sure before you compare two companies, you make sure that they are comparable. So with that let me ask Matthias to talk about Latin America market dynamics.","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Faiza, we're really traveling well with the many new wins, which we had this year. We also feel very confident that we will continue to commercialize many of the projects, which we have. We have an exciting project pipeline throughout the region. Yes, we face some challenges on current volumes and we will offset it however with new wins, we feel good about it. We always reported that we had very good in-roads in Beverages. We're now expanding more also into Savory, into the Dairy category. And frankly overall, we'll feel pretty good about it also in Q4.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","If I could, just one more comment, just so you know what we do in your apples-to-apples comparison. We fully restate all currency.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then could you maybe just tell us what percentage of the Flavors business is LatAm or maybe what percentage of the LatAm business is Flavors just so we could size it because the growth just seems really strong at 20%, so I'm just wondering is it \u2013 if you could talk about are these local customers, sort of what the size might be, maybe expand a little bit more on that?","Michael DeVeau - VP, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Yeah, Faiza, it's Michael. I mean, we traditionally don't disclose from a Flavor standpoint our percentage of business. I think as you think about it, it's probably our smallest region with respect to the other regions that we have globally, but from a business standpoint maybe Matthias, if you want to provide additional commentary.","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Yes, Mike outlined the smallest region, yet from a growth perspective for us very sizable, very impactful. We feel very good about the in-roads we make and I'm confident that we are gaining great market share in Latin America. Again what we are reporting here is the all like-for-like, this is currency neutral, there is no element of pricing in it, but volume and new wins.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Feeney with Athlos.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jon.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Could you give us a sense how large right now the naturals business is globally for you and what its growth is and what sort of growth rate are you expecting in the naturals business across categories over the next couple of years?","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Well, from a Flavor perspective, we have probably more than 50% of all the new briefs, which we are working on are calling for natural solutions, natural Flavors. We feel excited about the many requests for natural modulators. I cannot exactly give you an indication of the overall market growth. The underlying market growth of naturals, we only realize that definitely naturals are outperforming any other product offerings in the marketplace. It's not only here in North America where more and more consumers they're looking to organics, (51:24) organic and natural. We see very same trends around the world, in Western Europe but also in many mature markets in Asia, in particular.","We have also a higher win rate in naturals as such, as we are well positioned for it and frankly, we see all these requests and all these briefs as exciting opportunities for us to accelerate growth.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","I got you. Thank you. Just a couple follow-ups on that, if you don't mind. You said more than 50% of all new briefs, but of the existing business can you give me a sense of how much revenue right now is going from \u2013 is in products that are already sort of meeting those kinds of natural specifications. And the second question is typically with these new briefs, does that involve a higher pricing or fully developed margin to IFF in the Flavors business as you reformulate with naturals?","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","Let me take first the question on the margin profiles. Whenever we are in a position to bring technology into a product offering, we typically have a higher margin profile. When it comes to 50% plus on naturals, keep in mind that we still have a lot of developing markets where natural as such may not necessarily be the major call. I'm referring here to many developing markets also in Africa and Middle East and in many other parts of the world.","To the question on what the total percentage of the portfolio of natural is all about and we are not sharing this information. We feel good about what we currently have and frankly we made very good in-roads.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And just to further comment in terms of model, we have a cost-plus model and relative to naturals as well.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Cost plus. So that's actually very helpful, Alison. So when you say cost plus meaning your margin in terms of dollars tends to stay flat and you charge up on that, so you might see higher \u2013 same or higher penny profit, but lower percentage margin or do you actually \u2013 when you say cost plus, is it a percentage of cost?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so essentially what it means is if costs go up, the price goes up.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Right.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We maintain the margin.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Okay. But your \u2013 is that \u2013 I guess that's a simple question. Is it a margin expansion opportunity in terms of total dollars coming into IFF when someone replaces, typically speaking, replaces an artificial with a natural product.","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, not in and of itself.","Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors","It is more important, Jon, what kind of categories, whether it is Beverage or Savory that makes a difference in terms of the portability or margin perspective. But not whether it's synthetic or natural.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your last question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, good morning, John.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Sometimes your incentive compensation accruals in a quarter can be different from the other quarters, but the change in business tone in the fourth quarter, would you expect to under accrue or reverse any incentive compensation in the fourth quarter?","Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So we can say this about incentive compensation, because we do not enclose our incentive compensation numbers other than calling out a variance and so I can't give you an exact number. I would say, it's marginally favorable in Q3, but will be a larger benefit in Q4, based on our projected performance.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, secondly, when you talked about your global customers seeing some slowdown, it sounds like in the developed markets you're still seeing the smaller customers outperform the larger customers. I think that's a trend we've seen for several quarters now.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Absolutely, John. That's what we see in many markets that the smaller and regional customers have just good growth rates. And if you're with these customers and then you really can do very well \u2013 very good business. And that was actually one of the reasons why we acquired Ottens here for Flavors in the U.S. and just participating in that segment of the market, a bit better in the U.S.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane. Heidi, your line is open. You may need to un-mute on your end.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Sorry, hi, I'm back. I wanted to go back to the naturals question. I heard from some other ingredients company, slightly different for Flavors, but still in naturals that a lot of the smaller companies have been faster at reformulating into naturals and we've seen a lot of reformulation announcements from the globals, but they still tend to be in the discussion or testing stage and we haven't actually seen the big volumes come through. Would you agree with this or are you already benefiting from this trend? Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Heidi. I totally agree and support this, I think we have seen that smaller companies are faster in the implementation and they're also much faster in the replacement of either artificial nature identical (56:56) into natural. We see them launching more innovative product solutions and we expect that the larger accounts they will follow in the quarters to come.","Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.","Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thank you very much. Thank you much for your time. Good quarter, quarter three, we are on track for year 2015, and I believe we will have a good trajectory for years to come. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference.

I would now like to introduce Shelley Young, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Shelley Young","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to IFF third quarter 2013 conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our third quarter 2013 financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our website at iff.com. Please note this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay for up to 1 year on our website.","Before turning the call over to our senior management team, I'd like to read our forward-looking statements. Please keep in mind that during the call we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the third quarter and our outlook for the balance of the year. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our risk factors contained in our 2012 10-K filed on February 26, 2013, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today and on our website.","With me this morning are Doug Tough, our Chairman and CEO; Kevin Berryman, our CFO; Nicolas Mirzayantz, our Group President, Fragrances; and Hernan Vaisman, our Group President, Flavors.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Tough.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Shelley. In the third quarter, we achieved strong momentum in many areas of the business, propelled by new wins in both business units and continued execution of our 3-pillar strategy. We are pleased with both our top line and bottom line growth momentum. We delivered local currency sales growth of 4% for the consolidated company, reflecting 5% growth in Fragrances and 3% growth in Flavors.","Both business units benefit from a high, continued level of new wins which are meaningful since they continue to be based on our proprietary technology, the strength of our creation capabilities and our deep understanding of consumer tastes and preferences.","Our overall performance was led by 8% growth in the emerging markets. For the first half of 2013, the emerging markets grew at 9.5%. Emerging market growth remains quite high and is more than twice the level of the developed markets. The BRIC countries grew at 9% this quarter, and we also had strong growth in Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey and Singapore.","We continue to believe that our emerging market growth strategy is robust since it is based on providing Fragrance and Flavors to markets where consumer demand and engagement is growing based on increases in disposable income.","This quarter, we also had strong growth in the more mature markets of Western Europe, including France, Spain and Germany. We are very encouraged by the progress we are making in growing all aspects of our portfolio. As you may know, we are not dependent on any one product, country or category for our growth. It is this diversity which provides us with more stability and enables us to achieve ongoing growth.","To provide greater perspective on the top line, we entered the quarter knowing that we faced a more challenging comparison to the prior year. As you may recall in 2012, our local currency sales growth improved meaningfully throughout the year, from 3% in the first half the year to 8.5% in the second half the year. In the quarter, third quarter of 2012, our growth was 7%. Our 4% growth for this year on a 2-year stack basis equates to an average growth of 6%, which is in the range of growth projections for the business.","We are also pleased with the momentum we achieved in the bottom line. The volume gains combined with a stable raw material cost environment resulted in continued expansion in our gross profit margins of 170 basis points over prior year quarter to 44.2%. And we're able to hold our gross margins steady with the second quarter of 2013.","As planned, we reinvested some of this profitability into our R&D platforms so that we can strengthen our foundation for growth in the short term, medium term and longer term. Our adjusted gross margin expansion more than offset the increased research expense of this quarter, including a performance milestone to our biotechnology partner, Amyris, and resulted in operating profit growth of 7%. We also achieved below-the-line leverage in other income and expenses due to a reversal of the foreign exchange losses on working capital that we had experienced last quarter. As a result, our adjusted earnings per share increased 13% over the prior-year quarter.","On a year-to-date basis, our performance is in line with our long-term targets for the business of 4% to 6% top line growth, 7% to 9% operating profit growth and 10%-plus earnings per share growth.","For the first 3 quarters, like-for-like local currency sales growth was 6% and was made up of 6% like-for-like growth for Flavors and 5% growth for Fragrances. This growth was propelled by our emerging market strategy as well as our strong level of new wins.","This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvements in our profitability and metrics. We believe this reflects the strength of our strategies as executed by our global teams and their ability to execute in the marketplace. Year-to-date gross margins are up 210 basis points over prior year, reflecting the success of our strategic improvement initiatives in enhancing our gross margin profile combined with a benign raw material cost environment.","Our adjusted operating profit increased 10%, and at the same time, we were able to invest 8.5% of our sales in R&D. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings per share increased 13%. And given our performance to date and the expected performance in the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver on our long-term targets for 2013.","I would now like to turn the call over to Nicolas Mirzayantz, our Group President, Fragrances.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Thank you, Doug. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter the Fragrance business unit delivered local currency sales growth of 5%, supported by continued high level of new wins as well as continued strong growth in the emerging markets.","Looking at our Fragrance compound business, we delivered local currency growth of 7%, continuing the momentum we saw in the first half of the year. We are very proud of our strong level of new wins which have been at a consistently high level every quarter this year. We have been trending significantly above levels we achieved last year, and the growth we are realizing from our new wins in the first 3 quarters of the year are the highest we have ever experienced since the first quarter of 2011.","This quarter the emerging markets contributed over 70% of the growth in Fragrance Compounds, with double-digit growth in Greater Asia and Latin America. We also achieved strong growth in the developed markets of Asia, including Japan; and Western Europe, including first and foremost, France, where we won a lot of new business this quarter. We also had strong growth in Great Britain.","In Fragrance Ingredients, we are beginning to see signs of stability, reflecting many of the strategic decisions we have made over the past year. This quarter Fragrance Ingredients had flat year-over-year local currency growth with a majority of the product families reporting increased volume. This is an achievement in light of the migration of volume from Fragrance Ingredients to Fragrance Compound this quarter as mentioned on our last call.","Just to give you a better perspective for the progress we are making, if this volume are not shifted to our Fragrance Compounds business, the Ingredient business will have shown 4% growth. We believe we will see more stability going forward. While we do not expect it to be a straight-line trajectory, we believe the overall trend is more stable.","Turning to Fine Fragrance & Beauty Care. We delivered growth of 5% in this category, which reflect double-digit growth in 3 out of 4 regions. Latin America achieved double-digit growth led by high growth in Hair Care and Fine Fragrance, reflecting strong win performance. Greater Asia also achieved double-digit growth, reflecting strength in Hair Care due to strong new wins from global accounts. 10% local currency growth in our EAME region reflects strong growth across the region with strong new wins in Fine Fragrance and Hair Care. In North America, we had double-digit growth in Hair Care, which was offset by a decline in Fine Fragrance as there were no major new launches in the quarter combined with a tougher comparison to 12% growth in the prior year.","In our Functional Fragrance categories, overall local currency sales growth of 8% was led by double-digit volume growth in Fabric Care and Home Care.","Fabric Care had double-digit growth in 3 out of the 4 regions. From a geographic perspective, growth was led by double-digit growth in Greater Asia and Latin America. The growth in Greater Asia and Latin America was led by volume gain in Fabric Care due to the traction we are gaining with key regional customers due to new wins in liquid and powder detergents driven by our deep understanding of local consumers and supported by our expertise in encapsulation technologies.","North America had also solid growth of 7% in Functional Fragrances due to very strong momentum in Home Care based on important new wins and migration of some volume from Fragrance Ingredients to Functional Fragrance.","In EAME, growth was flat in Functional Fragrances. Our double-digit growth in Fabric Care, fueled by the success of our customers' products in the market as well as new wins, was offset by declines in Personal Wash and Home Care due to volume erosion this quarter, which we believe to be temporary.","Looking at our performance for the first 9 months of the year, the Fragrance business unit had growth of 5%, with 8% growth in Fragrance Compound. Fine Fragrance and Beauty Care grew by 7% for the first 9 months, led by double-digit growth in Latin America and strong performance in Greater Asia and EAME. Functional Fragrance increased 8% year-to-date due to very strong growth in the emerging markets.","Turning to our financial results. We are pleased with the performance this quarter. The solid 5% local currency sales growth reflects growth in both our Compounds category, Fine & Beauty Care and Functional Fragrance. All of our categories are supported by our emerging market's presence, which had growth of 11%.","The solid top-line growth in our Compounds business supported continued margin expansion. The improved profitability reflects moderating input costs as well as continued focus on our multiyear restructuring program to improve efficiencies and speed to market. At the same time, we were able to keep our RSA costs as a percentage of sales constant while making investments in R&D. This included a performance milestone payment to our biotechnology partner Amyris for the progress they are making in creating sustainable, cost-effective ingredients for us. As a result of the margin expansion combined with cost discipline, our operating profit increased 24% or $16 million, and our profit margin expanded by 300 basis points. Also, we have been reporting that we are now in a more benign input cost environment. The net impact of the input cost increased we have seen over the past couple of years continues to be a pressure point on our gross margins versus historical levels.","For the Fragrance business, we are still facing headwinds regarding the net impact of price increases and input cost increase on our gross margin. It will take time and additional efforts to get to the point where the needed impact on our margin is breakeven. Kevin will talk more about it during his remarks.","On a year-to-date basis, our segment profit is up 20% over the prior-year period. For the first 9 months of 2013, Fragrance segment profit is $222 million, which is a gain of $37 million over the prior year. Our segment margins on a year-to-date basis are 19.3% or an increase of 230 basis points compared to the prior segment margins. These gains are due to volume growth combined with margin expansion and ongoing cost discipline.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we're entering a more challenging quarter compared with the prior year quarter when, as a reminder, we delivered growth of 15% in Fragrance Compounds and 6% in Ingredients. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect to see continued momentum in our Fine Beauty Care and Functional Fragrance category, offset in part by a decline in Ingredients due to the continued migration of some volume from Fragrance Ingredients to Functional Fragrances. In total, we expect the fourth quarter to deliver continued momentum which would be somewhat muted by the strong comparables to the prior year.","I would like now to turn the call over to Hernan Vaisman, our Group President, Flavors.","Hernan Vaisman","Thank you, Nicolas; and good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter our local currency sales grew by 3%. Although we were disappointed by the lower level of growth this quarter, which we considered to be temporary, we believe that our overall momentum remains intact and that growth will improve next quarter and be more in line with historical growth patterns. We said last quarter that we were substantially completed with the exit of low-margin sales activities. There was a small piece of volume from low-margin sales activities that were exited in the third quarter of 2012. And if we excluded this activity from the prior year's result, then the like-for-like growth for Flavors was 4% this quarter. This marks the 31st quarter of consecutive local currency sales growth for Flavors. Our local currency sales growth was driven by strong level of new wins and continued growth in the emerging markets.","Looking at our new win rate this quarter, we continue to innovate on behalf of our customers to offer them solutions that address consumer demand for products with reduced sugar and salt while still providing them with preferred taste profiles and to provide them with authentic citrus flavorings that enhance customer's Beverage offerings. We continue to win new businesses based on these innovations. This quarter the strong level of new wins, which was in line with its historical levels, was offset by a higher level of erosion on existing business.","Turning to emerging markets, they continue to be a growth driver for us. Although they did not grow at the robust level we have seen in the past, they continue to deliver growth that are propelling our business forward. We experience strong underlying growth in emerging market countries, including Indonesia, Thailand, Russia, Brazil and Mexico.","Turning to the regions. We achieved positive growth in every region. In North America, we delivered growth of 1%. While this was a disappointment, especially when compared to the high single-digit growth we achieved in the prior year, we delivered continued strong results in Beverage and Savory. The strong growth we achieved in Beverage from a citrus platform and Savory on account of our Flavors modifiers was offset by declines in Beverage this quarter. In addition, although we are not longer reporting the impact of like-for-like volume, there was a small piece of Sweet business in the last year's numbers which distorted our results. Readjusted both years, the exit of these low-margin sales activity growth in North America would have been 4%.","In our EAME region, local currency sales growth of 3% was led by strong growth in Sweet, Beverage and Savory. That said, this quarter we achieved solid growth in Central, South and Eastern Europe and throughout the Middle East and Africa.","In Latin America, local currency sales grew 7%. We continued to grow our market share due to strong momentum in Beverages, which dropped high single-digit growth in the region. This strong performance was partially offset by high single-digit declines in Sweet. On a country level, Brazil, our largest Latin America market, had a strong growth, followed by Argentina and Mexico. Our largest region, Greater Asia, continues to perform well, even though it compares to 9% growth in the prior year quarter.","Looking at our end-use categories, Greater Asia had 4% local currency sales growth on a mid single-digit growth in Savory, Sweet and Beverage, driven by new win performance. The best performing country within our Greater Asia region in term of the dollar growth was Indonesia, with double-digit growth this quarter. However, we are seeing lower growth in India, where the economic environment is impacting our customers.","As you know, we substantially completed the exit of low-margin sales activities last quarter. This effort took more than 6 quarters to complete, but it enable us, using the tools of economic profit, to focus on our energies on research against those categories that are most advantaged while working with our customers to fix those sales activities which were not providing us with an adequate margin. As a result, we estimate that our margins have improved by 90 basis points due to these changes we have made to our portfolio.","Turning now to profitability. We delivered strong performance again this quarter, owing to our ability to provide innovative [indiscernible] solution to our customers and help them to grow their market share with new products that appeal to the targeted consumers. The local currency growth of 3% when combined with a net impact of moderated input costs and pricing delivered enhanced margins, which was somewhat offset by R&D spending and investment in the regions. Flavors' third quarter segment profit increased 7% or $5 million to $81 million, and the profit margins improved 80 points to 23.2%.","On a year-to-date basis, Flavors' like-for-like growth is 6%. Our order book indicates that we have started the fourth quarter with strong growth. Looking ahead, we expect to see increased momentum in the fourth quarter, propelled by growth in emerging markets. We expect that our focus on controlling costs should allow us to sustain momentum and finish 2013 with a strong operational performance.","In closing, the investment we are making in Greater Asia region will put us in a strong position to support regional growth. The liquid flavors and fragrance plant we built in Jurong, Singapore, is now fully operational. By the end of the year, our facility in Guangzhou, China, will be fully operational as well. And we plan to have a new state-of-the-art, creative facility in Jakarta, Indonesia, to better serve our customers in the region.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman, our CFO.","Kevin C. Berryman","Thank you, Hernan. And good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Again, turning to our third quarter 2013 financial results, I would like to provide some additional insight into the trends that we are seeing in our business.","Third quarter revenue totaled $742.3 million, an increase of 5% from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, local currency sales increased 4%. Although the exit of low-margin sales activities were substantially completed in the second quarter of 2012, as Hernan earlier indicated, there remains some minor levels of sales for these activities in the third quarter of last year. As a result, if we adjust our results for these sales activities, our consolidated growth would've been 5% on a like-for-like basis, which puts us right in the middle of our long-term growth objectives. The overall growth reflects a balanced mix between our 2 business units, with Flavors growth of 3% and Fragrance growth of 5%, based on a continued, strong level of new wins across both business units.","The emerging markets continue to perform well, up 8%, and they're up 9% year-to-date on a local currency basis. We believe the diversity we have in all 4 regions of the world and our investments in our organization will continue to fuel our long-term growth. We are very pleased with our strong momentum in all geographic regions, especially Western Europe, where Fine & Beauty Care delivered double-digit growth this quarter. The BRIC countries generated local currency sales growth of 9% and 14% for Fragrance Compounds.","Local currency sales growth in China increased strong double digits for Fragrance Compounds as well. The developed markets also performed well, including France, which reported strong growth in Flavors and Fragrances.","Adjusted gross margins for the quarter increased 170 basis points to 44.2% in the third quarter from the year-ago period as a result of moderating raw material costs combined with the strategic initiatives we have put in place to improve productivity. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of our gross margin expansion versus year ago. It is important to note that while we have recovered input cost so that gross profit has been protected the input cost pressure still represents a significant pressure point on our gross margins from pre-inflation levels. I will speak to this in a moment.","One last note on our gross margins. Last quarter, we noted that we expected that the year-over-year margin improvement trend would begin to slow. We are beginning to see that play out as we are comparing margins to prior year levels that have already benefited from the margin enhancement efforts embedded in our strategic initiatives.","Regarding operating expense investments, we continue to make investments in our R&D platforms to fuel our future growth. This quarter, as Nicolas mentioned, we made a milestone payment to Amyris, one of our biotechnology partners. These types of payments signify that key milestones are being met, and we are pleased with the progress we are making. We continue to believe that the output of this programs will provide us with dependable, competitive advantages.","Adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 7% to $144 million. As a result, adjusted operating profit margin increased 50 basis points to 19.4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted operating profit has increased 10%.","Going further down the P&L. This quarter we realized modest foreign exchange gains on our working capital positions, reversing the losses we saw last quarter that where generated in those countries where we do not have hedging programs due to market conditions or other practical considerations. This reflects normal movements in currencies in those countries where hedging programs are problematic.","Finally, our EPS for the quarter was $1.22, which was 13% ahead of the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, our EPS of $3.55 is 12% ahead of the prior year period, and we are pleased with our bottom line growth.","By now you are probably familiar with this chart, which demonstrates that even though we are seeing margin gains of 170 basis points this quarter the net impact of historical rising input costs continues to be a headwind on our gross margins. If we look at the period Q3 2010 to Q3 2013, you will see the factors leading to the gross margin improvement between the 2 periods. Again, we chose the third quarter of 2010 as the base period since that is the last comparable quarter prior to the large increase in input costs that we saw in 2011 and 2012. Over the 3-year period, the net impact of our pricing actions and industry input cost increases has been a negative 160 basis points on our gross margins as evidenced by the red bar.","It is important to note that we proactively worked with customers to implement pricing increases to reduce the strong pressure from input costs and limit the inflationary pressure to the 160 basis points noted on our slide. However, the importance of the execution of our strategy where we adopt the numerous measures to improve our margins, including the exit of low-margin sales activities, cost-savings initiatives, innovation enhancements, manufacturing efficiencies and restructuring and other gross margin improvement efforts, cannot be understated. These strategic improvements had a 350 basis point positive impact on our margins over the 3-year period as shown by the green bar on the chart.","This more than offset the negative 160 basis point reduction from the net impact of input cost and pricing, resulting in our gross margins improving 190 basis points over the period.","Turning to our RSA costs. RSA as a percent of sales increased to 120 basis points to 24.8%, up from 23.6% of sales in the prior year quarter. The higher RSA this quarter reflects higher incentive compensation accruals and higher R&D expenses versus year ago partially due to the previously mentioned milestone payment to Amyris in the Fragrance business. As we've mentioned in the past, strong performance versus budget in any quarter can lead to an increased compensation accrual through our AIP program. We accrue for these payouts on a quarterly basis, effectively matching the performance accrual to the performance in that specific quarter. In those quarters where we have strong sales and operating profit versus our expectations, we increase our accruals. Conversely, in those quarters where we fall short of performance expectations, we book smaller accruals, or even as we did in 2011, reversed previous accruals made.","Importantly, including the incremental R&D costs and additional incentive compensation accruals, other RSA costs as a percent of sales, primarily sales and administrative expenditures, would've fallen 30 basis points as a percent of sales between Q3 of 2013 versus the comparable year-ago figure.","It is important we remain disciplined in our approach to spending. And going forward, cost discipline will be a continued focus while strategically investing in R&D and other business development opportunities.","Turning to foreign currency dynamics. Our foreign currency translation this quarter had 100 basis point positive impact on our reported sales. In addition, due to our proactive hedging activities with the euro, foreign currency had an immaterial impact on our operating profit results. As we have been communicating in 2013, we remain nearly 80% hedged against the euro at levels that approximate $1.29 per euro, effectively consistent with the average exchange rate levels for the full year 2012. At current rates, the operating impact on our full-year results is expected to continue to be muted. Importantly for 2014, we also have now hedged over 80% of our euro profit and cash flow exposure at $1.32 per euro.","Turning to our cash flow. As you know, our business is very cash generative, and we are pleased with our improved operating cash flow performance this year. For the first 9 months of 2013, our operating cash flow was $257 million versus $138 million in the third quarter of 2012. However, there are some large items impacting our comparability that I would like to discuss.","Number 1. Last year, we had a cash outflow of over $105 million related to our Spanish tax settlement. This outflow was included in our 2012 9-month year-to-date cash flow. Number 2, this year in the 9 months ended September 30, 2013, the company made an additional $30 million voluntary contributions to our qualified U.S. pension plans versus the 2012 comparable period. Finally, in the 9 months ended September 2013, the company paid out over $55 million in compensation payments based on the strong operating performance we had in 2012. In the first 9 months of 2012, our incentive compensation payments were less than $20 million, representative of the less-than-satisfactory performance that the company delivered in 2011 versus our internal objectives.","If we exclude these items to make the year-over-year comparison more representative of our underlying operating cash flow trends, then the cash flow would've improved substantially from $263 million in the first 9 months of 2012 to $344 million in the first 9 months of 2013, or an increase of over $80 million.","It is also worth noting that we accelerated our payment of our 2012 fourth quarter dividend into late December last year versus the normal planning of January of 2013. As a result, our 2013 year-to-date net cash flow has benefited as the first 9 months did not have the normally quarterly cash outflow associated with quarterly dividend payment in January.","Turning to our capital structure. Early in the quarter, Standard & Poor's rating service raised its long-term corporate credit and senior secured debt issue ratings on IFF to BBB+ from BBB based our good operating performance and affirmed its A2 short-term corporate credit ratings. This brings S&P's ratings in line with Moody's. In July, we repaid $100 million of private placement notes from the proceeds of our $300 million public bond offering completed earlier in the year. The next material debt maturity is $125 million of private placement debt maturing in 2016, indicating that we continue to have significant financial flexibility.","We are also making progress on our share buyback program. Through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares at an average price of $75 per share or approximately $33.4 million. Year-to-date through the end of October, we have spent a total of $42 million on buying back roughly 550,000 shares. We expect to meet our $50 million share repurchase goal for the year.","With that, I would like to turn the call back to Doug to give a perspective on the balance of the year.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Kevin, Hernan and Nicolas for the comments. We are pleased with our momentum on both sides of the business and believe we are well positioned for growth both due to our steady pulse with product innovations, our infrastructure and our feet on the ground in the faster growing markets, our relationships with both our global and regional customers as well as our deep consumer knowledge of global consumers and innovative solutions on how to drive consumer engagement.","Looking forward, we expect to be able to deliver continued growth in the fourth quarter, noting that we will be comparing our performance to a much more challenging quarter and that the environment still poses certain challenges.","We have started the fourth quarter well and are optimistic about our forecast. We have the right teams in place to continue to provide customers with superior customized products that deliver improved performance to consumers. Our perspective for 2013 remains in line with our long-term growth targets. We expect to deliver local currency growth in the range of 4% to 6%, supported by continued new wins and volume growth in the faster growing and more mature markets. We expect to grow our operating profit in line with our long-term growth targets of 7% to 9% as we continue to stress efficiency in all that we do, exercising financial discipline while nonetheless investing in required growth activity. And finally, we are optimistic that we will be able to deliver greater than 10% earnings per share growth.","In conclusion, we believe our strong performance at IFF this quarter is the result of strong execution of our strategy to leverage our geographic footprint, strengthen our innovation platform and maximize our portfolio. We believe we are very well positioned in the market, and we plan to continue to selectively invest in those areas where we see the most growth, whether in regions, countries or categories. We continue to focus on executing our 3-pillar strategy.","Thank you for your participation. And I will now open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess, Doug, curious what your interpretation of the word moderate. What does that mean for fourth quarter growth? I guess, my math suggests you need 2% to 3% in fourth Q to hit the low end of sales growth target. Maybe just a little bit of color there would be helpful, please.","Douglas D. Tough","Sure, Mark. I'll be glad to provide the color. I guess, just a couple of generation comments. I think we probably categorize this quarter as moderate as well. And you're trying to dimensionalize some targets. But I think I want to just put into context a couple of things and tie them together which have come out in this morning's call. I mean, I think we've touched upon -- the last year in Q4 of 2012 was our most challenging. And on a like-for-like basis, Fragrances is going up against 13% growth and Flavors is going up 7%, which are significant targets.","So that was kind of the context of putting in moderate. We expect as we've kind of achieved the year somewhere in the range of 5% YTD through the first 9 months we'll end the year generally in that range as well. So our context of moderate is still satisfactory results and ending up in the range, but we're cognizant that we've got the most stretching target. But the last comment here is looking at our Q4 order book progress to date, it's very positive on both sides of the house. And it's most encouraging on Fragrances so far because it's up against the most challenging target. But Hernan has already touched upon the expectation that there'll be a resumption of more traditional growth above what we did in Q3. So putting them all together, we're optimistic. But it's early. And the one other complicating factor is a lot of companies, including this one, were slightly disrupted year ago by the hurricane which hit the East Coast, so the comparability to the order book isn't going to get sorted out for a couple of weeks yet. But so far, what we see is quite positive. So moderate, Mark, is really quite encouraging and an expectation of broad continuation of what we've done, YTD.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's great. Maybe just a follow-up then from a Fragrances standpoint. Nicolas, so positive local currency growth in the fourth quarter in spite of the comparisons, is that reasonable then?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Yes.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great.","Douglas D. Tough","That's the trend, the way things are going, Mark, yes.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","And Mark, really, as I have mentioned, it's continued momentum and good traction in Compounds and somehow muted by the strong comp from last year, but the momentum is still there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Sison from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Nicolas, could you comment on sort of the order patterns heading into the holiday season for Fine & Beauty? What type of growth or -- that your customers were looking for, for the holiday season?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Look, it depends where you are around the world obviously; and it's very, very different region to region. Obviously, our numbers are augmented by a very, very strong pipeline of new wins this year. We had a very strong new wins of activity. But overall, the overall order book is positive, but people obviously remain cautious for the holiday season. Now I understand that there are some pockets of pressure in different parts of the world, but this is offset by a good pipeline of new wins for us.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, and a quick follow-up. Fine & Beauty in North America was down for the first time. Was that sort of just a one-off in the quarter?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","I think that you have to take into consideration 2 different dynamics, Michael. First, the strong comp of 12% last year, number 1. And also, it's coming on the heels of also a very strong second quarter at plus 13.5%. So probably, some of the launch we have some early intake for the pipeline. So we were putting these 2 quarters into perspective but also compared to last year. And it is true that a lot of the new wins intake and measure initiatives impacted us positively in Q2, and we have the same magnitude of intake for Q3.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Silke Kueck for Jeff. The first question I have is that what sort of interesting when I look at your 9-months result is that the North American local currency -- or I'm sorry, the Latin American local currency comparisons have been strong very year-over-year. They were great last year, and they are great this year. And similar for Greater Asia. But in North America, it seemed like for the 9 months last year North America didn't really grow. And for the 9 months this year, it didn't really grow. So one of the question is just like what happened? And are you optimistic that these trends should improve and why? And I have one follow-up to that.","Douglas D. Tough","Silke, is your question skewed to Flavors, Fragrances? Just guide us a little bit, please.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I looked at it just on a combined basis. I just looked at North America in total for like the 9 month last year versus the 9 months this year. And it just sort of like didn't grow in either period or maybe grew a little bit last year and like for the 9 months really didn't grow at all this year.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","I think that -- Silke, it's Nicolas. I think that we're getting tractions by getting access to more quality [ph] opportunities, new business opportunities. We have to remember for some categories some customers are manufacturing in North America for the rest of the world, so there are maybe also related to some performance of some of our key partners. But overall, we're getting traction, and we're getting access to more business opportunity. And the pipeline of new wins for the future and the pipeline of new projects that we're working on is strong and healthy.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So if I understood that right, it seems that some of your larger multinational customers are also shifting manufacturing from the North American region to someplace else, and that's sort of like reflected in your regional performance as well?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","No, that's not what I meant. I said that some customers are manufacturing in North America for the rest of the world, so some challenge that might be seen in some parts of the world are affecting our local sales in North America.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I see. And my follow-up is this. I was wondering whether you're sort of like caught up in terms of compensation accrual for the year and how you think your fourth quarter global corporate expense -- what it may look like and whether it's like a double-digit number or like a single-digit expense number?","Kevin C. Berryman","Silke, this is Kevin. Just a couple -- a follow-up question on your first -- follow-up comment on your first question as well. The other thing that you have to remember is that a big impact on the Flavors business in North America was this exit of lower margin sales activity. So that was a big impact on our year-to-date figures. I think it was 6 or 7 percentage points of growth in Flavors. So you have to really take into account that dynamic because that was one of the material impacts in Flavors. So you take that and that will fundamentally improve your North America numbers at a pretty material level, 3 to 4 percentage points, I would say, on a consolidated level. That's first comment. Second comment is as we look at Q3 quarter to date, as we have said in the past, we kind of true-up our performance levels through the quarter depending upon how we are performing at that particular point in time. So our true-up in the final quarter of the year relative to incentive comp will be dictated by how we perform in the fourth quarter. I will say that one point is that as we've talked all year long, we were concerned about our plan and our execution in the fourth quarter relative to our fourth quarter local currency sales growth because of the strong comparability issue that has already been highlighted. And given the renewed outlook that we have or revised outlook, which shows us coming in levels that are more in line with kind of our year-to-date figures, you can pretty much assume that, that will require some incremental incentive comp in fourth quarter could the expectation would be that we will be growing faster than what we would've originally envisioned.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Silke, it's Hernan. One more comment following your question regarding North America. I mean in some way complementing what Kevin mentioned. If you go like-for-like basis, in last year North America Flavors has a growth of double digit. And this year, like-for-like is 6%. So I could say that the performance of North Africa Flavors in the last year was very really, very positive.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I feel bad ignoring, Hernan. So 2 questions for you. Some thoughts on Asia Flavors in the third quarter. Maybe just talk sort of broadly about what you're seeing over there. And then how much of the impact in the quarter was the slowdown that you alluded to in India? And then just more broadly, from an operating margin standpoint, so you're now basically done lapping the exit of the low-margin businesses. The operating margin was up year-on-year. It was just up less than we've seen in prior quarters. So I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of whether this is a good run rate going forward or not?","Hernan Vaisman","Okay, Mark, let me start with the first one. Obviously, I mean, Greater Asia was not growing as quickly as they had been in the past. It's still have been growing a very solid path. I will say you have -- we have been in this quarter a kind of mixed bag. They were countries, as I mentioned before, that were doing pretty well, like for example, Indonesia, that is really delivering very good growth. India is a matter of concern. I mean, we -- everyone, not only IFF, is recognizing that the economy is hitting severely in the country. We used to grow at the high double-digit, and we are now in the mid-single digit. And we don't see that it's going to recover in the short term, but it's not forever. We still believe that the growth story in India is still there, and we will be there for many, many years. So we say it's a kind of mixed bag. And now as mentioned by Doug and myself, the orders in hand, order book, is much stronger at the back of some slowdown in the third quarter. So as already commented, we saw some slowdown, but we strongly believe that our fundamentals and the fundamental of the emerging market will be there for many times -- for many years to come. And regarding your question in margin. As you can see, I mean, we really delivered a very high -- I mean in gross margin. We always strive for improvement. Of course, when you get at that level, it's becoming kind of uphill. But then we in every single year, we work out with the teams initiative to improve productivity. So we believe that even though at the very high level we have some room to improve.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you very much for your participation in reviewing the IFF third quarter results. We're confident with our strategy, and we look forward to updating you in 3 months on Q4 results. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you for joining us for the conference for today.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau","Thank you, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Conference Call. Earlier today, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at www.iff.com.","This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our website.","Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2015.","These statements are based on how -- based on what we see today and contain elements of uncertainty.","For additional information concerning factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 2013 10-K filed on February 25, 2014, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued this morning.","With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig.; our Group President of Flavors, Matthias Haeni; our Group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz; and our Interim CFO, Rich O'Leary.","With that, I would like now to turn the call over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, good afternoon to everyone. I would like to start by providing some introductory remarks and then pass the call to Matthias and Nicolas, who will provide their perspectives on performance of the individual business units. Then Rich will review our consolidated financial performance in greater detail and finally turn the call back over to me for our 2015 outlook and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions.","To begin, I want to share some of my on-boarding experience over the past 5 months. During that time, I focused my attention on getting to know many constituents inside and outside of IFF. As part of this process, I was fortunate to tour 19 IFF sites around the world. While at each location, I took the opportunity to meet with many of our global and strategic customers. It was an invaluable opportunity to learn about our relationship with our customers and, more importantly, understand where we are successful and where we have opportunities to improve.","The tour also provided an excellent opportunity to meet with approximately 80% of our employees via 24 local town hall meetings, which engaged with all of these people on a personal level, to get their feedback on our business, strategy and future opportunities. Coming away from these visits, one thing is extremely clear: without the passion and dedication of all of our employees, we would not have achieved as much success as we did over the history of IFF. I deeply value all of their feedback, and I'm glad to have met and spoken with so many of them.","Finally, I also had the great fortune in meeting much of the investment community. It was terrific to hear their insights and perspectives on our performance, strategy, capital structure and M&A. So for those of you whom I have spoken with, I thank you for taking the time to share your opinion, as it's helpful to gain insight into what matters most for our shareholders.","For those of you who are new to the IFF story, our organization has had a lot of success over the past 5 years. Through our 3-pillar strategy, we are now much stronger strategically, innovatively and financially. We will continue to drive performance through sustainable profitable growth, which in turn will lead to incremental shareholder value.","To that end, we have embarked on a strategic refresh, where we are pressure testing our current 3-pillar strategy to ensure we are maximizing our performance.","Incorporated into this process is much of the insight I mentioned earlier, but it also includes guidance from an external consulting firm to ensure a deep and broad range of perspectives. This refresh is currently underway and will continue for the next couple of months. We expect to communicate our 2020 vision at our June 2 Investor Day in New York City.","Turning now to the full year 2014 results. We are pleased to report that for the fourth time in 5 years, IFF achieved its long-term financial targets. We met or exceeded our sales, operating profit and EPS goals and, at the same time, continued to invest in R&D, manufacturing and commercial resources to strengthen our business.","Local currency sales grew 5% on a consolidated basis, driven by new win performance and the acquisition of Aromor. The emerging markets, which grew 3x faster than the developed markets on a local currency basis in 2014, now represents approximately 50% of total sales, which we believe is best in class within our industry.","Excluding item impacting comparability, adjusted operating profit increased 11%, led by a 60 basis point improvement in gross margin, disciplined cost control and lower incentive compensation expense.","The net impact was positive, as adjusted operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 19.5%. From an EPS perspective, we benefited from a lower tax rate and gained incremental leverage via our share repurchase program. As a result, adjusted diluted EPS improved 14% to $5.08 per share, which is a company record.","Beyond financial results, 2014 was a year of achievement and progress. For example, we are very proud of our accomplishments in the area of sustainability. In 2014, we were included in the CDP Climate Disclosure Leadership Index and opened the largest solar field in our industry. And just recently, Aromor, our in-house naturals facility, and its partner in Turkey, were awarded the For Life Social Responsibility Certification for IMO.","2014 also saw some key investments into the business. We opened our new creative facility in Jakarta and a new sales office and lab in Chile. And just last week, we opened our new Flavors facility in Chicago, expanding our coverage in the Midwest of the United States.","On the R&D front, we have made advancements in our external collaborations and continued work with our Scientific Advisory Board. And with the successful integration of Aromor into our Fragrance business, we are already seeing positive results and expect this positive momentum to continue in the coming year.","Finally, 2014 was also a year of celebration. Globally, it was IFF's 121st anniversary, an event celebrated in IFF sites around the world. It was our fifth anniversary of our membership at the New York Stock Exchange. And what a perfect year it was formally to launch our core corporate values of passion, creativity, expertise and empowerment, which was a grassroots campaign directly from our employees themselves.","Overall, I'm very pleased with our accomplishments in 2014 and look forward to continue the success.","With that, I would like now to pass on to Matthias.","Matthias Haeni","Thank you, Andreas, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to report that Flavors local currency sales grew 6% in the fourth quarter, which was our strongest performance in 2014. Our overall growth was driven by 7% increase in the emerging markets, including double-digit performance in India, the South Cone of Latin America, Africa and selected markets in Southeast Asia as well as a 6% improvement in the developed markets.","On a category basis, Beverages grew double digit with broad-based growth across all regions. This strong performance was the result of our creative team's ability to provide innovative solutions that are differentiating and satisfy consumer desires for healthier and better-for-you products.","Growth in Savory was also solid, improving mid-single digits globally, led by strong new wins. EAME[ph] local currency sales growth was strong, increasing 7%, as our performance continued to improve sequentially versus Q2 and Q3 over 2014.","Results were driven by strong double-digit growth in Beverages and mid-single-digit increases in Savory and Sweet, all a result of new win performance. I would like to highlight also that within EAME, the mature markets of Western Europe were up mid-single digits.","Greater Asia was solid, posting a 3% local currency sales growth, led by mid-single digit improvement in Savory and in Beverages. Southeast Asia and Japan continued to post solid growth, yet was offset by softness in China, where overall consumer sentiment and weaker economic conditions impacted results.","In North America, conditions continued to improve. As we said, even earlier this year growing 7% year-over-year in Q4. This improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in Dairy and in Beverages, which were both a result of strong innovation geared to support our customers' need for healthier, better-for-you products that maintain consumer preference.","Latin America continues to be our strongest-performing region, up 13% on a local currency basis, as a result of our successful delivery systems. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, which is a clear indication of the value innovation has on our business.","From our -- from a profitability perspective, segment profit increased 5% and segment margin improved 10 basis points to 20.4%. On a full year basis, local currency sales grew 4%, led by Latin America and EAME. Full year segment profit totaled $331 million versus $323 million in the prior year and our segment profit margin remained constant at 22.7%.","In addition to our solid financial results, it has been a great year for Flavors in terms of geographic expansion, as we opened or improved facilities in all 4 regions over the last 12 months. Last week, I joined the North America Flavors team for the opening of a brand-new facility in Chicago, where we now have applications and flavors labs as well as a culinary center.","In November, we announced the opening of a new site in Chile in Latin America and a new creative center in Indonesia, Greater Asia. And in EAME, we invested in a new regional dairy center in Hilversum, the Netherlands. These new facilities enhance collaboration and allow us to partner more closely with our customers, building differentiating taste solutions.","As we also launched our Always Vanilla campaign, which many of you, you will see at the CAGNY next week, showcasing our expertise with this key ingredient. In addition, our consumer insights team developed new tools such as trend evaluation [ph], powerful programs to help our customers win in the marketplace by identifying key consumer trends at the very early stage. I'm proud of all our 2014 achievements as we build strong for years to come.","In 2015, we expect growth to continue to drive -- to be driven by new win performance. Looking at Q1 specifically, while it is still early we are seeing indications of strong growth.","I will now turn the call over to Nicolas.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Thank you, Matthias. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that Fragrance local currency sales grew 7% this quarter, including 2 percentage points of growth related to Aromor acquired earlier in the year. Our overall performance reflects mid to high single-digit growth across all regions. The developed market for our Fragrance Compound business, which includes Consumer Fragrances and Fine Fragrance, was strong, growing 7%. This was led by high single-digit performance in North America where we continue to benefit from being added to a new core list.","On a category basis, Consumer Fragrance performance was stronger, growing 8% as Fabric Care, Home Care and Hair Care all grew double digits. North America and Latin America both grew high single digits, followed by mid-single digits in EAME and Greater Asia. It should be noted that this marks the 13th consecutive quarter of Consumer Fragrance growth.","Fine Fragrance local currency sales declined by 1% against a very strong 13% growth reported in the year-ago period and 24% growth in Q4 2012. Our double-digit performance in Greater Asia was more than offset by weakness in EAME, which compared to a 32% growth rate reported in the fourth quarter of 2013 as well as softness in Latin America.","Turning now to our Ingredients business. Local currency sales increased 13%, including incremental sales from Aromor. This performance reflects strong growth of specialty ingredients, including Aromor as well as key product families from IFF, including naturals.","From a profitability perspective, Fragrance segment profit increased 23% or $14 million to $76 million. This strong improvement in segment profit and segment margin reflects top line growth, lower incentive compensation expenses versus a strong year-ago period and productivity initiatives, including savings from the closure of our Augusta, Georgia Ingredients plant, which all combined to offset rising input costs. The net result was robust. Our segment profit margin expanded 290 basis points to 19.1%.","On a full year basis, local currency sales growth was strong, growing 7%, led by a double-digit growth in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in EAME, along with the addition of Aromor earlier this year.","Every region and every category in our Fragrance Compound business had positive growth. On a category perspective, Fine Fragrances increased 2% on top of the 8% we reported for the full year of 2013. And consumer fragrance sales grew 5% against an 8% comparison, supported by advancements in our market-leading encapsulation technology. Fragrance Ingredients, which benefited from the addition of Aromor, was up 18% in 2014.","Looking at profitability for the full year, segment profit grew 18% and segment profit margin expanded 210 basis points year-over-year.","2014 was a very strong year for Fragrances outside of our financial results. We launched 2 new captives fragrance molecules, received the For Life designation for our Aromor naturals portfolio. We successfully integrated Aromor. We strengthened our leading encapsulation technology. We established a new strategic insight group, and we were acknowledged for climate leadership by the Carbon Disclosure project.","From a customer perspective, we successfully gained access to 3 new core lists, secured meaningful wins with key customers leveraging our leading encapsulation technology and created the #1 men's fragrance in the U.S., Invictus by Paco Rabanne, which was previously launched with great success in Europe in 2013. All in, 2014 was a year of accomplishment, and I would like to thank the entire IFF team for their many contributions.","In 2015, we expect continued growth, driven by strong new win performance. With respect to Q1, we believe we can deliver modest growth as we are facing our most challenging year-ago comparison.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard A. O'Leary","Thank you, Nicolas. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Looking at our Q4 results, net sales in the fourth quarter were up 7% on a local currency basis, led by a high single-digit growth in Latin America, North America and EAME. This quarter also benefited by approximately 2 percentage points associated with an additional week of sales or the 53rd week, which generally occurs every 6 years. The emerging markets grew 6%, while developed markets increased 5%.","While local currency sales grew 7%, net sales increased 4%, reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies.","Slight decline in gross margins year-over-year, which was driven by higher input costs, was more than offset by ongoing control of our research, selling and administrative expenses and lower incentive compensation costs versus the strong prior year results. As a result, our adjusted operating profit increased 18% to $133 million and our adjusted operating profit margin improved 210 basis points to 17.5% this quarter.","Finally, adjusted EPS grew 17% to $1.07, as year-over-year gains and adjusted operating profit were partially offset by a slightly higher adjusted tax rate and interest expense.","To factor in year-over-year comparisons in looking at our top line growth, I thought it would be helpful to include a 2-year average local currency sales growth chart by quarter to highlight the underlying trends. As you can see, in Q4, local currency sales growth accelerated sequentially, growing 7% on a 2-year average basis. If we exclude the impact of the additional week of sales in the fourth quarter, the 2-year average growth rate is 6%, which is in line with the trends we've seen in the first half of 2014.","The improvement versus Q3 is primarily attributable to Flavors, which was more in line with historical norms.","Quickly putting our full year results into perspective, I want to highlight that our 2014 performance was within our long-term targets and continue the strong trends we've seen over the past 3 and 5 years.","RSA as a percent of sales decreased 220 basis points from 28.3% of sales to 26.1% of sales. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense. Our continued focus to control cost and drive process improvements remains a priority, and by doing so, allows us to reinvest in R&D and commercial resources to build competitive advantage for our business long term.","In Q4, R&D as a percent of sales remained within our 8% to 9% target range at 8.2% of sales.","Now taking a look at currency. Here, you see our usual chart showing the change of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, as the movement in euro represents our largest exposure relative to the impact on overall results. Foreign exchange movements in Q4 had approximately 3% negative impact on our top line performance. While on a full year basis, it was negligible.","As a reminder, the U.S. dollar strengthening versus the world's currencies does not necessarily materially impact IFF in many emerging markets, as 2\/3 of our sales are tied directly or indirectly to hard currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar.","Looking to 2015, approximately 2\/3 of our euro exposure from an operating profit perspective is now hedged at $1.32 rate, a little bit below the full year average for 2014. And while this significantly reduces our exposure for 2015, at current rates of around $1.13, we believe it will have a little more that 3% -- 3 percentage point negative impact on operating profit in 2015 based on an almost 15% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro.","In addition, at a current rate of $1.13, we would expect to see approximately 5 percentage point negative impact on our 2015 reported sales, as we do not hedge the translation impact on our top line but rather protect our overall operating profit by hedging our raw material purchases. This impact is included in our full year 2015 guidance that Andreas will speak to more about momentarily.","Now turning to a cash flow perspective. Our operating cash flows in 2014 was $518 million or 16.8% of sales compared to $408 million or 13.8% of sales in the prior year period. The increase in cash flow from operations was driven primarily by an increase in net income, lower amounts associated with Spanish tax payments and lower year-over-year pension contributions.","Our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales, as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of the quarter are down 60 basis points to just above 29% of our trailing 12-month sales.","From a capital structure standpoint, capital spending focused on growth and infrastructure was a significant use of cash. Over the past 3 years, we have been investing approximately 4.5% of sales on adding capacity and new technology where it's needed to optimize our geographic footprint and deliver winning solution to our customers around the globe. In 2014, we are in line with our target as CapEx as a percent of sales was 4.6%.","For 2015, we expect a similar level between 4% and 5%, and then we believe it will revert back to a more normalized level of between 3% and 3.5% going forward.","Finally, regarding our share buyback program. In 2014, we have spent approximately $88 million on share buybacks. This, combined with our dividend payments, resulted in total cash return to our shareholders of $221 million or 53% of net income.","I'll now turn the call back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Rich. As we look ahead to 2015, we believe our business is well positioned for continued performance that generates returns for our shareholders, despite macroeconomic uncertainty and increasing currency pressure.","We have a well-balanced geographic profile, a diverse product portfolio and a very strong innovation pipeline that sets us apart from the competition.","We believe this breadth and diversity provides our investors with an attractive combination of sustainable growth and strong cash flow generation. As such, our local currency sales are expected to grow in line with our 4% to 6% long-term target, with balanced growth across both businesses.","We also expect to see operating profit in 2015 grow in line with our long-term target of 7% to 9%, albeit at the low end of the range given the impact of our unhedged portion of our euro exposure. We set up our expected incentive-based comp and expense to 100% target level and modest inflation in our raw material costs. Given that we are at the low end of our operating profit range, we expect to see EPS grow high single digits on a reported basis or double digits on a constant currency basis.","In summary, 2014 was a successful year. We achieved our long-term financial targets for the fourth time in 5 years, continued to invest in R&D to drive innovation and differentiation, made great strides in sustainability, benefited from the integration of Aromor and advanced external collaboration, all critical for future success.","On a full year 2015 basis, we are confident that we should be able to deliver top line and operating profit growth in line with our long-term targets, despite some headwinds, such as the macroeconomic uncertainty, currency pressure and modest raw material inflation.","Before I close, I want to remind everyone that we will be presenting at CAGNY next Thursday, February 19. I hope to see many of you at the presentation, but also at our correspondents' dinner, where we will showcase some of the art and science aspects of our business.","With that, we are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, one housekeeping question first. What was the benefit to EBIT and EPS in the quarter from the extra week, Rich? And then secondly, sort of broadly, I'm trying to understand the sales growth expectations for 2015, given the volume weakness that many of your customers are seeing. What gives you the confidence -- obviously, you had a good fourth quarter on tough comparisons, but what gives you the confidence that, that's going to continue? And then sort of related to that, how are you thinking about pricing as a contributor absolutely and relative to the benefit in 2014 that's embedded in that number?","Richard A. O'Leary","Mark, I'll start with the first one and then let Andreas talk to the top line. As we noted earlier, the impact from the top line perspective was about 2% -- 2 percentage points of additional growth. But when translating that into operating profit -- in fact, you need to remember that the fourth quarter is our weakest quarter in terms of overall gross margin profile. And in December -- within the quarter, December is generally weaker within the quarter. This, combined with some RSA expense -- higher RSA expenses in December, I'd say that the overall impact from an operating profit standpoint was marginally positive.","Andreas Fibig","Okay. And I'll take it Rich on the sales growth. Mark, I would answer the following as first of all, we have a very good and balanced portfolio across our 2 business units. We have good innovation right now, which we can offer our customers. We have a good balance between the emerging markets and the established markets. And actually, if you look at our customer base, it's not just the big global customers, we have -- almost 50% of our sales was local and regional customers, and here we see growth as well. So all in all, we believe it would be a good perspective, 4% to 6% growth in local currency for 2015.","Richard A. O'Leary","And Mark, can we go back to the third question around the pricing impact? Since, what, the middle of 2014, we've been talking about pricing pressure and input cost pressure, particularly in the naturals. Key items such as orange, lemon-lime, vanilla and patchouli are all up significantly. These increases have started to flow through our cost of sales. And as I mentioned earlier, we actually saw that impact our fourth quarter gross margins pretty significantly. We've been continuing to proactively work with our customers and address these pricing pressures. On the other side, from an oil perspective and how that impacts our results going forward, it's important to remember that we're 2 or 3 or 4 steps down the chain from a derivative standpoint off of oil. And so I think overall, based on what we see today, that impact coming in later in 2015, we still expect to see overall input costs up on the order, I'm going to call it, about 1% for 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was hoping you could give a little bit of color to the Fragrance margin expansion because that was really significant and just whether or not that is -- I guess, sources of it and whether or not that should be sustainable going forward.","Richard A. O'Leary","Lauren, a couple of things. It's Rich. I mean, first, good top line growth and leverage throughout the P&L were certainly a key driver of that. As we mentioned in the commentary, that more than offset the impact of higher input costs, which were up significantly or noticeably in the fourth quarter. And then another big driver was incentive compensation expense. Last year, results in both businesses were quite strong. On the Fragrance side this year, I'd say they were closer -- or more closer to normal levels, so we also have a benefit of incentive comp. So top line growth, incentive comp benefit more than offset input costs.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","And Lauren, it's Nicolas. Also to add to this, we also continue to see the benefit of the multiyear productivity initiatives that we have put in place, number one. And number two also, we are getting the benefit of the closure of our Augusta facility. So all the restructuring are for manufacturing footprint that we had shared with all of you of our Ingredients business is also paying dividend.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then also, Nicolas, you mentioned -- I know there were 3 new core lists this year. But then I think the commentary for Q4, you specifically, I think, like talked about one of them. So when do -- is it the right way to think about it that you kind of lapped that benefit? Because it sounds like the access to core lists or the wins that came with it. Or is it more just it's ongoing because of access to more business?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","I think it's ongoing. As you start, you're building up your portfolio of initiatives and you are increasing your ability, so you're increasing your market access and you're increasing your growth opportunities. But we are very pleased with the initial start, with the engagement with these -- with new core list.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. I was wondering whether you can talk about the product launches on the Flavors side in Latin America. I noticed that the volume growth was up, I don't know, 16% in local currency this year and I think that's on top of maybe like 11% last year. So what are the new proprietary delivery systems? And is that something specific to the region? Maybe you can give us clarity.","Matthias Haeni","Yes, thank you. This is Matthias speaking. Well, as we communicated on our Q2 and Q3 calls, these are higher than normal volume growth and also due to select few customers cycling product launches last year. As you cycle those few products, performance in Q4 significantly improved in North America led by strong new wins, particularly in Flavor, taste solutions for healthier products, which really made a significant difference to the new win performance throughout in North America.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","How about the growth in Latin America?","Matthias Haeni","In Latin America, our growth was very strong, in large driven by a new proprietary IFF technology solutions. We mentioned to you in earlier calls that we very successfully launched new delivery systems, but it's not only the delivery system, which gives a more authentic performance of the flavor. We were also very successful with very strong inroads in many new product launches, which are reducing calories, which are processing again better-for-you performance products.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I had a follow-up question on share repurchases. My memory is that there was -- there's like a $250 million share repurchase program that was launched and -- that was initiated in early 2012. Is it sort of completed? Is there anything left to continue to repurchase shares in '15? And is it part of your earnings guidance?","Richard A. O'Leary","Silke, it's Rich. As you said, the original authorization was $250 million. We have approximately $100 million, maybe a little bit less, remaining on that authorization. So we will expect that -- to continue that into 2015. As we've talked about on prior calls, we have a very structured approach in terms of how those -- how the share repurchases are implemented based on the price of the -- stock price in the marketplace. If the stock price is higher, we'll buy back less. If it's lower, we'll buy back more. But our guidance does reflect the expected share purchases in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I just wanted to follow up on 2 things. One was the new wins in Fragrances. One, I just wanted to clarify, is that mostly in developed markets? And then sort of what's driving those new wins? Is it your encapsulation technology? Or is it -- I just want to think about like what your competitive advantages are versus your other large competitors. And then just on the Flavors side, if you could talk about -- maybe is there a way to think about what percentage of your Flavors portfolio now is geared towards better-for-you or health and wellness products?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Faiza, it's Nicolas. So regarding the new wins, actually, we have a very well-balanced portfolio of new wins in both developed and emerging markets. And we spoke about it last quarter as we were going to 2015, the newly gained access to core lists, which are giving us a benefit also in Europe and North America. As you had correctly identified, our leading encapsulation technology has given an access the new wins and will continue to give us growth with the technology in both '15 and 2016. So the pipe is stronger. We're expanding into new categories and we're supporting very interesting and attractive growth opportunities with our customers.","Matthias Haeni","Coming back to your question on the portfolio or the innovation program on what we can capitalize on the many investments we have done for health and wellness. I cannot share with you exactly what is the mix and how much really of new product which we have in the portfolio that are geared for health and wellness. But I can confirm to you that more than half of all the new wins are geared towards health and wellness not only in the developed markets, but also in developing markets. And when I'm referring to health and wellness, I'm referring to reduced sugar content, less sodium, less fats. I'm referring to mouthfeel. I'm referring to many other very innovative taste solutions as the industry moves more and more from flavors into taste.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then if I could just follow up on guidance for next year, like what's going to drive some of the margin growth? Because this year, it seems like it was -- there was some pricing, there was better commodities and then there was incentive comp rolling over and some of the productivity savings. So is that going to go through next year? Or is it really just better sales leverage?","Richard A. O'Leary","No. There's -- I mean, embedded in our model in the guidance is leverage through the P&L. That 4% to 6% growth translates into 7% to 9% operating profit growth, and we talked about some of the pressures at the EPS level that make that the last leg at the lower end of our guidance. The leverage will be a little bit less this year, as we've talked about early, given currency pressures and incentive comp reset. But we build into our expectations leverage at -- throughout the P&L and that we would expect that to continue next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research LLC","A couple of questions. Is there any way, first of all, of giving us a sense how much of the sales here -- in the places where you're really growing, that's across the board in Fragrances and in the emerging markets within Flavors. How much of that is share gain versus your big global competitors versus you coming up with new products in the pipeline, if you will, for customers that we just haven't seen yet maybe?","Richard A. O'Leary","This is Rich. I'll start with some general comments and I can turn it over to Nicolas and Matthias to fill in where they feel appropriate. I think overall, as we mentioned earlier, the growth -- in Q4, we saw an improvement in terms of our commercial performance, the win\/loss fulfillments compared to particularly the third quarter. So that's a component of the driver. Volume erosion on existing business was again a little bit more favorable in Q4 compared to Q3. So I think it's -- those are some of the drivers. Ultimately, longer term, as we've said in our commentary, our growth going forward is going to be largely driven by commercial performance and our wins in the marketplace.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Rich. I can outline on this as well. Over the last few years, as you may know, we have made significant investments in our geographical footprint. We invested in many new locations and creative centers to be closer to our customers. We also expanded significantly our account base in many of the markets and not only into the emerging markets, but also in the more developed markets. And including U.S. such with the opening of Chicago. You may understand that we want to have a different proximity to our accounts. We want to engage at a much earlier stage. And as a result of the many investments in our geographical footprint, in the expansion of it, we are engaging with more customers at the earliest stage. I cannot tell you to which extent we will be gaining market share. But I can share with you when we measure our performance, as expressed by Rich, in the commercial performance, so we are eliminating the volume erosion or volume increase. We are very satisfied with the performance in Q4 and overall in 2014.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Jon, it's Nicolas. I think it's a combination of different factors. Number one, we're able to leverage our longstanding presence and leadership in emerging markets; also, the newly gained access to core list, which are really impacting our performance in developed markets. And then it's really the results of the consumer insights, excellence and investment that was done over the last decade. And combined with the technology, especially the leading encapsulation technology, providing superior performance, but also superior consumer acceptance for the brands we engage with. So it was a lot of investment in fundamentals that are now all combined that are actually providing that momentum.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research LLC","Okay, great. And, Rich, just I'm relatively new. I've only covered stock for a couple of years. I wasn't around for the last extra week. I'm trying to understand why a business -- most of the food and beverage companies I've covered, they have a 14th week that it's something more like a 7% or 8% effect on sales in a quarter as opposed to 2%. Is there -- what is it about the sale cycle or the linearities of the weeks in the fourth quarter particularly that makes it only a 2% impact? And how did you -- when was the last extra week? Because I couldn't find it looking through. And how did you handle it last time?","Richard A. O'Leary","Okay, a couple of things. It happens generally every 6 years, depending upon the cut-offs. But it's generally, I would say, every 6 years. Within our industry as we're more B2B than consumer oriented, the second half of December by itself is quite light as it is. In the case of this week, you think about this week, it ended on January 2. You've got maybe 2.5 days at most of true shipping days available, and our customers are also looking at their supply chains. And that -- those are probably the key drivers on why it's not going to have a comparable impact that you might see in a consumer products company.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research LLC","And I guess, I mean, there's a second half of December that you're lapping as well. Is it -- do people change their order cycles or something like that, I mean, in the quarter? And I just -- you -- do I just have to go back and look? I don't -- do you know off the top of your head when the last extra week was, last time you did a 50...","Richard A. O'Leary","Yes. I'll go back and look. But I would say it's 6 years ago. When you think about -- why you probably don't see it is when you translate that into a full year impact, we're talking about plus or minus 50 basis points on a full year basis, so that's probably why we haven't -- that's why it's not going to be highlighted.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Andreas, this is maybe an industry question or you can answer it as IFF. But ADM bought Wild recently. And after Investor Day, it sounded like they're targeting several billion dollars more of specialty food ingredient acquisitions higher than the legacy ADM. Do you think the Flavors business is going to have to have ancillary products or bolt-ons to broaden their portfolio? Just a few minutes ago, you mentioned this move from flavors towards taste. And I don't know if you go even broader than that in the food ingredients area.","Andreas Fibig","John, thank you for that question. It's certainly a good industry question. And we see that with the acquisition of Wild by ADM that they move, sort of say, into like a new player on the lower end of the flavors market. And we will see how the integration of Wild in ADM will work out and what they do next. So that -- actually, we don't see any impact at the moment on our business. Particularly, if we look at our business, it's more in terms of specialization. It's more based on our innovation and technology. So at the moment, we don't see too much overlap with our business. But nevertheless, we will monitor the situation. We will see how that comes out.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then for Rich, since you hedge, the potential eventual impact of the current foreign exchange rate is pushed out. How far out are you hedged? And at that time, if you go out beyond the hedges, what would be the run rate headwinds of foreign exchange versus 2014?","Richard A. O'Leary","Well, as I said, in the early commentary, we're about 2\/3 hedged for 2015. We've got -- we start -- we layer in the hedging month-by-month in a very programmed, disciplined approach. We're hedged -- we're partially hedged certainly not to the 2\/3 extent that we are in 2015 for 2016. Then the impacts of the hedges roll through. And as we're hedging raw material purchases, the impact in terms of when it affects our P&L, there's a time lag difference between when the contracts are closed out and then we offset the impacts on a P&L perspective. So I think the best I can tell you is what I've talked about earlier in the commentary, which given the current euro exposure rates and assuming $1.13, we think it's about a 3% headwind on the operating profit level versus a 5% headwind on the top line.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That was a 2015 comment right?","Richard A. O'Leary","'15. Beyond...","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. And I was kind of looking what kind of run rate number would be further out.","Richard A. O'Leary","I think we want to focus our commentary and feedback on '15. That's too far out beyond that.","Operator","And you have a follow-up question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Two questions as follow-up. So one, Rich, just on RSA expenses x R&D, x incentive comp, is there an opportunity for leveraging the remaining piece of that since it's still fairly large as a percentage of sales? And then Andreas, I was sort of intrigued by your -- how much about this health and wellness are driving growth in the quarter or the new business wins. Any idea where the adoption of health and wellness by geography is? It seems like Europe might be a little bit further along in the adoption curve. Any idea where North America is versus Latin America, Asia? If you can separate it between developed and developing markets that would be sort of helpful.","Andreas Fibig","Rich?","Richard A. O'Leary","Mark, let me just start with your first question. Again, from a leverage standpoint, we expect to have leverage throughout the P&L. And as I think in addition to that, we are constantly looking for ways to drive process efficiency and savings in the organization that allows us to then reinvest in R&D, commercial, business development-related expenses to grow the business. So I would expect to continuously leverage in 2015.","Andreas Fibig","Matthias?","Matthias Haeni","Coming to your question on the activity level from health and wellness launches or health and wellness programs, I would say that Western Europe and North America is significantly more advanced versus many other geographies. Yet when it comes to sugar, we also see a lot in Latin America. A few countries have introduced the so-called sugar tax introduction. So you're paying additional taxes if you have a high sugar content or a high calorie content in products, and it simply forces a lot of manufacturers to take calories out and the overall advantage also for the consumer is changing dramatically. I don't think that in many parts of Asia health and wellness in form of reduced sugar is much advanced. We see though first signs, particularly in India and some other markets. I think it will take probably a few more years there until we see the same engagement and activity level as we would -- as we right now see in Latin America, in Western Europe or in North America. I hope this answers your question.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","It does. Is there any impact on the Fragrances side as you sort of shift in the same fields?","Andreas Fibig","Nicolas?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Mark, a few things, I think, that you see in terms of wellness, a lot of promoting, better hygiene overall. So it's what are the different habits that the brands can be promoting. But we are, obviously, looking at what are the solution, following the flavor trend in that respect that can be supporting the needs for consumers. So within our sustainability initiatives, we're also strengthening our portfolio in R&D to meet future consumer demand.","Operator","And your next question comes from Curt Siegmeyer with KeyBanc.","Curtis Alan Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. You guys had some costs associated with the new plant in the third quarter in the Flavor segment. Is it -- that doesn't seem to have repeated here in the fourth quarter. Is that safe to say that's behind us now?","Richard A. O'Leary","Yes. I think the other thing that you start to see in the fourth quarter is some of the productivity savings that Nicolas talked about on the Fragrance side of the business. So I think the impacts of that, as we exit 2014, we're then going to be on an apples-to-apples basis.","Curtis Alan Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one other one on North American flavors market, which you guys sort of touched on some new product introductions that sort of helped in the quarter. What's kind of the health of the underlying market? I know you said that, that seems to have gotten a little less bad. But is it the right way to look at it the underlying market is down and you guys are growing maybe low to mid-single digits all from new product introductions? Or what's kind of the delta there.","Matthias Haeni","Well, we are mainly growing, thanks to new product introductions. I cannot tell you that our volume is really increasing a lot. I think the conditions in North American market as such, they are not really that encouraging overall from -- in the food and beverage industry as reported by many of our customers. We are, however, really satisfied with the traction which we have, with the inroads we made, thanks to differentiating flavor technology.","Andreas Fibig","So then I would like to close the call here. Thank you very much for your questions, and I hope I see many of you during the CAGNY conference next week in Boca. Thank you. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's International Flavors & Fragrances conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Shelley Young, Director, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Shelley Young","Thank you. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IFF Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Earlier today, we distributed a press release announcing our second quarter results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at www.iff.com. This call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website.","Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements, which I will read out loud. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the third quarter and our outlook for the full year of 2014. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors outlined in our 2013 10-K filed on February 25, 2014, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today and is on our website.","With me on the call today is Doug Tough, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nicolas Mirzayantz, our President of Fragrances; Matthias Haeni, our President of Flavors; and Kevin Berryman, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I would now like to turn the call over to Doug.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Shelley, and good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I start my formal comments, I would like to say how much I have enjoyed being part of IFF's journey these past 5 years. You will have read that as of September 1, I will be stepping down as Chief Executive Officer and turning the reins over to Andreas Fibig, who is currently an IFF board member and was most recently with the German pharmaceutical company, Bayer. I will make additional comments about the transition at the end of the presentation.","Turning to the agenda for today's call. I will provide an overview of the second quarter for consolidated IFF, followed by Nicolas Mirzayantz and Matthias Haeni, who will provide their perspective on the performance of our Fragrances and Flavors business segments, respectively. Then Kevin Berryman will provide you with the financial review of our second quarter and turn the call back over to me for a balance of year outlook and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions.","Turning to the second quarter 2014. Our local currency sales growth this quarter was 4%. As a reminder, our overall growth includes a percentage point of growth related to Aromor. We are comparing to strong like-for-like growth of 8% in the second quarter of 2013, supported by a high level of growth in both business units. This quarter, our Fragrances business delivered growth of 6%, which includes 2 percentage points of growth from Aromor. Our Flavors business, up against a very challenging comparability period of 8%, delivered growth of 1% this year.","Growth was again void by a healthy level of new wins, which is indicative of the company's emphasis on innovation and technology and the work we are doing with our customers to deliver superior products that will delight their consumers wherever they may be.","The emerging markets, which comprise 49% of our sales continued to outpace the developed markets with mid-single-digit growth of 5%. We saw some softening this quarter in the developed markets, which contracted 1%. It is worth highlighting that we achieved high-single digit and even double-digit growth in many of the emerging market countries, including Indonesia, China, India and Argentina, along with solid growth in Brazil and Russia.","Looking at our growth on a 2-year basis, our overall growth was 6% comprised of 5% in Flavors and 7% growth in Fragrances, including Aromor. This growth is within our long-term targeted growth range.","Our profitability remains solid. The company's gross profit margin improved 90 basis points versus the prior year and reflects our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross profit margin improvements. This quarter's improvement was primarily due to ongoing cost improvement initiatives, the net impact of price to input costs and favorable currency impacts in certain markets due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to emerging market currencies.","Our adjusted operating profit increased 8%, reflecting the benefits of margin expansion and lower incentive compensation accruals versus the high year-ago levels, which reduced our overall cost structure. The results of Aromor were not significant to our consolidated financial performance.","Notably, this quarter, our adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to $1.37. EPS benefited from excellent organic profit results, a lower tax rate, reduced interest expense, foreign exchange gains on working capital and a slight reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to our share buyback program. In summary, we continue to deliver strong profitability metrics above our long-term targets even with moderate sales growth.","It is important to note that 1 quarter is not indicative of a year. Our second quarter top line growth of 4% was weaker-than-expected. That said, I remind you that we had a very strong first quarter with local currency sales growth of 7% and adjusted operating and EPS growth of 14% and 11%, respectively, all metrics above our long-term targets.","Let's review our first half of the year results. Our local currency sales growth was 5% comprised of 7% growth in Fragrance and 3% growth in Flavors. The 5% growth is within our long-term targets. On a year-to-date basis, our profitably metrics are above our long-term growth targets.","Adjusted operating profit increased 11% during the first half of 2014. This was driven by significant gross margin expansion of 160 basis points, primarily due to cost savings initiatives, as well as the benefit of net price to input costs and reduced incentive compensation accruals versus higher year-ago levels. Our input costs continue to remain at elevated levels. Adjusted operating profit growth was supported by increased segment profit in both business units.","Our adjusted earnings per share grew 16% in the first half of 2014. The double-digit growth in our adjusted EPS reflects our expanded growth in operating margins, lower interest expenses as a result of refinancing and the benefits of our share repurchase program, as well as favorable trends on foreign exchange so far this year. Of note, our operating and earnings per share profitability growth metrics are above our long-term growth targets.","I would now like to turn the call over to Nicolas and Matthias so they can provide more detail on their respective units. Nicolas?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Thank you, Doug, good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to our Fragrance business units. Fragrance had local currency sales growth of 6% this quarter compared with 8% growth in the second quarter of 2013, which was our highest growth quarter last year. Our 6% growth includes approximately 2 percentage points of growth from our Aromor acquisition, we said are captured in Fragrance Ingredients.","On a 2-year basis, excluding Aromor, our sales growth is also 6%, which compares quite well with our long-term growth targets. This quarter, the emerging markets grew at 6% or twice the rate of our developed markets and represented 51% of our Fragrance Compounds sales. We achieved strong growth in the emerging markets of China, Indonesia and Brazil, which is one of our strongest Fragrance markets and where we have a leadership position. Our overall sales performance was a result of a strong pipeline of new wins in our Compounds business, which includes both our Fine Fragrances and Consumer Fragrances end-use categories.","Fine Fragrances grew 14% in both Latin America and Greater Asia. This growth was offset by declines in our EAME region due to customer order patterns. Let me remind you that year-to-date, sales in the EAME increased 5%.","North America was flat this quarter compared with a 13% growth in the year-ago quarter. That said, North America grew by 11% for the first 6 months of 2014. Although our overall Fine Fragrance category was flat this quarter on a 2-year basis, Fine Fragrances had growth of 7%, which is above our long-term targets end-market performance.","Turning to Consumer Fragrances. This category had solid growth of 5% compared with 8% growth in the prior year quarter. Growth this quarter was led by high-single digit growth in Toiletries and mid-single-digit growth in Fabric Care, Personal Wash and Home Care. Hair Care also grew this quarter. North America and Asia delivered double-digit growth, and Latin America was also positive. This was offset by a slight decline in EAME.","Turning to our Ingredients business. Fragrance Ingredients delivered local currency sales growth of 21%, which includes 17% of growth from Aromor. The growth in Fragrance Ingredients reflect continuous strong sales of key IFF product families. Excluding the planned migration of some volume from Fragrance Ingredients to Compounds, Fragrance Ingredients would have grown by 9%.","This quarter marks our final quarter of the planned migration of volume from Fragrance Ingredients to Compounds. In summary, we achieved solid top line growth thanks to the strength and diversity of our portfolio, customer base and end-use categories. On a year-to-date basis, our Fragrance business grew 7%, which includes 2 percentage points of growth from Aromor and is within our long-term targets.","Turning to our profitability. We were able to leverage our 6% local currency sales growth into higher segment operating profit to achieve very strong business unit performance. Our gross margins benefited from volume gains and productivity savings combined with a favorable impact of price-to-input cost and currency benefits, offset by a small negative mix impact due to the reduced growth in Fine Fragrance. Our input costs continue to remain at elevated lead levels.","The gross margin expansion, combined with decreased incentive compensation accruals from the high year-ago levels drove an improvement in our segment profit margins. These benefits were offset in part by increased RSA spending to support business growth. For the quarter, our segment profit increased 19% or an increase of $14 million. Year-to-date, our segment profit has improved by $32 million or 23%.","Here are a few additional areas I'd like to highlight:","Number one. We're seeing the impact of some higher raw material costs in our inventories, especially in naturals and petrochemicals. We expect input cost pressures to impact our P&L around the end of the year and to be developing headwind for 2015. We are proactively engaged in pricing discussions with select customers to offset the inflationary pressure.","Number two. This quarter, we completed the purchase price accounting related to Aromor. And as a result, we will now have a modest ongoing amortization expense in our P&L.","Number three. As planned, this quarter we closed our Fragrance Ingredients plant in Augusta, and we will see the cost benefits in H2. As always, our focus is on efficiency and making sure our operations are cost-effective and competitive. These recent initiatives support our strategic focus to drive improvements in our Ingredients business.","Turning to our third quarter outlook. For the third quarter, we're expecting continued top line momentum in the business. We expect the rate of improvement in year-over-year gross margin to moderate in H2, especially when compared with the improvements we made in gross margins in the first half of 2014. We look forward to updating you next quarter.","I will now turn the call over to Matthias, our new group President of Flavors.","Matthias Haeni","Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Against challenging comps of 8% a year ago, flavors delivered local currency sales growth of 1% in the second quarter of 2014. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2013 was our strongest like-for-like quarter of last year.","New wins, which were at historical levels in the second quarter, continued to be a growth driver of our business. The volume from new wins was offset by a higher level of erosion on existing business, especially in North America where we had several very large new product launches in the second quarter of 2013. Looking at the 2 years average, Flavors had solid growth of 5% on a like-for-like basis for Q2. The emerging markets continued to drive growth for our business, representing 52% of sales. The emerging markets grew by 5%, led by double-digit growth of 15% in Latin America. The BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India, and China, all performed well, reflecting our ability to work with both global and local customers in these markets. Solid growth in the BRICs was offset by losses in other countries, including Thailand, which was pressured by geopolitical risk. On a year-to-date basis, we grew by 8% in the emerging markets, with 90% of our growth coming from these markets.","From a regional perspective, in Europe, Africa and in Middle East, local currency sales increased by 2% on top of 5% growth in the second quarter of 2013. Growth was strongest in Beverages, Sweet and Dairy, partially offset by softness in Savory.","In Greater Asia, this quarter we were disappointed in our flat growth versus 8% like-for-like growth in the year-ago quarter. Gains in the Savory and Sweet end-use categories were offset by declines in Beverages and Dairy.","In North America, the operating environment continues to be challenging. Volume erosion on existing business was significant and more than offset our growth from new wins. As mentioned, this was driven by several large product launches last year and we were comparing to growth of 11%, which is the most challenging comp of the year.","Finally, we saw continued very strong growth in Latin America of 15%, driven by our proprietary technologies in Beverages, which resulted in very strong growth in the category, reflecting a very high level of new wins. On a year-to-date basis, Latin America has grown by 19%. The second quarter is the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our Latin America region.","Turning to our profitability metrics. Flavors' gross margins remained strong at prior year levels as a result of our technology-driven wins and creative capabilities. Our segment profit improved by 1% or $0.9 million to $91 million or an increase of 20 basis points as a percentage of sales. The improvement reflects flat gross margins combined with decreased incentive compensation provisions versus the high level of a year ago. Our input costs continue to remain at elevated levels. On a year-to-date basis, our segment profit increased 3.5%, or $6 million, or an increase of 40 basis points.","Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2014. We expect growth to be moderate given the ongoing challenges in North America and Western Europe. We are carefully monitoring the situation, yet we remain confident we can continue to leverage our innovation and technology to grow our business.","I also want to highlight that we have begun to see input cost pressure on some items in our inventory. We are expecting to see the increased cost pressures in our P&L around the end of the year, and we will likely see headwinds in 2015. As a result, we have been proactively working with customers on price increases to help mitigate these inflationary pressures. As of 2014, our current strategic initiatives and other cost savings should offset any cost increases in 2014.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin, our CFO.","Kevin C. Berryman","Thank you, Matthias, and good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to turn back to our consolidated results. And on the slide, you can see that we delivered again strong operating metrics again in the second quarter on a consolidated basis. Our net sales of $788 million were up 4% on a reported basis and also on a local currency basis. Our consolidated sales includes the results from Aromor, which added a percentage point to our consolidated growth. This quarter, Fragrances comprised 52% of our sales and Flavors, the remaining 48%. Our growth was the result of our diversity in terms of regions, end-use categories and customers. Emerging markets grew 5% this quarter and the developed markets declined by 1%, reflecting a challenging environment in North America for Flavors and a slower growth in Fine Fragrance in Western Europe during the second quarter.","Our adjusted gross margin this quarter improved by 90 basis points to 45.1%. This primarily reflects gross margin expansion in Fragrance due to volume gains, certainly a result of strong new wins, currency benefits, as well as the favorable impact of price to input costs and internal improvement initiatives across both business units. The strong margin growth combined with lower incentive compensation and favorable currency resulted in an 8% increase in our adjusted operating profit to $156 million, resulting again in our operating profit margin rising to 19.8%, up 60 basis points from the year-ago figure of 19.2%.","Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter of 24.9% was favorable to our adjusted figure of 26.5% in the first quarter of 2013, reflecting higher earnings from lower tax jurisdictions and the effect of favorable tax settlements, partially offset by higher repatriation costs and the absence of the R&D tax credit in the current quarter. The strong operating profit growth, when combined with foreign exchange gains, lower interest expense and the positive impact on earnings per share of our share repurchase program, this resulted in a year-over-year improvement of 21% in our [indiscernible] $1.37.","Importantly, the growth in all of our profitability metrics in the second quarter are all at or above our long-term growth targets.","Now that we are halfway into the year, I wanted to put things into perspective by looking at our operating performance for the first half of 2014. It's important to note that on a year-to-date basis, all of our growth targets are in line with or above our long-term growth targets.","Our net sales of $1.6 billion increased 5% on both a reported and local currency basis, and of course, that includes approximately 1 percentage point of growth from Aromor. This is clearly within our long-term growth target of 4% to 6% organic growth.","Our adjusted gross margins also increased 130 basis points to 44.9%. Regarding adjusted operating profit, it increased 11% in the first 6 months of 2014, reflecting in part lower incentive compensation accruals. This equates to 110 basis point improvement in our operating profit to 20.2%. Finally, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 16% to $2.69 for the first 6 months of 2014, ahead of our long-term growth targets.","Turning to our research, selling and administrative costs. RSA, as a percent of sales, increased 30 basis points from 25% of sales to 25.3% of sales or an increase of $10 million. The primary drivers of the increase include Aromor-related cost, including operating and amortization and acquisition costs, investment in commercial resources to support our 3-pillar strategy, currency impacts and several discrete items. These higher expenses were partially offset by reduced incentive compensation accruals versus the very high levels in the second quarter of a year ago.","We remain focused on maintaining cost discipline while investing in R&D and other strategic growth opportunities. This quarter, R&D spending was 8.4% of sales versus 8.5% in the prior year. The prior year figure, as you may recall, includes an initial payment to Amyris, as well as other investments in research and development. Importantly, our emphasis on R&D has resulted in a stronger pipeline of innovation, and we continue to invest in our R&D platforms and the programs that support them. Our strong cash flow position and margins provides us with the continued flexibility to do so.","Turning to currency. Here, you see our customary chart showing the change and the strength of the euro relative to the dollar as the movement in the euro represents the large variable relative to currency impact on our results. As noted earlier, foreign exchange movements had a negligible impact on our top line growth.","As it relates to our adjusted operating profit and EPS results for the quarter, year-over-year currency impacts were positive. And at the operating profit line, we continue to proactively manage our gross margin profile through our cash flow hedging programs.","During Q2, we specifically benefited from a stronger U.S. dollar versus several of the emerging market currencies, which favorably impacted local expenses. Finally, EPS growth also benefited from the absence of foreign exchange losses and working capital, which we experienced in the second quarter of 2013 due to the high level of volatility in foreign exchange markets in the second quarter of last year. As a reminder, the 2014 -- for 2014, the majority of our euro exposure continues to be hedged at a rate of 1.32%, close to the full year average of 2013.","Turning to our cash flow. Our operating cash flow in the first half of 2014 was $154 million compared with an operating cash flow of $118 million in the prior year quarter. The prior year cash flow included a $30 million incremental U.S. pension contribution and the year-over-year increase reflects the $34 million improvement in net income, partially offset by increased incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of 2014 versus the first quarter of 2013. As a percent of sales, the current quarter operating cash flow is 9.9% of sales compared with 7.9% in the year-ago quarter.","Core working capital increased in absolute dollars to support business growth, however, declined on a percentage of sales basis and is on-track for targeted improvements that we outlined at the beginning of the year.","Turning to our capital structure. Capital spending for growth and infrastructure and newer technology continues to be our most important use of cash. Over the past 3 years, we have been investing approximately 4.5% of sales on adding capacity where it's needed to optimize our geographic footprint and to ensure that our proprietary technologies are available to our customers around the globe. We are also committed to returning capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Yesterday, our Board of Directors authorized a 21% increase or $0.08 in the quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share, up from the $0.39 per share a year ago. This dividend is payable on October 7 to shareholders of record as of September 25. Including this authorization, IFF's quarterly dividend payment will have grown by a compound annual growth rate of 15% over the last 4 years.","The current authorization importantly reflects the board's confidence in the company's ability to continue to execute on its 3-pillar strategy based on the notable progress we've made in expanding our geographic footprint, developing our R&D pipeline and improving the margin profile of our portfolio. The double-digit increase in the dividend also reflects our strong cash flow position. This enables us to maintain a competitive dividend yield, continue to execute against our share buyback program, all while maintaining a strong amount of financial flexibility to aggressively explore M&A opportunities.","Regarding our share buyback program. On a year-to-date basis, we have spent approximately $34 million on share buybacks. Total program spending since the first quarter of 2013 is $86 million through the end of the second quarter. Based on our programmatic share buyback program, we continue to expect that we will spend more on share buybacks in 2014 than we did in 2013.","Finally, as noted, we continue to evaluate business development opportunities. We are targeting those opportunities that would provide us with access to new technology, geography or business adjacency that would make strong strategic sense and leverage our expertise in science and technology. We have the financial flexibility to invest in both external business development activities, as well as our organic growth programs.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Doug.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Kevin, Mathias and Nicholas. As you've heard from our teams, we've had a good first half of the year with local currency sales growth of 5% and adjusted operating profit and earnings per share growth of 11% and 16%, respectively, all in line with or above our long-term targets. As you have heard, volume erosion on base business in Flavors put pressure on our top line growth despite a level of new wins that was in line with historical norms. We expect to see continued erosion in the third quarter in Flavors.","For the third quarter, we expect sales growth to be in line with our Q2 results as market conditions for Flavors will remain challenging. We expect to see continued gross margin expansion, but at a lower rate year-over-year, especially as we compare to the improved gross margin performance of the prior year and the improvements we saw in the first half of the year.","In addition, we are closely monitoring the input costs. And as Mathias and Nicolas indicated in their remarks, we expect to see some inflationary cost pressure around year end, which will have an impact on our 2015 P&L. As a result, we have been proactively working with customers on price increases to help mitigate these inflationary pressures. As to 2014, our current strategic initiatives and other cost savings should offset any cost increases in 2014.","Turning to the full year, given our current visibility, we now expect our full year local currency sales growth to be in the range of 4% to 6%. Our full year profitability metrics remain intact. Cost control and manufacturing efficiencies will continue to drive our operating profit growth. We are reconfirming our expectation for double-digit operating profit and earnings per share growth for the full year.","The investments we are making in R&D have resulted in a strong pipeline of innovation. We are confident that the commercialization of these technologies will result in continued sales growth and margin gains for the company.","As most of you know, in late May, we announced IFF's CEO Succession Plan. Effective September 1, I will be stepping down as Chief Executive Officer and will remain active as IFF's Chairman. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at IFF but have always said that at some point, I would scale back my involvement to make time for other activities. I have just celebrated my 65th birthday and I am looking forward to doing other things, including more time with my family, children and grandchildren.","The board has selected Andreas Fibig as the next CEO of IFF. Andreas has been a member of our board since 2011 and has been actively involved in setting our strategy and charting a course for the future. Andreas comes to us from Bayer Pharmaceutical, where he has successfully introduced new pharmaceutical solutions and drove a profitable growth agenda. Importantly, he is known to the Board of Directors and to our senior management team who value his insight and his input. He understands the value of R&D and driving the innovation agenda, understands and help develop our emerging market strategy and has previous operating experience in the emerging markets. Finally, Andreas has a successful track record with merger and acquisitions and will be a great addition to IFF as the company looks to further drive its profitable growth strategy, both organically and through business development activities. We welcome him to IFF and look forward to working with him, and I look forward to introducing him to many of you.","Here are the key takeaways from our second quarter call. In summary, our overall growth of 4% in the second quarter and 5% year-to-date reflects strong results in Fragrances and mixed results in Flavors. Our sales growth slowed in Q2 on account of greater erosion on existing business. We expect to see continued erosion in the third quarter in Flavors, which has led us to reduce our full year top line sales forecast.","The breadth and diversity of our portfolio provides greater stability to absorb variations in a particular region, category or customer. We can really see how effective this business model was for us this quarter as our overall growth of 4% had some great success which offset areas of weakness.","The second quarter compares to our most challenging quarter in 2013 from a top line growth standpoint. We continue to believe strongly in our strategy and long-term growth potential, and we are positioning IFF for future success. Our commitment to innovation, portfolio enhancement and internal improvements support our strong gross margin profile. We remain focused on our 3 strategic pillars: Leveraging our geographic footprint, enhancing our innovation and maximizing our portfolio.","I thank you for your participation today on our Q2 earnings call, and we will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I'm curious, given recent M&A in Flavors and Fragrances and adjacent categories, are there still value-accretive deals for IFF? And have you had to change the way you define value in terms of looking at that?","Douglas D. Tough","Good question, Mark. There's certainly been a recent spate of activity in a couple of areas. I think the broader question is, are there still opportunities there? And we believe the answer to that would be yes, conceivably both within the organic footprint, but also adjacencies which would leverage off the some of the skills and competencies we have, particularly in R&D. Some of the recent price points that have been achieved on a couple of the deals have certainly exceeded previous transactions, and that will weigh in on value. But I think as we've talked about in our 3-pillar strategy and the opportunities to continue to grow in the emerging markets as that middle class comes forward, we think there's still robust opportunity for growth. So it's not a prerequisite that we have M&A activity, but we are certainly, as Kevin pointed out, we have the financial firepower to do so if the opportunity presents itself, and we remain eager and we'll evaluate things. But you have used a critical word in there, which is, are there still value opportunities? And the economic profit discipline that we've instilled in the company will be germane to all the things we look at, and so we will have to have value in order to go forward. But we're confident there will be opportunities.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then just one follow-up for Matthias. Could you talk maybe a bit more about what's driving Flavors erosion? Is it large customers? Is it local customers? Is it specific categories of weakness? And maybe even talk about how that flowed through the quarter?","Matthias Haeni","Mark, this is Matthias speaking. As I tried to outline in the call, we had a significant erosion, particularly in North America. In North America, we were also up to significant comparables of last year as we have seen a few very large product introductions last year. These were seasonal, probably more trendy product launches, heavily supported by our customers and commercials. And we see in our shortfall versus prior year, approximately 2\/3 of our shortfall is driven by a few select products and customers. Going into Q3, I think we will see some continued softness not only from these introductions and the comparables, but also from the market situation, which turned to be a bit more challenging, and that has also been supported and communicated by many of our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I did just want to follow-up, I guess, first, on Asia. You've mentioned specifically that China and India were still quite strong, Thailand being the source of weakness. But just for the math to work, I mean Thailand is about, I think, 2% of company sales, which just seems like there may have been something else that was a drag, maybe it was a collection of things, but a little bit more color there would be really helpful.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Lauren, this is Matthias speaking again. Thank you for your question. I really tried to outline in Asia. We had seen a mixed picture. We had seen China, India grow strongly and we have seen some challenges in Southeast Asia. Not only Thailand, which is very much impacted by geopolitical situations and unfavorable market situations. We have also seen some challenges in Indonesia in the second quarter. However, I would like to remind, in the first quarter in Indonesia, we had very strong double-digit growth, and we expect to see a normalized pattern going forward.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then overall, at least in the way that I was modeling the quarter, North America actually was a little better than I expected. It was really EAME that kind of stood out as weaker-than-expected. At least as far as Western Europe goes, a lot of your customers, at least the publicly traded ones, have been talking about things maybe seeming a little bit better from a consumer standpoint there. So if maybe we could get a little bit of color on both Flavors and Fragrances, what you're seeing in Western Europe, and if the sources of weakness there was more developed or developing markets?","Matthias Haeni","This is Matthias again. In Western Europe, we experienced some of the challenges. I think it's not across-the-board. It is in a few -- with a few select customers. We keep on winning, thanks to our technology program, in particular, where we helped customers to reduce calories in products, but also to reduce sodium. We have a strong approach to pipeline, but as I outlined, we see some challenges relative to erosion of the business. Nicolas, do you maybe want to add something?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Lauren, it's Nicolas here. I will separate, obviously, the trend in Fine Fragrance in the Consumer Goods. As you saw, we had a very strong Q1 in Fine Fragrance of plus 18%. I think it's more related to order patterns, which had affected our performance in Q2. So overall, 5% growth for the first 6 months, which is above market performance. So I think that it's there, but -- we obviously watch out the overall environment and the economic situation. When I look at Consumer Fragrances, we have seen some pocket, obviously, of instability in the region, especially Middle East, Africa but also Eastern Europe, which is impacting the demands on our customers affecting consumer demand, which has created some pocket of headwinds. So we're seeing some improvement as our customers are mentioning. Would it be a meaningful improvement? I don't expect so. But at least we will see some improvement. So it's really a mixed performance according to the countries or subregion that you're talking about.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of your outlook for 2014, from double-digit EPS growth, you don't really need a lot of growth in the second half to get there. Can you maybe give us a little bit of help of how you see the second half? I know you don't like to give guidance on a quarterly basis, but are you implying that maybe the second half isn't double digits because your first half was pretty impressive.","Kevin C. Berryman","Mike, this is Kevin. I'll make just a few comments. We don't imply anything as it relates to what the second half of the business actually looks like in terms of performance level, but I think the mere fact that we are calling for strong double-digit growth in both operating profit and the EPS, I think is indicative that, again, we feel that our second half of the year is going to warrant good performance. At the end of day, we do have, as outlined, kind of a reduction from what we would have originally said on the top line. We had a 5% to 7% range. Now, we're a 4% to 6%. That doesn't mean anything other than probably the high end of our range before is probably unlikely now. And so consequently, we continue to believe that we have a good second half of the year.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right, great. And then a quick question on Fine Fragrances. Latin America still seems to be an area that continues to do well. I've heard Brazil is kind of a sore spot for some folks. Any worries there that, that business will slow down? Or do you have a pretty good backlog of new products to keep that momentum going as we head into the second half of the year?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Mike, it's Nicolas again. As you know, last year, we had a very strong first half where we grew 29%, which was far above the market performance. Here, you saw that after some challenge, but it was mostly due to strong comp, minus 15% in Q1 versus plus 38% last year. We have a lag on new good growth, 14% above 20% last year. So we have a good strong pipeline of new wins. But it is fair to say that across categories, Brazil has faced some slower growth rate across customers and product categories. So our pipeline of new wins is strong, and now, it will be -- we have to see other market, and the consumer demand will develop in the next few months. But our performance related to the market is strong. Now, we'll have to see what will be the impact of overall consumer demand.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And one quick one in North America Flavors. In terms of the market sentiment, are customers opting not to launch as many new products as we head into the second half of the year? Or is it maybe some attrition of the base business that's maybe going away faster than you would have thought?","Matthias Haeni","This is Matthias speaking. Frankly, I cannot tell what our customers are going to launch in the second half of this year. I can tell you that we have a strong project pipeline. Our commercial performance, which means the wins are in line with historical levels, yet still need the pressure on a few select customers, and volume remains strong. And we firmly believe we have the ability to win. We have a significant project pipeline, a very strong innovation pipeline that will make a significant difference, which is a lasting difference for our customers and IFF.","Douglas D. Tough","Now this is just an augmentation to what Matthias is talking through. If you look at the top line in the second quarter, you -- our growth from the new wins continue to be very solid. Where we saw the weakness, as Matthias outlined, really is more Flavors-specific and it's the erosion on existing business, which Matthias has already outlined, and some of that is associated with some discrete items on specific customers. So there is some other general erosion that we've seen in Flavors, but the thing that is most important and what we're driving relative to our innovation programs continues to be robust, and we see that pipeline being -- continuing to look pretty solid.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. I was wondering if you can indicate how much of the gross margin contribution this quarter came from volume price mix and how much may have been from a favorable pricing over raw materials?","Kevin C. Berryman","We haven't disclosed that information, Silke, but ultimately, we had drivers of volume mix because of the amount of our growth was more limited this quarter. And especially, as a Nicolas outlined, mix was not as positive as it normally is because of the Fine Fragrance situation that he suggested, but we saw good cost reduction initiatives. We saw some benefits on net pricing, and there was some currency all were adding up to be some positives as it relates to the gross margin.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the savings that you expect going forward, there are the benefits from the plant closure in Augusta, and my recollection is that was on an annual basis, maybe to deliver something like $6 million to $8 million. Do you think you may be able to get half of that in the second half? And what was the effect of the amortization expenses from Aromor that are falling away?","Kevin C. Berryman","The -- a couple of things. The $6 million to $8 million is still the expectation on an annual basis. So we would expect, given the timing of the closure, that we will get roughly half of that. Most of the costs as it relates to the acquisition, which we'll refer to, are really relative to the amortization cost. So those will be ongoing. Regardless, the net impact to Aromor on a total basis is immaterial within the context of the profitability of the company.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, I guess ultimately, just like to revisit the North American Flavors issue one more time. So the comparisons are really -- in North American Flavors were very difficult. And I agree, your commentary wasn't different than what your competitors said. Though, in the second half, the comparisons are becoming noticeably easier. And so one of the question is, will you -- is there 1 more quarter of headwinds because there's something customer-specific? Or is it going to be 2 or 3 more quarters of headwinds?","Matthias Haeni","Well, I thank you for your question. We will see continued softness in the third quarter in North America. You are right. We see ease -- comparisons easing in the fourth quarter. And we also expect the third quarter to improve relative to our second quarter performance in North America Flavors.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rohini Baza [ph] with Deutsche Bank.","Rohini Nair - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Rohini Nair from Deutsche Bank. Doug, wishing you all the best as you move on to the next adventure. A few more questions for me on North America Flavors. I guess I'd just love to understand whether you are actively taking any steps towards stemming this volume erosion that you're talking about? Or is it just that you eventually anticipate an improvement in the consumer environment? Along with that, what are you seeing from those specific challenged customers that you think they can improve on? Is it that their new product development is really not up to par? Are they not managing their inventories correctly? It'd just be great to have your thoughts around that.","Matthias Haeni","I think in North America, as we see some pressure overall in the market, we see more and more customers also being very cautious in product launches, and cautiousness is often the result of the seasonal launches. And if the seasonal launch is not going to be a big success, they will take it off the market. I think we see and we'll see continued situations in North America where very large customers are bringing a so-called limited time offerings to the market. We see it in many of the categories. And if this limited time offerings are not very strongly supported by commercials and marketing advertisements, you will see erosion quickly. Now I'm confident that with the project pipeline, which we have, and what we are working with our customers, we are working much more on iconic brands again, brands which are in the marketplace for quite some time, extensions of brands which will stay for a longer period of time. And it remains to be seen what we will get as new product launches in the fourth quarter. We have some visibility on the third one and we feel confident. As for the fourth and beyond, we will see what type of dynamics we are going to experience.","Douglas D. Tough","I would just want to build on something Matthias said, which is in the context of what are the actions being taken, and there's probably a couple. There's obviously a financial discipline associated with cost and investments. But we actually see some significant opportunities in the North American market, particularly with some customers. So both account management and focus on innovation, as well as opening of offices to support these customers, that's actually on our horizon because of the confidence we have in the innovation pipeline. So there's as much, if not more, offensive-based activities as they are defensive in terms of returning the business in North America to growth.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. If I could have just one quick follow-up. Those categories that you're seeing that are weak, is it basically across-the-board, Sweet, Savory, Dairy, Beverage, or are you seeing it more concentrated?","Matthias Haeni","I think it is more concentrated towards Savory and Beverages. And we keep on making very good inroads in other categories. I -- the isolated cases I was referring to from last year, they're in probably 2 categories only, and this is mainly related to Beverages.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC","Just one question I had. With some of the pressures in developed markets, Flavors business specifically, what's the competitive landscape end like? Has there been an uptick in bid activity or in competitive shuffling, as presumably, your competitors in Flavors are feeling some of the trends you're feeling right now? And to the extent you could mention the pricing environment as it relates to that competitive activity, I'd appreciate it.","Matthias Haeni","I think the -- I tried to outline -- we see some pressure in North America. We see some pressure in Western Europe. Nevertheless, given our opportunity and ability, coupled with the very strong project pipeline and our innovation programs, we are obviously -- these opportunities materializing for us very positively going forward. We have a lot offer to our customers. And what our offering is not only adding great flavors. In our offering, we also are in the position to add taste to products, and with taste, we are also, at the same time, engineering, together with customers, on lower-cost recipes for their own consumers. So overall, I'm very confident that we see opportunities in both in the developed markets, but also in the developing markets, and our growth and model and growth thesis remains strong. And we have a very sound, solid foundation in the Flavors business unit.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edward Yang.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","A question on pricing and raw materials. What percentage type of price increases do you need from your customers to offset some of the raw material prices -- pressures you're seeing?","Kevin C. Berryman","Ed, this is Kevin. We haven't disclosed that. And as you know, at the end of the year, when we talk to our Q4 results, we'll give a perspective on what the expected inflation levels are, and that may give you a better indication as to what kind of pricing may be required to help offset that pressure. But at the end of the day, we don't believe that we're faced -- just to make a few comments, we don't believe we're faced with the situation back in 2011, where we had double-digit input cost, but we do fundamentally believe that there are areas where we're going to have to take pricing to help offset input cost pressure beginning in 2015. So we'll talk more about that at the end of the year during our Q4 call. But not to be an alarmist, there's no need for us to be thinking along the lines of what would have happened in 2011. Your competitors will also, I would assume, be taking the same kind of positions because they'll be interested in trying to recover some of the input cost pressures they would see as well.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it, and that's helpful, Kevin. And along that vein, I'm still -- I am surprised that you are talking about raw material pressures because, in general, it doesn't seem like the raw environment or the commodity environment is necessarily very heated right now. Raw material price pressures, are they driven by capacity reductions in certain areas, or drought, because I don't really see energy prices up all that much. And are there any offsets -- you mentioned naturals as the place where you're seeing raw material pressures, but in synthetics, are you seeing price declines to offset some of those pressures?","Kevin C. Berryman","I think that you're right. The good thing about the diversity of our spend is that there's often times pieces of the portfolio that will go up, and it's often times offset to at least, to some extent, by other pieces of the portfolio that will go down. I would say the one area, and you've already outlined it, which we expect to in general have higher levels, is in the naturals area. We've already called out in the past, Citrus, as one particular area where we know that there's going to be some increases versus our current levels, and there's a few others. But in general, the majority of the pressure points are seen in the naturals area. There would be some others in the Fragrance Ingredients side, but ultimately, it's more in the naturals area at this particular point in time. And that's where we are focusing most of our discussions with our customers right now in terms of those future price increases.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah Donnelly with Gabelli & Co.","Sarah Donnelly - G. Research, Inc.","I just wanted to ask about some of the weakness which you mentioned in Savory and Beverages. Can you just talk a little bit about demand and the technology you have around sodium and sugar substitution and whether that continues to drive demand around new product or project -- your new product pipeline in North America and how it's impacting it globally?","Matthias Haeni","Yes, Sarah, this is Matthias again. I mentioned before, in North America we have seen pressure on few select customers. So it's not across the Savory market or it's not across the Beverage market. Where we have seen pressure are product introductions that were very trendy, very fashionable, heavily supported last year. And also, we have seen our customers building up inventory for such a significant launch. And this is why we are also coming under pressure relative to last year's performance. Coming into the project pipeline, I mentioned to you before, we have a very strong project pipeline in both of what you've described in sodium, as well as in sweetness or in calorie reduction. We are very active, actively engaged with our customers with large global accounts, as well as with regional accounts to take calories out of recipes, not only in beverages but also in other product offerings, in other categories. And we got very positive response. And our win rate typically is significantly higher once we can allocate technology into the recipe design with our customers.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up question from Mark Astrachan.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to go back to the earlier M&A question. Curious how you would describe your customers' reception to your competitors to do more business with those that have engaged in M&A and sort of adjacent categories and offering more of a one-stop shop, so in other words, you go beyond Flavors and Fragrances. Are customers more or less willing to engage with them? And how do they sort of think about things broadly, their reception to those deals?","Douglas D. Tough","Well, it's a broad question, Mark, and maybe I'll take the first swing at it and then Matthias can weigh in with some second thoughts. It seems to be a bit of a mixed bag. Some -- there will be a certain degree of receptivity from some customers, probably smaller ones who are looking for a one-stop shop, but almost to the contrary, some of the other larger ones have unbundled things and aren't necessarily looking for that opportunity for a one-stop shop, and as I say to the country, actually going the other direction. So I think it's certainly early to tell. Some companies have that as their business model. It's not the IFF business model that would be the one-stop shop. Matthias, do you want to say anything?","Matthias Haeni","I can echo what Doug outlined. I think medium-sized, or probably small-sized companies, they will appreciate a total product offering. It helps them in the facilitation of their recipe engineering, recipe design. And they also got a lot of probably additional technical advices from companies offering a total solution. When it comes to larger and above all, global accounts, they would typically ask you, Mark, to unbundle your total solutions and systems as they want to have control over individual ingredients and there will be very limited appreciation for what we think is the total solution for it. It may change from account to account. But if you want the experience, then this is what we are working with our customers on.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the call back over to Doug.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you very much, operator. Thank you, all, for your participation on our Q2 call. And we'll look forward to our discussion in early November with our Q3 results. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau","Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Yesterday evening, we announced our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.","Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2019. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 26, 2019, and our press release that we filed yesterday.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release.","For purpose of this presentation, we calculated combined numbers by combining our results of -- with the results of Frutarom prior to the acquisition on October 4, 2018, and adjusting for divestitures of Frutarom businesses since October 4, 2018.","With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We'll start with prepared remarks, and then take any questions that you may have.","With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Mike. On the call today, I will give an overview of our operational performance for the first quarter of 2019. After that, I will go through our integration progress and priorities as we see them today. Once finished, I will ask Rick to give a more in-depth financial review of our business performance, and then I will provide an update on our outlook for the balance of the year and take any questions that you may have.","I'm pleased to report that our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations as we achieved double-digit sales and adjusted operating profit growth, including benefits related to the acquisition of Frutarom. In the quarter, we delivered a record-setting quarterly sales of approximately $1.3 billion, a 39% increase over last year.","On a comparable basis and excluding the impact of divestitures, currency-neutral growth was achieved in all 3 segments led by scent at 4%, Frutarom at 3% and Taste at 2% or 3% overall growth. We also maintained strong profitability levels as productivity initiatives, cost synergies and price realization offset higher year-over-year raw material cost. This combined with the addition of Frutarom led to a very strong 13% increase over the prior year period.","Earnings per share, excluding amortization, came in at $1.57 as adjusted operating profit growth was more than offset by higher interest expense and shares outstanding, both related to the Frutarom acquisition.","In the first quarter, we continued to strengthen our portfolio via acquisitions and collaboration that expand our innovation platforms and product offerings beyond traditional flavors and fragrances. In January, we completed the acquisition of 60% of the share capital of Mighty, a leading Savory Solutions provider in Thailand. Mighty develops, produces and markets reaction flavors, with particular expertise in Savory Solutions. ","The company's portfolio includes flavors, seasoning blends, marinades and specialty function raw materials for the food and beverage industry. We also established an industry-exclusive collaboration with Aryballe, a pioneer in digital olfaction technology based in France. To refine and further develop the flavor and fragrance capabilities in applications of Aryballe's technology in portable, universal odor detection sensors.","Together, we were focused on the development of odor sensing and quality control application with a goal of creating a platform for applications in the food, fragrance, cosmetic and other industries.","In February, we announced that we expanded and strengthened our delivery capabilities for scent, taste and active ingredients so the acquisition of The Additive Advantage, a company that develops novel technologies with diverse capabilities that span many application and industries. TAA has the expertise to develop the next-generation 3D delivery systems, technology platforms that will enable the printing of flavors, fragrances, cosmetic and health and nutrition actives onto a variety of consumer products.","We're excited about this technology as it builds upon our market leadership position and capabilities and delivery technology. And lastly, in March, we announced that we completed the acquisition of 70% stake in Leagel, a producer of ice cream and gelato ingredients in Europe, a family-owned company based in San Marino, Italy, which specializes in artisanal taste, texture and toppings sold directly to ice cream and gelato shops. We see great opportunities to combine Leagel with SDFLC, our existing Brazilian ice cream and dessert business to create a global platform for gelato ingredients, expand our geographic reach and leverage cross-selling opportunities.","All four provide opportunities for us to develop stronger innovation and differentiate ourselves where there is competition. In terms of integration, I'm pleased to say that we are executing very well against our priorities. We've made strong advancements year-to-date on our year 1 cost synergy target of approximately $30 million to $35 million. In the first quarter, we achieved approximately 15%, and we expect savings benefit will accelerate throughout the year. Based on where we are today, we are confident that we can achieve our $30 million to $35 million cost-savings goal as our current run rate savings are already in excess of this target.","We also outlined our cross-selling priorities and execution plan to provide a foundation for cross-fertilization opportunities across the organization. While we will discuss and disclose more details at our upcoming Investor Day, I'm happy to report that we already have achieved approximately $7 million of annualized new businesses from the quick wins.","For those businesses, where we have aligned to our go-to-market approach as IFF, North America Taste and IBR growth was very strong increasing double digit. In the U.S., Frutarom's North American Taste business has successfully been merged into Tastepoint, our go-to-market approach to service small and mid-sized customers. The alignment of Frutarom's cosmetic active ingredients business with our Lucas Meyer Cosmetics is now complete, and we're seeing strong benefit with sales up double digits in quarter 1 2019. We have all created a global Savory Solutions organization under one leader to share best practices globally and collaborate with our taste division to ensure we continue to capture market share in this growing segment.","I will let Rich discuss the financials in greater detail, including debt repayment and cash flow in a moment. Going deeper into our cost synergies, we continue to optimize our global footprint and have closed our Manningtree site in the U.K. In addition, our operations team is actively completing the necessary steps for further network consolidation, and we expect additional sites to be closed throughout the year, all in line with our plan.","In regard to procurement savings, we have renegotiated a significant portion of our spend for leverage savings and are adjusting our saving strategy to benefit from significant make versus buy opportunities. With these in mind, we confidently believe that we are on track to achieve our full year target of approximately $30 million to $35 million, and again our current run rate savings are well in excess of our plan.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich to take you in the details for financial performance.","Richard O'Leary","Thank you, Andreas. In the Scent business, first quarter currency-neutral sales grew 4% versus a strong 8% year ago comparison with growth in nearly all regions and categories. Performance was strongest in Fine Fragrances, increasing double digits, led by strong new wins. Consumer Fragrances grew mid-single digits with double-digit growth in Home Care and mid-single digit growth in Fabric Care.","Fragrance Ingredients was down year-over-year as price increases related to continued high raw material costs were more than offset by volume declines. Scent currency-neutral segment profit decreased approximately 3% at the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable year-over-year price to input costs, which reflects the unprecedented raw material inflation we have been facing since late 2017. Scent pricing was approximately 3.5% in Q1, however not enough to recover the full cost increase. As communicated previously, we will work to continue -- we will continue to work with our customers on actions to mitigate these increases and are confident in our ability to fully recover the dollar impact. In terms of segment profit margin, year-over-year performance was down, however our margin profit remained strong at 17.6%.","Turning to the Taste business. In the first quarter 2019, currency-neutral sales grew 2% with growth in 3 or 4 regions. Performance in the quarter was driven by mid-single digit growth in Greater Asia, where India and Indonesia grew double digits and in EAME, led by strong growth in Africa, Middle East and Western Europe.","In North America, year-over-year improvements continued to be led by Tastepoint. In Latin America, year-over-year declines were primarily due to weak demand from multinational customers and market conditions in Argentina and Mexico. Taste currency-neutral segment profit decreased approximately 1% as volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable price to raw material costs and weaker mix. For Frutarom, in the first quarter, sales totaled approximately $364 million. On a stand-alone basis, Frutarom sales grew 3% against the strong year ago comparison, excluding the contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses. Sales were driven by strong growth in Taste, led by double-digit growth in North America and solid increases in Savory Solutions despite challenges in certain segments.","F&F Ingredients was pressured as a result of order patterns in their CitraSource business and raw material driven price decreases in the natural colors. In terms of segment profit, Frutarom delivered $29 million and $69 million, excluding amortization. The margin profile for Frutarom in the first quarter continues to be strong at 18.7%, if you exclude amortization driven by disciplined cost management.","Given the several moving parts, we wanted to give you an overview of year-over-year combined company results. In this chart, you can see from the first and second bars, $930 million from IFF and $402 million of Frutarom would represent a combined $1.33 billion top line for the company in the first quarter of 2018. In the third bar, we had approximately $23 million of divestitures related to non-core Frutarom businesses in Central Europe and the U.S., resulting in a combined first quarter 2019 sales of $1.31 billion. Of the $23 million of divestitures that we outlined, most of it was driven by the accrual business that was previously announced as a divestiture as part of the Enzymotec acquisition last year.","In the fifth bar, we estimated approximately $51 million of currency headwind to bring us to a currency-neutral combined first quarter 2018 sales base of $1.26 billion. Bridging to our $1.3 billion that we reported in Q1 2019, we achieved 3% sales growth on a combined currency-neutral basis.","Moving on to adjusted operating profit. If you combine the first and second bars, combined adjusted operating profit of the company would have been $237 million for the first quarter 2018. We had approximately $2 million in divestitures related to the non-core Frutarom business, I just discussed. Next is approximately $30 million related to step up amortization, following the Frutarom acquisition. This represents a combined Q1 2018 adjusted combined operating profit of $205 million. From the year we estimated approximately $7 million headwind due to currency, brings us to a currency-neutral combined first quarter of $198 million. And finally, our $205 million in operating profit for Q1 '19 resulted in approximately 3% growth on a combined company basis.","And finally, in terms of adjusted EPS amortization, combining the first and second bars of $1.78 for IFF and $0.70 from Frutarom, it would have been represented -- it would have represented $2.48.","On the next bar, you can see the debt issuance last year had a $0.24 impact. The share count dilution from the equity issuance going from approximately 80 million shares outstanding in the first quarter of '18 to approximately 113 million shares outstanding now creates a $0.67 per share dilution impact on a combined company basis. This drives $1.57 adjusted EPS for the combined first quarter of 2018. We then estimate approximately $0.14 of currency headwind on EPS to bridge you to a currency-neutral combined first quarter ex-amortization of $1.43. We then bridge to $1.57 that we reported in Q1 '19. We achieved approximately 10% growth on a combined company basis.","Before moving onto cash flow, I'd like to take a moment to provide you greater insight with respect to our organic top line performance relative to our peers. As a reminder, for a variety of reasons, many of our sales transaction in emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies for our impacts to the hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies.","When reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets. We believe this is much more accurate representation of underlying performance, but it is different from our peers. We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a true assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help put our performance in perspective relative to the competition.","For the first quarter of 2019, adjusted -- adjusting our currency-neutral sales growth calculation to a basis which we believe is comparable to have our competition reports, our consolidated organic currency-neutral sales would have been 3 percentage points higher or approximately 6%. As you can see, the largest variances come from countries with significant currency devaluations versus hard currencies. In the first quarter, on a consolidated basis 4 countries, Argentina, Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia represented approximately 95% of the difference in the way we report and how our competition reports.","We feel this is important to highlight the difference in reporting in assessing industry performance, given the potential significant impacts that currency movements can have on top line growth rates.","Turning to operating cash flows. Our cash flow for the quarter increased $58 million to $47 million in 2019 compared to negative $11 million in the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase is driven by higher earnings, excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization and improved working capital performance. Core working capital improved driven by continued progress in accounts payable and more favorable inventory trends. From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $58 million in CapEx or about 4.4% of sales led by a new plant and capacity investments, mainly in Greater Asia, which we have disclosed in the past.","Regarding cash returned to shareholders, we paid approximately $78 million or about 42% of our adjusted net income in dividend payout. As a reminder, as part of the Frutarom combination, we paused our share repurchase program as we prioritize debt repayments going forward. In the first quarter of 2019, our debt repayment was approximately $36 million. We remain committed to reaching our 3x leverage ratio by the end of 2020, down from approximately 3.6x at the end of 2018.","With that, let me turn it back over to Andreas.","Andreas Fibig","Thank you, Rich. As we look at the balance of the year, we reconfirm our full year financial guidance. We expect our sales growth to accelerate in the second half, give more favorable year-ago comparisons. In terms of profitability, we also anticipate that adjusted operating profit will improve, driven by higher integration savings, continued cost control and productivity savings and more favorable year-over-year price raw material cost trends. For the full year, we expect to deliver between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion in sales in 2019, which represents 5% to 7% combined company growth, including M&A. We also expect to deliver between $6.30 and $6.50 in adjusted EPS, excluding amortization or 8% to 11% combined company growth.","In summary, we're pleased with our performance for the first quarter as we delivered strong double-digit sales and adjusted operating profit growth. We achieved solid growth across all 3 divisions, all while maintaining strong profitability levels. We continue to make strong progress in the company's transformation following the Frutarom acquisition as we combine two strong organizations. We're executing well against our integration road map.","For those businesses where we have aligned our go-to-market approaches IFF, growth is very strong. We also continue to make great progress in terms of cost synergies, and I'm very confident that we will achieve our $30 million to $35 million cost-savings goal in 2019. Given this, total expected improvement in the second half of 2019 that we confirmed our financial guidance for 2019.","Before I open the call up to questions, I would like to take a moment to invite everyone to our Investor Day on June 5 here in New York City. We're excited to provide an update on our long-term strategy, give you deeper insights into our integration efforts and provide each of you with an opportunity to experience the best innovation of our organization. Registration links have been sent out, but if you need it again or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations Department.","With that, I would now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Astrachan","I wanted to ask about expectations for Frutarom sales growth going forward, given some of the positives and negatives, which you outlined in the earnings release this morning. So I guess, specifically, do you anticipate your annual sales growth to improve as comparisons get easier over the balance of the year, including in 2Q? And what is the current outlook for the expectations for that business, please?","Andreas Fibig","Yes. Thank you, Mark, for the question. Yes, first of all, the first quarter was in line with our expectations. We have seen some weakness in parts of our Russian business and the F&F business, in particular with CitraSource and that's it, material price decreases with natural colors. We don't believe that this will change in the short term, but we're working on it to make it grow significantly in the future. So we expect actually a higher growth rate in the second half of the year, and that's what we project. What we have seen so far is that, in particular Taste business has very good growth with the small and mid-size customers. And the businesses we have integrated in our, let's say, Tastepoint organization or Tastepoint like organization whether it's in the U.S. or in Latin America that they are growing quite nicely. So which is good and it reinforces, let's say, our strategy to have a much more balanced customer portfolio not just with the big CPG, but with some of the smaller and mid-size companies here as well, which probably is very helpful going forward in the mid and long erm.","Mark Astrachan","Okay. So mid-single digits would still be the expectations for the business?","Andreas Fibig","Yes.","Mark Astrachan","And then also, Rich, what was the impact from the switch from like-for-like to organic for that business?","Richard O'Leary","For the first quarter, it's really -- it's in the material. I mean, we had some divestitures going out and then the two deals were small. So it was clearly immaterial for Q1.","Mark Astrachan","And then expectations for the year, does that change anything in the calculus either?","Richard O'Leary","No, because I mean, we had -- these were in the pipeline, so it was part of the overall guidance of 5% to 7%. So I don't think that's changed materially in terms of the components, in terms of what gets us to the full year guidance. So I think we're on track to where we thought we're going to be from an M&A standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","My first question was on Latin America. So actually, I mean, Rich, it was helpful when you pointed out the FX piece of it, but that was a total company number. So I was just curious, it does still seem like Latin America decelerated pretty significantly. Is that -- can you just talk a little bit what might be going from a market share standpoint in the release you specifically called out multinational customers? So we're just curious a little bit more about Latin America.","Richard O'Leary","Yes. Look, I think that there's two -- there's couple of things. One, overall and also in Latin America specifically, growth with multinationals was basically flat, whereas the rest of the Taste business was growing high single digits or higher. So I think that's certainly big piece of it. Then we're also seeing particularly in Argentina, the effects from a macro standpoint in terms of the devaluation and what it's having in terms of consumer disposable incomes and purchase underlying demand. I think we -- the third thing that we talked about in the release was in Mexico, there has been some market changes from a legislation standpoint, that's also we're seeing some pressure from a market standpoint in terms of the consumer behaviors. Other than that, I think, there is some small -- there is some business that, I think, we did -- we lost, but it was more it was things -- business that we didn't have before, but I don't see many major shifts in market shares in LatAm. I think it's mostly the macro stuff and then just our mix of customers versus the competition.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. Actually, it's a good point on the large CPGs. We don't see too much volume growth, particularly on existing business. It's not that strong. It's a bit contrary for what we heard during the CAGNY conference. So I guess, it will take a bit of time until it turns to good growth again, but we will see in the months to come.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Great. And then also I just read about the 10-Q last night, and there was a comment around that for the next several quarters lower margin and then increases in selling and admin expenses. So it sounds like then the right way to think about it might be that even with the second half sort of acceleration that you're talking about that we still have EBIT margins down probably for another, call it, two quarters and a lot of the improvement is really fourth quarter weighted. Is that fair?","Richard O'Leary","I think certainly -- yes, I think that certainly second half is going to be better. I think, as we get through -- as we start -- continue to get the traction on the price increases and the price realization, which the teams have done a really good job in the scent business so far, but that's going to continue to build. That obviously has a dilutive impact. I mean, Q3, again I think we've talked about along was going to be one of the strongest quarters. Q4 sequentially is always down versus Q3, but we should -- we still expect to see year-over-year improvements in Q4.","Lauren Lieberman","Got it. So Q3 you expect EBIT margins to be up or just sequentially improving?","Richard O'Leary","Yes.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. Up.","Richard O'Leary","Up.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Okay. So the comment in the Q is really more focused on 2Q because it does say for several quarters and that's why I was trying to adjust...","Andreas Fibig","Yes.","Richard O'Leary","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","I have two questions. What is the total revenue divestitures from Frutarom on an annual basis? And in the quarter, did Frutarom prices rise? And if they did, by how much?","Andreas Fibig","Okay. So probably, I'd take the second one first. So there was no price increase on the Frutarom side. That's #1. And the total year, Rich...","Richard O'Leary","It's about $45 million, Jeff, in total.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts","Thanks for the currency adjusted organic sales growth numbers. I was little surprised that Natural Colors was weak. I thought that was in the area of some early revenue synergies. Could you give us some more color on that, no pun intended?","Richard O'Leary","Yes. Look for me, the organic -- the volume -- actually, unit volumes are quite strong. They are quite good growth. What's happening is in one of the key raw materials the cost is coming down and similar to what we see in the other parts of the business like the vanilla, there is a pass-through component of it. So all of the decline in the color stuff is really driven by cost pass-through, and so it's impacting the top line growth. Really no significant change into our overall operating margins. So it's really -- I think we feel good about -- structurally about the health of the business and the growth opportunities. So it's more just a market dynamic around the pricing.","John Roberts","And then secondly, as you've been changing your portfolio, would you guess, how much of your sales are still via a formal brief process? And how much of your sales would be with no formal brief associated with it?","Richard O'Leary","I guess, for me the way I think about it, I mean, still the majority of the legacy IFF business is driven by the briefs. We still have -- there is a still piece of it, which is proactive us going to our customers within technologies. I was characterized the majority of the Frutarom business as being more of a push business, where we are contacting them on a daily, weekly basis saying here what you need, here is what we have available. So I think it's more big -- I think we have a big picture between legacy IFF is still the majority briefs driven and Frutarom is a slightly different model.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen of Exane.","Heidi Vesterinen","So we talked about how H2 will be a lot better than H1. Would you be able to talk about what you're seeing so far in Q2 by segment, please?","Andreas Fibig","Heidi, that's -- it's Andreas. Good afternoon. It's probably a bit early right now to talk about this and to different segments. The only I might say is that we still see good growth out of the scent business because of pricing, because we're going through our [indiscernible] but for the rest, I would say, it's still a bit too early to comment.","Richard O'Leary","Heidi, look, I think we're seeing, I would say, some similarities between what we saw in Q1, we had a slow start to the quarter. And I -- look, some of the things that we talked about with Savory business, the CitraSource business, we are making changes, we are addressing those issues, but they're not going to change overnight. So I think we're confident in the full year, but I would not expect the major dramatic change between Q2, Q1.","Heidi Vesterinen","And on the scent business, it seems like it's been a few quarters now where most of the growth is pricing and there is minimal volume growth. What has been driving that? And what is the outlook?","Richard O'Leary","Well, the pricing -- still the majority of it is pricing, but -- I mean, that's clearly the pass-through of the -- or the recapture of the input cost increases. I think we are seeing good win performance in the commercial performance in terms of new wins or near the 5-year average. So I think we've seen continue improvement, particularly in the last 2 quarters. Volume erosion was well above the historical average, more than double from what it was over a 5-year average. So I think that's again more some of that gets into the customer mix. We've seen similar trends that the growth rates in the small- and medium-sized customers are double digits and more challenged on the global. So I think the other thing we feel really good about long term is we talked about it last year, we've gotten access -- more access to new business with the core list expansions we got last year, and that's going to provide a tremendous amount of upside to us over the next 3 to 5 years.","Andreas Fibig","Which is actually, let me supplement on this. These three new core list access will give us access to $400 million additional business we didn't have before, and we see out of these three new customers that already two are very active in briefing and where we're getting business and actually early and faster than we had expected.","Richard O'Leary","I think the other thing, Heidi, just, I mean, to put in perspective, I mean, we're still seeing good growth -- really solid growth on volumes in the compounds business. And where we're really seeing declines are on the Ingredients business, partly between because we're prioritizing the internal consumption and partly because we're raising prices and there are certain customers out there that have more elasticity in their demand. One thing I want to just go back to your question earlier in terms of the performance during the course of the year, we'll see sequential improvement Q1, Q2, Q3 will still be down year-over-year in Q3, but it sequentially will improve through the first 3 quarters, just to clarify my earlier comment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann of Bernstein.","Gunther Zechmann","Just on the scent division, you said already that the majority of the growth is driven by price. I would have thought that the mix in scent should be very favorable as well. Finally find Fragrance is growing very strongly, double-digit is that, but the margin is down so much. So can you just elaborate how much you're still losing to raw material cost inflation? And if there was any other factors in there -- in your cost?","Richard O'Leary","Sure. I mean, keep in mind, Gunther, I mean, we -- the teams have done a really good job, but we're not fully recovered in terms of the price realization. Year-over-year, Q1 input costs were up 10%. So that's still a significant headwind. You take that plus the cumulative effect of the price realization we had last year plus the first quarter as the dilutive effect on the overall margin. So I think we are on the right track. We're confident now we're going to be able to fully recover those costs during the course of the year and into early next year, but it does have a negative impact in terms of the margins.","Andreas Fibig","But in general, we're very happy with the performance of our Fine Fragrance business as you're aware we're saying we're up quite significantly and that certainly is because of the good win performance here.","Richard O'Leary","And that's helped to offset -- mitigate the impact of not being able to fully recover the input cost increases in Q1.","Gunther Zechmann","And on the raw material cost, just a follow-up, the 10% increase that you mentioned, is that just for scent? Or is that for the group? And also what's your outlook? How fast do you expect those costs to flatten or partly reverse like we've seen with Vanilla and a few Synthetic inputs over the course of the year?","Richard O'Leary","The 10% is just scent. And so I think again for the full year, I expect input cost percent to be up high single digits and 4% to 5% on a total company basis. So the full year guidance and expectations haven't changed. I would say, it's a little early to say when and if we would see some normalization right now for the year. We're not seeing anything significant.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Sison of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael Sison","Just curious on Frutarom's operating margin. We saw what it was in the first quarter. How do you think that improves throughout the year and maybe run rate exits the year? And then when you think about sort of that metric longer term, what do you think we should be for Frutarom in the 2021, 2022 time frame?","Richard O'Leary","Look, Mike, I think it's going to -- we expect it to improve, I think, similar to what we see in the IFF business Q2, Q3 will be stronger. Q4, I still would expect it to be better than Q1. So I think we're going to see improvement, obviously growing the return to our long-term expectations from a growth standpoint of being in the 5% to 6% range versus 3%. You get the fixed cost leverage there. So I think long-term, we still see significant upside in terms of profitability.","Andreas Fibig","And when the synergies role in, and that's the brunt of the synergies will come in next year and that will have a significant impact on margin, obviously.","Michael Sison","Right. Okay. And then so at what point do you think operating income will grow year-over-year? Will that start in 2Q? Or is that more of a second half phenomenon for Frutarom?","Richard O'Leary","I would expect we would see it in the second half. I mean, certainly, again Q3 should be the strongest quarter of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","Just going back to the raw material question, Rich, and just want to be clear. So are you implying that you haven't seen the Synthetics come off yet? Or it's just because of the way the lags you have in terms of your procurement and your inventory that any decline really wouldn't be felt till the end of the year?","Richard O'Leary","I think it's both. I think that #1 we have the inventory impact, but we have not seen any significant movements in the pricing for the input cost yet. So that's -- it's both of those factors.","Adam Samuelson","And is that -- would you say -- I mean, are you surprised at that just given brent -- I mean, it's valid year-to-date, but off of the highs that you saw in the second half of last year and especially with better -- seems like some of your major suppliers haven't had some of the bigger disruptions again? Just are you surprised you haven't seen any of those pricing declines at all?","Richard O'Leary","Look, I think there's two things. One from an oil standpoint, remember we're the derivative impact were 4 or 5 steps down the chain. So the actual oil impact has much smaller influence on it versus the conversion cost. I think the second thing is a big piece of what we've seen over the last 15 months has been more driven around supply interruptions and that's really what we continue to see issuances. I mean, it started with the BASF stuff, but I think that is equally important as it is purely just a brent pricing impact.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. And then just separately, just in the Taste business, I mean, I know the organic growth this quarter was similar to where you were in 4Q, and this is the hardest comp, the comps are still tough. But were you -- from a demand perspective, just seems like Latin America got worse as you looked at Argentina and Mexico and some of the issues you called out there? Is there anything in any other regions that you would call out as noteworthy positively or negatively?","Richard O'Leary","No. I think the biggest thing to me is what I mentioned earlier is really is the lack of growth from a global standpoint, the multinational companies, as I said earlier, growth was essentially 0, flat for the Q1 as opposed to being high single digits up for the small and midsized customers. So that's what we're seeing. I think it was more acute in Latin America for some of the things that I mentioned, as you said for Argentina and Mexico.","Operator","Your next question comes from Daniel Jester of Citi.","Daniel Jester","Just first on the synergies comments you made about hitting the run rate for the full year already. I'm just wondering what we saw 6-plus month left to go in the year, is there a reason why you're not lifting that synergy goal? And just maybe walk us through about how we should be thinking about the progression of that through the rest of the year?","Andreas Fibig","The thing is that we have the most improvement on the procurement savings and the run rates are really, really strong here, but it's also driven by our inventory and that's the reason why it takes some time that it falls through the P&L. So we have the better contract in place, but we still until it hits the P&L, we have to decrease our inventory and bring new material on. That's the reason. But for us, it's -- we're optimistic because it will have a very good impact on next year already because the team is doing an extraordinary job to make that happen. That's basically the main reason.","Richard O'Leary","Yes. I think it's the inventory impact is the primary driver at this point.","Daniel Jester","Okay. That's very helpful. And then on Taste margins, they have been down year-over-year for a couple of quarters, I think the raw material issue seems like it's a lot more of a scent related issue. So I'm just wondering if you can talk about margins in case and how you see those progressing?","Richard O'Leary","On the taste side, I think, Q1 was certainly impacted on from a mix standpoint, it was unfavorable. There was some price to input cost more timing related to, I would say, on the Vanilla side. Overall, I would expect this to see more or less in the same range. I mean, I think it's still quite healthy at the levels we're at. I mean, the margins are still quite healthy in the 24% range. So I think it's -- I don't see any major change in it. I mean, we're happy where they are. I mean, the business is performing quite well when you look at the underlying details.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Hundley of Seaport Global.","Brett Hundley","I just have two questions. My first one relates to raw materials. You guys sound pretty confident in being able to recover the inflation you've seen as you move into next year. I acknowledge this is a tough question, but just taking U.S. and China trade as a backdrop, citral, PG, a number of chemicals are on that tariff list. Can you just speak to that a little bit insofar as describing your confidence in being able to recover raw material price increases whatever they may be into next year? And then separately, my second question relates back to a comment that you made, Rich, in just talking about legacy IFF and the composition of your sales contracts or briefs rather than how they have dominated that commercial side of the business for a long time now. As MNCs revisit growth and innovation again just after years of cost cutting, I'm imagining that product technology and speed to market are going to become increasingly important just as they have been for the L&R customers out there for a while now. What does that mean for the briefing process and pricing in your view, if anything? Do you have any thoughts on that?","Richard O'Leary","Let me take the first one. I mean, I think from a -- keep in mind that our U.S. basis is quite small, it's less than 25% of the totals of our sales base. So when we look at rate in the current environment, when looking at the tariff discussions and what's in the current framework. It's not a material number, I mean, it's in the $10 million to $20 million range, potentially if they weren't fully implemented then we have alternatives on how to -- where we can source it. So I don't -- we don't see it as a significant headwind in terms of overall operating model. Let me just turn over to Andreas for the second.","Andreas Fibig","If I take the second part of the question on legacy sales and MNC performance, indeed what we see in our discussions is that the topics are now more growth related and growth should be simulated by innovation, which is great, because we have in IFF internally now an excellent pipeline in terms of new technologies. And as you have seen even in the first quarter, we've acquired a couple of technologies, which will help us to grow our business, which is good because I wholeheartedly believe that the competition and the differentiation works through technology, and that will help us to win more business. By the way some of these innovations or technologies we have or had in the pipeline helped us to win the 3 core list last year. So I'm very optimistic on this one going forward. Now the only thing we need the big MNCs getting their volumes up and that certainly will lift the tide here.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I just have one follow-up, which may be a little bit more long-term and strategic. So as you're managing the Frutarom business, I was just curious like this continued pace of acquisition that you currently look is going to bear out, why are you going so quickly? I would just -- and just wondering if there wouldn't be benefit in slowing that down, getting your arms fully and completely around what it is that you now own. I don't know maybe it's the competitive -- that there is a competitive landscape for these small deals and you're worried if you don't do them you will miss your window, but I [indiscernible] a lot of benefit kind of slowing that piece down while you work through understanding the portfolio you've acquired. So can you just explain why that wouldn't be the case? Why keep going at this type of pace?","Andreas Fibig","Yes. Lauren, I think it's a very valid question and super important. Look, there are probably two parts of these small M&As. The one part is, let's say, strengthening the business in some of the adjacent parts of our business like the ingredients for gelato which we believe is a fantastic business, and we will demonstrate during our Investor Day. And we had already a piece of the business in Brazil and now we are having a nice platform to growth. So these small acquisitions in some of these adjacent business, you will see going forward. And they will impact the integration not so much because these are kind of stand-alone businesses who we are helping -- who will help us to grow us in terms of sales but profitability as well. ","The second piece and you saw it for the first quarter, actually 2 of these 4 smaller deals were technology deals, which were basically technology deals or investments in technology companies to help us to bring better innovation to our customers. One is the 3D printing, we have talked about this for quite some time, which will help us to win core list, but also win business and that's not an integration in the business sense, it's an integration in our R&D, and we believe it's the right thing to do. Aryballe on the other side brings us into the digital piece of faction and measurement. It's right now used in the first use cases in quality control. So you will see these kind of technology deals going forward, and they certainly are not a barrier or distraction for the integration of Frutarom. I hope that, that helps to put context around these deals.","Richard O'Leary","And for me, Lauren, I mean, we're certainly being -- in my mind, we're being more restrictive in terms of the hurdle rates and the thresholds that we have for pursuing deals in terms of returns, in terms of strategic importance. As Andreas said, 2 of the deals were very technology driven that are fundamental to the scent business or to our delivery system platforms, which are, we believe, key strategic advantages. The other two deals were really in the pipeline already is -- prior to the acquisition. So I think -- and there is close linkage to the Frutarom businesses already. So I think we are -- I would characterize it as being quite selective already.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Andreas for closing remarks.","Andreas Fibig","Yes. Thank you very much for the participation. I hope it helped to put context around the results, and we're looking forward to see you at the Investor Meeting in June. Thank you very much. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"11648":["International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August  6, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Shelley Young - Director of Investor Relations","Douglas D.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Shelley Young, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Shelley Young","Thank you, operator. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to IFF's second quarter 2013 conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our second quarter 2013 financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our website at iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay for up to 1 year on our website.","Before turning the call over to our senior management team, I'd like to read our forward-looking statements. Please keep in mind that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the third quarter and our outlook for the balance of the year. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our risk factors contained in our 2012 10-K filed on February 26, 2013, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website.","Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which will exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today and on our website.","With me this morning are Doug Tough, our Chairman and CEO; Kevin Berryman, our CFO; Nicolas Mirzayantz, our Group President, Fragrances; and Hernan Vaisman, our Group President, Flavors.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Tough.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Shelley. The company achieved strong operating growth this quarter with both business units reporting double-digit segment profit growth. The improved performance demonstrates the continued benefits of our strategy. By focusing on expanding our geographic reach and strengthening our innovation platform and maximizing the value of our portfolio, we achieved top line growth of 6% and 8% on a like-for-like basis and continued margin expansion. Operationally, we had an excellent quarter with all of our profitability metrics up over the prior year quarter.","Our top line growth reflects momentum in many areas of the business, notably in Fine Fragrance and Beverage as well as continued growth in other areas of the business. All of the regions contributed to our second quarter performance led by double-digit growth in Latin America and high-single digit growth in the other regions. The emerging markets continued to grow at a rate of 10% or twice the rate of the developed markets. We achieved strong levels of growth in Western Europe, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Thailand and Argentina. Both business units contributed to the growth with a high level of new wins from both segments based on our technology, creativity and customer intimacy.","I'd like to say a few words about our strong level of new wins. We recently hosted our biannual Investor Day which was focused on the theme of innovation at core competency that informs all of our actions. As part of the event, we showcased 4 of our leading technologies to let our investors experience the Flavors and Fragrances technology for themselves. These included Fine Fragrance; Fragrance encapsulation; FlavorFit, which is our umbrella of modulation technologies that address the large and growing health and wellness segment of the market; and our Citrus Toolbox.","We received very favorable feedback on the technology demonstrations, and some of you completed our survey and told us that the technology demonstrations improved your understanding of IFF and how we are driving our growth. Well, this quarter clearly demonstrates the extent to which our technology is driving our new wins as well as our margin gains. Our customers' purchase orders are testimony to the fact that our innovations are adding value to their brands. We're very proud of our heritage of innovation and believe it will support future growth.","Our gross margins also benefited from the new wins this quarter. Gross margins were up in both business units. And on a consolidated basis, our adjusted gross margins of 44.2% this quarter increased 240 basis points over the prior year quarter. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of margin enhancements. The gross margin expansion this quarter was due to favorable growth, volume growth and mix, new wins that are based on our technology, moderating input costs, as well as the exit of low-margin sales activities and manufacturing efficiencies. The improved gross margins were more than sufficient to offset higher research, selling and administrative expenses this quarter versus the prior year quarter. The higher volume combined with expanded margins resulted in an adjusted operating profit increase of 10% to $145 million from $132 million.","Our operating performance was partially offset by foreign exchange losses on working capital related to currency volatility, resulting in adjusted earnings per share growth of 6%. Kevin Berryman will provide more context around these other income and expense items.","I'd like to provide some perspective on the first half of 2013 for IFF. We have had a strong start to the year, and we are pleased with our performance. Our local currency sales growth was 5%, or 6% on a like-for-like basis, which reflects the success of our emerging market strategy combined with continued growth in the developed markets, reflecting our focus on growing categories. For the first 6 months of 2013, Flavors grew 7% on a like-for-like basis, and Fragrance Compounds grew 8%. Fragrance Ingredients, which declined by 11% in the first quarter of 2013, showed some improvement in the second quarter due to higher sales of specialty products. Still, Ingredients declined by 1% in the second quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, Fragrance Ingredients sales has declined 5%.","The first half year results do not yet include the migration of some customers' volume from Ingredients to Compounds, which we have talked about in prior quarters. Once this volume moves to Fragrance Compounds, there will be renewed pressure on Fragrance Ingredients. On a profitability basis, Fragrance Ingredients continues to be attractive. And as we have mentioned, it is an important strategic component of our overall Fragrances business.","Turning to our profitability metrics. The company's first half adjusted gross margin was up 260 basis points over the prior year, reflecting favorable volume and mix, moderating input costs and manufacturing efficiencies. Year-to-date margins also benefited from the exit of low-margin sales activities. On a year-to-date basis, the company's adjusted operating profit was up 12% and adjusted earnings per share is up 12%. In short, in a volatile marketplace, our half year results are positive and support our strategic focus.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Nicolas Mirzayantz, our Group President of Fragrances.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Thank you, Doug. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our performance this quarter. Our Fragrance business delivered 8% local currency sales growth this quarter with 10% local currency sales growth in our Compounds business and a small decline of 1% in our Ingredients business. The strong performance this quarter reflects a continued high level of new win in our Compounds business in all regions with our fast-growing customers combined with growth in our existing business. The emerging markets represented 47% of total Fragrances sales and 52% of Fragrance Compounds sales.","In our Compounds business, growth in the emerging markets was 12%, and growth in the developed market was 8%. The emerging markets continued to grow at double-digit levels that are twice the rate of the developed markets, led by very strong growth in the BRIC countries, especially in Brazil and China, as well as strong growth in the Middle East, Thailand, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.","It is important to note the resilience of our developed markets, which can be clearly seen this quarter. The developed markets experienced broad-based growth in many areas of the world, including Western Europe, Great Britain, the United States and Japan.","Turning to our categories. Fine and Beauty Care had total growth of 13% this quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in North America, EAME and Latin America, fueled by a high level of new wins and stronger growth in the base business. As anticipated, Fine Fragrance delivered double-digit growth this quarter due to the strong execution on the part of our creative and commercial teams and their success in partnering with our customers to provide them with consumer preferred fragrances.","We benefited from many exciting launches and pipeline development this quarter, including Lacoste L12.12 Noir, Avon Far Away Bella, Boss Nuit Pour Femme and Paco Rabanne Invictus. In addition, Burberry has recently introduced it's Brit Rhythm, which was created also by IFF perfumers. The other categories within Fine and Beauty Care, which are Toiletries and Hair Care, had high-single digit growth this quarter. Hair Care had double-digit growth in North America, partially attributable to a successful new launch. Toiletries had saw [ph] growth in all regions led by double-digit growth in Latin America and strong growth in the other regions.","Turning to Functional Fragrances. This category continues to perform well overall with 7% growth led by double-digit growth in the emerging markets. This marks the 20th consecutive quarter growth in Functional Fragrances due to a strong level of new wins as a result of our 3-pillar strategy. Growth in fabric care was led by double-digit gains in greater Asia and Latin America due to strong new wins using our encapsulation technology, which had double-digit growth. Home Care and Personal Wash also achieved steady growth.","In Fragrance Ingredients, we experienced improved performance from Q1 as a result of improved volumes in the specialty segment, which somewhat offset declines in the high volume Ingredients area of the portfolio, which remains under pressure. Also the migration of some volumes from Fragrance Ingredients to Compounds has been delayed, and we won't see the impact of this development on our volume until the third quarter of 2013.","We are very pleased with the broad-based top line growth this quarter with contributions from all regions. Our strong results are due to the efforts of our team to drive higher win rates and demonstrate our ability to execute on our plan.","Turning to segment profit. Our 8% sales growth resulted in double-digit segment profit growth of 13% this quarter due to the leverage inherent in our business model. Strong volume growth combined with moderating input costs, favorable mix and productivity initiatives resulted in margin expansion, which more than offset increased research, selling and administrative costs, in part, due to an initial payment to our biotechnology partner, Amyris, who will be working with us on creating sustainable cost-effective ingredients. Our overall results were strong. Operating margins of 18.7% increased 100 basis points over the prior year operating margin.","I would like to highlight the impact that input costs have had on our P&L. Although they were moderately down this quarter, the net impact of the input cost increases we have seen over the past couple of years continues to be a pressure point on our gross margins. As a result of the input cost pressure, we have adopted other measures to reduce manufacturing costs and operate more efficiently. These measures have enabled us to grow our margins and offset the impact of pricing versus input cost pressure.","Along these lines, we have made certain decisions to make sure that we are operating as efficiently and profitably as possible to deliver value to our shareholders. This quarter, we moved forward with our plan to stop our Fragrance manufacturing activities in Jakarta, Indonesia and move them to our new efficient facility in Singapore. In addition, we also announced a move forward with our plans to close our Ingredients facility in Augusta, Georgia and rationalize our Ingredients business. These moves will help us to maintain a more cost-effective structure as part of our continuing efforts to drive efficiency in all that we do.","On a year-to-date basis, total Fragrance sales increased 5%, with 8% growth in Fragrance Compounds and a 5% decline in Fragrance Ingredients. Our segment profit increased 17% over the prior year period to $140 million. And our segment margins on the year-to-date basis are 18.6%, an increase of 200 basis points. This is a great achievement and reflects moderating input costs, favorable volume and mix and the benefits of our productivity initiatives. Looking ahead, we expect to see continued growth in Fine and Beauty Care but at a more moderate rate that we saw in the second quarter. We also expect to see continued momentum in Functional Fragrances. For Ingredients, we expect to see continued pressure on the high volume segment and some migration of Ingredients volumes to Compounds resulting in some pressure on Fragrance Ingredients.","I would like now to turn the call over to Hernan Vaisman, our Group President, Flavors.","Hernan Vaisman","Thank you, Nicolas, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, Flavors delivered 5% local currency growth spread across all regions. Excluding nearly $11 million of low-margin sales activities, local currency sales growth was 8% on a like-for-like basis. The exit of low-margin sales activities primarily affected North America and Latin America and mainly constituting products in the Sweet category. This is the last quarter that we expect to report the impact from the exit of low-margin sales activities. Starting with the third quarter, we have substantially completed the exit of low-margin sales activities.","Flavors like-for-like growth of 8% this quarter compares to 9% growth in the second quarter of 2012 and 8% growth in the second quarter of 2011. On a 3 years basis, our growth of 8% demonstrates the consistent nature of our Flavors business and our ability to grow our top line sales by focusing on our geographic reach and driving innovation into the portfolio. This is reflected in the strong level of new wins this quarter as well as growth in our base business. Due to the strong level of new wins, we achieved consistent performance across all regions with continued strong growth in the emerging markets as well as the developed markets. Sales in emerging markets this quarter were approximately 50% of total sales. Our performance this quarter demonstrates the success of our creative and application teams as well as our customer relationships.","Turning to regional performance. North America delivered exceptional like-for-like growth of 11% this quarter, which is a clear indication of the strong performance of our commercial and technology teams and the success they have experienced driving innovation into the portfolio. The best-performing category was Beverage followed by Savory, reflecting strong new wins with many of our customers and shows their faith in our innovative products that deliver brand growth. EAME delivered like-for-like sales growth of 5% this quarter due to improved year-over-year sales in both the developed as well as emerging markets.","Flavors experienced growth in Western and Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East it. On a category basis, growth was led by Beverage and Savory. Sweet and Dairy also delivered positive growth. In Greater Asia, volume gains and new business wins drove like-for-like growth of 8%, reflecting widespread gains with higher quarter-over-quarter sales mainly in Indonesia, China and the Asian countries. Beverage category contributed to the strong performance led by Savory and Dairy. Finally, Latin America achieved like-for-like growth of 11%, showing increased momentum to the new wins. Savory and Sweet both delivered double-digit growth, while Beverage and Dairy also delivered solid growth.","In all, we are very pleased with our top line growth this quarter, which demonstrates the successful execution of our naturals and health and wellness platforms and continued focus on innovation which drives our growth in initiatives.","Turning to our financial performance. This quarter, we delivered very strong results due to many positive operating factors, which all move in tandem, including strong top line growth due to a high level of new wins in every single region; improvement in the base business; mix gains due to increased sales of products using our technologies and innovation; the positive impact of moderate decline in our input costs and the favorable impact of exiting low-margin sales activities.","All of these factors resulted in expanded gross margin, which more than offset increased research, selling and administrative costs, which include additional labor costs consistent with our investment in new geographies. The strong volume growth, when combined with margin expansion due to changing mix in part due to the exit of low-margin sales activities and moderated input costs, resulted in a double-digit growth of 12% in our segment profit margin this quarter, or an increase of $9 million. Our operating margin expanded by 170 basis points to 24%. We are very pleased with our results and with our teams in all regions who successfully and skillfully worked to produce such good results.","On a year-to-date basis, Flavors like-for-like sales growth is 7%, reflecting a strong growth in every single region. Our segment profit increased 8% to $123 million, while achieving segment profit margins of 23.7% or an increase of 120 basis points. Looking ahead, although it is still very early in this quarter, we expect to see continued broad-based momentum and deliver solid growth in the third quarter.","I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman, our CFO.","Kevin C. Berryman","Thank you, Hernan. Good morning and good afternoon everyone that's on the call. Again turning to our financial results for the second quarter of 2013, I will try to provide some additional context to our results. Reported revenues for the second quarter totaled $758 million, an increase of 5% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, local currency sales increased 6%. And finally on a like-for-like basis, which excludes the impact of exiting low-margin sales activities and the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 8%.","The growth reflects a substantial improvement in both business units from the first quarter of the year and is indicative of broad-based growth across our regions. The momentum we are seeing on our top line reflects increased new wins in the market, which is validation of our ability to provide value-added solutions to our customers. In fact, the percent growth from net new wins in the quarter was at the highest level we have seen in any quarter for the last 3-plus years. Clearly, our focus on innovation is showing results.","Adjusted gross margins this quarter improved 240 basis points to 44.2%, up from 41.8% in the prior year quarter. Our gross margin expansion this quarter reflects strong execution on our strategies. Volume growth and improved mix of business, the final benefit of exiting lower margin sales activities, as well as continued cost containment initiatives, when combined with moderating input costs, resulted in a gross margin improvement. As I did last quarter, I will provide more detail on our gross margin progression in a moment.","Our operating performance this quarter clearly was strong. Looking back over the past 5 quarters, our gross margins have improved by 200 basis points or better versus the prior year quarter in every quarter. In fact, our improved margins this quarter are on top of a 210 basis point improvement in the second quarter of 2012 versus the second quarter of 2011. We anticipate that going forward, the improved year-over-year margin improvement trends will begin to slow, especially as we start to compare our margins to year-ago figures that have already benefited from the margin enhancement efforts embedded in our strategic initiatives.","Our strong operational performance resulted in incremental incentive compensation accruals, which when combined with increased investments in our R&D, resulted in RSA costs of 25% of sales in the quarter. As a result of our strong performance, our adjusted operating profit increased 10% and led to an increase in our adjusted operating margins to 19.2%, up 90 basis points from adjusted operating margins of 18.3% in the prior year quarter.","Going further down the P&L, the strong operating profit was somewhat reduced by higher other income and expense items driven primarily by foreign exchange losses on working capital balances and higher interest costs, resulting in adjusted EPS increasing 6% versus the prior year. I will discuss these other expenses a bit more in a moment.","Finally, there were several other items that impacted our reported earnings per share, which improved 15% versus a year ago from $1.08 to $1.24 in second quarter of this year. These items are not included in our adjusted operating profit or adjusted EPS figures, and I will comment briefly on them.","In Q2, we recognized a $16 million gain from the sale of a building adjacent to our corporate headquarters. This decision to sell this nonoperating asset is consistent with the principles of economic profit, which is infused within the organization and drives our thinking on both investments and divestitures. The sale of the building enables us to maximize our returns against our existing asset base, which is an important driver for all of our financial decisions as we look to improve the overall returns of the business.","Also in Q2, and as previously mentioned, we moved forward with our plan to close our facility in Sweden and transfer our liquids manufacturing out of our plant in Jakarta to a new efficient facility in Singapore. We recognized a small loss provision related to these initiatives. And finally, as Nicolas also mentioned, we also moved forward with our plan to close our Augusta Ingredients facility and rationalize the Fragrance Ingredients business. As we noted last quarter, the closure of the Augusta plant is a second quarter accounting event, and we booked a $2 million charge this quarter related to the upcoming plant closure.","I would again like to show the margin progression that we presented last quarter, to remind everyone on the call that even though we are seeing margin gains of 240 basis points this quarter, the net impact of rising input costs on our margins continues to be a headwind. If we look at the period Q2 2010 to Q2 2013, you will see the factors leading to the gross margin improvement between the 2 periods. We chose again the second quarter of 2010 since that is the last comparable quarter prior to the large increase in input costs that we saw in 2011 and 2012.","Over the 3-year period, the impact of pricing and input costs has been a negative 210 basis points on our gross margins as evidenced by the red bar. It is also important to note that we proactively work with customers to implement pricing increases to reduce the strong pressure from input costs and limit the recent inflationary pressure to the 210 basis points noted on the slide. However, the importance of the execution of our strategy, where we have adopted numerous measures to improve our margins, including the exit of low-margin sales activities, cost savings initiatives, innovation enhancement and other gross margin improvement efforts, cannot be understated. These strategic improvements had a 350 basis point positive impact on our margins as shown by the green bar on the chart. This more than offset the negative 210 basis points reduction from the net impact of input costs and pricing, resulting in the margin gain we are able to report this quarter.","I would also like to comment briefly on the success the company has had in consistently driving operating profit margin expansion over the last few years in the context of the strong input cost pressures we have felt. Although the input cost increases, net of pricing actions, have been a strong headwind to our gross margins, we have been able to keep our operating profit margin on a steady upward trajectory via our focused execution of our profitable growth strategy and disciplined management of expenses. Specifically, we have been able to steadily increase our adjusted operating profit margins in Q2 from 16.5% in 2010 to 17% and 18.3% in 2011 and '12, respectively and finally, to 19.2% in 2013.","Turning to our RSA costs. This quarter, RSA costs as a percent of sales increased 150 basis points to 25%, up from 23.5% of sales in the prior year quarter. The higher RSA reflects higher incentive compensation accruals and higher R&D expenses, partially due to an initial payment to Amyris, our biotechnology partner in Fragrances. As we've mentioned in the past, strong performance versus budget in any quarter can lead to increased compensation accruals through our AIP program. We accrue for these payments on a quarterly basis, effectively matching the performance accrual to the performance in that specific quarter. In those quarters where we have strong sales and operating profit performance and payouts are expected to be higher, we increase our accruals. Conversely, in those quarters we fell short of performance expectations, we book smaller accruals.","Importantly, excluding the incremental R&D costs and additional incentive compensation accruals, sales and administration expenditures as a percent of sales would have fallen when comparing the current quarter to the comparable year-ago figure. Clearly, we remain disciplined in our approach to spending. And going forward, cost discipline will be a continued focus, while we strategically invest in R&D and other business development opportunities.","As promised, I would like to spend a quick moment to reflect on the other operating income and expenses this quarter, which represented a $0.05 headwind to our EPS figure. The expense in Q2 was triggered by volatility in multiple currencies in June versus the U.S. dollar. As you know, being a global company with operations in 32 countries and with customers at over -- in over 100 countries, we have hedging programs in place to guard against the material foreign exchange risk that we have as a global company. We are substantially hedged in most of the countries in which we operate. There are some countries, however, where hedging is either not available or inefficient or too expensive to put in place.","In June, on the heels of comments by the Federal Reserve, which affected investors' expectations for short-term interest rates, we saw a strengthening of the U.S. dollar and a corresponding weakening of several currencies, including those currencies in countries where IFF hedging programs do not exist. Due to the amount of volatility in the foreign exchange markets and the timing, which was late in the quarter during the month of June, we experienced a larger-than-normal put loss on outstanding accounts payable items. The impact was primarily experienced in a handful of countries, including Argentina, Brazil, India and Thailand.","Although we are not able to anticipate movements in currencies, we do manage this risk with forecasting of foreign exchange balances and natural hedging programs. The significant volatility that we experienced in June is certainly high versus our historical performance, and as a result, it is not expected to be a systemic issue. Importantly, had there been no foreign exchange losses in the second quarter, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.04 higher or $1.18 versus our final adjusted figure of $1.14.","Speaking more generally about our other foreign exchange exposures, our foreign currency translation this quarter, as mentioned previously, had a 100 basis points impact on our reported sales. Given the more limited volatility in the euro-dollar exchange rate versus the currencies discussed in the prior slide and combined with our cash flow hedging activities with the euro, foreign currency actually had an immaterial impact on our operating profit results. As we have been communicating, in 2013, we remain nearly 80% hedged against the euro at levels that approximate $1.29 per euro, effectively consistent with the average exchange rate levels for the full year of 2012. At current rates, the operating impact on our full year results is expected to continue to be muted.","Turning to our cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for the 6 months ending June 30, 2013, was $118 million or $17 million lower than the prior year comparable period. Decrease for the first 6 months primarily reflects higher year-over-year incentive compensation payments and additional pension contributions versus the year-ago period. These 2 items represent a total additional cash outflow of more than $55 million this year versus last year.","The net incremental outlays in the first half of this year versus last year have been offset in part by, one, an underlying improvement in cash flow versus last year in core working capital of $29 million; and two, an increase of $23 million in net income due to an improved level of operating performance and the sale of a nonoperating asset that was described earlier in the second quarter. It is worth noting that we paid out our normal fourth quarter dividends in late December, so our year-to-date net cash flow benefited as the first 6 months did not have the normal quarterly cash flow associated with this quarterly dividend payment.","Turning to our capital structure. IFF has certainly proven a willingness to return capital to shareholders, both through our dividend payments as well through share buyback programs. In July, -- due to our strong operating performance, the board authorized a $0.05 or 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.39 a share, reflecting their confidence in our future growth and profitability. The increase in the dividend will improve our payout ratio to the high end of our historical range of 30% to 35%. We also believe it important to have increased our dividend to support an improved yield, given the recent and continued strength in our stock price.","As you know, since announcing our share buyback program late last year, IFF's share price has experienced a strong increase. As a result, and due to our disciplined approach to the execution of our program, our progress against the share buyback program has been slower than originally expected. Year-to-date, we have spent approximately $19 million on our share buyback program. Going forward, our intent is to repurchase at minimum $50 million in value of our shares over the course of 2013.","Now I would like to turn the call back over to Doug.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Kevin, Hernan and Nicolas for the remarks. We are very pleased with our performance this quarter, which reflects our continued focus on execution of our 3-pillar strategy. Our success this quarter is the result of our innovation programs, which are creating value for our customers and investors. Looking forward, we expect to be able to deliver continued growth in the second half of the year noting that we are entering into a more challenging period on a comparable growth basis and that the environment still poses certain challenges. However, we remain focused on our strategic priorities and believe we have the right teams in place to continue to provide customers with superior customized products that deliver improved performance to consumers.","Our perspective for 2013 remains in line with our long-term growth targets. We expect to deliver local currency growth in the range of 4% to 6% supported by continued new wins and volume growth in the developed and emerging markets. We expect to grow our operating profit in line with our long-term growth targets of 7% to 9% as we continue to stress efficiency in all that we do while exercising financial discipline. And finally, we are optimistic that we will be able to deliver 10% or higher earnings per share growth.","In conclusion, we believe our strong performance at IFF this quarter is the result of strong execution of our strategy to leverage our geographic footprint, to strengthen our innovation platform and to maximize our portfolio. We believe we are well positioned in the market and we plan to continue to selectively invest in those areas where we see the most growth, whether in regions, countries or categories.","Thank you for your participation. I will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. One on sales growth, just trying to get a sense of how to think about balance of year growth rate. So you're done lapping some of the exits of businesses in the Flavors business. So as you look to the 4% to 6% long-term targets, I guess that's a blend of like-for-like and local currency. So maybe help us a little bit with the exiting of the business negatively impacting the top line over the balance of the year. And then second question is just on cash uses, so you increased the dividend by more than the 10% or 10%-plus earnings target. Recently, you've committed now to buying back at least $50 million of stock for the year. Obviously, we can sort of read into it how we want. But sort of curious to your thoughts on what you're doing with the excess cash here, and what that potentially means as far as acquisition criteria or outlook and just sort of returning cash to shareholders on a longer-term basis.","Douglas D. Tough","Mark, it's Doug. I'll talk to the second question first. And then I think we're just going to need a little clarification perhaps on the growth question you're asking. I mean, Kevin's touched upon I think the disciplined approach that we've taken with the Board. And the business is sufficiently cash generative that the kinds of acquisition opportunities we would be contemplating, we were still going to be in a very positive position vis-\u00e0-vis cash if we need to do so. But in the context of both the discipline -- the dividend and trying to stay within the payout ratios that we have, that triggered the move to the recent significant increase. And I also think that the company's commitment to the program that we initiated a year ago on the share buyback, the board supported the management recommendation to continue to participate in that program. So in that, the company's cash position, we're confident on almost all levers we need. Now can you just embellish a little bit on your growth question, please?","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Sure. So first half sales growth, local currency, is a couple of points below the like-for-like number. So as we're now lapping the exit of the low-margin business, I'm getting -- I'm trying to get a sense of whether we should expect an acceleration in what is now local currency growth absent exiting that low-margin business, or just how to think about the sales growth progression through the year.","Kevin C. Berryman","Sure, Mark. This is Kevin. Let me make some preliminary comments and then I'll look to Nicolas and Hernan if they want to add any additional commentary. There was 2 things, I think, that were pointed out by both of the BU presidents. One was that the expectations on the Fragrance side of the business for the balance of the year starts to be looking up at some pretty strong comparables. And we do expect that, that will represent a higher level of challenge for the Fragrance business as we look to the balance of the year. I also think that on the Flavors side, we've been able and Hernan and his team have been able to put a pretty solid numbers on a like-for-like basis on an ongoing basis. And while that should, all else being equal, result in a slightly higher number for Flavors on a reported local currency sales basis, that momentum and overall needs to be done within the context of kind of how the environment is. So probably a continued positive picture on Flavors and with some developing challenges with Fragrance just because of the comparables that we're going to be facing. Q3 was actually pretty strong in Fragrance, but Q4 was very strong as you might recall. So I would say continued good solid in Flavors and with some developing challenges relative to the comparables on Fragrance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to know if you could comment -- I have so many questions, but I guess I was most interested in the comments on the base business strength. New win momentum is something that has been building that you guys have been talking about. But I felt like the comments on base business strength was something maybe a little bit newer. So I guess one, to what degree does that reflect kind of underlying market growth and stability and improvement, particularly Latin America, given some of the worries about slowdown there? Or also just sort of a greater longevity to some of your -- the products that you are a part of in the market that they are just having a longer and better success rate beyond a kind of year 1 in the marketplace? And then the implications that would have for win momentum going forward?","Hernan Vaisman","Okay, Lauren, let me start with Flavors. And basically, we saw in this quarter, I mean, some growth in the base business. But the -- frankly, I mean, the big bulk of the growth was coming from the new wins. If I had to give you a kind of magnitude, I mean, I could say between 60% to 70% are coming from new wins, the rest was basically base business. In which areas we see growing base business? Again, in some way marginal for this quarter was basically in the emerging markets and in some markets in Europe. In the rest of the markets, I mean, basically, the big bulk of the growth came from new wins as we mentioned before.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Lauren, it's Nicolas. Just to provide some additional comment for Fragrances. What we saw in Q2 first was a very, very strong new win rate. So the majority of the growth is coming from new introduction into the market across all categories. What we saw, especially in Fine Fragrance, is the resilience of our existing portfolio. But more importantly, some of the very strong equity that were won last year continue to do well. So it's not only the quantity of the win, but also the quality. So we saw some very continued strong performance of the introduction from 2012 into 2013.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then if I could also ask about -- for an update on the Evolva partnership, where things stand there?","Hernan Vaisman","Hernan, Lauren. Again, I mean it's difficult to mention. We are still in the process of scaling up as we mentioned in the last couple of calls. We believe that we will be finalizing this scaling-up process in this quarter. So if everything goes successfully, this is something that we have to wait. Probably we will see start commercializing the new products early next year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","For the last couple of quarters, really the last 3, your incremental gross margins have been pretty close to 100%. And there really hasn't been very much movement in your cost of goods sold even though you had good volume growth. And I suppose that's because of the many cost reduction initiatives that you have. So the gross margin comparisons will be a little bit more difficult in the second half because last year's cost of goods sold was pretty low. So in general, what's a normal incremental gross margin for you now that you've limited the -- now that there are some limits on your cost initiatives? And when you closed down Jakarta and you closed down Augusta, what's the net effect for IFF? Is it $10 million or $15 million or $5 million? How does it affect your cost structure?","Kevin C. Berryman","Jeff, this is Kevin. Let me take a stab at your question. Look, the gross margin that we've been able to experience, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, is really driven by a lot of things. And certainly, your perspective on the absolute level of the costs and the ability to drive cost savings into the portfolio of products certainly plays a role. The one piece though that I think is important to recognize within the context of the gross margin picture is certainly, to the extent that we're able to offer up innovation to our customers and it's adding value to their products, which are being provided to their consumers, is that affords us opportunities to have higher levels of margin as we embed technology into our business. So that in itself is positive. And if you think about how that ultimately shows up on the P&L, it oftentimes shows up on what we'll call mix because our business is changing over time to be a better margin as we incorporate innovation into the portfolio. So at the end of the day, the ability for us to continue to have the margin profile is really about the innovation and whether or not we're able to deliver things that our customers are excited about. I do think that longer term, some of the manufacturing savings are going to be in place, and there's benefits that we're expecting. But really nothing in 2013 because any benefits we're expecting in the back half of 2013 are likely to be offset by the ramping up of our large facility in China in Flavors. And so really, the expectation is that we're going to start to see those benefits probably leak-in in 2014 through the end of 2014. And this should be helpful in terms of reducing our cost structure.","Douglas D. Tough","And Jeff, I would just build on what Kevin was saying on innovation. There's been a litany of items which contributed to the margin improvement. And that -- and frankly, that is -- those elements have contributed more than obviously any pricing in the context of the cost of goods. Even the programs that Kevin has touched -- or that Nicolas touched about, our relationship with Amyris and the Evolva opportunity that Hernan mentioned in Flavors, both of those should be able to bring us cost advantages and hence, margin improvement. And coupled with the ongoing focus in R&D on new molecule development, which creates superior products, that's where we'll get the opportunity for margin enhancement because our customers are looking for those competitively advantaged projects -- products. I think there's a number of items, which are all going to contribute, and obviously with the ongoing pursuit of productivity improvements in the operations area. So there are a number of things. But I really don't think there's a precise answer to your question in terms of the basis point improvement other than we know we have to keep doing it.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And what of Jakarta and Augusta? Can you give some quantification of why you're closing those plants?","Kevin C. Berryman","Well, basically, we're creating greater efficiencies for the infrastructure that we have in place. What we said, I would say, it's $10-plus million that you'll fully realize by the end of 2014. So in 2015, you should be able to see the $10-plus million dollars of savings, and that's kind of being layered in over the course of 2014. Jeff, in the back half of this year. Once again, any potential savings on Sweden and Indonesia really are getting offset by the ramp up costs associated with the China manufacturing facility in Flavors.","Operator","And you have a question from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So Amyris, the payments you made this quarter, could you quantify that? And then one other question, input costs. Just maybe give a little bit of color on how you're thinking about that over the balance of the year. And any sort of puts and takes on oil-based versus naturals?","Kevin C. Berryman","Mark, this is Kevin. I'll take it real briefly on the Amyris. We're not going to disclose the payment. It was an amount that was worthy of calling out, otherwise we wouldn't have said it. But certainly, we consider that confidential, so we won't be providing additional color on that. As it relates to the input cost situation, we noted in Q2 that it was -- we saw some moderating levels of input cost. We still believe that the input cost picture for the full year is benign. And so we're feeling as if given where we are through first half and given the positions that we currently hold for the balance of the year, we're feeling pretty comfortable that it's going to be pretty stable.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just going back to the Amyris payment, so should we think about that as a onetime item? Is it something that at some point will recur but only once in a while? Maybe some direction there would be helpful.","Kevin C. Berryman","Typically, what ends up happening is oftentimes, our agreements with our third parties have certain milestone payments. And depending upon when those milestones are met, you could have incremental investments. And so yes, there can be ongoing expenses, but they will specifically be driven by the attainment of milestones.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And this is in the R&D line, right?","Kevin C. Berryman","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm particularly impressed by the acceleration in Latin America and the like-for-like for Flavors. There's a bulk ingredient company I'm sure you're familiar with, Ingredion, that had 6% down volume in Latin America in their food ingredients. And I was curious whether you overcame similar weakness in Sweet and Brewery, I think they cited as their weak end-markets in Latin America, and so your growth was in spite of that. Or because you're such a small percent of the price of the products, you didn't see any effect at all in Latin America from the weakness in the end-markets?","Hernan Vaisman","Well, let me explain. Definitely, I don't know their business. I know what's the implication that they have alluded, the drop or the causes of the drop. In our particular case, we won really good business there. And then by winning this business, they give us, I mean, this kind of results. We see also a kind of slowdown in the economy in those countries. But again, it's not totally correlated with our result, as we are winning really business -- we are winning -- I mean definitely we will really outperform the market and we'll deliver this double-digit growth.","Operator","You have a follow-up question with Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was thinking about Amyris again. So just if I'm modeling next year's second quarter, assuming there's no milestone payment, then year-over-year R&D expense, all else being equal, would be down somewhat because this year had a onetime payment. Is that correct?","Kevin C. Berryman","Assuming there isn't another milestone payment to offset it, yes.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then so if you could talk a little bit about flavor margins now at 24%, 23% something last quarter. With the exits kind of done and the benefit to profitability, I mean, should we start thinking about this as sort of a new level for flavor profitability going forward, assuming again, all else equal, and no major moves in input costs?","Hernan Vaisman","Lauren, this is a $50 million question, but let me try to answer. As I mentioned, I mean in -- earlier, I mean we have -- earlier, you have many, many of some main drivers of this in gross profit. I mean, it depends on each quarter, it could be changing. I mean, basically, what we see, to mention, is volume, mix, let's forget now for the point and timing comparison with the exit of low-margins. So definitely, you have some variables that you have to manage in each quarter that will be -- I mean, in some way, defining the financial profit. Having said all that, following what we did in the past really focusing on really most profitable categories, the mix is really helping and giving us really tailwinds in the gross margin. The high volumes in almost all markets will help. So to try to summarize, while you have several variables that can impact, I would say that we feel that this gross margin can be sustainable throughout the times.","Kevin C. Berryman","Lauren, just an additional comment. This is Kevin. The other thing that we do is certainly we are investing in the future in terms of R&D initiatives and other corporate, I would call them business development expenditures. So Hernan certainly rightfully talked about some of the success in driving innovation into the portfolio, which is helping the gross margin front. But we will look to continue to strengthen our potential innovation opportunities in the future, which always implies if we continue to see that success, it's not necessarily all going to drop to the bottom line. We will work to continue to build our capabilities in innovation for the future.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I guess, Kevin, while I have you, just to touch on incentive compensation for a minute. So I guess one, could you just remind us the metrics that triggers the increase in accruals? So was it top line or like for-- top line growth, organic or like-for-like? And is it operating profits, pre-incentive comp or is it gross margins? What are the real triggers there? And then as we think about the balance of the year, at least as you're forecasting it to today, I recall Q4 was a really big incentive comp accrual quarter last year, there was a big catch up. So I'm guessing there might be a positive swing factor there this year because you're accruing at a higher rate at this point already.","Kevin C. Berryman","First part of the question, Lauren, about the 4 metrics, it's local currency sales -- it's reported local currency sales. So we don't adjust it for like-for-like. It's the reported number on local currency sales that is important for us to drive the business forward. It's gross margin percentage. It's operating profit levels and working capital efficiencies. Those are the 4 metrics that we measure on an annual basis for our annual incentive program. However, we do have long-term plans that are in place as well. And to the extent that we continue to show very strong total shareholder returns, which we have been showing, we obviously have to accrue additional expenses associated with those given the continued strength in our share price. I think that the last piece relative to, kind of as we look to the balance of the year, yes, Q4, Q4 was a big accrual as we ended the strength -- the year very strong in Q4, which we've already talked about, especially in Fragrance. And so there certainly was a catch-up there in terms of accruals given the strong performance in that specific quarter last year. And so depending upon how we translate into the final numbers for this year, having said all of that, there could be some challenges in the comparable, which could put some pressure the other way in terms of nonoperating. The only other comment to make is we have to fund all additional incentive comp within the context of the operating profit. So we don't get paid by an operating profit before incentive comp, we get paid after the fact. So we -- to over-perform and start to pay versus the operating profit metrics, we have to fund our additional incentive comp.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I guess I just don't understand how it doesn't end up being a circular reference then, but it's okay. We'll talk about it offline, that's fine.","Kevin C. Berryman","That's great.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn it back over to the speakers for closing remarks.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Jennifer. It's been an interesting conversation today and thank you, all, for your participation. The theme that has kept emerging here are the strength of the business, both the top line but also the gross margin strength. And I think it's a really good reinforcement of the focus that we had on our Investor Day, where the innovation theme and the demonstration of innovation on a number of fronts was really what we wanted to convey as the basis on which we could drive the business. And I think it's reinforced in the numbers and the results. Thanks, everyone, for your participation and we'll look forward to talking with you again in 3 months in November.

In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of one question per person.","I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's second quarter 2018 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com.

Please refer to the information on the disclaimer slide as well as the additional information contained in the regulatory filings of both companies.","With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have.","With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. On the call today, our plan is to review our financial results for the second quarter and the first half of 2018. Provide an update on our financial expectations for the full year, excluding the impact of Frutarom and give insights into the strong progress we have made relative to the Frutarom transaction. Then, we will be happy to take any questions that you may have as usual.","Starting with a recap of our first half 2018 performance, growth was strong across all of our key financial metrics and in line with the objectives we set out for ourselves earlier this year. Currency neutral sales increased 6% in the first half, with both business units growing 6%, respectively. New win performance, volume growth on existing business and price increases to offset rising material cost all contributed to consolidated growth.","From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 5% as volume improvements and our focus to drive greater efficiencies throughout our business via costs and productivity initiatives continue to support overall profitability. Currency neutral adjusted EPS improved 10%, driven by improvements in adjusted operating profit, as well as a more favorable effective tax rate.","I'm very pleased to also report that we are making strong progress against our four refreshed strategic priorities. Solidifying our position to drive differentiation, sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continued to grow strong double digits across all categories led by savory and dairy. PowderPure, our platform for clean label solutions, grew an impressive triple digits as we continue to scale this unique and differentiated technology.","Performance with local and regional customers also remained strong, growing double that of our global customers. And it's a trend that we see across both business units. In Flavors specifically, our mid-sized go-to-market platform Tastepoint continues to deliver strong results, improving strong double digits in the first half of 2018.","In terms of maximizing our portfolio, driving growth in our most margin accretive categories, cosmetic active ingredients continued its robust growth trend by improving very strong double digits. And hair care, home care, and toiletries improved high single digits. In Flavors, growth was strong in dairy and beverage, improving double digits and high single digits respectively.","We also remain diligent in our focus to drive greater efficiencies in our business, allowing us to reallocate resources to efforts that drive the greatest returns. This yielded strong results in the first half 2018 as our cost of productivity initiatives, including zero-based budgeting, added approximately 5 percentage points of growth to currency neutral adjusted operating profit and EPS growth.","All in all, we believe all parties are well-positioned in our strategy to drive long-term value for shareholders. Our pending transaction with Frutarom, which I will touch on in more detail shortly, will support and accelerate efforts across all of these pillars.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich.","[07BDC1-E Rich O'Leary]","Thanks, Andreas. And moving on to our Q2 performance, currency neutral sales in the second quarter grew 5%. Growth was broad based as all regions and categories across both Flavors and Fragrances posted solid results. From a profitability standpoint, currency neutral adjusted operating profit declined 2% in the second quarter, as top line growth and the benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives were more than offset by the impact of higher raw material costs, including the previously announced BASF citral supply issue.","Pricing was up about 1.5 percentage points in the quarter on a consolidated basis. However, as expected, it did not offset raw material pressure in our Fragrance business unit. As we move through the back half of the year, we expect the price to raw material cost dynamic to improve as pricing takes hold in Fragrances.","We are pleased that despite these challenges, we were able to achieve 8% currency neutral adjusted EPS growth as we benefited from a more favorable year-over-year effective tax rate and higher other income.","Looking at our business unit performance for the second quarter, Flavors currency neutral sales increased 6% with growth coming in all categories and all regions. It should be noted that on a two-year average basis, growth was very strong at approximately 9%.","North American Flavors improved 9% in the second quarter led by high-single digit growth at Tastepoint and strong new wins in beverage, dairy, and sweet. EAME increased 5% on a currency neutral basis led by strong double-digit growth in Africa and the Middle East, as well as mid-single-digit growth in Europe. Greater Asia grew 2% in the second quarter on a currency neutral basis. A strong double-digit growth in China and India was largely offset by softness in Indonesia and Thailand. Latin America increased 8% on a currency neutral basis led by strong double-digit growth in Argentina and Mexico.","Flavors currency neutral segment profit grew approximately 6% led primarily by volume growth and the benefits from our ongoing cost and productivity initiatives. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margin, we achieved margin expansion year-over-year of approximately 10 basis points to 24.3%.","Fragrance currency neutral sales improved 5% driven by broad-based region and category growth. From a category perspective, consumer fragrances grew 5% on a currency neutral basis. As growth was achieved in all categories led by double-digit growth in hair care, as well as mid-single digit increases in toiletries, home care, and fabric care.","Fine fragrances improved 1% on a currency neutral basis against the very strong 11% comparison in the prior year period. Growth was led by double-digit increase in Latin America and low single-digit growth in North America. It should be noted that EAME and Greater Asia were soft. However, it was due to a strong year-over-year comparison of 19% and 25%, respectively.","Fragrance ingredient sales were up 10% on a currency neutral basis with growth in three of our four regions, driven by improvements in volume and higher pricing related to raw material costs. From a profit perspective, Fragrance currency neutral segment profits decreased 9% on a currency neutral basis, as volume growth and cost and productivity benefits were more than offset by higher price to input costs, including the BASF citral issue.","As I mentioned, as we move through the back half of the year, we expect the price to raw material cost dynamic to improve as pricing takes effect. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margin, our profit profile remains solid yet was under pressure year-over-year.","Before I move on, I want to provide some more commentary on the raw material environment. Coming into the year, we expected mid-single digit raw material inflation in 2018, inclusive of the impact of the citral situation, with that heavier based in the Fragrance business unit. Since that time, cost inflation has picked up following a series of disruptions in the supply chain. There have been fires at several ingredient suppliers, increased environmental actions on suppliers in China, and to a lesser extent, rising oil prices. Based on what we're seeing today, we expect incremental inflationary pressure as we exit 2018 and head into 2019. It remains imperative that we achieve incremental price increases or identify other actions in unison with our customers to ensure we cover our raw material cost exposure over time.","Operating cash flow was $55 million compared to $58 million for the first half of the year. Performance was primarily impacted by a product recall payment as we previously disclosed, as well as costs associated with the bridge loan commitment fees, the combination of which was approximately $40 million. In addition, there was an increased level of working capital. Working capital was primarily impacted by higher inventory due to rising raw material cost, increased volume associated with the pre-building of inventory related to citral issue, and higher than anticipated sales volumes. Over the course of the year, we expect all the elements of working capital to improve.","From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $67 million in capital expenditures or about 3.6% of sales. And we continue to believe we'll spend approximately 4% to 5% of sales in 2018 on CapEx.","Regarding cash return to shareholders, in the first half, we spent approximately $109 million on dividend payouts and $15 million on share repurchases. As part of the Frutarom combination, we have paused our share repurchase program as we prepare for the financing of the transaction and prioritize debt repayments going forward.","Also, last week, our board of directors authorized a 6% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.73 per share on the company's common stock. The increased dividend reflects the board's confidence in the cash generation potential and financial strength of the company. We will maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation as we continue to accelerate growth through organic investments and strategic acquisitions, while returning significant capital to shareholders.","As we look towards the balance of the year, I want to provide some commentary on our financial expectations excluding the Frutarom transaction. All of our currency neutral metrics have not changed. Based on our strong year-to-date performance and our current outlook for the second half of the year, we are reconfirming our previously stated full year currency neutral guidance.","As world currencies versus the dollar continue to fluctuate, we do expect to see an impact in terms of our top line. Based on current rates, we believe that we will have a 2 percentage point benefit on consolidated sales growth versus 3% previously indicated. While many currencies have an impact, the largest is the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate.","On an adjusted profit and adjusted EPS basis, we anticipate the benefit of FX to be the same as previously communicated, due primarily to our 12 to 18 month rolling hedging program and movements of various other currencies. For your reference, please note that we remain hedged at approximately 80% on the euro, profit exposure at $1.15 for 2018 and are approximately hedged at 35% at $1.23 for 2019.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas, who would walk you through an update on Frutarom transaction.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thank you, Rich. First, I would like to reiterate that we continue to be very excited about the combination and it will create a global leader in natural taste, scent and nutrition with an expected 2018 pro forma sales of $5.3 billion and it is a win for both companies' shareholders. Together, IFF and Frutarom will have a broader customer base, more diversified product offerings and an increased market penetration.","We will instantly become a leader in natural solutions. We will also strengthen our exposure to fast-growing small and mid-sized customer accounts, gain new opportunities in attractive and fast-growing adjacencies and enhance our global reach.","We also anticipate cost synergies through raw material harmonization, footprint optimization and streamlining overhead expenses. Additional cross-selling opportunities and integrated solutions are expected to provide revenue synergies to our shareholders over time. Both organizations have a strong talent base, comprising thousands of extraordinary employees globally. And through our integration planning work, we continue to be confident in the opportunities that lie ahead and the ability of the combination to accelerate profitable growth, enhance free cash flow, and generate greater returns for our IFF shareholders.","Since the announcement of the deal on May 7, we really have made strong advancements towards the deal close, and I would like to give you an update on a few. On Monday, Frutarom received shareholder approval for the transaction. Of the votes cast at the special general meeting, about 95% were in favor of the proposed merger, representing approximately 75% of all outstanding shares. We are pleased that Frutarom shareholders have approved the combination with IFF, marking another milestone in our path to unlock the value creation potential of the combined company.","We continue to have comprehensive pre-close meetings and discussions on talent, R&D, adjacencies, and business and functional integration to ensure that when this transaction closes, we are ready to execute and drive profitable growth by capitalizing on the best of both organizations. We also want to take a moment to reiterate our intention to remain listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange upon completion of the transaction.","Given the progress to-date, we now expect to close in the fourth quarter of 2018, earlier than our previously communicated timeline of six to nine months from May 7 announcement. This timing continues to be driven primarily by the completion of the remaining anti-trust reviews.","To ensure the most successful integration, we have structured our approach in a very disciplined manner with strong and dedicated teams, foundational in our approach of four guiding principles. The first includes the establishment of a cross-functional team across both organizations directly involving about 75 people committed 30% to 100% of their time to the integration depending on the nature of their role. To complement and support this team, we have engaged external advisors such as leading consulting from across a variety of specialties.","Our second core principle is to protect the core business and deliver the plan. As both organizations are entering the transaction as a position of strength, it's very important that we do not lose focus and continue to deliver strong financial performance. At the same time, the integration team is responsible for realizing our targeted cost synergies and capture cross-selling opportunities. Leading the integration for us is Francisco Fortanet and Amos Anatot for Frutarom.","Francisco is the EVP of Operations for IFF and has extensive experience leading manufacturing procurement plus strong cross-functional leadership, robust commercial support and expertise bringing innovation to market. Amos is the EVP of Global Supply Chain and Operation for Frutarom and has a robust knowledge of the day-to-day operations at Frutarom and is actively involved in all business aspects. Together, both are excited and very engaged to ensure the successful completion and integration of our two great companies.","Aligned with our second core principle to protect growth trajectory of both businesses, we are structuring our Day 1 Model to ensure that once the transaction closes, Frutarom will remain as a standalone unit for now and will maintain their current to go market strategy given they are a very customer-centric organization, it is critical that we limit the changes on the front end of the business.","We want to ensure that there are zero disruption to customers and they continue to provide their products as effectively and efficiently as they have done in the past. To drive cost synergy realization, which I will cover in more details in a moment, we plan to leverage IFFs global expertise and shared service model.","As time progresses, we will slowly centralize various group functions to further unlock value. Simultaneously, we intend to drive cross-selling to sharing our vast technologies and categories expertise across the organization.","While going through the integration process, there will be areas where we selectively lift and shift as appropriate based on the long-term strategy of the business. One example is the cosmetic active ingredients where we are moving Frutarom's business into our LMC infrastructure.","As we outlined on May 7, we plan to unlock significant cost synergies related to the Frutarom acquisitions. I'd now like to give you a bit more clarity on where the $145 million cost synergies target will come from and the estimated timing of this.","We expect approximately 40% of the cost synergies targeted to come from procurement, as we accelerate the rationalization and harmonization of raw materials across both organizations. Activities include make versus buy, vendor consolidation, centralization of spend which will all contribute to the savings.","Approximately 30% will come from operations, as we optimize the global footprint. Given the large infrastructure of both organizations, approximately 110 sites on a combined basis, there are a lot of potential options to optimize our combined footprint.","Out of the anticipated $145 million of our run rate cost synergies, we estimate approximately 20% to 30% to come from streamlining of overhead expenses. It should be noted that less than 10% will come from business development as we are taking steps to ensure the preservation of the customer service levels at both companies.","In terms of timing, we anticipate $145 million of run rate cost synergies for the third full year after closing with approximately 25% achieved in 2019, 17% in 2020, and the remainder in 2021. In addition to the cost synergies, and that's where I'm most excited about, we believe there's a strong potential to drive accelerated growth by capitalizing on revenue synergies. Stepping back not only does this combination create a global leader in taste, scent and nutrition, the combined organization will have the broadest customer base and strongest product offering and deepest markets penetration in our industry.","With respect to customers, we at IFF are extremely well-positioned with global multinationals. Out of our approximately 3,000 customers, 50% of our sales are global customers where we are participant on nearly all global correlates. The balance, our sales, our local and regional customers, strategic focus for us where we are utilizing mid-tier customer go-to-market model like Tastepoint. Frutarom, on the other hand, has approximately 30,000 customers of which 70% are small, mid-sized, and private label accounts. By putting us together, we will have a very strong distribution network ranging from the largest global customers to start-ups and private label accounts.","In terms of product, we pride ourselves in our ability to bring differentiating and unique innovation to the market. With approximately 8% of our sales spend in R&D, we have developed industry-leading technologies across various areas, including modulation, delivery, natural cosmetics and so on. And our pipeline right now is as well-filled as it was never in the history of IFF.","Frutarom has a leading natural portfolio. 75% of their consolidated sales, as well as access to adjacent technologies, such as natural savory solutions, natural colors, natural food protection and health ingredients. The combination will create a comprehensive portfolio, with a potential for integrated solutions to offer our customers one of the strongest portfolios in the industry.","Together, both organizations will further penetrate key markets around the world. IFF has a leading market share in Greater Asia and Latin America, as well as strong positions in North America and Western Europe. Frutarom is a great complement, as they have very strong exposure to key emerging markets and a complementary position in developed markets.","While we haven't quantified the contribution of revenue synergies yet, we look forward to driving incremental growth by capitalizing on these uniquely beneficial positions. I would like to provide an update on the antitrust approval process. We are currently on-track, as all applications have been submitted to the eight countries that we needed to file.","In June, we have already received approval in the U.S. and have recently received approval in Israel. The rest, we are waiting feedback and under normal circumstances, expect to conclude the process in the fourth quarter.","Rich, can you please take us through deal financing consideration.","[07BDC1-E Rich O'Leary]","Thank you, Andreas. Given our progress to-date and as we prepare for financing the transaction, we want to briefly give an update on the sources and uses of funds. From a source of funds perspective, we're providing approximately $2 billion of new equity to Frutarom shareholders at closing of the deal. We'll then be issuing about $2.2 billion of new equity issuance to the market. Of the $2.2 billion, approximately 67% is expected to become an equity and approximately 33% tangible equity units.","From a debt standpoint, we'll be taking on approximately $3.1 billion of new debt financing. Within this debt financing, we'll be using a combination of 10 and 30-year U.S. dollar bonds, as well as Euro public bonds with maturities. The remainder will be cash on hand from the balance sheet.","In terms of uses of funds, we'll be delivering approximately $2 billion of equity and $4.3 billion of cash to Frutarom shareholders. Then we will be retiring approximately $900 million of debt on both sides, on both the IFF side as well as Frutarom. All of this was done while maintaining our focus by keeping an investment grade rating.","Back to you Andreas.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Thanks, Rich. Let's summarize. We're very pleased with our performance of the first half of 2018. Sales growth was robust at 6% with growth across both business units. We also have achieved strong improvement in currency neutral adjusted operating profit and currency neutral adjusted EPS. Based on our year-to-date performance our current outlook for the second half of the year, we have reconfirmed our previously stated full year currency neutral guidance.","On this strong foundation, we are pleased to have made great advancements towards the Frutarom deal close, faster than our original expectations. We are very excited that together, the combination of IFF and Frutarom will have a broader customer base, more diversified product offerings, and an increased market penetration. It will create a global leader in natural taste, scent, and nutrition with a very attractive financial profile in terms of growth, profit, and cash flow which is expected to unlock significant value for our shareholders.","With that, we would now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks and good morning, everybody.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Mark.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hi, Mark.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. So, wanted to ask first just on a logistic standpoint. So sales growth expectations for the back half of the year, so there's a pretty large implied range from guidance. There's obviously a much tougher comparison. So I guess any sort of broader strokes you can give on how to think about that including how much pricing should we expect given the commentary about incremental input cost pressures and the underlying volumes as well as new wins?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sure, Mark. I think couple things from me as I think about it. We've been talking since the end of last year certainly in the first two quarters that a big component of the higher growth in the first half of this year was the volume on existing business, so \u2013 and we've expressed and I certainly have expressed an expectation that that will soften. I think overall on a two-year basis, the numbers are fairly consistent first half, second half. But I do think the mix is going to change where I think our win performance is pretty consistent. There are good rates. Our commercial performance are good. But I think in the second half of the year, we're expecting a decrease in the impact associated with volume and existing business, and an increase in the pricing impact. As I said in the second quarter, we're about 1.5 points of pricing impact in Q2 and I'd expect that to be higher than that in the second half of this year.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, I guess kind of putting that together then it sounds like you're expecting basically the two year to weaken somewhat, but maybe not as much as, I guess, I would have thought given incremental pricing, is that fair?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yes, very fair.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just switching more to a strategic question, Andreas, I guess I want to understand a bit more what gives you conviction in commentary you had before about sustainability of Frutarom is about 6%, core sales growth in the context of what seems like some increasing competition within the natural space from competitors, not just Givaudan Naturex, but just sort of broader strokes as customers out there move towards cleaner labels and more healthful products?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I think that's a very fair question and an important question for us, as well as, we are redoing now our strategy. Let me answer it in a way that, first of all, we have now probably the broadest customer base in the industry. So, a lot of business is done with the mid-sized and smaller customers, where we expect to have higher growth rates going forward than our core business.","Secondly, if you look at the categories, we have now a portfolio as a combined company \u2013 or we will have, after closing \u2013 which gives us the ability to move categories which have good and high growth rates like natural colors, for example, and we mentioned then, natural color that's still a trend which where we have, let's say, the exchange from synthetic to natural colors in the U.S. just in front of us, where we will see high growth rates going forward.","So, the customer base and the categories give us good confidence that the growth rate will be really, really good, despite the competition in some of these areas, but the market is so big that we believe that will not hamper our ability to have a fast growing business in front of us. And if you're combining both, I believe it \u2013 we can see a good uptick in the growth rate here.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","First thing I would ask about was just the commentary on the incremental inflation. So, it sounded like both there's incremental inflation versus the outlook six months ago for the second half of the year and also very much heading into 2019.","And so, I just wanted to be clear on expectations for the back half, is there incremental pricing going in? Do you have visibility? I mean it sounds that way from \u2013 you've said you're reiterating \u2013 but how you're going to be covering that incremental inflation that's kind of close in.","And then also as you're looking into 2019, just to maybe try to help us square the kind of rate of inflation we're talking about, because if you're discussing needing to work with customers on solutions outside of pricing it suggests that it's a pretty severe rate. Thanks.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Lauren. It's Rich. Yeah. I think \u2013 look, as I indicated in my comments, I think, we started the year, we ended last year, started this year, we expected inclusive of citral and the BASF issue to be mid-single digits. It's now above that given the other dynamics. I think what we feel good about is that the vast majority of our discussions and pricing negotiations with our customers have been completed.","And so, it's a matter of phasing those in; we've talked about that in the past. These things don't happen overnight, but we're confident in our ability to recover those increases over time. As I think about next year, I \u2013 what our current view of what we're seeing today, I mean obviously we expect this \u2013 the BASF situation to normalize in the second half of this year, so that will relieve some of the pressure. I think that as we see it today, input costs next year are probably going to be in the low to mid-single-digit level.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then I'm not sure if you'll be able to comment on this yet, but the Frutarom outlook, I think sort of implies that they are baking in some incremental M&A before year-end. I mean, to what degree do you have visibility on that because that's one piece that's where the forward look that's left me a little bit less comfortable, assuming M&A for something that's about to be bought, sort of a \u2013 a bit of a funny dynamic \u2013 so, anything you can offer there would be great.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Look, in general, what we said when we announced the deal is that we certainly want to go ahead with a model of good acquisitions on this business and particularly on the adjacent businesses. Probably not at the same rate as Frutarom is doing it because some of them were just geographic expansions where we probably don't need it because we are, as a combined company, are very well covering the globe. We know and we have visibility of their pipeline in terms of deals. I can't give you any details, but there's certainly a good pipeline, and there are deals to be happen over time. And that's what I can say for now. Yeah, and we are planning our business model for money to be spent on M&A on this side as well. So, that's what I probably can announce today.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Vesterinen with Exane BNP Paribas.","Heidi Vesterinen - Exane BNP Paribas","Hi. Good morning. So a question on the pro forma business as well. I think in the past year, you had talked about increasing profitability through the combination. As you know, there's a debate on the market about how high margins can go. Some people are saying there's a cap. So, where \u2013 do you still see significant margin potential for yourself and more broadly in the industry, please? Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yes, Heidi. And in particular, when you look at the change in product portfolio and customer portfolio going forward, what we certainly see is that in some of the adjacent businesses, you have good margins and probably better margins than in the core F&F business. And now, it's up for us actually to manage our portfolio in a way that we see a margin increase over time for the total corporation.","I'd give you just one example. You might remember when we moved three years ago into the active cosmetics, that's a very high margin business, at least the piece or part where we are playing in. And we see now some of these businesses coming to us as well with Frutarom. And now, we are right now in the middle of the discussion in terms of strategy, what are the product categories we really want to push to move ahead on that time.","Certainly, it's true on the core F&F business. It's not easy to push the margin up and up, but we'll see, let's say, the acceleration of the different portfolios, I think. And then don't forget that we have the cost synergies for us as well, and they will help us on the margin side, and particularly when you look at procurement and at the manufacturing footprint, because that's another driver for us for margin. So, it was probably a little bit of a long-winded answer, but I wanted to give you some details, but the answer is, yes, we can move it up.","Heidi Vesterinen - Exane BNP Paribas","Thanks. And if I could squeeze in a very quick short one. On the citral issue, is there any scope to get compensated after this disruption perhaps from the supplier? Thank you.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, Heidi, we're looking at every possibility there in terms of obviously working with our customers. Our priority, number one priority, has been to maintain surety of supply with our customers and figure out the best way to work with them. From there, we'll look at any other option out there.","Heidi Vesterinen - Exane BNP Paribas","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice quarter.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hey, Mike. Thank you.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","When you think about the slide 20 and 21, appreciate the update on integration approach and such. And so I understand you're keeping Frutarom separate, makes a lot of sense. Can you give us a little bit of color how you plan to change the culture within Frutarom? A lot of different businesses that have been bought over the years, what's sort of the plan inside that box to integrate that and make that more efficient?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Mike, that's certainly something where we're looking to it right now to look what really makes sense to change or what makes sense to keep. We have to say that there's certainly some elements like the nimbleness and the customer focus we like a lot. We certainly will not change that. So, there are a couple of elements actually within the culture where we have to take to consideration whether we make them even bigger within the combined company.","But we are in the middle of the assessment to do it. We will also, in day one, integrate some business already as I've said we lift and shift. But it has to make sense and we can't jeopardize the top line growth, because that's so important for both businesses.","That's the reason, why we have also kept our business people really focused on our core business and doing the integration basically in the back office work. Okay. And we can give you certainly more details over the next couple of months, when we are coming closer to closing and after closing certainly as well.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sure. And then in terms of revenues synergies, you have three buckets that you talked about. Is there any particular \u2013 is it going to be quicker to see the synergies in either of the three buckets, all three buckets that just sort of, want to see also where and how soon some of these little areas can come in?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Look, it's actually an easy answer, but maybe not always as easy done. It's basically \u2013 we give them access to our technology and what we have seen so far when we disclose some of the technology to them there's a lot of excitement around that.","What they can do with it with their own customer base. Usually, they have small and mid-sized customers. So, I expect actually a pretty quick uptake of this kind of business or top line synergy on this side. On the other hand, they have all the adjacent businesses which we can sell into our bigger customers as well. And there's actually a lot of excitement on our bigger customers side as well, what they can do there. For example, an interesting company, it's called Taura. They have a technology, which is very complementary to our PowderPure technology, which goes into natural solutions. And we are right now talking how we can bring this together and make sure that this gives a great offering to our customers.","So, there are a lot of discussions, but it means basically our technology into their customer base and it means their adjacency into our customer base. And that's what we are working on it. And we haven't put too much of these revenue synergies already into our plan, because we said we want to be really diligent to go over it and then make really good plans. How to do it in the best way and when we have our, let's say, first, let's say, investor conference after the closure, we certainly will disclose some of it. Okay?","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. When you calculate currency neutral operating profit growth, is the base what you actually reported last year or is it a different base that's currency neutral that's not immediately visible?","Richard A.

O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. We take the prior year and then we're adjusting prior year results to current year exchange rates. Keep in mind, though, keep in mind that when you're looking at last year's reported numbers, the pension accounting change which may \u2013 which is a pretty significant number where the pension income is no longer reflected in operating profits now and other income and expense.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I just say that since your analysis of your own results rely so much on currency neutral values, you might simply supply those values so that your financial statements are somewhat more transparent. And since it's simply a translation or currency neutral, I don't think it would give away anything competitive.","And just secondly, can you describe what the tangible common equity units are in a little bit more detail and what's the timing of your equity financing?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sure. In terms of the \u2013 in terms of the financing, we expect to go \u2013 to do the debt and equity raise \u2013 equity first, debt second in the middle of September. The exact dates, we're still working through that. In terms of the tangible equity units, they're issued at a premium and they have both a debt \u2013 they both have a \u2013 they convert from a tangible equity unit into common shares. At the future, they have an interest component to that. And the premium allows the company to benefit up to a cap on growth in our share price over the three-year period that gets the upside in terms of as our \u2013 as we deliver upon the plan, the shares reflects that we'll have a lower dilution effect.","Jeffrey J.

Bernstein Ltd.","Hi. Good morning, everyone. From what you said about pricing versus raw material costs, I found that very interesting. Do you expect higher gross margins in the second half this year compared to last?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Compared to last year?","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Second half last year.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","No. No. I mean, I think what we expect to see is that if you look at the pressure \u2013 year-over-year pressure that we saw in the second quarter, I would expect the second half of the year be better than that or less year-over-year pressure.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Pressure from raw materials, but also \u2013 less pressure, but also better pricing from what you said, so higher...","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yes. So...","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","...gross margins in the second half 2018 versus 2017?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. So, I mean, if you look at the second quarter numbers, we were down about 200 basis points year-over-year in Q2. As we get the pricing in the second half of this year, I would expect that decline to decrease in the second half of the year.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay. That's very clear. Thanks. And then just on the second quarter itself, on the gross margin. Can you help me split out what \u2013 how big the effects were between the ongoing raw material cost inflation and the citral impacts? And I think, you already mentioned the 1.5% price in Q2, if I have that right?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yes, so pricing was about 1.5%.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Because you don't provide that bridge anymore that you used to.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yes. So, let me give you the background. So, yeah, as I said, 1.5% of price increases. When you \u2013 as I just mentioned, we were down about 200 basis points year-over-year on gross margins. All of that can be attributed actually slightly more than that. But all of that can be attributed to net price to input cost, the dynamic. And as best as I can \u2013 we can estimate it, it's split roughly 50\/50 between the citral issue and the other price increases. And as I said, it's a timing issue that we expected to normalize over the balance of the year and into early next year.","Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","That's great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Your mysterious largest shareholder, Winder, increased their position in your stock again recently. That surprised me a little bit given they'll be able to buy all they want on the secondary offering in a month or so. Have you talked to them about participating in the secondary?","Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Hey, John. It's Mike. From a largest shareholder perspective, look, we've had pretty lengthy conversation with them with respect to every ongoing institutional investor we have. They remain passive evident with their filing of their 13-G, so there's no change there. With respect to secondary offering, unfortunately, we don't disclose the process. But what I can say is that there's technical rules that they have to abide by given their size. So, it's ongoing conversations as we move forward, more to come.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, secondly, are you concerned at all about the persistent low growth in the Greater Asian flavors business? You had an easy comp this quarter as against minus 2% a year ago, and you haven't had a comp above 2% in over a year.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","No, actually not because we are happy that finally we were turning or we are turning around the situation in China. We have good growth in China in the Flavors business. What is in, let's say, an issue for us was Indonesia because we have a big business in Indonesia and the market is pretty soft that what's taking the growth rate down. But eventually that will come back. The rest of the Asian business is performing very well, and as I said, in particular, John, China, we are happy to be back. Interesting enough, as you might recall, the whole thing goes back to our factory issue we had in 2015. So, it took us longer to recover. We have now a second manufacturing plant actually in place and we will open it in the fourth quarter of this year.","So, we have a backup plan and we believe that China will be for us a good growth country going forward. And now even, we see the consolidation of Frutarom even better because we will get some of their volume basically into our factories as well.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a clarification on the guidance, a lot of ground covered today. There is a pretty sharp deceleration implied in second half currency neutral sales growth and understanding the comps get considerably tougher, especially in Fragrance, but you've got better pricing expected to flow through. Is it such that you think volumes are actually down year-on-year in the back half either company-wide or at least in the Fragrance? And if so, is it just \u2013 is it just comp or is there anything on win rates or customer order patterns that would make you think that? I just want to make sure I understand some of the moving pieces in there.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","No. Again, I think as I said, as I mentioned earlier, overall, when we look at on a two-year basis, it's \u2013 there's not any significant change. What I do believe \u2013 what we do see happening is that the first half of this year, lower comps but a big bigger chunk of the improvement was volume on existing business.","The growth \u2013 the volume on existing business were above, let's call it, five-year norms. Our win rates and impact of new wins was consistent with the five long-term trends. So, we were not seeing anything slowing or increasing there. And so, we expect to see a slowdown in the volume on existing business that'll be offset by pricing.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just below the line, tax rate has come in, I think, below kind of the expectations at the beginning of the year. Is there an expectation that you see a notable pickup in tax in the back half or what's the full-year expected rate?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. So, for the first half of the year, we're \u2013 between 2018 and 2019, I would expect we're going to end the year between 19% and 20%.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then there's no \u2013 the financing for Frutarom is not embedded in the EPS outlook for the year, is that correct?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","No, no. Everything related to that is excluded at this point.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Fintan Ryan with Berenberg.","Fintan Ryan - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions from me, please. Firstly, in terms of the integration with the Frutarom deal on the Frutarom side, given that we are a few months further down the line, have you thought about or have you seen any impact so far in terms of some Frutarom employee turnover?","And would you be confident that most of the core management team there will remain with IFF and help that integration process post-acquisition, particularly given that I felt that the Frutarom shareholders rejected the bonus, the $20 million bonus proposed for the CEO of Frutarom. How does IFF intend to keep him compensated or interested in the business?","And then in terms of the regulatory approvals, would you anticipate any issues in terms of some of the larger markets where Frutarom operates like Russia and Europe and the European Union? Is there a potential for any divestments that you can see at this stage or do you think it's just merely marketing exercise to get the regulatory approvals? Thank you.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Well, thank you, Fintan. Let me start with the last one first. On the regulatory side, we don't see any issues and we don't expect to have to divest any business before we get the regulatory approval which is positive. And that made us actually believe that the fourth quarter is good for closing, which is ahead of the initial timeline we have given to ourselves. We are very happy about that.","On the talent side for the integration, we haven't seen any significant departures, and we believe that many of the senior leaders will have a good position within IFF and will stay. And we are very happy with many of the talented people who will join the new IFF in the new makeup of the company and help us driving growth.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","From my standpoint, Fin, I mean, I think, we're also \u2013 obviously, we have a completely separate work stream around talent management and the people. As Andreas' previous comments in his prepared remarks, very strong talent base. Part of that work stream is identifying who those key people are and reaching out to them and having discussions before closing in terms of what the vision is for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Good morning, Faiza.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. I just wanted to go back first to pricing in the quarter. If you could just update us on \u2013 or give us more color around where the pricing is coming from? Like is it more \u2013 my sense is that it's coming maybe more from the smaller customers \u2013 and then you expect in the back half to get more pricing from your more global customers?","And then maybe if you could disaggregate sort of how much of it is coming from Fragrances versus Flavors? And within Fragrances, how much is Fragrance Ingredients versus the other components?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sure, Faiza. I mean, in general, I would say that the pricing is skewed towards Fragrances versus Flavors. And then within that, it's a balance between Compounds and the Ingredients business was, you know, we've talked in the past, Fragrance Ingredients business generally works off a six-month contract. So, they generally \u2013 the impact is seen sooner on the Ingredients side.","On the Fragrance Compounds side, the timing is often driven by one, the process to identify where and when the choices are made about the adjustments. And in some cases, can be driven by the indices or the contract on when the windows open up. The details on global versus local and regional, it's hard to say. So, I think it's more around those three businesses. More Fragrances than Flavors and more of what we see today is on Ingredients versus Compounds.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Understood. And then, unless I missed it, I don't think you reiterated your previous outlook around double-digit EPS cash accretion in year two post the deal. So, I was just wondering if that still stands, and if it does, maybe you could walk through some of the components of that? We understand the synergy phasing, but maybe if you could just update us on what type of underlying growth you're expecting? And maybe if you've baked in anything for incremental acquisitions there?","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Mike, I'm sorry, I can't control this. So it still stands. Let's put that clear, and Rich can explain.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we haven't \u2013 we reiterated the guidance today around our core business. We were not talking about the Frutarom deal that we will cover, as Mike said earlier and Andreas talked about, we'll cover that after the deal closes. But, overall, the big part of the year-over-year on a cash basis accretion is driven by the synergies. When we go from 25% to 70%, the cash flow generation of the business is quite significant. We expected to pay down the debt quite significantly, very quickly. So we get both the operating profit gain as well as the interest expense reductions that are driving it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Lambert with Raymond James.","Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking a few questions. A brief one, just going back on citral, I mean, every company has a different timing of impact apparently. And do you think that actually for you guys, the bulk of the impact \u2013 I think it was last year about $45 million for the year \u2013 total without any mitigation. Is it more in Q2 versus the rest of the year or there's still more to come just for citral impact? That's question number one.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. I think for that first part, I mean as we talked about on the last call, I mean, the impact was small in Q1. As I talked about at the time, most of the higher costs were sitting in inventory. So I think when you think about the overall impact, Q2, Q3 are the pressure points. And then on the input cost side, we expect the purchasing cost to come down as the citral line stabilizes. And then on the other side, we start to fully recover the \u2013 we get the pricing takes hold and that will further mitigate the impacts.","Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.","And you still believe you can \u2013 out of the 7%, recover about 5% of impact \u2013 the percentage points of your bridge?","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. We still believe that currently the impact in the year this year will be about a 2% headwind, so somewhere between $10 million and $15 million on operating profit.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to \u2013 when you think about your sales forecast, maybe this is a question more for Rich or maybe Andreas. Do you have implicit in that an assumption about acceleration or deceleration in your end customer markets? How much visibility do you have into that?","And finally, could you characterize the growth in your portfolio, in your customers right now between small or local \u2013 either small, local, or both kinds of customers versus global customers? And I asked because it seems like, persistently your growth rate is so much better than if I put together just a \u2013 sloppily put an index together of what appear to be all your major CPG customers, you've been growing a lot faster for a long time on an organic basis. So, just trying to get my hands around that and how you think about that as your forecast? Thank you.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sure, Jon. So, first of all, what we see certainly is that the smaller and mid-sized customers are providing us with better growth than the big ones. And now, with some of the moves we have done in our own core business like Tastepoint, for example, we are covering better these smaller and mid-sized customers which give us some good growth here. So, that's good. And actually, this is one of the reasons for the Frutarom deal because it will give us even more exposure towards these customers. And we feel very excited about this.","In general, if you look at the volume trends, they are pretty robust, I would say also with our end customers since, I would say, probably third quarter last year, and we see still pretty robust volume trends. We saw it in our first quarter, for example, where we were circling through our inventory much faster than we saw and particularly on the Fragrance side.","We don't see a deceleration of these trends, but you never know. So, that's certainly for something we have to see, and we are in constant dialogue with our customers all the time to figure out where they stand and how much growth they see going forward. But so far, the volume trend is intact for our customers which is actually good news for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hundley with Vertical Group.","Brett Hundley - The Vertical Trading Group LLC","Hey. Thanks for fitting me in, guys. I just have one question. I'm trying to think more about your \u2013 the ability of your Fragrance segment margins to rebound in 2019. And, Rich, I thought you had an interesting comment on pricing when you talked about raw material inflation continuing into fiscal 2019. And, I don't know, I'm just reading your comment as a very public and signaling and talking about how it's imperative that you get pricing through or look at other actions. If I'm not reading too much into that comment, as you guys have pricing discussions, ongoing pricing discussions with customers, do you feel like you're getting to any type of price ceiling on the synthetic side or do you feel like you're running into any challenges on taking pricing higher?","And maybe related to that, if it's not pricing, do you guys believe that you can deliver another round of cost savings following what you've done over 2017 and 2018. Are you feeling better about maybe walking your synergy number from Frutarom higher or maybe walking it faster? Can you just talk about the other ways, that if you don't go out and get pricing that you might be able to offset further oncoming inflation? Thank you.","Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Sure. Thanks. Look, I'm never going to sit here in my role and tell you that getting the price increase is easy. It's not. It's a long process. I think we have better tools available to us today to help our teams have fact-based conversations with our customers at a very detailed level that we hadn't had six or seven years ago. And that's imperative to our ability to get those price increases.","Would I like them to come sooner? Absolutely, but we have to manage our business and these are long-term relationships with our customers and we have to work together and some cases we can come quicker, in other cases we have to make a choice and work with them around formula optimization or opening up the formulas and reformulating. Sometimes we have to look at options around phasing in the price increases. But I think both businesses have shown the ability to recover the price increases. Again, sometimes the timing it was probably not what Andreas and I would like. But I think we're able to do that. Now, from a margin standpoint, obviously it's dilutive. Because what we don't do is try to mark up the cost increases. So, I think those will continue, we'll continue to work that next year.","I think what's important to me, I think, when I look at the trajectory on the input cost increases, again, we're not sitting here saying, we're expecting it to be double-digit increases across 80% of the portfolio, which is what we faced back in 2010, 2011 and 2012 and that took us two or three years to recover that. So, I think we will continue to do that.","In terms of your question around cost savings and what we do as a business, I mean, that's part of what we're constantly doing, is managing productivity programs. I mean, the productivity programs that Francisco has led over the last 11 years that I've been with the company, have been dramatic in terms of what they've delivered to the bottom line and help give us flexibility.","I'm not going to sit here and tell you we have the same ability to achieve those that we've had in the last 10 years, over the next 10 years because we've done all the easy stuff. But it's a constant part of our agenda. And then obviously \u2013 we will, obviously, look to accelerate the synergies and turn over every possible stone to have as much flexibility in our operating model. And I think we will then look at how much do we reinvest in the business. That becomes, to me, the variable of terms of, okay, if we're ahead of schedule, we can potentially reinvest quicker. If we're behind, we'll be more restrictive in terms of where we make incremental investments.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Actually, on the cost side and particularly on manufacturing, as Rich said, the easy stuff is done. But now in front of these, before the industrial revolution, we see much more of a drive into artificial intelligence and robotics, which will help us actually significantly to decrease some of the costs we were having in that area. And that's actually very, very helpful. So our profitability and potential savings agenda is still on for the core business, and then on top of it, certainly the savings we get to the Frutarom deal. Well, that's where we are and we feel actually very, very good about it.","Operator","And we have reached the allotted time for Q&A. I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for closing remarks.","Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you for all the great questions. It was a good session. I hope you got the answers you needed. And as usually, we follow-up with one-on-one calls for more detailed information. Thank you very much guys. Have a good day. Bye-bye.

Excluding a 2-percentage-point impact related to foreign currency, the diversity and the strength of our category and geographic presence allowed us to continue to grow our business as worldwide local currency sales increased 1% in the first quarter, on top of the 9% growth we reported a year ago. ","In Flavors, local currency sales increased 5%, or 3% on a reported basis, led by double-digit performance in the emerging markets. If we exclude a 1 percentage point impact associated with an intentional, strategic exit of low-margin businesses in the year ago period, local currency sales on a like-for-like basis, or as we refer to it, LFL, grew 6%. ","As expected, Fragrance results were pressured by volume declines in ingredients, which had a 300-basis-point impact on total local currency Fragrance sales, as well as a challenging year ago comparison when Fine & Beauty Care grew 14% in local currency. ","We were encouraged by the trends seen throughout the quarter as each month improved sequentially, a trend that has continued in the month of April. From a profitability perspective, despite a pricing benefit of nearly 3%, overall gross margin declined 140 basis points due to a 9% increase in raw material costs. This was an improvement relative to the fourth quarter when gross margin was down 220 basis points from the previous year. ","Research, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were down 10 basis points as a result of ongoing cost control and modest benefits from our restructuring. However, as we have previously indicated, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS declined versus the prior year period, but results are in line with our expectations. ","After Nicolas, Hernan and Kevin finish their respective sections, I will give you some perspectives on our outlook for the full year. ","And with that, I would like to introduce our group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Thank you, Doug, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Comparing to a 7% local currency growth rate in the year ago period, which was a record first quarter and our strongest quarterly growth in 2011, local currency sales in the first quarter declined 3% as new business wins and pricing benefits were more than offset by volume declines on existing business. ","Volume in Fine & Beauty Care remained under pressure, down 2% versus 14% growth last year, particularly in Western Europe, as we compared to a 2011 period which included both new wins and volume that was stronger than historical averages. ","Sales in our EAME region decreased 7% on top of 22% growth last year. However, local currency sales increased 4% in North America, and 5% in Latin America. Fine & Beauty Care sales trend improved versus the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily driven by an improved win rate in Fine Fragrance. ","In Functional Fragrance, local currency results were positive, up 1% for the 15th consecutive quarter, as new business wins and the realization of price increases continued to drive results. Sales were up 5% in Europe and 6% in Latin America. Within this segment, Fabric Care remained a standout, growing mid-single digits on the local currency basis. ","For Fragrance Ingredients, we continued to focus on driving portfolio management. While we have experienced top line pressure, we have been able to maintain and protect our percent margin on the external part of our business. We have been making balanced pricing decisions that have resulted in some volumes being lost. These volumes have been lost where our low-margin competitors are pricing to gain share in lower value-added segments of their portfolio. ","Going forward, our priorities for Ingredients remain: focusing on technology innovation; product portfolio management; asset optimization; and operations sustainability. ","Given the recent trend in the business, we are also conducting a full assessment of our Ingredient activities following the economic profit principle to ensure that we are maximizing our shareholder returns. I expect that this process will take several months at which time we will provide an update. ","From a geographic perspective, trends in the developed market improved, led by North America, which grew 1%, driven by a 4% increase in Fine & Beauty Care. Sales in Latin America were up 5% in Fine & Beauty and up 6% on Functional Fragrances. While not surprising given the strong comparable I just mentioned and the economic situation in Western Europe, EAME sales decreased 5%. ","From a profitability standpoint, as expected, operating profit declined 18%, or $13 million, to $56 million as double-digit increases in raw material costs and volume declines more than offset higher prices and cost control initiatives. As a result, operating profit margin fell 280 basis points to 15.5% versus a year ago period. ","Looking ahead, we are encouraged that our level of new wins and pipeline of new business should lead to local currency sales growth in the second quarter. We continue to see sequential improvement in our compound business. ","It is worth noting, however, that Ingredients is expected to remain under pressure in Q2, similar to our Q1 performance, as a result of our 6 months pricing agreements that were finalized during Q1 with a majority of our customers. ","From a pricing perspective, in our compound business, we will continue to have pricing discussion with our customers to reduce the impact of higher raw material costs, a process that I expect will be ongoing until we fully recover our input cost increase.","I would like now to turn the call to Hernan Vaisman, our Group President for Flavors.","Hernan Vaisman","Thank you, Nicholas. Marking the 25th consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth, I am pleased to report that the like-for-like local currency sales grew 6%, excluding approximately 1 percentage point associated with the strategic exit of low-margin business on top of the 12% local currency growth we reported in the first quarter, 2011. Our performance can once again be attributed to new business win and higher prices across all regions and all categories. ","In North America, like-for-like growth was 5%, excluding 2 percentage points related to the exit of low-margin businesses. The best performing category was Beverage, which was up strong double digits, thanks to new wins and increased volumes of products used in our sweetness tools. ","Within our EAME region, local currency growth was led by strong results in Africa and the Middle East. Western Europe continued to remain in positive territory on a local currency basis, led by our innovative naturals portfolio but at a slower rate than Africa and the Middle East. In Latin America, local currency growth was strongest in Dairy, up double digits, followed by high single-digit growth in Savory and Beverage. ","Similar to last quarter, our best performing region in terms of dollar growth and percentage change continues to be Greater Asia. Excluding approximately 1 percentage point associated with the exit of low-margin business, local currency sales growth was 9%, led by a double-digit increase in Confectionery and good growth across Savory and Beverage. ","Looking at the geographic breakdown of our sales, I am very pleased with our performance in the emerging markets, which has grown double digits on local currency basis for the 10th consecutive quarter. This performance was driven by a double-digit local currency growth in Africa, the Middle East, Indonesia, India, as well as in South Con [ph] and many impacted regions in LatAm. ","From an R&D perspective, we expanded our relationship with Evolva Holdings, a Swiss biotech company, to implement a commercially viable biosynthetic route for the sustainable production of a key flavoring ingredient. We expect this new agreement would leverage the progress we've made against our original agreement as we continue to build additional competitive advantages.","Turning to profit. First quarter operating profit increased 1%, or $1 million, to $80 million, as volume growth, higher pricing and cost disciplines drove results. Operating profit margin was down 50 basis points versus the prior year period to 22.8% due to higher raw material costs. ","Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2012, while we are comparing to our net percent local currency growth rate, we are off to a solid start as new business wins are expected to continue to drive our top line performance. ","With that, let me turn it to Kevin.","Kevin C. Berryman","Thank you, Hernan, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. First quarter 2012 reported sales totaled $711 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year period, as the impact of foreign exchange had a negative 2-percentage-point impact on sales. ","Excluding the impact of currencies, local currency sales increased 1%. The emerging markets continued to perform well, up 3% on a local currency basis, on top of the very strong 12% local currency sales growth we reported in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted operating profit fell 8%, or $11 million, to $122 million as pricing actions and cost discipline were more than offset by increases in raw material costs. ","With interest expense declining $1 million and other expenses down approximately $6 million year-over-year, the decline in adjusted operating profit was mitigated at the net income level as adjusted EPS fell 3% to an even $1, in line with our forecast. ","As expected and as communicated on previous calls, our raw material costs remained high in the first quarter of 2012. While both businesses faced significant cost pressure, it was most pronounced in Fragrances, where strong increases in naturals, petrochemicals and feedstock ingredients drove a double-digit increase in raw material cost. ","Flavors raw material costs, which were up high-single digits, continued to be impacted by higher year-over-year cost of items such as citrus and mint and menthol. As expected, our traction against our pricing actions continued to reduce the gross margin impact on our profitability, as our gross margin shortfall versus the year ago period fell to 140 basis points versus the 330 and 220 basis points we saw in Q3 and Q4 of last year. This is a positive trend we will expect to continue over the course of 2012. ","Given that input costs were in line with our expectations, and based on current prices as well as our inventory levels, we expect that Q1 will represent the strongest pressure point in input costs in 2012, as we continue to expect only modest raw material cost inflation for the full year 2012. As a result, our raw material cost comparisons are expected to continue to ease over the balance of the year starting in the second quarter. ","From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA expense as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 22.9%, reflecting continued cost discipline. Within RSA, we continue to make R&D investments to support our long-term strategic growth initiatives. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and incentive compensation expense from both periods, our comparable investment increased year-over-year on both a dollar basis and on a percentage of sales basis.","As I mentioned, foreign exchange in the first quarter had an approximate 2-percentage-point impact on the top line but had a lesser impact on profitability as a result of our hedging activities. ","Looking ahead, 2\/3 of our euro-dollar exposure in 2012 remains hedged at a rate near 140. As such, as currency rates stay where they are today with the euro in the neighborhood of $1.30, we expect foreign exchange impacts to be a modest headwind to earnings per share for the full year 2012. ","From a cash flow perspective, we continue to make improvements in core working capital. As a result of these improvements, as well as lower incentive compensation payouts and tax payments, cash flow from operations increased $88 million from the year ago period to $53 million in the quarter. ","As anticipated, capital expenditures increased in line with our guidance, and we expect it will approximate 5% of sales for the full year 2012. These investments will continue to be focused on supporting our strategic growth, with a specific concentration in the emerging markets and the addition of new technology platforms. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year.","Douglas D. Tough","Thanks, Kevin. Going forward, we expect business trends should improve over the course of the year, as we continue to capitalize on our strong emerging market presence, a healthy research and development pipeline and our profit improvement initiatives. ","In fact, overall, April has proven to be a strong month for both Flavors and Fragrances, though Ingredients remained soft. From a top line perspective, Flavors' local currency should remain resilient even as we accelerate the exit of low-margin businesses. ","In Fragrance, we expect local currency sales growth starting in Q2 to be driven by strong new wins. As Nicolas communicated, the one area where we see risk to our plan could be in Ingredients as current trends remain soft on our external sales portfolio. ","Regarding our margin structure, while we expect raw material costs will rise modestly in 2012, we are seeing pressure beginning to ease, which when combined with our pricing actions, should result in gross margin expansion beginning in Q2 and continuing throughout the balance of the year. ","We expect that this will lead to the third consecutive year of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS growth, even as our incentive compensation program resets, and we continue to make incremental investments in R&D and other parts of the business that are vital to sustain long-term profitable growth. ","While we started the year in line with our expectations, the majority of the year is still ahead of us. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic despite the current trends in Ingredients and the fluidity in the macroeconomic environment, particularly in Western Europe, both of which pose some risk in our achieving our long term financial targets in 2012. ","In wrapping up, we have started the year broadly in line with where we thought we would be. Both our Flavors and Fragrance teams have executed the strategy to deliver financial results in line with our expectations. Going forward, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook given the evolving macroeconomic landscape. We will proactively manage our performance, making adjustments as necessary as we continue to make progress against our strategic plan. ","With that, we would be happy to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess, Doug, in terms of thinking about what you said, first quarter results, April trends, how do you think about that over in the balance of the full year relative to long-term expectations? Like you had talked a bit about that in that context on the last call. So maybe if you could give us a bit of an update in terms of where we're thinking for the results for the year on both the sales and earnings basis relative to this target? That'd be helpful.","Douglas D. Tough","Sure, Mark. Well, I don't think anything has really meaningfully changed, Mark, versus where we were before. I make that with one caveat, that we're probably as perplexed as the rest of the world about what might evolve in Europe, particularly Western Europe. It remains a little bit of a cloud over our heads and our customers' heads. But putting that part aside, the Q1 came in, in line with expectations in volume and profitability, in EPS. We think we're probably closer to the lower end of the sales guidance range we've given. And as I've just mentioned, we think there's some risk to the long-term financial EPS target. But relative to what our comments would have been, we wouldn't be meaningfully different, absent the caveat I've just given about Western Europe. I think the embellishment I would provide on it is the expectation that both comparables are easing, or as the overall situation now as we see it in cost of goods and raw material impacts is easing, the pipeline we have in terms of R&D wins, the customer wins is solid and the R&D pipeline remains robust. So we wouldn't be meaningfully changing anything relative to what we said a while ago.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just secondly, the spread between your volumes and your largest competitor's volumes have widened now to the largest amount in probably 3 years, at least since you and Kevin have been at the company. Just wondering what has led to that share shift and how you think about that going forward?","Douglas D. Tough","Well, I'll talk to this briefly and then I'll certainly ask the 2 group presidents to chime in a little bit. I mean, I think we would look at things from a longer-term perspective. I accept very much you said about the most recent results, you're aware the industry doesn't get share information per se. So we couldn't claim victory a few years ago, nor do we understand the absolute share position right now. But over the course of the longer term, our results aren't meaningfully different. We think we've got extremely robust comparables to go up against, which we've just reported upon. So we'd probably look at the longer-term, Mark, and say, do we have the level of wins underway with customers? Is there a level of customer intimacy we need to have to make sure we win? And is the pipeline in R&D short and mid-term and long-term underway to give us confidence that our current business plan's going to achieve the results we expect? And those would very much be the case. I'll let -- Nicolas will talk first with any embellishments he might want on Fragrance comments.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","As Doug has said, much information is not readily available, so it's difficult to comment. The most recent results show a difference, but when we go back to the 2-year, 3-year period, we have averaged actually a 7% growth above our long-term financial of 4% to 6%, and which -- a market which has grown over 3%. So that's important. And as Doug was mentioning, we see a very, very strong pipeline of new projects, good pipeline of new wins and also strength in colleague [ph] participation, which will be leading to sequential improvement as we progress.","Hernan Vaisman","Hi, Mark. This is Hernan of Flavors. I mean, if you evaluate the Flavors performance of the last 2, 3 years, I mean, definitely we can say that we are performing pretty well in the marketplace. Having said that, I mean, we really -- I mean, you see I think with our competition in Latin America, we see a kind of a softness in our business. We really address it early last year. We make several changes, we fine-tune the strategy, and I can say now that we are in better position really to grabbing more market share going forward. So overall, I feel very confident. The fundamentals of the business in Flavors are there, and the results are proof of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Aaron with RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It sounds like you're seeing in your value added businesses, seeing some nice sequential improvement so far this year. I'm wondering if you're seeing any signs of strength in that business beyond what you can just attribute to easier comparisons?","Douglas D. Tough","You want to talk to the technology opportunities?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Yes. I mean, I think that all with the business is based on the market, but also I think that you have to have the right portfolio. I mean, we have been investing, I mean, a lot in terms of technology, and now we are getting into the market and this kind of portfolio improvement is helping us to really get businesses from the market, even sometimes from the competition. So I think that this is the upside. On the downside, I could say that the -- Doug mentioned it before, I mean, Europe is under stress, so we can really see probably some volumes going down. But basically, definitely, I mean, the technology will give us the advantage to really overcome, I mean, this kind of softness in Europe.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But maybe just to kind of ask a follow-up clarification trends. Just on your kind of April comments because it sounds like you saw some strength in April. And this was I think in your report of this quarter last year, you had mentioned that trends had kind of worsened in the month of April. So what I was kind of getting at is when you look at just -- I hate to be so focused on the last month or so, but if you look at your kind of most recent trends, is the improvement just entirely reflective of the easy comps -- easier comps that you're up against? Or have you seen more of an underlying strengthening of the business as you look at things in the last couple of months?","Douglas D. Tough","Overall, there is a strength. I mean, Hernan has touched upon, and I think it's remarkable, the comment that was made in his opening remarks, that this is the 25th consecutive quarter of growth in Flavors and its growth off of a strong results again, year ago. So the buoyancy that we're seeing is growth on growth, and while it's to a lesser level, the general comment looks to be the same in Fragrance compounds. We remain concerned and made the note that the softness in Fragrance Ingredients we would expect to continue in Q2. But on the core Fragrance -- Flavors in particular, it's growth on top of growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I've come to focus a little bit on Asia because that's actually the one division where it just felt like at least in the compound business within Fragrances, it was pretty different than how we'd looked at it. So Functional down 9, Fine down 3. So Nicolas, can we maybe talk a little bit about what's going on there? Was there anything in particular in the comps? And then how to think about that going forward?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Yes, good question. First of all, we come especially in the Functional, as you were referring, from 14% growth in 2011 and 31% in 2010. So it was a comp effect. But it was mostly 3 key drivers that drove the decline in Asia. First, a loss of a business last year. So we knew about it, which was at the low-margin business, number 1. Number 2, last year, we saw a significant promotional activity with some customers that did not take place in 2012. And last, important to mention that we had also some inventory correction with a key customer affecting us in particular. So these where the key drivers of the challenges in Q1. We expect a sequential improvement as we progress throughout the year. Two factors: first, increased colleague [ph] participation and also strong win rate that we know will be backing us later on this year.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to follow up. Because it sounded like particularly, at least the 2 and 3, the promotions and then the inventory correction. If I'm understanding, they should have actually been isolated to this quarter, so the only thing that kind of continues as we go through the year is the lost business. So does it turn positive as we get -- excluding Ingredients, does the compounds business get positive when we go into the second quarter?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","We have to see. We see a positive improvement as we progress, and we see continued improvements. So our expectations as we progress throughout the year, we should expect that sequential improvement for compounds.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then can you just explain, Nicolas -- I'm sorry, like significant promotion with some customers. I didn't -- my misunderstanding maybe, but I didn't know there was much that IFF would do with customers that was terribly promotional? So can you just elaborate on what that would have been or how to think about it?","Hernan Vaisman","Yes, sorry if I was not clear enough, Lauren. Some customers were very active in their promotional activities in the market. So a lot of advertising a lot of promotion in stores during that specific quarter, and the customers where we are highly represented. So we benefited from that increased activity and promotional activity. We did not see this year the same level of promotion on their part.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Got it. So that actually may be something that continues to be a headwind as we move forward, if that customer's promotional for more than a quarter. Okay. And then just maybe, Doug, for you. You guys mentioned on Ingredients, review is underway. Just what's -- timing of kind of sharing with us anything that might be more specific, both decisions made internally and then anything that is able to be share with us.","Douglas D. Tough","Well, the internal work is underway, Lauren, and the plan is to for presentations to our Board mid-summer. And with conclusions coming out of -- and Nicolas referenced that we're going at it with the same degree of rigor akin to what we've presented at the Investor Day a year ago with economic profitability and really a deep dive into all parts. So Board review is planned for mid-late summer and the implications, what we can share with you and the investment community we would do so thereafter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you elaborate a little bit about what the issues are in Ingredients? Is it that your prices are too high or your normal customers are now more backwardly integrated and so you have too much capacity? From a strategic point of view, what's the malfunction in Ingredients?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Hi Jeff, it's Nicolas. One thing which is important and that we have mentioned over the last quarter is that we have taken strategic pricing to protect margins from the rising raw material cost. So every player in the business has different portfolio, which are impacted differently by different feedstock. And yet we felt that the priority for us was to protect margin levels, which we did. But we don't see necessarily additional backward integration from some of our customers in that respect. So this is part of the analysis that we're conducting. And as Doug said, it's a very much in-depth full review of the different parts of our portfolio because I think it's about portfolio participation. You have a different set of competitors according to the different portfolio in which you are engaged, and therefore, we are going through that in-depth analysis.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So why do you need a strategic review at all?","Douglas D. Tough","Let me add a couple of little bits and embellish something. One of the points you'd raised, Jeff, was is there a capacity change in the industry and which could be a driving force and implication going forward? And that's one of the areas we're frankly investigating right now. Early signs suggest there might be some legitimacy to that. So when you have the couple of quarters or 3 quarters of softness that we've had, in the order of double-digit, it frankly is very much on the radar screen of both management and our board. So you can call it a strategic review or an extremely in-depth analysis to what are the root causes? What are the implications going forward? Is there a need to reshape the portfolio? I guess I'd liken it, analogous to the Investor Day we had a year ago, where we articulated some categories had robust profitability and would hence get enhanced emphasis, and some needed remediation, which is underway, too. So in the context of the broad-scale portfolio of Fragrance Ingredients that Nicolas just referenced, there maybe some of those that we emphasize and those that we de-emphasize. So that's kind of the -- and the other one final comment would be in this very price-sensitive environment, we saw some customers opt for a lower-priced alternative, and as Nicolas said, we retained the margin by pricing up, which has caused the elasticity to be a little more negative than we'd first thought.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","What percent of your Fragrance capacity is used internally versus sold externally?","Kevin C. Berryman","It's roughly -- John, this is Kevin. It's roughly 50\/50. And you're specifically talking the Ingredients business when you asked that?","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Correct. Yes, the back integration. And the Fragrance compound business, are they charged market price for what they use internally? Or do you transfer that to them at standard cost?","Kevin C. Berryman","Well, we don't go into the details of what our transfer pricing methodology ultimately is, John. But we do have clarity in our strategic review in terms of the evaluation of what the costs are and how they flow through to the compound business to the extent that there are benefits there. And as you know, we only report at and track our business at the consolidated Fragrance BU level.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","No, I know. I'm just trying to get -- as you review the Ingredients business, should you look at the 100% of the capacity on a market basis to review it versus maybe you might look at it more favorably if you used standard costing, for example.","Kevin C. Berryman","We do both. That's part of our deep dive in terms of the work that's being done.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then you had double-digit growth in the emerging markets, but in local currency, at least, Greater Asia is only up 1%, Latin America is up only 4%. Kind of where was the growth substantially above 10% to kind of weight average those up double-digit?","Kevin C. Berryman","The double-digit number was for Flavors in terms of their emerging market growth. It was a lower number for the Fragrance business. Fragrance had softness across both the developed and emerging markets.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Was emerging market Fragrance roughly flat or?","Kevin C. Berryman","Yes. It was actually both of them were under pressure.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And it largely was in the Ingredients side that caused that? Because again, Asia had pretty steep drop in Ingredients.","Kevin C. Berryman","Certainly, that was part of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of the raw material pressures you're seeing in Fragrances, if I were to take out Fragrance Ingredients, is the pressure less on the other 2 segments? And I'm just curious if most of the pressure is really just on this one little business.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","No, it's actually across the board that you're seeing. Impacting probably some categories more than some others, according to the portfolio and the mix of the Fragrances. And one thing that you have also to take into account is that the input costs in the Ingredients are then also flowing into our compound business. So you see the impact internally and you see it also from the portfolio of Ingredients we're buying directly on the outside.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","It does sound like you're getting some pricing -- when you think about the 280-basis-point margin decline year-over-year for Fragrances, how much of that comes back as pricing flows through in the second quarter? And do you sort of make it all up by the end of the year?","Kevin C. Berryman","Mike, this is Kevin. Our pricing initiatives continue to gain traction in the quarter so our effective pricing levels in Q1 are greater than what we saw in Q4. The combination of our continued hold on pricing and continued pricing actions, which then combined with a more moderate level of input costs increases over the balance of the year will translate into our gross margin profile starting to look more positive in Q2 and then continuing to improve over the course of the year.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one real quick one for Hernan. When you sort of look to the second quarter and beyond, your sales growth was very good in the first quarter. It sounds like it's going to be very good in the second, third and fourth. Will your earnings growth start to mirror that type of growth and maybe improve as the year unfolds?","Hernan Vaisman","Yes. As was explained by Kevin and Doug, I think that we now start seeing the positive inflection point. I think that the pricing policy that we applied together with the departure of low-margin business will improve our gross margin performance. So I could say that it's going to be better. The second half or even the second quarter will be better than today, the first quarter.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you all very much for your participation. We look forward to having a further conversation in 3 months time. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Shelley Young, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Shelley Young","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to IFF's third quarter conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our third quarter 2012 financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our website at iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay for up to 1 year on our website.","Before turning the call over to Doug Tough and our senior management team, I'd like to read our forward-looking statement. Please keep in mind that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the fourth quarter and full year 2012. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty.","For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our forward-looking statements and risk factors contained in today's 10-Q filing with the SEC, as well as our 2011 10-K filed on February 28, 2012, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website.","Some of today's prepared remarks will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today and on our website.","Now I'd like to introduce the participants on today's call. With me today is Doug Tough, our Chairman and CEO; Nicolas Mirzayantz, our President of Fragrances; Hernan Vaisman, our President of Flavors; and Kevin Berryman, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Tough.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Shelley, and good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Our focus on the call this morning is a review of our third quarter results and a short discussion on our outlook for the remainder of the year.","As a company with significant operations in New York and in New Jersey, we are very well aware of the impact that Hurricane Sandy has had on people in the area. Our thoughts and our prayers go out to everyone who was affected by this storm, including our own numerous employees in the region.","The solid growth we achieved this third quarter is due to the strategic priorities we have implemented over the past few years to deliver profitable growth, by improving the profitability of our product portfolio, strengthening our innovation platform and leveraging our geographic reach. You have heard us say many times that the diversity of our business model, in terms of geographies and use categories and customers, helps to provide us with stable results in good times and bad.","This quarter, we are seeing the cumulative effect of our strategy, combined with the diversity of our business model, resulting in solid momentum and strong growth in both Flavors and Fragrances even with ongoing economic uncertainty in many parts of the world. We are very pleased with our progress and encouraged by our results and believe we are on the right path.","Both our Flavors and Fragrances Compounds businesses delivered strong top line growth and margin recovery this quarter, and we saw strong contributions to overall profitability from both our businesses.","For the total company, we delivered top line local currency sales growth of 5%, which is the highest quarterly sales growth we have seen since the first quarter of 2011. On a like-for-like basis, which excludes the impact of the exit of low-margin sales activities, our local currency sales growth was, in fact, higher at 7%.","This quarter, we continued to execute on our plan to exit lower-margin sales activities in Flavors. We also saw a better mix of business, both in the developed and in the emerging markets.","As expected, we are seeing lower increases in raw material costs, although they remain at elevated levels and we continue to take pricing.  These factors, in addition to ongoing manufacturing efficiencies and other elements, such as product mix and new business wins, resulted in gross margin expansion of 350 basis points this quarter to 42.5%, up from 39% in the prior year quarter.","Our adjusted operating profit increased $6 million, or 5%, to $164 million -- $134 million in the third quarter compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2011. Also, our adjusted operating profit margins expanded 100 basis points this quarter to 18.9% compared with 17.9% in the year ago quarter.","In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.20 per share. The GAAP number includes an $0.88 charge arising from our settlement with the Spanish tax authorities earlier in the quarter. Excluding this charge as well as the $0.01 per share reversal of a restructuring charge in the prior year quarter, our adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.08. This quarter marks the second consecutive quarter in which we were able to deliver solid EPS growth on an adjusted basis despite the challenging economic environment. We are pleased with our performance this quarter and with the favorable trends we are seeing in both our top line and bottom line growth.","I will now turn the call over to Nicolas and Hernan, who will provide you with an update on the progress of our business units, and then to Kevin, our CFO, who will provide an overview of our financial performance. After their respective sections, I will give you some perspective on the outlook for the balance of the year. With that, I'd like to introduce Group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Thank you, Doug, and good morning and afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with our progress this quarter. We achieved solid results in many areas of the business, and overall trends are improving. Our ability to execute on our plan is illustrated by both our top line growth as well as our recovering profitability.","In terms of our sales performance, we saw accelerating growth in many areas of the business. Local currency sales growth for the Fragrance business was 5% in the third quarter. Fragrance Compounds grew by 9% in local currency, fueled by 10% growth in Fine & Beauty Care and 8% growth in Functional Fragrance. We attribute our success to the strength of our strategic relationships with our customers, our knowledge and insight into consumer preferences and our ability to provide superior product that meet customer needs.","I want to focus on some of the positive trends we are seeing, and there are many. Over the past 3 quarters, Fragrance Compound local currency sales growth has accelerated in every quarter. We grew from the 1% decline in the first quarter to a 6% increase in the second quarter to a 9% increase in the third quarter. This growth in Fragrance Compounds was led by 17% growth in Latin America, 8% growth in North America and 7% growth in EAME. We are very encouraged by the results that we're seeing. In terms of drivers, Fragrances' growth this quarter was driven by a strong pipeline of new wins, continued pricing and lower volume declines on existing business.","On a category basis, Fine & Beauty Care achieved 10% local currency sales growth, led by strong performance in Fine Fragrance and Toiletries. This quarter, new launches in Fine Fragrance included La Vie Est Belle from Lancome; Balenciaga's Florabotanica; Yves Saint Laurent's Manifesto; Taylor Swift by Elizabeth Arden and Donna Karan WOMAN by Est\u00e9e Lauder. These are just a sampling of the high-profile launches in Fine Fragrance.","Toiletries also performed very well, reflecting major wins with global brands, led by strength in Latin America and EAME.","Functional Fragrance local currency growth of 8% marked the 17th consecutive quarter of positive sales growth in this category. The solid growth was driven by continued strong momentum in Fabric Care and double-digit growth in Personal Wash.","Growth in both end-use categories was driven by strong growth in Latin America and North America, as well as growth in Greater Asia. The growth was also supported by increased sales using our proprietary encapsulation technology.","Given the strong growth we are seeing in the emerging markets, we are adding manufacturing capacity and sales and creative infrastructure to support our growing emerging market footprint. In early September, we announced and celebrated the opening of a new state-of-the-art liquid Fragrances and Flavors manufacturing plant in Jurong, Singapore. This is part of the $100 million investment in Greater Asia and replaces an existing facility.","Turning to Ingredients. As expected, local currency sales declined by 12% due to continued volume losses in commodity products. As we've been communicating, we remain focused on finding ways to revise our participation strategy in Fragrance Ingredients given the new realities of the market and the competitive dynamics. Although year-over-year trends are improving, we expect to see a moderate year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter.","To offset the impact of high raw material costs on our customers, we have been proactively working with some of them to change their product formulas. Due to our vertical integration and expertise, we're able to work with them to find more sustainable alternatives. As a result, we expect to see some volumes transfer from our Fragrance Ingredient business to our Fragrance Compound business beginning next year. This volume transition supports our customers and IFF Compound business, creating a win-win situation. We will provide more insight early next year on the expected top line impacts, which are not expected to be material on a consolidated basis.","As you probably are aware, we report on only the external portion of our Ingredient business, which is roughly 50% of the total Ingredient business. The remaining volume is comprised of internal supply, which are ingredients that we make and use in our Compounds plants. This part of the business continues to grow as we use more IFF ingredients in our internal creations and new wins, and this increased volume is reducing the pressure on absorbing the fixed cost of our Ingredient plants.","Although we achieved local currency sales growth of 5%, our reported net sales declined 1% due to the weakness of the euro and other currencies related to the U.S. dollar versus a year ago. Strong operational performance allowed the Fragrance business to more than offset this foreign exchange pressure, resulting in an 11%, or $7 million, increase in Fragrance segment profit to $65.3 million in the third quarter.","Our continued focus on cost savings initiatives and financial discipline, combined with an improved mix of business and continued pricing to offset higher raw material costs, enabled us to achieve margin recovery this quarter. Fragrance segment operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 17.7%, up from 15.7% a year ago.","Fragrance gross margin recovery supported gross margin expansion at the consolidated level. It should be noted, however, that on a year-to-date basis, margins continue to be pressured by increased input costs, which remain at or near historical highs. To offset this dynamic, we continue to focus on cost savings initiatives, including our Q4 2011 restructuring program, and maintaining a disciplined approach toward cost management.","In the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued momentum in our Fragrance Compound business in both Fine & Beauty Care and Functional Fragrance, supported by growth in every region. We are encouraged by the pipeline of new business wins in our Fine & Beauty Care and Functional categories, as well as the continued traction with our proprietary encapsulation technology.","We continue to closely monitor Ingredient volume trends and believe that we will see improved volume trends in the fourth quarter, although still negative.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Hernan Vaisman, our President of Flavors.","Hernan Vaisman","Thank you, Nicolas. Good morning and good afternoon. This is our 27th consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth. On a like-for-like basis, over the last 3 quarters, we have delivered local currency sales growth of 6%, 9% and 9% on top of the 9% growth for the third quarter of last year.","We are proud of the -- our results and our ability to consistently deliver strong growth metrics.","This quarter, as expected, the exit of low-margin sales activities accelerated, which had a 3-percentage-point impact on Flavor sales growth, but a favorable impact on segment and company margins.","Once again, we delivered strong growth in every region and every category. Our growth was led by a strong pipeline of new business wins in Beverage and Dairy, both of which achieved double-digit growth. On a like-for-like basis, Savory and Sweet also delivered solid growth in this quarter.","Our results were supported by 10% growth in the emerging markets. Our like-for-like growth in North America was 6%. Beverage and Dairy were once again the 2 best-performing categories and delivered double-digit growth. We also saw solid growth contributions from Savory and Sweet, owing in part to our savory and sweetness modulation tools.","On a like-for-like basis, our EAME region delivered local currency sales growth of 13% led by strong growth in Dairy. EAME was our best-performing region this quarter. Western Europe continued to deliver solid performance with a strong volume growth from wins offsetting volumes declining on existing business. In addition, we are also delivering strong growth in the emerging market of Africa and the Middle East. Greater Asia, our largest region, delivered strong 8% local currency growth. On a like-for-like basis, Greater Asia grew at 9%. This growth was led by double-digit growth in Dairy and high single-digit growth in Beverage, Savory and Sweet. In Latin America, local currency growth on a like-for-like basis was 6%, led by double-digit growth in Savory and positive growth in Dairy and Beverage. Although we have made progress in this region, we continue to work with the customer to improve our sales momentum in Latin America.","Due to our continued growth, we are making additional investment in the business to support our future growth. As Nicholas mentioned, in September, we opened a new plant in Singapore that manufactures both flavors and fragrances. We are also beginning a new manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, China, which will be exclusively focused on Flavors. This plant is expected to open in the first quarter of 2013. Both the Singapore and China plants are essential to aligning our infrastructure to support our projected capacity requirements in Greater Asia.","Last month, we announced our plans to invest over $50 million in Gebze, Turkey to expand on our existing manufacturing site and build a new leading-edge creative facility. Turkey offers an unparalleled strategic hub into the fast-growing emerging market in the region that will allow us to significantly increase and differentiate our value proposition to our customers. We expect to invest significantly in our Flavors creative and manufacturing capabilities in Turkey, which will provide additional support to key emerging markets.","This quarter, although our Flavors business achieved local currency sales growth of 6% on a reported basis, our net sales were flat due to the weakness of other currencies versus the U.S. dollars versus the year-ago quarter. Importantly, operating performance in our Flavor business more than offset these foreign exchange pressures.","Our gross margin recovery at the segment level supported gross margin expansion at the consolidated level due to volume gains for new business, the accelerated exit of lower-margin sales activities and more favorable category mix, which more than offset higher input costs and investment to support growth initiatives, resulting in 150-basis-point increase in our segment operating margin to 22.4%. This translated into a Flavors third quarter segment profit increase of $5 million, or 7%, to $76.1 million. We continue to make investment in Research & Development to support the future growth of the business and provide our customers with the leading-edge technology and product quality that they expect from us.","Looking ahead, we expect to see continued sales momentum in the fourth quarter of 2012 led by strong growth in the emerging markets, offset in part by the accelerated exit of low-margin sales activities.","Our consistent underlying sales growth remained strong, driven by new business wins using our sweetness and savory modulation tools to make our customers' end products healthier. We are excited about our future growth prospect.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman, our CFO.","Kevin C. Berryman","Thank you, Hernan, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to put our financial performance into context since it is a direct result of the actions we've taken to improve the profitability of our portfolio, harness the growth of the emerging markets and create innovative and appealing new products that will help our customers to win new business and obtain market share growth.","Reported revenues for the third quarter totaled $709 million. Although sales decreased on a reported basis, on a local currency basis, they increased 5%.","The 600-basis-point foreign currency impact reflects the strong U.S. dollar relative to other currencies versus the year-ago quarter.","On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of the exit of lower-margin sales activities, our local currency sales growth was 7%, reflecting strong growth in both businesses, across geographies and categories. Approximately 70% of this growth was volume related with a balanced pricing.","As you've heard from Hernan, Flavors continued their steady cadence of positive growth, which speaks to the consistency and stability of the Flavors business. This quarter, Flavors delivered 6% local currency growth. And excluding the impact of the exit of lower-margin sales activities, they delivered growth of 9%.","Our Fragrance business delivered overall local currency sales growth of 5%, reflecting strong underlying trends in many areas of the business. Importantly, Fragrance Compounds delivered local currency sales growth of 9% and increased segment profitability, reflecting cost savings initiatives, improved category mix and the net impact of increased prices and lower increases in raw material costs.","Overall, our strategic priority of leveraging the growth in the emerging markets is producing favorable results. We're seeing continued double-digit local currency sales growth in the emerging markets, which has made significant contributions to the top line of both businesses, with a growing global middle class and the desire for, and availability of, products that consumers use in their everyday lives. We are very encouraged by the growth we are seeing and have made targeted investments in various areas of the globe in order to be able to continue to participate in this growth for the foreseeable future.","As we have mentioned in the past, we operate in a global environment that has seen varying degrees of economic momentum. Over the course of the year, we've spoken about slowing economic growth in Western Europe and China, and we've been closely monitoring our progress in both regions. This quarter, on a consolidated level, we saw improving trends in Western Europe driven by our Flavors business. But we continue to see some softness in Fragrances driven by Fragrance Ingredients. Both Flavors and Fragrances showed solid growth in China.","From a top line perspective, we are pleased with our underlying growth, which led to increased margin recovery and profitability. Our gross margins expanded to 350 basis points that has been alluded to previously, to 42.5%. The improvement was primarily due to an improved mix of business in both Flavors and Fragrances, increased volume from both businesses, the exit of lower-margin sales activities in Flavors and ongoing manufacturing efficiencies. These gains, along with pricing actions, more than offset increased raw material costs.","Research, selling and administrative costs increased 11% or $17 million this quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased incentive compensation accruals this quarter versus the year-ago quarter, when provisions were lower than target. In addition, we also had increased pension costs and investments behind growth initiatives. Importantly, our strong gross margin recovery more than offset these increased RSA expenses, resulting in a $6 million or 5% increase in adjusted operating profit to $134 million.","Interest expense declined $400,000 in the quarter, reflecting lower levels of outstanding debt. And other expenses decreased $3.4 million year-over-year due to gains associated with the company's deferred compensation plan assets.","As we've explained, this quarter, we took a $72.4 million charge, or $0.88 per share, to net income, arising from our Spanish tax settlement that we announced on August 2. Excluding the impact of this charge, our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2012 was 27.2% versus 26.9% in the year-ago quarter. The 30-basis-point increase primarily reflects the absence of an R&D tax credit in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2012.","Adjusted EPS increased 8% to $1.08, up from $1 in the third quarter of 2011, excluding the reversal of a restructuring charge of $0.01 per share in the prior year quarter.","I would like to comment briefly on the top line trends we are seeing in our business. On a total company basis, our local currency sales growth has increased every quarter: from 1% in the first quarter to 4% in the second, to 5% this quarter. These trends are more pronounced if we exclude the impact of the exit of lower-margin sales activities, which has been putting incremental pressure on our top line growth. On a like-for-like basis, our growth increased from 1% and 5% in Q1 and Q2 to 7% in Q3. We assume the industry continues to grow at 2% to 3% overall. On a like-for-like basis, our year-to-date growth is 4%.","Looking at the business units, Flavors has shown consistent growth every quarter with 5% growth in the first quarter followed by 8% in the second and 6% in the third quarter. However, excluding the impact of the exit of low-margin business, the like-for-like sales growth has increased from 6% to 9% and 9% in the first 3 quarters of the year.  On a year-to-date basis, they have achieved 8% like-for-like growth.","Nicolas spoke of Fragrance Compounds' accelerating growth. The third quarter was a robust quarter for Fragrance Compounds, and growth has improved every quarter this year to 9% in the third quarter, resulting in a 5% growth year-to-date. All areas of the Compound business are showing continued momentum.  The only area that remains challenged is the external portion of our Fragrance Ingredients business. However, the strength of the rest of the portfolio is more than offsetting this weakness.","Overall, we are seeing better momentum in the business. While we are cautiously optimistic, trends are improving, and underlying volumes remain strong.","I'd like to provide you with an update of our raw material costs. Although they are still increasing, they are increasing at a lower rate, as we expected. Compared to the prior year quarter, raw material costs increased 2%. That said, the third quarter of last year was the highest increase of last year at 13%. So even though raw material costs only increased by 2% this quarter, on a 2-year basis, they are up 15%, which has continued to pressure our margins.","Year-over-year pricing benefits this quarter, while reduced versus previous quarters, have helped to somewhat reduce the margin pressure, while raw material costs remain as a significant headwind on a year-to-date basis.","Our continued margin recovery this quarter reflects strong innovations, improved product mix, cost savings initiatives and the exit of lower-margin sales activities in Flavors. As we mentioned last quarter, we believe we have reached an inflection point in our gross margins, and we are seeing this play out.","From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA expense as a percent of sales increased 250 basis points this quarter to 23.6%, up from 21.1% of sales last year. The year-over-year change primarily reflects increased incentive compensation accruals in the third quarter of 2012 versus the third quarter of 2011. As you may recall, last year's RSA spend was favorably impacted by lower incentive compensation accruals due to the challenging economic environment. The level of incentive compensation we are now accruing for this year reflects our improved performance versus expectations and is more consistent with normalized levels of incentive compensation provisions. Other cost increases reflect continued R&D spend on innovation and on commercial activities and other customer-facing activities to support our growth in the emerging markets. Finally, we also incurred higher pension costs and increased our provision adjustments for allowance for doubtful accounts.","The dollar remained stronger versus the euro in the third quarter versus a year ago. And as a result, foreign exchange, as we have discussed, had an approximate 600-basis-point impact on the top line. However, there was limited impact on the third quarter year-over-year operating profit margin, largely due to our cash flow hedging activities. These activities, combined with our other operating improvements, more than offset the negative impact of foreign exchange.","Looking ahead to the balance of the year, over 70% of our euro-dollar exposure in 2012 remains hedged at the rate near $1.39. With current rates at around $1.28, the euro had strengthened versus where it was in the third quarter. We therefore expect that any headwinds from foreign exchange in the fourth quarter will be negligible. For 2013, we are nearly 70% hedged against the euro at levels that approximate $1.29.","From a cash flow perspective, for the first 9 months of the year, cash flows from operations were $143 million, or 6.7% of sales, compared with $117 million for the first 9 months of 2011. Importantly, the cash flow in 2012 includes a cash payment of $105.5 million this quarter related to the Spanish tax settlement and a $240 million -- $248 million cash inflow from ongoing operations.","This increased cash flow from ongoing operations in 2012 reflects the impact of lower year-over-year incentive compensation and income tax payments in 2012 versus 2011, as well as an improved earnings position.","As anticipated, capital expenditures are increasing, in line with our guidance, due to the investments we've made in Singapore and China. And we expect capital spending to approach 5% of sales for the full year 2012. The Singapore plant, which opened in early September, manufactures both Flavors and Fragrances liquid compounds. The Guangzhou, China plant will open early next year and will be exclusively Flavors focused.","And as noted by Hernan, in addition, last month, we announced a $50 million-plus investment in expanding Flavors' manufacturing facility and building a creative center in Gebze, Turkey.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year.","Douglas D. Tough","Thank you, Nicolas, Hernan, and Kevin. We are pleased with the progress we've made over the past few quarters. The diverse and stable nature of our business, combined with our customer intimacy and consumer insights, enabled us to deliver strong results in a challenged environment.","Although we are mindful of economic volatility in various parts of the world, we are confident that, based on our diversification, we will be able to offset softness in one part of our business with strengths in another part of the business world.","The accelerated momentum we see in the Flavor and Fragrance Compounds business is fueled by the strategic investments we have made in the emerging markets over many years, combined with our ability to provide customers with products that meet and surpass consumer expectation and lead to market share growth for both our customers and for us.","We are committed to driving the business for the long term and executing on our growth plans.","IFF's operations were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, resulting in short-term disruptions in power, manufacturing and in our information technology systems. I am pleased to say that most of these disruptions have now been resolved due to the rapid reaction of our employees in implementing our disaster recovery plans. We are currently in the process of estimating the impact of the storm on our business. We do not expect it to have a material impact on our fourth quarter financial results.","For the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued strong local currency sales growth in Flavors, offset in part by the continued acceleration and exit of low-margin sales activities. In Fragrances, we expect momentum to continue in Fine & Beauty Care, while also maintaining solid growth in Functional. We expect to see improving volume trends in Ingredients business in the fourth quarter, although we still expect year-over-year moderate volume declines.","With regard to margin trends, we expect that raw material costs will continue to stabilize at the current rates, which, as Kevin has pointed out, when combined with last year's trends still results in historically high levels of input costs. Given our progress on a number of initiatives, we expect our gross margins will continue to trend above year-ago levels.","We have a committed and dedicated group of people whose mission is to see the company succeed. We are pushing ahead to meet our internal profit objectives despite the headwinds mentioned. Excluding the costs related to the impact of the hurricane, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be in line with current market consensus for the fourth quarter.","In conclusion, our strong performance at IFF this quarter is a result of our geographic footprint, our product diversity and our ability to work with our customers year in and year out to develop new products that help shape the industry and delight consumers.","Going forward, we expect continued momentum and growth. We will continue to proactively manage our performance and calibrate costs in line with our top line growth as we continue to execute against our business plans.","With that, we would be happy to take any questions you may have. Thank you for your participation.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess first question, Kevin, just housekeeping. 2013 input costs, if you could give us an update there, that'd be helpful. And then second question, you commented in the press release that the new facility in Singapore replaces an existing plant in the same area. Could you talk maybe more broadly about an opportunity for more of the same happening, meaning this year, spending 5% of sales on CapEx this year, next year, last year, and so new facilities are coming. I understand some of that is for demand. But also, new facilities are probably more efficient than existing facilities. So what is the opportunity longer term to do a better job of getting efficiencies and costs out of some of these new facilities coming online?","Kevin C. Berryman","Okay, Mark, nice to hear from you. Look, I think that it is a little bit early for us to discuss what's been -- or what our expectations are for 2013 input costs. I think we've said in the past that we don't consider there to be a great level of variability as we look forward into 2013. And I'll leave it at that at this particular point in time. But certainly, it's a much more stable environment than we've seen in the past. So I'll leave it at that at this particular point in time. In terms of the investments in our factories, clearly these are investments that are capacity oriented and supporting our future growth initiatives largely in Greater Asia. The recent Turkey announcement is supporting other parts of the emerging market portfolio that we have. But clearly, they're about increasing our capacities. There are efficiencies embedded into those plants. But at the same token, there will be some incremental depreciation that we have at this particular point in time as well. Having said all of that, we will continue to try and drive incremental efficiencies into our business. And as you see through the initiatives that we have in recognizing the third quarter gross margin progression, it's a wide swath of efforts, including some pricing but also new wins, good margins on those new wins and working on price and cost efficiencies with our factories. And that will continue to be a focus as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Aaron with RBC Capital.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And so I wanted to clarify your comments in your prepared remarks about what sounds like an expected volume transfer from Fragrance Ingredients into Compounds. Are you essentially saying that you've been able to kind of negotiate to transition some of your external ingredients supply into kind of sales of higher value-added compounds? And then if that's the case, were you able to do that without making a trade-off on your Compounds margins?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","It's Nicolas. What we did is that we really built upon our vertical integration in some parts of our portfolio and unique expertise to be able to provide solutions to our customers and build upon that expertise to go from a single ingredient to really a creation. And this is really creating a win-win situation for both our customers and really eliminating some of the volatility in the feedstock of the ingredients. So we're providing a more stable solution, which is providing stability to the brand of our customers.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just a follow-up. Kevin, I think relative to most Street estimates, your gross margin this quarter came in better, and the RSA expenses were a little bit higher to offset that. Was that the case versus your internal expectation as well kind of coming into the quarter? I'm just trying to kind of better understand this. Maybe you had more flexibility than you expected to have to spend back against the business in Q3.","Kevin C. Berryman","I would say that the results are pretty much in line with kind of what our expectations were at. And I think that, as we've talked about, we will continue to evaluate investments in customer-facing initiatives and innovation long term, and in the short term when we think those opportunities are warranted and value enhancing. We certainly did some of that in the third quarter, and that will continue to be the case as we see opportunities and continued margin progression and growth at the top line.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Silke Kueck for Jeff. In -- so it looks like your sales performance on a year-over-year basis was lower due to currencies. So maybe you lost $5 million in sales year-over-year. And your gross profits moved up quite significantly. And what you indicated is that your raw material costs are still up 2%, but you also got about 2% pricing. So you probably more than offset all of your raw material costs but, it seems also, other cost benefits that you're picking up. So I wanted to just see like what's the benefit of restructuring savings and other cost efficiencies may have been to your gross margin line, if you can quantify it. And secondly, I also have a question regarding -- just I wanted to get an update as to what has been done on the Ingredients side to better match the costs with the lower sales base of the business.","Kevin C. Berryman","Sure, Silke. Let me take a stab and then I'll turn it over to any my colleagues who want to add any additional color. I think that again, as outlined in the prepared comments and some earlier comments, there was a wide swath of things that were driving our gross margin. While certainly, pricing helped to offset the incremental input costs that we talked about, it really wasn't the primary driver. The net pricing versus input costs was not the driver to our margins. Volume and mix certainly was a key determinant of that, and that certainly helped provide a big chunk of the benefits. And I think also, the cost savings initiatives were also important, and that is just the blocking and tackling of running the business where we saw some good progress again in Fragrance, where they were able to reduce some costs in their business. Hernan and their team, obviously, have been managing through the exit of some of the lower margin, and that benefit approached 50 basis points for the company as well. So there certainly was a wide range of issues that were executed, or opportunities that were executed against, which allowed us to deliver the strong margin profile. So it just wasn't about the pricing even though that continued to be an important element to help reduce some of the pressure from input costs.","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Silke, it's Nicolas. Regarding Ingredients, as we have been saying in the past, I mean, following the strategic review of the portfolio, we concluded that the Ingredients business was and still continue to be of strategic and financial importance to us, and the #1 priority of the business is to provide cost-advantage ingredients to our Compound business. And that's why we're really driving higher consumption of IFF ingredients in our new wins, in our creation, in order to have a better absorption. It is also fair to say that the Ingredient part of our business has been probably one of the most efficient in terms of manufacturing. So we're constantly looking at opportunities to reduce costs and to bring it in line with some of the challenge. But we'll also continue to develop solution and -- that we will be sharing with the Board as we move forward and develop alternatives to adapt to our costs, to the new reality of the market. One thing that I wanted to add and I want to make sure also following the question from Edward, is that with the transfer of some of the Ingredients into Compounds, we will see a lower Ingredients top line sales in the future in 2013 as we're migrating business from Ingredients to Compounds.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research Group.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I have a question on the Flavors business. How much of the business now is in products where customers have either a health label or an all-natural label?","Hernan Vaisman","It's Hernan speaking. We don't have available this information. But what we can say, that we -- we've seen a, I would say, material growth on these health and wellness trends. So while I cannot be precise, I could say that it's really gaining territory in almost all parts of the world.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Well, I asked that question because the developed markets growth continues to be quite good. And I would assume it's a big factor in the developed markets?","Hernan Vaisman","Definitely. In developed markets, it's one of the key factors. I mean, not only the health and wellness but also naturals are the key drivers. And since we have, I would say, very suitable tools, it's helping us to grow the business there.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","But would it be maybe 1\/3 of the developed market Flavors applications?","Hernan Vaisman","I could not say at this point in time 1\/3 because I don't have this information. But I think that they're growing very fast and, at one point in time, probably will get there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And Nicolas, in terms of new launches in Fine & Beauty, you talked about that and I was impressed with the recovery in growth there. Does that suggest that Fine & Beauty should show pretty steady organic sales growth for the next several quarters? And then one for Doug. In terms of the $50 million in EBIT that you can get for product rationalization, can you give us an update roughly where you're at on that through year end?","Nicolas Mirzayantz","Mike, regarding Fine, as you mentioned, we have a good momentum and a good string of new wins that have already been launched or are in the pipe. As we all know, one of the most critical seasons for our customers is the one in which we're entering right now until Christmas. So I believe that the Christmas season will be driving a lot of the market trends. And from that, we will be able to project our performance. So I think it's too early in the season. What is important is that where we participate, we have a strong momentum, and we've been able to secure and to win significant new launches.","Douglas D. Tough","We pick up the next part of your question going -- and it's really flowing out of the Investor Day discussion. And while we haven't disclosed the number, I'll take you through the 3 planks that we had then and we have now. And it's been an interesting evolution. That maximization of the portfolio is both -- that's really where the concept flowed from. It was to really focus as much on growing where we could. And you can see in both the Fine discussion Nicolas has had and some of the categories that Hernan discussed, we've got some priority categories, and they're broadly doing well and contributing to that goal. The third plank was that if we couldn't fix things, we would exit businesses. And that was -- there was a little bit of that in Fragrances in previous quarters. The focus really for the company in the last few quarters has been on Flavors. And Hernan touched upon that, and Kevin has just mentioned the benefit of margin we get from exiting. Exiting was a last resort. But nevertheless, you can see the company's positive traction in margin recovery from having exited the business and still having some good top line growth. The second plank, and really the most interesting one and where we've candidly been treading water, and while that's disappointing in the absolute, I think the particulars around the facts are important. But treading water was really around some categories in Functional Fragrance in the Fragrance businesses. And the treading water was the identification of the need to fix some businesses. And candidly, the team have really taken some excellent actions to move the progress ahead, but we have been hit by significant raw material cost increases over the last couple of years. So it's a function of taking some pricing with customers, revising some formulas, doing some things we inside the company call \"some value creation,\" which is streamlining the business. We've done a number of things, all of which have been positive in terms of margin recovery, but they've been offset by the, if you will, the tsunami of the raw material cost increases in the last couple of years. So since that meeting, we've probably made very little traction despite some really strong actions. But if this grow-the-categories, we're still doing that, we will exit some low margin. But that fixed Functional, we've made some -- little progress. We've still got more to do, but it's been a great experience. And had we not, frankly, been able to engender some of the successes I just talked about in the light of the cost increases, the margin would have been extremely negative.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erik Sjogren from Morgan Stanley.","Erik Sjogren - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, [indiscernible], it's Erik Sjogren at Morgan Stanley. The only question remaining for me is really on the Flavors business. I mean, a 3% impact from the portfolio rationalization in the third quarter, is this a run rate now? Or are you adding significantly more to the products you're considering here for the next couple of quarters going forward?","Hernan Vaisman","It's Hernan. So this is the run rate. I mean, just to give more -- I mean, Flavors some more information, this is -- what you've seen this quarter is what we expect to have in the next few quarters. So in other words, after, I mean, the second half -- or in the second half of the next year, we will not see any more business discontinued. Of course, we are always reviewing our portfolio, but I would say that we can say that we are largely done by half of next year.","Operator","And there are no further questions. Do you have closing remarks?","Douglas D. Tough","Yes. Thanks. I'd like to thank all the participants on the call for their support today. Particularly with the federal election, there's many potential distractions for all of us. For those IFF employees on the call, I would like to reiterate my thanks and appreciation for all you've done during the last week in keeping the business going strongly. And for all the people on the call, we look forward to our Q4 and final year results, which we expect to be positive. Thank you for your participation today. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's International Flavors & Fragrance conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
