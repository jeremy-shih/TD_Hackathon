At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After speaker's presentation, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andrew Crum, Senior Associate Realty Income. You may begin.","Andrew Crum","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter 2019 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from any of the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO Sumit Roy.","Sumit Roy","Thanks, Andrew. Welcome everyone. We are pleased to complete another solid quarter. We remain on track for a very strong 2019 and are well positioned as we look towards 2020 with a robust investment pipeline and strong liquidity. During the quarter, we invested approximately $412 million in high-quality real estate at investment spreads well above our historical average which brings us to approximately $2 billion invested as we enter the fourth quarter.","Our investment activity during the quarter included our second international acquisition in the U.K. Additionally, our investments during the quarter were 51% industrial by rent with approximately $234 million invested through three separate transactions with three new investment grade-rated tenants including our first-ever distribution facility leased to a large e-commerce retailer.","Including the previously announced portfolio acquisition from CIM Real Estate Finance Trust we have announced over $3 billion in acquisitions year-to-date. As a reminder, the CIM transaction is expected to close in various tranches with the acquisition of most of the properties in the portfolio expected to close in 2019. To fund our activity we raised $572 million in equity capital during the quarter ending the quarter with $236 million of cash on hand and positioning our balance sheet favorably for the remainder of the year and as we look towards 2020.","Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end our properties were leased to 274 commercial tenants in 49 different industries located in 49 states Puerto Rico and the U.K. 82.7% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at nearly 12% of rental revenue.","Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.7% of rental revenue. Convenience store remains our largest industry at 11.6% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and\/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments.","These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants.","The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail portfolio is 2.8 times on a four-wall basis while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list at 1.7% of rent is relatively consistent with our levels of the last few years. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3% flat versus the prior quarter. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2019.","During the quarter, we re-leased 29 properties recapturing 101.5% of the expiring rent. Year-to-date we have re-leased 186 properties recapturing 102.1% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,100 properties with leases expiring recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1.2% during the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. Our projected run rate for 2019 continues to be approximately 1%. Approximately 86% of our leases have contractual rent increases.","Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Paul Meurer","Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of revenue excluding reimbursements was 4.6% for the quarter and 4.8% year-to-date both of which were below the comparable year ago periods. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we expect our G&A margin to remain below 5% in 2019.","Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursements was 1.3% for the quarter and year-to-date periods, which is better than our full year expectation in the 1.5% to 1.75% range. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.83 per share for the quarter, which represents a 2.5% increase.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and we remain one of only a few REITs with at least two A ratings. As Sumit mentioned, during the third quarter, we raised approximately $572 million of common equity almost entirely through our ATM program. Use of proceeds were repaid borrowings on our line of credit and to pre-fund an active acquisition pipeline, including of course the large CIM portfolio acquisition.","We finished the quarter with nothing outstanding on our $3 billion line of credit and approximately $236 million of cash on hand. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.0 times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7 times. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, as the weighted average maturity of our bonds is 8.5 years and we have only $1.2 million of debt coming due in the remainder of 2019. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter with just over $300 million of debt maturing in both 2020 and 2021. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and excellent liquidity.","Now let me turn the call back over to Sumit.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, Paul. During the third quarter of 2019, we invested approximately $412 million in 51 properties located in 23 states in the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.7% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years.","On a total revenue basis approximately 56% of total acquisitions are from investment grade-rated tenants. 49% of the revenues are generated from retail and 51% are generated from industrial. The weighted average initial cash cap rate on industrial acquisitions during the quarter was in the low 5% range, while the weighted average cap rate on retail acquisitions was in the mid 6% range.","These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are general merchandise, food processing and childcare. We closed 15 discrete transactions in the third quarter and approximately 23% of the third quarter investment volume were sale-leaseback transactions.","Of the $412 million invested during the quarter, $384 million was invested domestically in 50 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.1 years. During the quarter, $27.6 million was invested internationally in one property located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 4.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 20.6 years.","Year-to-date 2019, we invested $2 billion in 241 properties, located in 38 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.5 years. On a revenue basis, 25% of total acquisitions are from investment grade-rated tenants. 90% of the revenues are generated from retail and 10% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 45 different tenants in 19 industries.","Of the 60 independent transactions closed year-to-date, six transactions were above $50 million. Approximately 65% of our year-to-date investment for volume was sale-leaseback transactions. Of the $2 billion invested year-to-date, nearly $1.5 billion was invested domestically in 228 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.7 years.","Year-to-date approximately $577 million has been invested internationally in 13 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15 years. Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $15 billion in the third quarter. Of the $15 billion sourced during the quarter, $9 billion were domestic opportunities and $6 billion were international opportunities.","Investment-grade opportunities represented 33% of the volume sourced for the third quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the third quarter, 31% were portfolios and 69% or approximately $10.4 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date 2019, we have sourced $45.4 billion in potential transaction opportunities, which marks the highest annual volume sourced in our company's history. Of these opportunities, $35.6 billion were domestic opportunities and $9.9 billion were international opportunities. This continues to confirm our belief that our investment -- international investment pipeline is truly incremental to our domestic business.","Of the $45.4 billion sourced year-to-date, 38% were portfolios and 62% or approximately $28.2 billion were one-off assets. Of the $412 million in total acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 84% were one-off transactions. As to pricing cap rates in the U.S. were essentially unchanged in the third quarter.","Investment-grade properties are trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties are trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Regarding cap rates in the United Kingdom for the types of assets we are targeting, investment-grade or implied investment-grade properties are trading from the low 4% to high 5% cap rate range. Non-investment-grade properties are trading from mid-4% to low 7% cap rate range.","Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter averaging approximately 198 basis points for domestic investments and 188 basis points for international investments both of which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.","Our investment pipeline remains robust and we believe we are the only publicly traded net lease company that has the size, scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. We were pleased to announce a diversified portfolio acquisition from CIM Real Estate Finance Trust for approximately $1.25 billion during the quarter, which further demonstrates the advantages of size and scale in the net lease industry. We continue to expect 2019 acquisition guideline -- guidance of $3.25 billion to $3.5 billion.","Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter we sold 27 properties for net proceeds of $21.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.4% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.6%. This brings us to 63 properties sold year-to-date for $71.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.1%. We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of nonstrategic assets recycling the sales proceeds into properties that better fit our investment parameters. We continue to expect between $75 million and $100 million of dispositions in 2019.","In September, we increased the dividend for the 103rd time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents an approximately 3% increase over the year ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 82.2% based on the midpoint of 2019 AFFO guidance. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.5%.","We are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. To wrap it up, we completed another strong quarter and are very well-positioned as we look towards 2020. Our portfolio continues to perform well, our investment pipeline remains healthy and we are conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to pursue additional growth initiatives.","At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. ","Christy McElroy","Hi. Thanks, guys. Just following up on your comments on the industrial acquisitions in Q3. How much of the volume of the industrial deals was the large e-commerce retailer that you referred to? And what was the difference in cap rate on that deal versus the other industrial deals?","Sumit Roy","That's represented approximately 40% of the overall investments in industrial. And the cap rates in all three assets were fairly close to each other. They were right around slightly north of 5%.","Christy McElroy","Is there more to do with this or other large e-commerce retailers? And how do you think about that, sort of, investment relative to your -- historically what you've done in industrial and kind of relative to what you do in retail?","Sumit Roy","Look, we've always said that there are two asset types that we are very focused on retail obviously being the bread and butter and the preponderance of what we do and that will always be the case. But industrial continues to be an asset type that we are very attracted to. There are points in time where we can make investments in very high-quality tenants with growth rates embedded in these leases that are well above what we have in our overall portfolio with very long-term leases. And that is a very attractive proposition for us, especially, when we can finance it and capture spreads right around our long-term averages, which is precisely what we were able to accomplish this particular quarter. So we were very happy with the ability to transact, especially on these three assets and -- with some of the provisions that I've shared with you it made it that much more attractive.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then just lastly on the funding for the CIM acquisition and other, sort of, incremental deal volume in Q4. We could see where you're at Q3. And from a funding perspective you closed on an additional billion or you closed on that first billion tranche from CIM after Q3. And where are you, sort of, in your funding you've got a cash balance and then you've got your line of credit. Is your intention to do another bond deal near term? And any, sort of, incremental ATM issuance that you plan for Q4?","Sumit Roy","The beauty of our balance sheet today Christy is that we can pretty much access a variety of capital some of which we obviously pre-funded through the ATM in the third quarter. But having a leverage debt-to-EBITDA of 5.0 at the end of the third quarter gives us the ability to certainly access the unsecured market or the equity market given where we trade. So I don't want to share with you precisely what our financing plans are, but -- because we are analyzing it, looking at it on a day-in day-out basis, but it will be a combination of that along with some of the dispositions and the free cash flow from operations that we are going to be generating.","Christy McElroy","Okay. Thanks so much for the time.","Sumit Roy","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shivani Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","Shivani Sood","Hey, good afternoon. Just on the disposition side, it looks like you guys have cycled the fair amounts of vacant boxes. So just curious if that was driven by something specific or just trying to take advantage of the very competitive private markets right now.","Sumit Roy","Thanks for the question, Shivani. I'm glad you've brought up this thing about vacant assets and why we -- why there was such a preponderance of vacant asset sales. It is not by design that we decided on this particular quarter to have more vacant asset sales. The advantage of being a net lease company is that we are able to look at every asset, freestanding asset and make a determination as to what is the best economic outcome.","Holding on to a vacant asset and incurring some of the carrying costs is justifiable, if our belief is that we can get a tenant that is willing to pay rents that justify the carrying costs and the overall return profile is superior to what we are able to get when we sell a vacant asset in the open market.","And if that equation sort of does not yield that holding on to an asset is warranted, we go to the market and we sell it at a price and that's precisely what we did this particular quarter. But I wouldn't read one way or the other in terms of whether we are going to do more vacant asset sales going forward versus not.","This is a decision that our asset management team is involved in on a day-in day-out basis, where they are constantly determining what is the right strategy for a given asset. And it just so happens that in this particular quarter we had quite a few vacant asset sales.","Shivani Sood","Thanks for the color. It's really helpful. And then just wondering, if you can give us an update on your thoughts on just development as a component of the overall investment pipeline just given the higher relative yields, excuse me. Should we expect that -- to see that continue to increase if we stay in a lower for longer interest rate environment?","Sumit Roy","Shivani, that's a very good question. Once again, our development program has been anywhere between call it $35 million $36 million, which it is today, to as high as $150 million. And that continues to be an area that we are focused on. To the point that you've made regarding higher yield that is part of what the asset management team does.","When we get an asset back, we are constantly thinking about -- one of the options that we explore is to see whether we can reposition those particular assets. And in some cases the answer is yes and that is the vast majority of the developments that we are currently involved in.","And yes, it does give us a much higher yield and allows us to continue to expand our tenant relationships. And in fact, that's how we were able to get Starbucks as one of our tenants. So that is a program that we like. It's a small program today but it's one that we will continue to build on going forward.","Shivani Sood","Thanks for the time.","Sumit Roy","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.","Rob Stevenson","Good afternoon, guys. So are you guys looking at any non-U.K., European acquisitions these days? And how is your staffing over there going? And sort of what your sort of funnel look like outside of the U.S. these days?","Sumit Roy","So thanks for the question, Rob. Most of what we are looking at currently is all in the U.K. Yes we have sourced in the -- sourcing number that we shared with you the $6 billion. Some of it was in mainland Europe, but it was primarily driven by sourcing in the U.K.","We are continuing to focus on stabilizing and creating a flow business that we can lean on in the U.K. That is our priority one. But that's not to say that for the right opportunity, we wouldn't consider moving to Western Europe. But that is not the focus currently.","With regards to the team and setting up an office et cetera, we are very close to making that happen. I think I've mentioned this in one of my previous calls we have one of our veteran acquisition officers moving to the U.K. potentially later this month but certainly by December.","And we are also in the midst of supplementing that team with somebody from the local markets that we are very excited about. And that will be the seeding of that particular office going forward. And I think I've mentioned this as well that some of the support functions have been outsourced. And over time when we have built a portfolio that can justify bringing in some of these outsourced support functions we will then grow the team to accommodate that as well.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then Paul what's keeping you from an A rating at Fitch? I mean, you've been A at Moody's for a while and even S&P upgraded you more than a year ago now. What are they telling you the sort of reason why you're still sort of -- if the word can be termed languishing BBB+?","Paul Meurer","I'm smiling a bit Rob. We agree with your analysis. We think we're well deserving of an upgrade there and certainly have shared with them significant data to show that on a comparable basis versus other A-rated REITs out there, et cetera that our metrics not only support that, but also demonstrates stability through different economic cycles, et cetera.","So we also are a bit perplexed as to where we stand. They do their homework and give a review, but just haven't been ready to kind of move it up to the next level. And we think that it would be appropriate for them to continue that review and hopefully reach that more positive conclusion soon.","Rob Stevenson","Would the upgrade there have any practical impact on you guys? Or is it more of at this point just a marketing positive?","Paul Meurer","Our understanding is at this moment in the market, no. It really doesn't inhibit us in any way at this point nor would it make a market difference to have that additional rating with them.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thanks guys.","Paul Meurer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Linda Tsai","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. When you look at the investment spreads for domestic and international transactions would you expect these ranges to largely hold in the upcoming quarters? I mean, I realize it has likely to do with the mix of what you're buying, but what are some inputs to consider in terms of potential movements?","Sumit Roy","Well, there are two things that you obviously need to focus on in order to determine what the spread is. One is the cap rates. And as you've pointed out and I think I've said in my prepared remarks that the cap rates for the assets that we are interested in the U.K. tend to be in the high 4s to the mid 5% range.","And then the question becomes, okay, how do we go about financing that particular acquisition. And that's where our cost of capital advantages really come to the 4%. Our weighted average nominal cost of capital in the U.K. today is right around the 2.8%. And so even a 4.7% is a very healthy 190 basis points of spread. And clearly on the U.S. side, our cost of capital is higher. It's closer to 3.7% today 3.8%. And -- but we are able to then buy assets at a higher blended cap rate. And so the spreads are being quite advantageous there as well.","So once you sort of take into account where the cap rates are in the cost of capital, I think the spreads will -- it just so happens that this particular quarter, it's being essentially the same. I think it was 10% less spread in the U.K. or -- versus what we had in the U.S. But that I wouldn't say is the norm going forward. There are quarters -- it's quite possible that in the U.K. we may be able to do even better. But if you have to think about a trend line, I wouldn't forecast one geography necessarily having a superior spread to the other.","Linda Tsai","Thanks for that. And then given you've deleveraged to about five times in 3Q, would this be a reasonable expectation to maintain going forward?","Sumit Roy","I think what we have publicly said and what we have shared with the rating agencies is that we want the flexibility to run our business at a 5.5 times plus minus. And that's the right ZIP Code for us. The fact that it is five today is largely being driven by the over funding that we spoke about given the pipeline that we have visibility into. So I wouldn't necessarily say that five is the new norm. I would just say that it will fluctuate, but 5.5 is where you should expect us to operate in the balance sheet.","Linda Tsai","Thank you.","Sumit Roy","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Hi thanks. Just looking at Walgreens the stock is reacting well today just on speculation that it's in talks to go private. And not that I'm asking you to comment on this but maybe just a couple questions around your Walgreens exposure just as a reminder these individual leases any master leases. That's part one. And then part two when you look at a public tenant maybe in your past going private, how do you kind of look at that risk and maybe just some context around that? Thanks.","Sumit Roy","Sure Todd. It's a very good question. Yes, we have seen the rumors as well real-time or breaking news if that is truly accurate. And look in the past when we have seen smaller operators go private, cash flowing businesses that go private, and especially, if it's going private using the private equity route, that has tended to change the leverage profile of the business. The good news here is you're talking about a company that is approximately $70 billion in enterprise value with an equity market cap of about $55 billion, $60 billion if I remember correctly.","So, the reasons for it to go private if that is true would need to be a lot more strategic. And -- so we feel pretty good. Look we've said that the entire delivery of healthcare is an area that is going through massive changes. But what we are very excited about is the fact that we own the brick-and-mortar. And any solution -- and that's our thesis and our belief is that any solution which is going to lead to more efficiency in the delivery of health care is going to require a brick-and-mortar network.","And so -- and I don't want to start speculating as to who the potential buyers if there's any truth to that, but I think whatever happens, there's going to be some story around that as -- like why is it that as a private company or as a combined company with somebody else, et cetera the value proposition is even better? If that's not the case, I don't think that there would be rumors about it going private. So, we would still be very comfortable.","With regards to whether we have master leases, we don't. But I just want to remind you that most of the Walgreens that we have in our portfolio came through sale-leaseback directly with Walgreens. And so these are institutional quality leases with growth et cetera and I think our weighted average lease term on the Walgreens is right around 10 years. So, we are very comfortable regardless of which direction this news ends up going.","Todd Stender","Okay. Thanks for that.","Sumit Roy","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.","John Massocca","Good afternoon.","Sumit Roy","Hi John.","Sumit Roy","So, with regards to the CMFT transaction, is any portion of that portfolio potentially not a good long-term fit within your portfolio? And if so, how might that impact 2020 disposition activity? Understanding you're probably not going to give 2020 guidance, but just any commentary there would be helpful.","Sumit Roy","Sure. And so I think when we first announced this particular transaction, we spoke about -- this is a $1.25 billion transaction. We expect the vast majority of it to close later this year. And we also said that about $200 million of this particular portfolio are assets that we wouldn't have pursued in the one-off market. And so -- but that does not necessarily mean that all of the $200 million that we have acquired are going to be disposed of day one.","In some cases, the economic argument would be that we hold on to the assets, collect the rents for the duration of the remaining lease term, and then given the location, given the below-market rents, whatever the dynamics are that it might actually be better for us to hold on to it and try to re-tenant it. Or it could also imply holding on to the assets until the end of their initial lease term and then selling it.","So, -- and then there's a small bucket of that $200 million that we are absolutely going to come out with in 2020. And when we come out with our guidance in February, we will share that information with you.","John Massocca","Okay. That makes sense. And then, looking kind of at the existing debt stack, you've seen some of your peers kind of prepay some higher coupon debt. I mean does that make sense potentially for you guys going forward?","Paul Meurer","It very well could. We did a fair amount of that refinancing activity over the past 24 months, if you will. And some of that we already kind of took care of. But it is fair to say that they're still a little bit there that we're taking a look at. And as we get closer, obviously, it becomes cheaper to do so. And it is something that we're taking a look at.","John Massocca","Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Collin Mings with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Collin Mings","Hey, good afternoon.","Paul Meurer","Hi. Collin. How are you?","Collin Mings","Doing well, doing well. I just want to pick up a bit on John's question, just as it relates to the CIM deal and maybe more broadly your ability to execute on larger portfolio deals. Can you maybe just update us on if you believe there's a portfolio discount available in the market right now, and just maybe talk a little bit more about that opportunity?","Sumit Roy","Yeah. Look, I think variants of this question have been asked in previous calls. And at least over the last couple of years, I would say, that we believe that there has been a decided discount when we pursue portfolio transactions. And we've seen this in the sale leaseback market. We've seen this even in the U.K. When we are able to come in and write big checks $0.5 billion, $1 billion, et cetera, we do get some form of discounts. And so, I don't want to speak specifically to the CIM portfolio. But largely speaking, we have seen portfolio discounts. And those portfolio discounts could range anywhere between 25 to 75 to even 100 basis points, if you compare it to the one-off 1,031 market. And that is one of the advantages of having size and scale.","Collin Mings","And I guess to that point to your comments that you've highlighted and talked about this dynamic before, do you feel like that gap is widening or narrowing? Or can you speak to that at all? Or does it just really vary deal to deal as you look across the marketplace?","Sumit Roy","I think it's the latter, Collin. I can't tell you that on every portfolio you have x basis points of discounts, and that remains constant regardless of the tenant regardless of the market environment. What I can tell you is we do see a discount, but the amount of the discount will certainly vary. And we've seen that on multiple sale leasebacks that we've done with the same tenant, in fact, where given market conditions, they're willing to accommodate us given our movements and cost of capital. And then, when things improve we accommodate them. So, it's not one fixed number, but it is a discount.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then, just one last one for me. Just more directly, can you maybe touch on the drop quarter-over-quarter in the Circle K exposure?","Sumit Roy","That probably has to do with rollovers. I think we've had a couple of Circle K rollovers, one of which we got back. And there was another one where we actually entered into a very long-term lease, and we invested the capital to expand the space, because they want to expand their convenience store. So, it really is a function of just what is precisely happening. I don't really know what the movement was, but I do remember seeing a couple of these and the investment committee. And so, in certain cases we've invested more and in others we've got back vacant assets.","Collin Mings","Got it. Thank you very much.","Sumit Roy","Sure, Collin.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for closing remarks.","Sumit Roy","So thank you all for joining us today, and we're looking forward to seeing everyone at NAREIT.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's First Quarter 2015 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.","John Case","Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We're pleased with our first quarter results with AFFO per share increasing by 4.7% to record quarterly amount of $0.67. As announced in yesterday's press release we are reiterating our 2015 AFFO per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.71 as we continue to anticipate another solid year for earnings growth. We've had an active first four months of the year. We were added to the S&P 500 Index in April becoming the first net lease REIT to join this index.","In January we were added to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index as a result of increasing our dividend every year for 20 consecutive years. In addition we raised 379 million in equity capital at an attractive cost to fund our acquisitions activity.","Now I will hand it over to Paul to provide an overview of our financial results. Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks John. As usual, I will comment and provide brief highlights regarding our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.4% for the quarter; this increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at March 31st was approximately $936 million.","On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.5 million. This increase was primarily due to our two recent bond offerings, the $350 million 10 year notes we issued last June and $250 million 12 year notes issued in September. We also recognized a non-cash $1.1 million loss on interest rate swaps during the quarter. On a related note our coverage ratios, both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.9 times and fix charge coverage at 3.4 times.","General and administrative or G&A expenses were approximately $12.9 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from the prior year. Included in G&A expenses approximately $94,000 in acquisition cost. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.4% and our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 remains the same at approximately $55 million.","Property expenses which were not reimbursed by tenants totaled $4 million for the quarter. Our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remained approximately $20 million. Provisions for impairment of approximately $2.1 million during the quarter includes impairments we recorded on one sold property, one property classified as held for sale and one property where the building was replaced.","Gain on sales were approximately $7.2 million in the quarter and just a reminder as always we do not include property sales gained in our FFO or in our AFFO. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.68 for the quarter a 4.6% increase versus a year ago and adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.67 per share for the quarter a 4.7% increase versus a year ago. Dividends paid increased 2.6% in Q1 and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.274 per share.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain a conservative and safe capital structure. As you know in early April we raised approximately 276 million of new equity capital in conjunction to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at a very lost by offering shares to the index fund needing to buy stock on that specific day. Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rate and continued to be rated BAA1 BBB+ at a weighted average maturity of seven years.","Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $370 million balance at March 31st. After the equity offering and our acquisition activity in April the facility balance today is approximately $400 million. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $785 million.","Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure to rising interest rates that we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $68 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015 and our maturity schedule as well later thereafter. Currently our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 29% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.7 times.","Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on the quarter.","John Case","Thanks Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy base on a number of properties was 98% a 40 basis points decline from last quarter. At the end of the quarter we had 86 properties held for lease out of nearly 4,400 properties in our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.1% a 10 basis points decline from last quarter and a 10 basis points improvement year-over-year.","Occupancy based on square footage was 98.7%. We had a number of properties come off lease during the first quarter which impacted primarily our physical occupancy. Our leasing team will continue to address these properties as part of our standard portfolio management process. We continue to expect our occupancy to remain around 98% through 2015. Of the 43 properties we re-leased during the quarter 30 were leased to existing tenants and 13 were leased to new tenants, recapturing 99.2% of expiring rents. Additionally five vacant properties were sold during the quarter.","Our same store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter. The industry is contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth for convenience stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the first quarter, our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 78% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial and distribution properties at 11%.","Our diversification contributes to the predictability of our cash flow. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service non-discretionary and\/or low price point component to their business. Today more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristic which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete with ecommerce. At the end of the first quarter, our top 20 tenants represented 54% of rental revenue. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue.","With Circle K's acquisition of the Pantry, two of our top 20 tenants consolidated into one allowing the U.S. government to enter our top 20 at 1.2% of rent. Now 10 of our top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings but rental revenues from these 10 investment grade rated tenants represent 60% of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio no single tenant accounts for more than 5.5% of rental revenue so diversification by tenant remains favorable.","Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.5% of rental revenue that actually remains our second largest tenant at 5.2% of rental revenue. Drugstores and convenience stores are our two largest industries each at 9.6% of rental revenue. Drugstore is about 10 basis points from last quarter while convenience stores are down 20 basis points from last quarter. Our third largest industry is Dollar stores at 9.3% down 20 basis points from last quarter.","As many of you know, Dollar Tree is expected to close its acquisition of Family Dollar later in the second quarter. The FTC has substantially completed its review of the acquisition and identified 340 of the combined 14,000 stores for divestiture. We continued to expect no financial impact on our rental revenue given the minimal portfolio overlap that our Family Dollar locations have with Dollar Tree and the long leased durations of our locations.","We continued to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. This revenue percentage is up from 46% at the end of 2014 primarily as a result of Couche-Tard's acquisition of the Pantry converting the Pantry our former 15th largest tenant from non-investment grade to investment grade status.","However, this percentage should move down a bit to the mid-40s later in the second quarter as a result of Dollar Tree\u2019s pending acquisition of Family Dollar. In addition to tenant credit, the store level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our weighted average coverage ratio on our retail properties was 2.6 times on a four wall basis, and importantly the medium is also 2.6 times.","Moving on to acquisitions, we continue to see a very high volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced about 9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities and completed 210 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9%. So we remain selective in our investment strategy. There continues to be a lot of capital pursuing these transactions and we continue to see cap rates check down a bit for the higher quality properties we're pursuing.","However our investments spreads relative to our cost of capital continue to be quite attractive. Subsequent to the first quarter end we closed an additional 302 million in acquisitions bringing us to a total of 512 million in acquisitions for the first four months of the year. We expect acquisitions volume for 2015 to be at the high end of our previous acquisitions guidance range of 700 million to 1 billion given what we\u2019re seeing today.","We continue to selectively sell assets and redeploy that capital and to properties that better fit our investment strategy. During the quarter, we sold nine properties for $22.1 million. We continued to anticipate dispositions to be around 50 million for 2015. I\u2019ll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail now. Sumit?","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. We are in the first quarter of 2015, we invested 2010 million in 83 properties, approximately 2.5 million per property located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.9% and the weighted average lease term of 15.5 years. As a reminder, our initial cap rates or cash are not GAAP which tend to be higher due to straight lining of rent.","We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 60% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 74% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 26% are from industrial and distribution assets. These assets are leased to 15 different tenants in 12 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our diversified industrial, quick service restaurants and automotive services.","Of the nine independent transactions closed in the first quarter only one transaction was about 50 million. Transaction still continues to remain healthy, resource more than 9 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 54% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 46% or approximately 4 billion were one-off assets. ","Investment grade opportunities represented 55% for the first quarter. Of the $210 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, approximately 41% were one-off transactions. 94% of the transactions closed were relationship driven. We remained selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing on less than 3% of deals sourced and continued to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 46 year operating history.","As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain tight in the first quarter with investment grade properties trading from low 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. As John highlighted, our disposition activities remained active. During the quarter, we sold nine properties with 22 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7% and realized an unlevered internal rate of return of over 12.5%. ","Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy averaging 248 basis points in the first quarter which was significantly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.","In conclusion, the first quarter investments remained solid at 210 million while sourcing more than 9 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above our historical level as a tight cap rate environment in the first quarter was more than offset by our improving cost of capital. We remain selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters.","We continue to seek advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we believe that our acquisitions for 2015 will be at the high end of our previous acquisitions guidance range of 700 million to 1 billion.","With that I\u2019d like to hand it back to John.","John Case","Thanks Sumit. Our activities continued to result in healthy per share earnings growth which supports the payment of the liable monthly dividends that increase over time. We increased the dividend this quarter by 2.6%. We\u2019ve increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of almost 5%. Our payout ratio in the first quarter was 83.7% which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. ","Finally to wrap it up, we\u2019re pleased with the results for the quarter and with the investment opportunities we continue to see in the acquisitions market We remain well positioned to execute on acquisitions with approximately 1.1 billion available on the credit facility today. Our cost of capital advantage continues to support our ability to drive healthy earnings accretion for our shareholders.","At this time, I would like to open it up for questions, Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question today from Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","I am wondering if you expect any impact to your portfolio from Walgreens\u2019 announcement of the 200 store closings.","John Case","Nick this is John here. I think that Walgreens is looking at closing 200 underperforming stores while at the same time opening up 200 new stores. Our average lease term with Walgreens is 14 years and we have good performing stores we only have about five coming due in the next three or four years and those are all strong performers. If they were to close one of our stores of course they would be responsible for paying rent through the term of the lease. But we\u2019re not expecting any impact from that at all. We continue to like that business quite a bit as you know.","Nick Joseph","And then in terms of the updated guidance at least that acquisitions trending towards the high end, can you update us on the capital plan for the remainder of the year given where the balance sheet is today?","John Case","So it will be a function of where we are on acquisitions for the remainder of the year. We have front loaded our equity a fair amount this year as you know partly as a result of the S&P inclusion, so we've raised 379 million in equity to date I would see over the balance of the year we\u2019ll tend to go in the direction of fixed income markets but we\u2019ll look at both equity and debt markets and determine at the appropriate time what makes the most sense for the company from a funding perspective. But given where we are with the balance sheet and what we\u2019ve done year-to-date we\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility there.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","I was just wondering if you could give us the cap rate, the overall cap rate on the acquisitions I think was 6, 7 if you could break that out between the retail and the industrial assets?","John Case","Sure. Sumit, do you want to handle that.","Sumit Roy","So on the industrial side, the cap rate was in the low 6 zip code and on the retail side it was in the very low 7, just right above 7 so blended that was 6, 7 on the acquisitions.","Vikram Malhotra","And then on the additional assets that you bought subsequent to the quarter, could you just give us some more color as to maybe just high level which sectors or what type of asset they were?","John Case","We will release the details on those acquisitions on our second quarter earnings call in July as we typically do. What we can say is that it was principally attributable to a large sale leaseback transaction with an existing tenant. And we're have limited in terms of what we can say about it at this time. We thought it would be helpful to disclose amount in April to put context along with our guidance for the year in terms of acquisitions.","Vikram Malhotra","And then just looking at the investment grade exposure overall, I am sure it\u2019s every quarter things can move around. But just high level it seems like that percentage has maybe creeped up the last few quarters. I am just kind of wondering if you just have a sort of governor in some sense I mean you\u2019re close to 48% now, where do you think that number could go over the next year or so.","John Case","We\u2019re comfortable at 48%. We don\u2019t have a litmus test or a target. We execute both the non-investment grade and investment grade transactions that are investment strategy within our investment parameters. I will say that as a result of the Dollar Tree acquisition of Family Dollar you will see the investment grade percentage tick down to the mid-40 to probably be around 44% at the end of the quarter because Family Dollar will go from investment grade to non-investment grade.","But I think it will remain in the 40s and generally the mid-upper 40s for the remainder of the year. I don\u2019t think it will change substantially. We\u2019re happy with the credit profile of the portfolio and again we\u2019ll execute both the non-investment grade and investment grade opportunities that make sense for us. So that at this point driven by the opportunities we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace.","Vikram Malhotra","And then just last one obviously I know it\u2019s very small percentage of the portfolio that will come up for re-leasing. But just have you seen any of the tenants or any desire to maybe move down in terms of whenever renewals come-up?","John Case","Typically the renewals are for the existing tenants around five years and for new tenants about seven years, that\u2019s held strong for last five, ten years and we\u2019re not really getting much feedback that that\u2019s changing. So we\u2019re not seeing much pressure for shorter lease terms nor we able to extend those lease terms much further into the future than five and seven years.","Operator","Our next question will come from Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin Mings","Just a couple of questions here, first, you guys provide maybe an update on where the watch list stand I think last quarter you referenced it maybe 1.5% of revenues, any changes to that, any changes in the composition?","John Case","It\u2019s 1.2% of revenues today. It\u2019s about a 150 million in properties. There is a fair amount of casual dining and child daycare on that. This really hasn\u2019t changed substantially since the last quarter.","Collin Mings","And then as far as the acquisition is completed year-to-date but at least during the 1Q, can you may be talk about the breakout between rent bumps and what you\u2019re getting for the investment grade versus non-investment grade.","John Case","Yes, it\u2019s pretty much in line with what they\u2019ve done historically. On investment grade overall they\u2019re averaging around 1%. On the non-investment grade they are around 1.7% somewhere around there. So not much of the change in terms of rent growth from the acquisitions we did in the first quarter versus what we\u2019ve done over the last few years.","Collin Mings","And then maybe just remind us just bigger picture here John, as you think about where assets trading right now relative to replacement cost. I think in the past you\u2019ve highlighted some of the deals that are getting out there. These assets are trading well above replacement cost. I mean how does that look in the current environment and how much of a consideration is that if you\u2019re thinking about the different deals that are coming across your desk.","John Case","It\u2019s a significant consideration for us. When we have 9.5 billion of acquisition opportunities like we did in the first quarter yet we execute 210 million, we\u2019re being very selective and a lot of that is driven by structures and pricing that is being given by the markets of these sellers that we\u2019re not willing to match. And that that certainly includes a fair amount of not only rents that are well above market but also replacement cost that are sometimes 150% to 200% pricing of replacement costs 150% to 200%.","So there's some pretty aggressive structure in getting done and that\u2019s while you see us continue to be quite selective.","Collin Mings","And then just maybe one last one from me, this goes back talking about the deals that are relationship driven I think in the past you\u2019ve suggested maybe 20, 25 basis point greater yield than some of the non-relationships deals. Does that spread still hold true? And then is there any differential between some of the retail and non-retail assets when you think about that maybe 25 basis points advantage you get.","John Case","It\u2019s really up to 20 basis points or so and we don\u2019t see a difference between the retail and the industrial assets. It holds true for both classes of assets.","Operator","Our next question will come from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","If you were to rank the factors that are contributing to driving cap rate lower I guess across all the property types in that lease other than low interest rates, would your competitors are signing value too? We\u2019re certainly familiar with what\u2019s important in realty incomes portfolio but how are competitors thinking about this space, are they\u2019re looking at the investment grade tenants the lease duration, what\u2019s contributing to that to make net lease a lot prominent than it once was.","John Case","Yes, it\u2019s really all over the place but the reason it\u2019s so competitive today Todd because of the function of the yields offered and that\u2019s clearly driven by the interest rates and alterative investments, but we see a lot of players work in this space five years ago coming at and aggressively buying assets. And in some cases I would say that there is not a lot of discipline on some of the acquisitions we see done away from us. So there seems to be an aggressive search for yield.","Todd Stender","And how about large deals you\u2019re looking at certainly are comps for your guys, you go back to ARCT in inland, I think you highlighted that the stuff you've already acquired in Q2 as a portfolio. What do the portfolio premiums look like, how does that kind of compare to historically divest and maybe in the last two to three years.","John Case","Well, we've seen really an evaporation of the portfolio premium because of resurgence in the 1031 market and lenders lending to that buyer class. So we\u2019ve seen the cap rates on the one-off transactions reach the cap rate that we were seeing on the portfolios and in some cases some asset classes that are even more aggressive. So we're seeing may be the beginning of a reversal where the art is from portfolio to on-off transactions. But that clearly today is non-premium pricing for you know portfolio transactions of several hundred million.","Operator","We will take the next question from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore","First thing on other revenue, Paul, that was up and I am curious what I guess that was and then what happens going forward?","Paul Meurer","You know it's a typical number I think that it's best to be modeled not a zero as recommended in the past, right, because it's a active portfolio, it's large and you know we actively manage this such that you're going to find income there periodically from easements, proceeds from insurance situations on properties, takings, main takings of may be a small piece of land from an investment, interest income, so it's kind of a mismatch that you're going to have some level of a run rate there.","And then the reason was a little bit larger in this particular quarter was a whole back of some funds that we had set aside in an acquisition that was returned to us in the first quarter that the tenant did not need for some tenant improvements they had planned to do in a property that we were acquiring towards the end of last year. So that pops it up a little bit more than usual.","Rich Moore","So you did like 3 million last year so if you do you know 3 million to 4 million this year that\u2019s kind of a reasonable number.","Paul Meurer","That feels about right, that's correct. And I wouldn\u2019t annualize the number you are looking at here in this first quarter because it did have one unusual $400,000 item in it but otherwise you're going to have some income in that line item every quarter.","Rich Moore","And then John, you talked last quarter about, on your development plans about wanting to grow your built-to-suit portfolio and receive a couple of hundred million annually and I think it's a little bit larger this quarter than it was, I mean what if you added you know what are you working and do you still growing it to a fairly substantial size as reality?","John Case","Yeah, well you know we're pleased that we've been able to raise it to just under 75 million at the end of the quarter. We continue to look for opportunities to continue to grow that and given the returns we have on those investments and the higher yields. So we're looking at industrial properties and retail sort of a balance of the two and you know good lease terms and cap rates that are in excess of 9% versus closer to 7% high 6% on the straight acquisition side.","Rich Moore","So what would be annual?","John Case","We would like to see that thing. What's that?","Rich Moore","Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you.","John Case","No, I was just going to say we would like to continue to grow that -- as the year goes on.","Rich Moore","So what kinds of things did you add, do you have any examples of the sorts of projects you are working on?","John Case","Yes, in industrial we had a number of expansions with FedEx, you know we had a large retail discount store that\u2019s a ground up development that we started as well. So it's pretty representative of the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.","Dan Donlan","John I was wondering if you could talk a little about Page 16 of the supplemental, just looking at the fix charge coverage ratios that you guys gave there, what percentage of the portfolio, looks like it's 2.6 average EBITDA to rent ratio, what percentage of the portfolio does that represent?","John Case","The 2.6?","Dan Donlan","Yes sir.","John Case","Yes it represents the retail portfolio; we got sales and P&Ls on about 65% of the retail tenant. Most of the balance that we don\u2019t get those on are investment grade tenants.","Dan Donlan","That was going to be my next question, what percentage of the non-investment grade do you not get in on, it sounds like it might be basically nothing.","John Case","Yes, very, very small.","Dan Donlan","And then that is a, that's a four wall coverage, could you may be guesstimate what you think you might be if included you know may be corporate overhead?","John Case","Yes I mean it would probably see may be 2 to 3 somewhere in there, for G&A.","Dan Donlan","And then I guess for Paul, just kind of making sure the, just so I understand the balance sheet, is the CIP that you guys have, is that, is that roll through in the other assets line item?","Paul Meurer","Yes it does.","Dan Donlan","And then just kind of curious as to your thoughts on may be doing some 30 year paper, I know you've done it before in the past are you guys open to that, is that market attractive, is it open to you guys?","Paul Meurer","It\u2019s certainly open and I would say as a general comment it\u2019s always something of interest longer term, given that we like the match fund longer term with our liabilities versus as you know our long-term asset. So it\u2019s really just a function of how it feels and worth price in a times, it\u2019s very aggressive and is very, very compelling. So it\u2019s something we would always consider. You may recall that last time we did it, it really was the result of a reverse increase from the life company who specifically reached out to us wanting to place third year paper with us and then we surrounded that with some other investors to create a natural trade at that time. But it\u2019s something we will look at each and every time when we consider typically for us long-term fixed rate liability.","Dan Donlan","And then just kind of maybe bigger picture I guess John or Sumit, what are you seeing from retailers or companies that have large real-estate, exposure on their books maybe they\u2019re getting pressure from the investors to monetize. Do you see that continue to play out, is there other potential transactions out there that aren't so large that you think you can take down and what\u2019s your appetite for this type of deals on a going forward basis.","John Case","Those [spots] continue to multiply and their discussions going on, we can\u2019t go into particulars on those but we would expect to have a couple of opportunities over the next year or two. These things take a long-time. The companies that we\u2019re talking to that we\u2019ve been talking to about this concept for a multiple years but it really seems to be gaining momentum with the activist investors coming in more pressure on some of the boards in management teams to more efficiently utilize their real-estate and potentially monetize it. So the number of discussions we always had these discussions, and say the number of these discussions and the seriousness of these discussions is both my much greater today. So we would expect to execute on something over the next year or two on that front.","Dan Donlan","And is there some type of high water mark from percentage of rent perspective that you just don\u2019t want to go above or if you really, really like the deal are you okay with maybe increasing the tenants exposure to 10% of rents, how should we think about that?","John Case","I think we would be comfortable for the right tenant, right company, right transaction to go beyond the revenue percentage levels that we are at today. We are at 5.5% at Walgreens and then 9.6% in terms of industry. I could see industry and tenant going beyond that in the near-term and they we try to work our way back down to 10% plus or minus industry revenue exposure and mid single-digits in terms of tenant revenue exposure.","So we really like that diversification it\u2019s always been an important element of the story. We\u2019ve never been more diversified than we are today but we would not turn in attractive transaction like that away for a period time to exceed those levels.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.","Chris Lucas","John, just kind of following up on a couple of earlier questions, really to the development program I guess could you remind us sort of how guys play there and how scalable your infrastructure is if you look to grow this and how you look to expand that program. So what roles are you playing in that process, is it just capital or there are other things that you\u2019re providing here?","John Case","It\u2019s a capital, we\u2019re not acting as the developer, we have a relationship with the number of national development companies and we'll fund development or provide a take out. It\u2019s always -- with the signed lease on hand. So there is no speculative development, so it\u2019s really a capital function and I think because of that I think it\u2019s quite scalable.","Chris Lucas","So, as it relates to the process development versus acquisitions, is there no more time spent on the development relative to the acquisition?","John Case","No, there is more time spent by our team. We got to monitor the development process. We work with outside advisors in terms of monitoring the construction and development and then we have our own team and our own people also involved in that. So there is more time, more effort from the management team from our team here in San Diego on development properties versus acquisitions generally speaking.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen that concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.","Thanks Elisabeth and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference. And we thank you for your participation."],"18159":["Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2016  2:30 PM ET","Executives","Janeen Bedard - VP, Administration","John Case - CEO","Paul Meurer - CFO & Treasurer","Sumit Roy - President & COO","Analysts","Robert Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott","Joshua Dennerlein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Vineet Khanna - Capital One Securities","Nicholas Joseph - Citi","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities","Daniel Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Collin Mings - Raymond James","Operator","Please stand by, we're about to begin. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter 2016 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be; John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit the during the Q&A portion of the call; in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.","John Case","Thanks, Janeen, and welcome to our call today. We're pleased to report another active quarter for acquisitions. As announced in yesterday's press release we are increasing in our 2016 acquisitions guidance from $1.25 billion to approximately $1.5 billion; and tightening and raising the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance to $2.87 to $2.89 as we anticipate another solid year of earnings growth.","After financing 85% of our capital needs since the start of 2015 with equity, we returned to the bond market this month with a $600 million ten-year senior unsecured bond offering at 3.15% which represents the lowest all-in yield in our company's history for ten-year debt transaction. Our balance sheet remains well capitalized and access to our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to pursue the highest quality net lease investments that support our reliable dividend growth.","Now let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks, John. I'm going to provide highlights for few items in our financial statements for the quarter starting with the income statement.","Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $11 million to $53 million, and year-to-date by $10 million to $171 million. This decrease is partly due to a lower average outstanding debt balance over the past year as we primarily sold common equity and repaid outstanding bonds and mortgages. However, this decrease was also driven by the recognition of a non-cash gain of approximately $2.1 million on interest rates swaps during the quarter which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense. And in the comparative third quarter of 2015, we recognized the non-cash loss of approximately $5.2 million that increased our interest expense in that quarter. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of these non-cash gains and losses to calculate our AFFO.","Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.6% this quarter as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Year-to-date, our G&A is only 4.9% of revenues and we are still projecting approximately 5% for the year. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.6% this quarter and we are still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year. Provisions for impairment were $8.8 million in the third quarter on 11 sold properties, five properties held for sale, and two properties held for investment. $2 million of this impairment recognized in the quarter relates to the pending sale of our former headquarters office building in Escondido which is expected to close in the fourth quarter.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet; we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We raised approximately $500 million of common equity capital thus far this year, and as John mentioned, we successfully returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million ten-year senior unsecured bond offering with the yield of 3.15%. The offering was well oversubscribed and we were very pleased with the quality of the fixed income investors in the offering. This offering extended the weighted average maturity of our senior unsecured bonds from 6.2 to 6.8 years, and provides us with additional flexibility under our $2 billion revolving credit facility which following the offering has a balance of approximately $470 million.","Other than our credit facility the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $32.4 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedules remains in very good shape with only $36 million of mortgages coming due the remainder of this year. And our maturity schedule is well latter thereafter with only $284 million of maturing debt in all of 2017. Finally, our overall leverage remains low with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.3 times. In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital; both of which remain well priced financing options today.","So let me turn the call now back over to John to give you more background.","John Case","Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Our occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, a 30 basis points increase from last quarter. We continue to make good progress with our releasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. On the 47 properties we released during the quarter, we recaptured a 105% of the expiring rent. While we typically do not pay tenant improvements to release assets, we did incur $2.1 million NTIs and $7 million in committed redevelopment capital to release three former Sports Authority properties to a leading national retailer while generating a recapture rate of 136% on these three leases, and an incremental yield on invested capital of 18%.","Year-to-date, we have recaptured 104% of expiring rent on 122 lease rollovers which remains well above our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold more than 2,200 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were released. This compares favorably to the handful of net lease companies who also report this metric. Our same-store rent increased 1.1% during the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date. We continue to expect same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016.","90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 70% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type; all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties released the 247 commercial tenants and 47 different industrials located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.","There is not much movement in the composition of our top tenants in industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7.3% of rental revenue and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. As we discuss our top tenants; I'd like to highlight a positive transaction involving Diageo. Earlier this year, Diageo sold its wine-related businesses in order to exclusively focus on spirits and beer. We own 17 vineyards and wineries in Napa Valley that are leased to Diageo. Diageo sold its operations related to our properties to Treasury Wine Estates, the world's largest publicly traded venture. We and Diageo negotiated a buyout of the guarantee of our leases that have approximately 15 years of remaining term.","Diageo was paying Realty Income $75 million in cash in two equal installments in exchange for being released from the guarantee. We received the initial payment in the third quarter and we will receive the second payment in January of 2017. At that time we will fully release Diageo from the guarantee, and Treasury Wine Estates will become our tenant.","We believe this is a very attractive transaction for our shareholders for many reasons including; first, the $75 million payment reduces our investment in prime Napa Valley real estate to approximately 50% of current market value. It also increases our yield on our investment to 10.5%. We gain as a top tenant, Treasury Wine Estates, who is an excellent venture with an equity market capitalization of approximately $6.5 billion, who has a strong credit profile. While Treasury does not currently have rated public debt, it has a healthy balance sheet with a debt-to-EBITDA of 1.5 times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.3 times. It has a singular focus on wine with premier labels such Pin Bowl and Barringer [ph], and added BB and Sterling among others through this transaction.","Moving on to tenant credit; we continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 45% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased from 2.7 times to 2.8 times on a four wall basis and the median increased from 2.6 times to 2.7 times in the third quarter.","Moving on acquisitions; we completed $410 million in acquisitions during the quarter and through the first nine months of the year, we completed approximately $1.1 billion in acquisitions at record high investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. Year-to-date, we have sourced $23 billion in acquisition opportunities putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date which is consistent with our average since 2010. As I mentioned, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.5 billion and we continue to acquire the highest quality net lease properties as we grow our portfolio.","Now let me hand it over to Sumit who will discuss our acquisitions and dispositions.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. During the third quarter of 2016, we invested $410 million in 93 properties located in 29 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years. On a revenue basis, 69% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants; 86% of the revenues are generated from retail; and 14% are from industrial. These assets are lease to 23 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drug stores, discount grocery stores, and automotive services.","We closed 20 independent transactions in the third quarter and the average investment of property was approximately $4.4 million. Year-to-date 2016, we invested $1.1 billion in 236 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 15 years. On a revenue basis 51% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 81% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 19% are from industrial. These assets are lease to 41 different tenants in 24 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drugstores, casual dining restaurants, and transportation services.","Of the 61 independent transactions closed year-to-date, two transactions where about $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy, we sourced approximately $9 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $23 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Off these opportunities, 51% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 49% or approximately $11 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 24% for the third quarter. Off the $410 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 33% were one-off transactions.","As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the third quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter we sold 23 properties for net proceeds of $18.1 million at a net cash cap rate of 9.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.4%. This brings us to 49 properties sold year-to-date for $53.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7%, and an unlevered IRR of 8.6%.","Our investment spreads relative to a weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 271 basis points in the third quarter which were well above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less on nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.","In conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance of 2016 to approximately $1.5 billion. We are also raising our 2016 disposition target to between $75 million and $100 million.","With that I'd like to hand it back to John.","John Case","Thanks, Sumit. As mentioned previously, we returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million ten-year benchmark senior unsecured bond offering at a yield-to-maturity at 3.15%. This offering allowed us to term out our loan balance at attractive pricing while repricing our credit curve and the debt capital markets which will have ongoing benefits to the company and future debt offerings.","Since the start of 2015 we have issued a total of $2.5 billion of capital. $1.7 billion of this capital raised has been equity, so we have continued to finance our capital needs conservatively. Our leverage remains low with debt-to-total market cap of approximately 23% and debt-to-EBITDA at 5.3 times. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. Our credit ratings remain BAA1, BBB+ by all three rating agencies with positive outlooks from both, Moody's and S&P; providing us with the highest overall credit ratings in the net lease sector.","During the third quarter, we increased the dividend for the 88th time in the company's history. The current annual launched dividend represents a 6% increase over the prior year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our year-to-date AFFO payout ratio is 83.5% which is a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we had another productive quarter across all functions of the organization and remain optimistic about our future. As demonstrated by our sector leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in the net lease business.","Our portfolio is performing well and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisition environment remains a very efficient marketplace and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest quality properties given our sector leading cost of capital, access to capital, and balance sheet flexibility.","At this time I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now go to Robert Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Robert Stevenson","Good afternoon, guys. John, once you get the second payment from Diageo, is there anything left to do really with the vineyard, is that a candidate for sale at some point in '17?","John Case","Once we get the second payment in January, Diageo will be fully released and Treasury Wine Estates will become our tenant as I said. This is prime Napa Valley real estate, and our basis relative to value and investment will be about 50%. It's performing quite well for us, 15 years of lease term left. So it's not something we would look to be selling unless we had an offer that was unbelievably attractive but we'll stick with it.","Robert Stevenson","Okay, and then Paul; what were you thinking and how strong the preferred market has been off-late that you guys price a preferred issuance today? What are you thinking about in terms of the series [ph]?","Paul Meurer","I think today you'd be looking at something for us in the 5% to -- 5% and 8% range right around there. So that's very attractive from a historical perspective relative to the preferred market. The preferred asset 6% and 8% as you know and it is callable in mid-February, and that's a decision as we get closer to it that we'll make at that time.","Operator","At this time we'll move to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joshua Dennerlein","Could you walk us through your thought process on why you didn't provide 2017 guidance with 3Q results?","John Case","Sure. Basically we thought by providing it in the first quarter we could provide an additional three months of visibility, and that should resolved in guidance that was -- it is more informed. When we looked at what our peers were doing, we saw that 85% of the S&P500 REITs released guidance in the first quarter or not at all. So again, we were bit of an outlier. This is not unlike us changing the month in which we look at our dividend a couple of years ago, our fifth dividend increases; it used to be in August, now it's in January. So we lined it up with our fiscal year.","And in an industry like ours, that -- it's largely reliant on external growth to drive overall growth for the company. It is difficult as you all have seen to project acquisitions 15 months out. And so I think it's especially pertinent to our sector. So that's why we decided to release guidance going forward in the first quarter.","Joshua Dennerlein","Got it, thanks. But it looks like you've pulled back on the ATM during the third quarter; any reason for that? And what can we kind of expect for 4Q -- have we used it at all so far?","John Case","So over -- with the twelve-month period ending September 30, we exclusively financed our growth with equity and we've raised -- that's $1.1 billion of equity. We've raised $1.7 billion of equity over the last 20 months and our balance sheet has never been in greater shape than it is today with debt-to-total market cap of approximately 22%, 23%; and a debt-to-EBITDA in the low five, about 5.2, 5.3. So we elected to issue the bond that we referenced in our opening comments and for a number of reasons; one, we had not been in the bond market in two years. And we had an opportunity to reset our pricing by issuing a large liquid benchmark ten-year offering. We actually priced six basis points through our secondary spreads when we priced transaction and we had really incredible demand for the transaction as well.","So we didn't want to over equitize, we've raised a lot of equity; we'll continue to look at all sources of financing going forward but the bond -- we could not be more pleased with the $600 million unsecured offering and then what that did for us. So we'll continue to look at equity prices going forward, we'll look at all forms of capital we have with the recent bond offering -- near-term, immediate needs for significant capital.","Operator","We'll take a question from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thank you. I just wanted to understand the rag [ph] exposure. Now given the size, can you maybe give us a sense of how the portfolio looks like in terms of -- what percent has -- what percent of it has rent bumps? Any other interesting differences between the portfolio you can highlight?","John Case","So Vikram, you're talking about the most recent transaction we completed -- it was a\u2026","Vikram Malhotra","Yes, the most recent and then just as the whole -- just as the tenant as a whole.","John Case","Okay. So the most recent transaction, we don't go into lot of detail but I will tell you that it was a negotiated off-market transactions sale leaseback opportunity that we worked on with Walgreens directly based on a relationship. Very attractive properties at -- with an appropriate investment structure; the lease does have growth in it. And it was an attractive investment. So it took us to 7.3% in terms of our overall rent exposure. When assuming in the first quarter and Walgreens expects is they've said publicly that the ready transaction will close; we'll be up to around 9% which is at the high end of where we want to be, be it any single tenet, we feel very comfortable that it's such a strong tenant. But again in this -- for the sake of diversity, we'll manage that exposure, back down a bit through additional growth and some selected asset sales but primarily through additional growth.","Vikram Malhotra","And can you give us some sense of like what percent of the portfolio has rent bumps. How the -- broadly how the coverage looks in terms of -- even if there is a range you can provide us -- just to give us some sense of the different parts of the portfolio -- the different parts of the world mean portfolio?","John Case","Yes, I'd say we have growth on in terms of the Walgreens exposure, it's probably 60% to 70% of the assets. So that's -- there are some that are flat but overall it's about between 60% and 70%. And it's all sale back transactions, not that lease existing transactions.","Operator","And we'll take next question from Vineet Khanna with Capital One Securities.","Vineet Khanna","Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. So just on the disposition side, it looks like on a property count basis, 82% of disposition have been vacant properties in '16, 73% in '15 and 35% in 2014. But it just reflects sort of a shift in strategy around dispositions and asset management or as you just said, reflection of tenant fallout here or something like that.","John Case","Well, we're selling more vacant assets that we think we're better-off selling and trying to relax. So we're being more active on that front. And this past year we had two bankruptcy events that we were planning for; that included Ryan's and the Sports Authority, and some of the sales activity had been related to vacant properties for those former tenants, end tenants.","Vineet Khanna","Okay. So no real shift in strategy just sort of a thought.","John Case","Yes, and we'll be a little more active on the disposition front. We are raising our disposition guidance from 50 to 75 for the year, to $75 million to $100 million for the year. And again, we're -- if we have legacy assets that are not consistent with our investment parameters today, we're going to strongly consider selling those assets; some of which are leased but some of which are not leased; and redeploying that capital into assets that better fit our investment strategy and provide our shareholders with a better return.","Operator","At this time we'll go to Nick Joseph with Citi Group.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. Paul, you mentioned the $470 million on the line after the recent debt deals. So I'm wondering how you think about the line and floating rate debt more broadly as part of the capital structure?","Paul Meurer","Historically, once we reached some critical level of borrowings on the line that would be the immediate way to finance the business and finance acquisitions. We then look to the permanent capital markets, mostly equity but also long-term bonds etcetera. But historically aligned with a lot smaller too, so over the past year with a $2 billion line, it gives us a little bit more flexibility to be able to carry a little bit larger balance than we had historically; but on a percentage basis relative to the enterprise as a whole, it's quite similar. So we're not taking on that much more variable rate debt overall in the capital structure.","What's good about that -- the ability to carry a $400 million, $500 million, $600 million balance on the line but again isn't taking that much more risk relative to the enterprise as a whole, it gives you almost a free look at the permanent capital markets where you can wait and time when it's appropriate to issue long-term bonds or perhaps common equity. So that's one side benefit of that. Right now sitting here with plus or minus $500 million balance, that kind of gives us that window but it's not one where we're anxious or you know feel the need to immediately issue capital any time soon?","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks for that. And then I guess in terms of cap rates, have you see any changes to cap rates or seller's appetites more broadly, given the economic environment and move -- rates the election or anything else?","John Case","No, cap rates have remained pretty consistent over the last 12 to 15 months. On the investment grade side we're still seeing initial yields in the low fives to the high six's on the non-investment grade side; I'd say the high-five's up into the 8% range. So that's been consistent and it really no reaction in the market to the movement and the tenure at this joint \u2013 juncture.","Operator","[Indiscernible] has the next question with Mizuho.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon. I see that your floating rate debt exposure, basically a credit line it was about 20% in the quarter dropping down to about 14%, 15% post the bond issued in October. The question is, given the concern about rising rates is that a level you're comfortable with or should we look for further reduction? And then how you're thinking overall about floating rate exposure at this point in the cycle with rates slightly [ph]?","John Case","So I'll start and Paul, you can elaborate. I think on a $23 billion capital structure, $500 million of floating rate debt is something we're quite comfortable with. So we will have some floating rate outstanding. I mean we're not in the business predicting where interest rates are going to go, I know a year ago people were predicting it would go higher and well, actually -- even after today, well below where they were in December of last year. So that's a pretty dangerous game, I think a lot of us have been expecting -- a lot of people in the marketplace have been expecting rates now to rise for five years after the monetization that took place after the Great Recession. But that really hasn't materialized, we've got 1% plus GDP growth; our tenants are doing well but when we look at their P&Ls, we're not seeing gangbuster growth, we're just seeing moderate solid sales growth.","So we're certainly comfortable, gets back to the amount of floating rate debt with $500 million. I mean we're not going to put all of our chips in one interest rate scenario, and we'll remain lowly leverage, very strong balance sheet where the impact of rates will be muted on our own company. Paul, anything you want to add to that?","Paul Meurer","No, that's fine.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And then if I may, as a follow-up, just -- I know you are giving 2017 guidance but just curious on the competitive environment for the types of acquisitions you're looking at the higher grade type of tenant. Just curious on the competitive environment that you're seeing out there, institutional bids etcetera?","John Case","Sure. There is some level of competition but we're really in a good position to focus on the highest quality net lease properties given our significant cost of capital advantage, size, access to capital, balance sheet flexibility. So we remain very selective and that's been consistent. Going back to probably 2010 we acquired on average about 5% of what we're sourcing. So we're in a position where if we want it, we can generally execute and make the acquisition.","So there is competition out there but seldom are we competing with other public companies for transactions, there are some private capital out there and certainly on the higher quality industrial product -- we'll run into some money being managed by investment managers, familiar with the net lease market and that could be pension fund and down and even sovereign wealth money. Not seen much out of the private or non-listed REITs today and really\/only compete with maybe one or two other public companies; just on the assets. And then again, that's just given where we're focused versus where some of our peers are focused on the yield risk curve.","Operator","At this time we'll move to RJ [ph] with Baird.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon, guys. Paul, couple of questions for you on the balance sheet; so obviously you guys are discussing how much equity you guys have issued over the past twelve months, and I'm curious how comfortable or what level of leverage you're comfortable bringing the balance sheet up to -- if you choose not to issue additional equity in the next couple of quarters?","Paul Meurer","As a general remark, and we will -- we've stated our philosophy for the balance sheet is kind of roughly two-thirds equity, one-third long-term debt if you will to kind of help people think about how to model us going forward. When equity has been attractively priced as it's been over the past year and a half, we lean more towards doing that, and really exclusively did that for 21\/22 months. And as such that brought it down to more or less say 20% debt leverage ratio, but ultimately you want to have the ability to go out more to that 30% to 35% range if you need to -- and if equity for some reason at different points in time is not as attractively priced as it is. But we're very comfortable with where we are right now in that 20% to 25% range. We'd be comfortable going up a little bit higher and have the ability and flexibility to use debt or equity going forward right now.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And Paul, I priced obviously a good ten-year bond offering last quarter, 3.15; I'm curious if you're talking to your bankers, if you think -- where do you think that deal will get pressed today?","Paul Meurer","Right now that same bond is trading at about 137 basis points over. The deal was priced at 147 basis points, so even with the rise in treasuries we're still looking at ten-year money kind of around the same effective yield that we were able to do the transaction a few weeks ago.","Operator","We'll now move along to Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.","Karin Ford","Hi, good afternoon. Investment spreads were 271 basis points this quarter, given that changes in cap rates often times lag changes in the capital markets, where would the spreads need to fall to that would cause you to get more conservative on your investments?","John Case","Karin, over the history of the company, our investment spreads versus our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital have been in the mid-100s. So we've gone as high as 275 basis points which is a record and we've been as low as 75 basis points. It all depends on the growth in assets, I mean we're not just simply looking at the spreads, we certainly want transactions to be accretive but we're also looking at the long-term benefits for the IRR, the growth and the lease. So even we have at least 100 basis points of cushion today before we even hit our average investments spread. So we're in good shape on that front.","Karin Ford","Thanks for that. A second question, was the bond offering anticipated in original guidance? And recognizing that you're not giving 2017 guidance today, do you have any early thoughts as to how AFFO growth maybe setting up for next year compared to this year?","John Case","Well, we don't want to bring it out, guidance -- we feel very good about the business and are seeing very good opportunities going forward. So we do like -- we have a great deal of momentum going into 2017 and it's going to be a good year for the company. But we'll come out as I said and issue formal guidance during the first quarter. And on the bonds; Paul, do you want to address that?","Paul Meurer","We're just in terms of what we expected coming into this year. We did model doing a little bit more leverage and not just all equity, up through the third quarter. And the leverage that we modeled in fact was a little bit wider pricing, we were thrilled with what we're able to execute a few weeks ago. So given the uptick in acquisition activity throughout the year, and the fact that we're now expecting $1.5 billion; had we financed that with rather than 100% equity, financed it with two-thirds equity, one-third debt; we would have come in above our original guidance by a material amount.","But what we did is took advantage of attractive equity cost and really fortify the balance sheet; and here today we sit in great shape and as Paul said, we have the flexibility to look at all forms of capital, long-term, as we look at financing the business on a go-forward basis in 2017.","Operator","We'll then move to Daniel Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Daniel Donlan","Thank you. Just wanted to talk about your EBITDA coverage, it was only 2.6 times in the fourth quarter of '15, now it's 2.8. So is that more a function of what you bought or is it more a function of your tenants, your existing tenants gauged wrong.","Paul Meurer","It's either dark growing with our existing tenants for the most part. And I think acquisitions contributed a little bit to that but you know the uptick in this last quarter -- couple of industries, see stores and our tire, auto service. I'll head we saw a good growth in the EBITDAR from all those industries and they were the principal industries that contributed to the increase and are -- both our average and our median EBITDAR coverage ratios.","Daniel Donlan","I appreciate that. And just kind of curious on cap rates and neither if their lease back, basically lease back this quarter -- basically lease back this quarter. What do you think the difference in cap rates is for deals that are maybe ten-years in term versus maybe 15 or even 20-years in term? Is there a pretty big gap there? Just kind of curious on your thoughts.","John Case","There is a gap and I'll hand it over to Sumit. Sumit, you want to take that one?","Sumit Roy","Yes, sure. So it's a function of both, the tenant as well as the lease term. And if you assume that the leases are structured exactly identical and the only delta is going to be the term, I would say between a 10-year and a 20-year lease term, you could potentially have a difference of anywhere between 10 to 25 basis points.","John Case","And we've seen it even as high as 50 in one transaction.","Sumit Roy","If the credit is non-investment grade, yes.","Operator","We will now move to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Thanks, guys. It seems like the notion of you guys making large M&A type deals -- that's kind of been taken off the table, we just haven't seen many transformational deals in the net lease space. Can you just comment on how that market looks like right now; you've got year-end coming, investors and portfolio managers have tax deadline. How does the M&A market look like right now?","John Case","The M&A market has been pretty slow as of -- observed it across the sectors. We're not going to -- I'm not in a position to speculate on what may or may not happen in our own sector. So I don't want to make any comments around that.","Todd Stender","Sure. And then maybe just going back to kind of the -- the lease renewals; if you take the redevelopment out with the Sports Authority assets, it looks like renewals ruled down by about 8%, if I have that right. Is there anything in there -- any tenants or leases that rolled down the most? Anything -- any color you can provide?","John Case","If you look at the last column, released to a tenant after a period of vacancy on Page 24 of our supplement. We had three of those six tenants where we had recapture rate of 54%, where former Ryan's that were leased to national tenants. And even though the rent was substantially less, we substantially increased the value of those investments by leasing them to national high quality tenants, long-term lease terms with good growth. So we got a much lower cap rate, in one instance it was done as a ground lease, and we got a completely new building that would revert to us at the end of the term if this tenant elects to move on.","So there is a story behind all of these; if you were to exclude those three former Ryan's, the recapture rate would have been 102% versus the way you calculated it at about 93%, 94%. We still think the right number is 105% and -- including the assets that we released without vacancy. We had an excellent return on our invested capital there and we can get 18% on an unlevered basis for our shareholders, we will do that all day long.","Operator","We'll take the final question today from Collin Mings with Raymond James.","Collin Mings","Thanks, yes, good afternoon. Just sticking with that Page 24, just -- can you expand just on the types of opportunities you're seeing as far as redevelopment, obviously this quarter was a bit unusual in terms of Sports Authority but is there a way to think about how much you could or would spend, given some of the incremental yield opportunities?","Sumit Roy","Yes, so one of the things that we've been talking about now for quite a while is our focus on asset management and we've had a very focused effort in trying to identify opportunities, not only when it comes to releasing assets but even with existing assets, out parcel developments; do my seeing existing assets, having direct conversations with tenants to figure out if they need is for the 100% of the assets or it could be better served in by taking back some of the asset and re-tenanting it. All those discussions have sort of started to finally bear fruition and that's sort of the reason why you're starting to see 105%, 106%, 110% returns. We current are looking at 31 different opportunities within our portfolio and these are just immediate opportunities which should play out over the next twelve-months. And some of the returns that John just mentioned is around the zip codes of what we are expecting on some of these opportunities and this is going to continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business and one of the growth drivers that we are very excited about.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then just -- maybe can you quantify that just in terms of dollars and how do you balance that opportunity versus some of the messaging as far as wind or rash it up some disposition activity as well?","Sumit Roy","I mean disposition is different, in my mind from our asset management opportunities -- pure asset management that I was referencing, part of the reason why we've increased our disposition is to take advantage of the market that we have today by another $25 million. Quantifying this asset management, it continues to change; you continue to find new opportunities. So I think I'd be premature in putting a dollar amount to it but I can certainly share with you that the returns that we're looking at are in the high teens.","John Case","And I'll add to that, that we expect as Sumit said to become an increasing component of our business as we more actively manage the portfolio and just to remind you the dispositions are almost exclusively non-strategic assets; they are being sold-off our list which remains right at about 1%. So it's a kind of two different concepts there.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.","John Case","Thanks Matt, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again, and I'm sure we'll see most, if not all of you at May REIT. So have a good afternoon and thanks for being on our call.","Operator","And again, that does conclude today's conference call.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s second quarter 2018 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.","John Case","Thanks Janeen. Welcome to our call today. We're pleased with our results in the second quarter. During the quarter we invested $347 million in high quality property acquisitions and increased AFFO per share by 5.3%. Given the momentum we see in our business, we are increasing our 2018 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.75 billion from the prior range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We\u2019re also raising the range of our 2018 AFFO per share guidance from $3.14 to $3.20 to $3.16 to $3.21. ","Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks, John. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Other revenue in the quarter was $3.6 million. Other revenue typically consists of easements, take in, interest income and insurance proceeds and it will vary from quarter-to-quarter as we've mentioned in the past. ","Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.7% for the quarter and 5.4% year-to-date. Consistent with prior year G&A tends to be slightly higher in the first half of the year due to the timing of stock vesting and the cost associated with their annual meeting and proxy. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and we continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in all of 2018. ","Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues were 1.5% for the quarter and 1.6% year-to-date. We expect non-reimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018. ","Funds from operation or FFO per share was $0.79 for the quarter. As a reminder our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.80 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.3% increase. ","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the second quarter we issued $300 million of common stock primarily through our ATM program. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is now 9.2 years and our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $8.5 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018, and only $91 million coming due in 2019, outside of our revolver. And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. ","Our overall leverage remains modest as our debt to EBITDA ratio is currently 5.5 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 4.6 times. In summary we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics. ","Now let me turn the call back over to John.","John Case","Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.7%, an increase of 20 basis points versus the year ago period. We expect occupancy to remain north of 98% for 2018. During the quarter we re-leased 47 properties recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent, making this our 8th consecutive quarter of positive recapture rates. ","The first half of 2018 we have re-leased 102 properties recapturing approximately 105% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994 we have re-leased or sold 2750 properties with leases expiring. Recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased","Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% for the first half of the year. These results were consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.","Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 257 commercial tenants and 48 different industries, located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.","Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue. In the second quarter, convenience stores became our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue. We continue to like the convenience store industry. We own high-quality real estate locations and profitable stores leased to leading national investment grade rated operators.","Additionally, our convenience store portfolio, primarily consists the stores with the larger physical footprint. These stores tend to drive greater sales and volume, unrelated to fuel consumption, often featuring extensive prepared food options. Within our portfolio of retail properties, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and\/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today\u2019s retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.","We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.8 times. Both of these store level metrics represent improvements from last quarter as our retail store level performance remains strong. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years.","Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $347 million acquisitions during the quarter at 6.5% cap rate at investment spreads consistent with our long-term average. Our investment spreads improved during the quarter, and we are pleased with the quality of our acquisitions. 52% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade rated tenants. Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters.","We remain one of the only publicly traded net lease companies that have the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Year-to-date, approximately 80% of our acquisitions have been sale leaseback transactions. During the quarter, we sourced $7.7 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remained selective in our strategy, acquiring approximately 5% of the amount sourced.","Given the continued strength and visibility in our investment pipeline and the current market environment, we are increasing our 2018 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.75 billion from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.","I\u2019ll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in a bit more detail. Sumit?","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John.","During the second quarter of 2018, we invested $347 million in 190 properties, located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.6 years. 85% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are quick service restaurants and convenience stores. We closed 15 discrete transactions in the second quarter.","Year-to-date 2018, we\u2019ve invested $857 million in 358 properties located in 32 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% under the weighted average lease term of 13.8 years. On a revenue basis, 71% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants.","94% of the revenues are generated from retail and 6% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 28 different tenants in 17 industries. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year-to-date, three transactions were above $50 million.","Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 67% were portfolios. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $17 billion in potential transaction opportunities, and of these opportunities, 60% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $7 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 24% for the second quarter. Of the $347 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 25% were one-off transactions.","As to pricing, cap rates were essentially unchanged in the second quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 151 basis points in the second quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield, less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.","Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 26 properties for net proceeds of $33.7 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.3%. This bring us to 40 properties sold year-to-date for $47.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8%.","In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target of $1.75 billion and disposition volume of approximately $200 million.","With that I\u2019d like to hand it back to John?","John Case","Thanks Sumit.","We continue to have excellent access to the capital markets to fund our business and maintain our conservative balance sheet. We remain well-positioned upon our growth through a variety of avenues for the rest of the year. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion available on our line of credit, excluding our accordion feature.","In June, we increased the dividend for the 97th time in our Company\u2019s history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the Company\u2019s listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%. And we are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index.","To wrap it up, we\u2019re pleased with our Company\u2019s momentum across all areas of the business and remain optimistic about our prospects. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline, and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.","At this time, I like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joshua Dennerlein","Thanks for the question. Maybe you could talk about your views on Amazon\u2019s entry into the pharmacy business and how that impact [ph] CVS, Walgreens, your portfolio?","John Case","Sure, Josh. I think that sort of the topic of the day is Amazon\u2019s acquisition of PillPack and what the impact it\u2019s going [technical difficulty] industry. PillPack has about five [technical difficulty] overall market share today, focus on drugs, treating long-term conditions [technical difficulty]about 25% of pharmacy sales, 50% of the drugs are for acute illnesses and 25% are for specialty drugs and these are typically handled by the brick-and-mortar pharmacies. So, PillPack is suitable for relatively small portion of the market. Walgreens and CVS are top two drugstore tenants, each have about 23% of the market. And both have been very successful recently, having positive same-store pharmacy sales for the last five years.","Most consumers of drugs, based on surveys and industry trade information prefer face-to-face interaction when purchasing drugs. These are the older -- this is the older portion of our population, the baby [technical difficulty] Walgreens and CVS have become competitive on pricing [technical difficulty] integration alliances with PBMs. So, that\u2019s helped them capture more market share [technical difficulty] also able to create captive market share through this vertical integration. And both, Walgreens and CVS offer same day and overnight delivery [technical difficulty] and or delivery in major markets today and continue to [technical difficulty] FedEx and Walgreens have formed a venture specifically for this purpose.","Another statistic that gives us comfort is since 2010, brick and mortar drug stores have taken about 20% of the market share from mail order pharmacies. And again, this is due to them becoming more price competitive [technical difficulty]and out of convenience. 80% of the [technical difficulty] lives within a 5 miles of CVS or Walgreens, and the two -- the top two brick-and-mortar pharmacies continue to add in-house health clinics to drive pharmacy sales. So, we see that trend continuing and growing and having a positive impact on those brick-and-mortar businesses.","The overall pharmacy market is growing by 5% per year, expected to continue to grow at a nice straight around 5%. There were [technical difficulty] not surprising to see new entrants. I\u2019d say, importantly, our pharmacies are in outstanding real estate solutions that are fungible. And while our investment in the industry has declined by about 1.5% in the last 18 months, based on growth in other areas and selective asset sales, we remain really confident in the [technical difficulty] and specifically [technical difficulty]. So, we\u2019re certainly comfortable with our investments there.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Spenser Allaway","You mentioned in the opening remarks that you\u2019ve seen a good number of portfolio deals in the market. Is the increase in acquisition guidance for the year related to expectation [ph] to close some of these bigger portfolios or is this just a function of more one-off deals?","John Case","It\u2019s a combination of portfolios as well as one-off transactions, Spenser. So, year-to-date, more than 80% of our acquisitions have been large -- larger negotiated [ph] sale leaseback transactions where we were the only company [ph] in negotiations with those tenants. And what we found is we\u2019re seeing a market that\u2019s really different than the broader sector. [Technical difficulty] because of our access to capital and cost of capital we\u2019re able to execute very large sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiation basis which allow us -- which enable us really to diversify. So, a lot of companies in the sector can\u2019t [technical difficulty]. So, some of the growth is coming from that activity and some of its continued one-off smaller portfolios, given a [technical difficulty] net lease acquisitions market.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","You mentioned that the cap rates on the blended basis were 6.5 for the quarter, I was wondering if you could break that down between the retail and industrial assets?","John Case","The industrial asset, [technical difficulty] really one large asset, a distribution center in Northern California that [technical difficulty]development take out and on development properties we get yields that are anywhere from the 100 to 150 basis points higher than where we get them on a stabilized basis. So, this particular -- on the industrial side our cap rates because it was the development property were actually higher than 6.5%. And then on the retail side, they were just slightly under that, Nick.","Nick Joseph","And you mentioned the watch list but [technical difficulty] meaningful changes to rent coverage ratio for any of your larger [technical difficulty]?","John Case","The information that\u2019s been coming in, sales from our tenants that report are continuing to improve. And that\u2019s why you saw our coverage levels pick up a little bit from where they were in the previous quarter. So, the news on a tenant level is positive and we feel very good about [technical difficulty] really minimal percentage is outstanding on the watch list.","Operator","Our next question will come from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.","Karin Ford","With over $500 million out on the line and in active pipeline, should we expect bond issuance in the second half of the year? And then if you over [technical difficulty] the second quarter acquisitions, just if you could give us your current thoughts on leverage in the current environment.","John Case","We\u2019re pleased with the strength of the balance sheet today, debt to EBITDA at 5.5x. When we look forward, including the accordion, we have about $2 billion of capacity on the revolver. Our overall floating rate debt exposure [technical difficulty] right now. We also have [technical difficulty] we\u2019re anticipating about $150 million in proceeds, asset sales, and we\u2019re also anticipating probably about $75 million retained equity from our business in our operations to help fund our growth. Both, the bond -- really all the long-term capital markets are open to us right now, 10-year bond [technical difficulty] and right around four, three or so. So, that\u2019s attractive. And as the appropriate [technical difficulty] all of our alternatives Karin with regard to financing the acquisitions.","Karin Ford","And my second question is, what are the trends you are seeing on investments [technical difficulty] quarter, so, so far in the third quarter. [technical difficulty] able to maintain them at above average levels for the rest [technical difficulty]?","John Case","Well, right now they are coming at attractive levels. So, I think the second quarter levels are pretty indicative of where [technical difficulty] this quarter, and we\u2019re optimistic that spreads will continue to widen out a bit, so our margins will improve.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brian Hawthorne","Hi. On your industrial portfolio, are there any markets that you\u2019re kind of starting to look at or get less interested in?","John Case","Well, we\u2019ve on the industrial side had a strategy of being in significant markets where there\u2019s good re-leasing opportunities if needed or in mission-critical locations. The markets that [technical difficulty] in right now, that\u2019s a very attractive sector right now. And the valuations are quite attractive. But, we\u2019re not seeing any huge speculative supply issues in any of those markets. So, what is being built by the developers out there is being leased typically, if it\u2019s not already pre-leased, leased during the construction phase. And by the time it\u2019s completed, it\u2019s leased. So, you we\u2019re not looking to exit any specific markets on the industrial side, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Spenser Allaway","Thanks. Sorry, guys. Just a quick follow-up as it relates to development. [Technical difficulty] development represents a small portion of portfolio and it does look like the pipeline has been winding down. Curious how you view development in the current environment specifically with construction cost summarized?","John Case","So, on the development side, it\u2019s always been an attractive way for us to grow. So, we have $25 million under development today. As I said, the yields are more attractive on development than they are on acquisitions. So, we remain bullish on -- we\u2019d like to have more underdevelopment, decent amount of development spend second quarter, but we\u2019re looking to put more development on the books forward. Now to remind everyone, all the development is preleased. We don\u2019t do speculative development and [technical difficulty] existing clients. So, certainly a low-risk form of development.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. ","John Massocca","Quick modeling detail question. What specifically this quarter drove the sizable other income number? I know it\u2019s variable quarter to quarter but I think Q2 2018 was higher than you guys do in most years.","John Case","[Technical difficulty] so that $2.6 million payment in insurance proceeds on one asset, an asset that was destroyed by a tornado and that showed up in our other income area. ","John Massocca","Okay. That makes sense. And then kind of philosophically, I know with [technical difficulty] valuation [technical difficulty] is probably not something that\u2019s top of mind. But how do you look at your industrial assets potentially as a sort of [technical difficulty] if you were to see equity market volatility, given how kind of robust that market has been even at the beginning of this year?","John Massocca","We always [technical difficulty] asset sales, irrespective of [technical difficulty] as opportunities for us to [technical difficulty] capital and drive growth. And those asset sales are done on strategic bases, sometimes involving credits we want to limit our exposure to or markets we want to limit our exposure to or just decrease industry exposure. And sometimes those are -- those sales are driven opportunistically because we get really attractive pricing and a pricing which makes us [technical difficulty] conclude that it makes us more valuable company [technical difficulty] shareholders to sell the property and recycle the proceeds than to hold onto those assets. So, that\u2019s how we look at our entire portfolio and there\u2019s no doubt that currently industrial pricing is attractive but a number of our areas have attractive cap rates currently.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this question-and-answer session portion of Realty Income conference call.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Janeen Bedard, Vice President. Please go ahead.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s third quarter 2017 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that maybe considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.","John Case","Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We are pleased to report another solid quarter with AFFO per share growth of approximately 7%. During the quarter, we completed $265 million of high quality acquisitions, while strengthening our balance sheet raising $444 million in common equity. We ended the quarter with a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7 times, which is the highest it\u2019s been in our company\u2019s history. Given our active investment pipeline, we continued to expect to acquire approximately $1.5 billion in acquisitions this year. We are also reiterating our 2017 AFFO per share guidance of $3.03 to $3.07, which represents annual growth of 5.2% to 6.6%.","Now, let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Paul Meurer","Thanks, John. I will provide some highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Interest expense increased in the quarter by $10 million to $63 million. This increase was primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance in the third quarter, following our March issuance of $700 million of long-term unsecured bonds as well as a smaller gain on our interest rate swaps recognized this quarter as compared to that quarter last year.","Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 4.7% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date, which is in line with our full year projection. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues are 1.8% in the quarter and our guidance remains 1.5% to 2% for all of 2017. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.77 for the quarter versus $0.73 a year ago. Our 2017 FFO guidance remains $2.96 to $3.01 per share. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT defined FFO definition, which includes various non-cash items such as quarterly interest rate swaps, gains or losses, amortization of lease intangibles and the $0.05 charge we incurred in connection with the redemption for our Series F preferred stock back in April. This $0.05 preferred stock redemption charge is the primary difference in our FFO and AFFO guidance. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.77 per share for the quarter, representing a 6.9% increase over the year ago period.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $444 million in equity primarily through our ATM program. Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7.9 years and our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.7 times. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have on just $23 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $1.3 million of debt coming due, the remainder of this year and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. Finally, our overall leverage remains modest with our debt to EBITDA ratio standing at 5.2 times.","In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. Now, let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on these results.","John Case","Thanks, Paul. I will begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3% unchanged versus the year ago period. We continue to expect occupancy to be at or above 98% in 2017. During the quarter, we re-leased 79 properties recapturing approximately 104% of the expiring rent, which is notably above our long-term average. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Year-to-date, we re-leased 181 properties, recapturing approximately 107% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,500 properties, with leases expiring, recapturing over 99% of rent on those properties that will re-lease.","Our recapture rates reflect net effective rents as we seldom incur tenant improvements and leasing commissions. This compares favorably to those companies in our sector who also report this metric. Our same-store rent increased 1% during the quarter and for the year-to-date period, which is consistent with our projected run-rate for 2017. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 251 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial at about 13% of rental revenue.","Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue and drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue. We remain confident in the drugstore industry and speaking in 2010, the number of mail order prescriptions has declined each year and that has coincided with Walgreens positive pharmacy same-store sales growth for 18 consecutive quarters within our retail portfolio over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and\/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today\u2019s retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies this year have been in industries that do not have these characteristics.","We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. Store level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound, both the median and weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties, 2.7 times on a four-walled basis. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years.","Moving on to acquisitions, we completed $265 million of acquisitions during the quarter at near record investment spreads. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.7 billion in acquisition opportunities bringing us to $24.3 billion sourced year-to-date. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 4% of the amount we have sourced. Our low cost of capital allows us to acquire the highest quality properties that provide favorable long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth. Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline, we are reiterating our 2017 acquisitions guidance of approximately $1.5 billion.","Now, I will hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. During the third quarter of 2017, we invested $265 million in 56 properties located in 16 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.2 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 10% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 10 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are theaters, automotive services, and quick-service restaurants. We closed 13 discrete transactions in the third quarter.","Year-to-date 2017, we invested $957 million in 177 properties located in 35 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 97% of the revenues are generated from retail and 3% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 47 different tenants in 21 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, theaters and automotive services. Of the 50 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were about $50 million.","With regard to transaction flow, it continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $7 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 49% of the volume sourced, were portfolios and 51% or approximately $12 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 40% for the third quarter. Of the $265 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 19% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 48-year operating history.","As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain flat in the third quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy averaging 263 basis points in the third quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield that\u2019s our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.","Regarding dispositions, during the third quarter, we sold 17 properties for net proceeds of $25.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an un-levered IRR of 13.6%. This brings us to 45 properties sold year-to-date to $69 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized an un-levered IRR of 10.9%.","In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching a 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1.5 billion and disposition volume between $125 million and $175 million.","With that, I would like to hand it back to John.","John Case","Thanks, Sumit. We were active on the capital markets front in the third quarter issuing approximately $444 million in common equity at an average price to investors of approximately $58 per share. Our equity issuance activity during the quarter came through our ATM program of cost \u2013 this is a cost effective equity issuance allowed us to match fund our acquisitions activity and to prepay $175 million of our bonds that matured in September. We currently have approximately $1.3 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. This provides us with the ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow our company.","Last month, we increased the dividend for the 93rd time in the company\u2019s history. Our dividends year-to-date represent a 6% increase over the year ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. We are proud to be one of only 5 REITs, S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our dividend represents an AFFO payout ratio of 83% based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance.","To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company\u2019s financial position and operating performance and remain confident in the outlook for our business. Our real estate portfolio is performing well. Our acquisition pipeline is robust. Our balance sheet is conservatively capitalized. Our cost of capital remains a competitive advantage, we believe allows us to continue generating favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.","At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from R.J. Milligan with Baird.","R.J. Milligan","Hey, good afternoon guys. Couple of quick questions. John, you mentioned the ATM issuance this quarter, I was just curious if you recall had some comments on sort of the thought process on issuing such a large amount on the ATM and whether or not you have changed the strategy or adjusted the strategy going forward in terms of match funding the acquisitions versus overnight offerings?","John Case","RJ, that\u2019s good question. In the third quarter, we had an opportunity under favorable market conditions to match fund acquisitions and debt maturities. We were also able to save the shareholders about $17 million relative to what we would have had to pay in order to do an overnight offering. So, it worked out particularly well. Going forward, we will consider all forms of equity raising, so whether it be a regular way overnight offering, a marketed offering or additional ATM issuance activity. This was a heavy quarter for us on the ATM. We had, I\u2019d say, half of it was raised through regularly trading and about half of it was raised through reverse inquiry from high-quality institutional investors. So, we were pleased with the pricing. For the quarter, it was about $58 on a gross basis and it worked out well for us, but we will continue to look at all equity raising alternatives in the future.","R.J. Milligan","Great, thanks. And then it looks like in the quarter on the acquisition side, you guys added to your AMC exposure and given some of the weakness that we have seen in the equity at AMC, just curious how you guys got comfortable with increasing your investment within theaters and within AMC specifically?","John Case","Right. So, the equity performance is a bit divorced from the performance of our theaters. So, we are aware that the AMC stock has not traded well recently, but our properties and our theaters are performing quite well. We like the experiential nature of the theater business, and in particular, AMCs. It continues to be a low cost form of entertainment. As you know, the theaters have continued to upgrade their offerings with more comfortable seating and better technology and the full-service, higher quality food and beverage offerings. And as a result, they are seeing a rise in revenue. 2016 was a record year at the box office for the theater industry. So, it\u2019s tough comp year. Year-to-date, we are off about 5% from where we were at this time last year in terms of box office, but most industry experts believe we are going to see a strong fourth quarter as a number of big blockbusters such as Star Wars are released during the holiday. So, they expect the underperformance this year to turn a little bit and become a bit more favorable, but we are very happy with our theaters. The vast majority of our AMCs have been retrofitted with better seating, better technology and again, food and beverage offerings. So, where that\u2019s been done we have seen a 64% increase in revenues versus the pre-reconfiguration revenues for those AMCs. So it really comes down to picking the right properties having strong underwriting structures and we are pleased with that.","Operator","We will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Maybe sticking with theaters more specifically about underwriting the ones you bought in the quarter. I guess, how did you underwrite those from a rent coverage perspective certainly, where they are today and arguably I would assume rent coverages have declined during the year as box office has declined? And then how did you get comfortable, I know you talked a lot about the positives that a lot of theater operators are doing to their assets, but at some point premium video-on-demand is going to come and it\u2019s hard to imagine how that\u2019s not somewhat impactful to the four-walled profitability in the theater even if the exhibitors get hole. So, how do you get comfortable with the potential rent ultimately on renewal is what the exhibitors generating in those four-walls would be less?","John Case","Well, got it. So we have seen on our theaters the rent coverage ratios actually improving and we underwrote these particular theaters that we acquired in the third quarter based on the strong cash flow coverages high-quality of real estate and the fact that they had been renovated. So, they were performing quite well with regard to the premium video-on-demand. There has been discussion in the sector to take it from potentially 90 days which is where it is today down to 45 days for release time. 95% of ticket sales are in the first 40 days after a movies theatrical release. So we don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be a major impact on our theater business from the PVOD discussions that are taking place in addition theaters and studios are negotiating a revenue sharing arrangement with regard to that PVOD business. So that theater should be able to generate some incremental cash flow from that standpoint. So the as you know that the theaters typically have given their higher drop to breakeven higher drop in sales to breakeven they have lower coverage ratios. So something in the low 2s verses in our portfolio average or median which is at 2.8x, because they have more ability to control variable cost. So the coverages once again can be a bit lower.","Michael Bilerman","Right. But the revenue sure that you talked about is will make the exhibiter whole it doesn\u2019t make the four-walled profitability whole of what they are generating in theaters?","John Case","It does contribute to the credit worthiness of the tenant, because it is a source of additional revenues.","Michael Bilerman","Right. But ultimately when they go to resign their lease at that location, the revenues that they can generate in the four walls arguably is less, but like if we are arguing that\u2019s about.","John Case","Yes, I mean that\u2019s not been our experience in what we have seen. We have seen improving operating metrics on our portfolio theaters and we are comfortable with their performance. So, the fact that 95% of the ticket sales are in the first 45 days after release, we just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a material impact on our portfolio of theaters.","Operator","We will take our next question from Collin Mings with Raymond James.","Collin Mings","Hi, good afternoon.","John Case","Hi, Collin.","Collin Mings","First question from me just as far as the disposition guidance here implies a relatively active quarter here in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe just discuss what\u2019s driving that any sort of revisions as far as from a guidance standpoint or things in the pipeline on the asset sale front?","John Case","Sure. So, we have our dispositions guidance from the $125 million to $175 million for the quarter and that\u2019s notably above where we were earlier in the year and these are assets that we are selling that are non-strategic typically. We are taking the proceeds and redeploying them into investments that better fit our investment parameters. What\u2019s driving the increase this year or a couple of office sales that we expect to occur before year end as you know office is not a core product for us. We have acquired some office over the years in larger portfolio transactions and we look to reduce our office exposure. It is non-strategic and it has come down a bit, but we expect it to come down more with these office sales. So, again primarily a couple of office buildings that we plan to sell by year end are driving the upward adjustment and the disposition guidance.","Collin Mings","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe just sticking with that idea of some asset sales just recognizing there is obviously some unique characteristics about your industrial bucket, but can you maybe just update us on the opportunities there may potentially recycle some capital there, particularly just given the current environment and potentially some better yielding opportunities on the retail front?","John Case","Yes. We like the industrial business. It\u2019s primarily distribution close to 70% of it is related to e-commerce activities on what\u2019s happened it\u2019s a business we would like to grow. What\u2019s happened is that that it\u2019s become incredibly competitive and pricey. So, we haven\u2019t aggressively grown that business this year given just the lofty pricing. We kind of stepped back from being more aggressive on that front. It\u2019s not a business we want to sell and liquidate long-term. We like the prospects and we like the investments that we are in. So, we will continue to look and review at acquisition opportunities in that sector and we hope to find some where the risk-adjusted reward, risk-adjusted returns are a bit more favorable than what we have seen in this frothy industrial market here over the last 6 to 9 months.","Operator","Our next question will go to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks. So, just a couple of quick specific questions, just on Gander Mountain, can you update us how many stores do you have vacant currently and plans to maybe re-lease them or sell them?","John Case","Sure. On Gander, first of all, Gander represented less than 0.5% of our overall rents. So, it was not a very material issue for us. That being said, we had 9 locations, of which Camping World was interested in the vast majority of those locations. However, they were seeking rent reductions that didn\u2019t make sense for us given the quality of the real estate. So, 8 of the 9 locations we are marketing to national retailers at what we believe will be more favorable rates from quite strong tenants than what was being offered by Camping World. So, it\u2019s a conscious decision for us to take these assets and go to market with them and we think we will have a better outcome in terms of recovering our pre-bankruptcy rent. Historically, the company has recovered 82% of the pre-bankruptcy rent on the bankruptcies we have been involved in. We think we will do that well or better with regard to the Gander portfolio.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. And then just on the same-store rental revenue growth, you highlighted the industry\u2019s healthcare or health and fitness childcare C-store that drove the majority of the increase, can you maybe talk about sort of at the other end the offsets which sectors did you see maybe weaker growth?","John Case","Yes. Well in this quarter in this quarter, we had the shoe industry which we have a very minor position in, but that contributed to put negative pressure on the same-store rent growth. Going forward, I think it will continue to move around a bit, but we do feel good about health and fitness and C-stores continuing to help drive positive same-store rent growth.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott","Hey, guys. Quick question for you, John, on pharmacy, I know you guys have a positive view of the space and the numbers look pretty good. Just a question if Amazon does get into the business in a material way, I think literally while we are on the call, there was an article that came out saying they got licenses approved for 12 states or something like that, so, just curious your long-term thoughts on the states if Amazon does try to crack the code on this particular business?","John Case","Yes. Of course it\u2019s something we have been considering and discussing and analyzing for quite sometime now. First of all, we are invested in the three most significant players in the pharmacy market with Walgreens, CVS and then Rite-Aid. We have high quality real estate. We have got companies that are affiliated with pharmacy benefit managers, which drive high market shares. So, there are barriers to entry here. They have well-developed retail and distribution that helps give them a competitive advantage and creates barriers to entry. One thing we have looked at it since 2010 we have looked at how mail order pharmacies have performed relative to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. And since 2010, the prescriptions dispensed through mail order pharmacies have declined by 20% and most of that has been picked up by the Walgreens and CVS\u2019 of the world. In addition, the regulation in the drugstore industry will make it difficult we believe for Amazon to penetrate easily this sector. So, if you look at \u2013 if you look at the customers or pharmacies you will see that many of them are on short-term \u2013 shorter term prescriptions and of the baby boom generation maybe the older generation and they like to have the face-to-face consultation with the pharmacist. So, often, they prefer picking their prescriptions up in person and having a discussion with the expert on side effects or other issues related to their drugs. So, that\u2019s something that I think bodes well for the brick-and-mortar business. And Walgreens as all of this is played out and you are probably aware of this, Walgreens\u2019 U.S. pharmacy same-store sales growth has been positive for the last 18 consecutive quarters. So they are doing quite well.","Michael Knott","Right. Thanks for that. And then my other question will just be \u2013 just on the watch list, I know you said it was basically unchanged from where it\u2019s been in the past, but I guess more of a cycle question than a realty income specific portfolio type question, but just curious if you feel the need to position yourself a little bit more defensively to set the margin from a credit standpoint at this point in the cycle or weather sort of seems like continued sunshiny days out there?","John Case","Yes. Well, we continue to experience levels on the watch list in the low 1% area. The portfolio is performing well. I think that\u2019s evidenced by re-leasing spreads by our continued high occupancy. Our portfolio has performed well with regard to the impact of e-commerce. Our properties have \u2013 on the retail side over 90% having service nondiscretionary and\/or low price point component. Of the 22 retail bankruptcies this year, 19 have not had any of those characteristics. So, our type of real estate so far has proven to be pretty resilient to what is recognized as the most significant potential disruptor and that is e-commerce. So, we do not \u2013 portfolio is performing well and we really don\u2019t need to shift into a more defensive posture right now.","Operator","We will go now to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.","Joshua Dennerlein","Hi thank you. I thought Walgreen plans to close about 600 drugstores with the acquisition of 2000 stores from Rite Aid. Do you know if any of those stores are in your portfolio or how we should think about that?","John Case","Yes. So, we don\u2019t \u2013 we have been in dialogue with Walgreens, but of the 1900 they will be purchasing 1900 Rite Aids and that should close in the spring of 2018. We have 15 Rite Aid stores within a 2-mile radius of a Walgreen store and what Walgreens has indicated is the majority of their store closings are going to be former Rite Aids. Our Rite Aids that are within that 2-mile radius of Walgreens have an average lease term remaining of 9 years and Walgreens even if they close those stores will be responsible for lease payments for 9 more years on those stores. So, I don\u2019t think it will have a material impact on us and based on our preliminary discussions we are not hearing that it will.","Joshua Dennerlein","Okay, thank you. And my other question, the wildfires impact \u2013 the wildfires in California did they impact the treasury line of states liner in your portfolio at all?","John Case","They did not. There is no material impact, tragic event. Our hearts go out to the people who were affected out there and we wish them the very best in the recovery efforts. And I would also say that about Irma, Harvey and Maria as well, but on the real estate front, we did not have any material impact to our portfolio from any of those unfortunate events.","Operator","Our next question will go to Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Dan Donlan","Thank you and good afternoon. Just wanted to go back to Gander and unit your decision to try to release those procedures seldom take in our printer negotiations with Gander I mean it is very high confidence level in this 80% and just kind of curious how you think about CapEx in regard to these boxes timeframe you know your setting for yourselves on that?","John Case","Yes we have a high degree of confidence in our asset management team did a thorough analysis of what was being proposed by Gander versus what we were hearing talking to other national leading retail tenants so we think that come out better that\u2019s why we made the decision we think our retention rate in terms of rent is going to be as I said equal or higher than our historical rate of 82% now this will play out over a couple quarters a couple these properties are much closer to being inked up than others but we have five that we think are going to happen pretty quickly and the remainder I will take a little bit more time but even when you factor in the time value aspect of that analysis you were better off you went camping world was proposing so it\u2019s the right economic decision for the company and for the shareholders.","Dan Donlan","Okay, understood in an image, keeping with that, I just went back and looked at your vacant asset sales of last 24 months and it seems that you are averaging about 1% of the portfolio in terms of lease on a trailing 12 basis he sold 50 of the last 2012 and then prior 12 months that you sold about 56 so I am just curious how do you see that trending over time is there certain portion of the portfolio that for whatever reason these assets are vacant your deciding to sell is that portion the portfolio would be opposite moving down I am just kind of curious and why the how those things going to trend in the future if there\u2019s something specific to maybe the last two years or for something specific to Mason the legacy assets that you required before 2000 whatever it may have been?","John Case","Yes, I mean I think we\u2019ll continue to see this trend 4, 5 years ago we started more actively managing the portfolio to optimize its overall performance. So what we get you don\u2019t want to do is keep on the books nonstrategic assets that are potentially creating a drag for the company are creating a drag when we can take that capital and reinvested into properties that are higher quality and meet our investment parameters that being said on these vacant asset sales we\u2019re generating unlevered IRRs of roughly 10% or so. So these have been profitable investment is just that there they become a bit obsolete in some cases or maybe the real estate markets surrounding these assets have changed maybe that that the most logical uses for the market don\u2019t make sense anymore. So I would expect us to continue to sell that what I would say vacant the other vacant assets that are and no longer strategic to our investment philosophy.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I think, I heard you say this but what would the AMCs that you purchased are they fully amenitize of food and alcohol and then when you compare those to the rest of the existing portfolio and I guess it was the AMC portfolio how to they run some coverages compare and how much of the existing portfolio is fully amenetized?","John Case","So the portfolio we purchased yes it was fully amenitize had strong rent coverages. The vast majority of our AMCs had been retrofitted and are there new version and therefore have experience that uptick and overall revenues per theater. So these we believe, we see plenty of theaters and these are of the of the highest quality there in the top quartile of performance for all of AMCs portfolio.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then appreciate some of the color on cap rates you guys have given, but can you just comment on kind of specifically cap rate movement for suburban and rural big-box locations maybe over the past 18 months and investment grade or non-investment grade?","John Case","Sumit, you want to take that.","Sumit Roy","Sure. So most of our investments with regards to big-box falls into what John described as our retail strategy and a very small few approximately 50 off all of the big boxes that don\u2019t fall into a service low price point nondiscretionary element of retail they are with tenants such as Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s et cetera, tenants that we are very, very comfortable with. And what we found in discussions with our tenants that these are assets that are continue to perform well even post our acquisitions, so we have very comfortable with the portfolio that we currently have with regards to big-box.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Neil Malkin","Hi, guys good afternoon. Sorry if I missed but the spreads or the cap rates acquisitions were a good bit higher than they\u2019ve been the last several quarters the function of mix in the asset you purchased or and what kind of to that phenomenon?","John Case","Yes, the spreads were in the third quarter about 260 basis points, which is at the high-end of our range year-to-date we\u2019re running that about 05 to 10, so it was primarily a result of having higher yields. In the third quarter on the acquisitions and we had a favorable [indiscernible] cost of while cost of capital during the quarter as well, so it\u2019s a combination \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of the 2. So the theater transaction, which represented a large component of what we did in the third quarter you had a higher cap rate which help drive the overall higher cap rate for the third quarter.","Neil Malkin","Got it. And then this was all the things are kind of going on with drug stores are you seeing or is it too soon seller expectation change or are you may be changing the way you kind of look at risk to you incremental drug store acquisitions just given the sort of the new things that are coming authentic competition e-commerce, or changing demographics what have you?","John Case","We are comfortable with our drugstore exposure we are at 10.8% of rental revenues for drug stores so we as we say we don\u2019t want any single industry being much more than the low single double digits in terms of what it represents as a percent of our overall rental revenue and then Walgreens our largest drugstore tenant is 6.6% of rental revenues and we are comfortable with that exposure that being said we are not looking to yet we want to remain diversified that created a lot of stability and cunning de-risk our portfolio for the company so we are not looking to materially add to your overall drugstore exposure nor the Walgreens exposure we are comfortable with where we are.","Operator","We take our next question from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Hi, thanks. Most recent balancing questions. So, I guess for Paul you have got a bond in a term loan maturing in January you have historically issued bonds when the longer-term side but do a whole in your debt maturity schedule in 2020 because the coupons in the debt maturities are fairly low in 2% range would you consider going little shorter term and revise?","Paul Meurer","While in general our philosophy remains the same which is generally speaking longer-term unsecured bonds as part of a liability structure but ultimately we look at our debt maturity schedule over time and when there\u2019s holes there we do take advantage of those we think a laddered maturities schedule is prudent relative to how we lay out our maturities and point out there\u2019s a couple gaps out there one of which is obviously 2025 which would speak to the potential for seven-year bonds and then certainly everything is available kind of thereafter overall we look at the maturity schedule and think about what in each of those buckets how much and as such you know you could see us do anything you know from 5 years to 7 years to 10 years to 12 to 20 to 30 were constantly looking at what all the alternatives are and always want to keep our options open as it relates to that you will see us lean towards the unsecured market you know and dealing with institutional bond investors and we got a lot of interest from bond investors at a really all maturities across the curve.","Todd Stender","That\u2019s helpful. And then with the equity raise in Q3 to help with your year lobbying for a higher credit rating and they range in one of the rating agencies holding out for at this point?","Paul Meurer","Well the rating agencies are conducting their own analysis and they are not previewing any of that with us we think we posted it another strong quarter here operationally is currently the balance sheet is in excellent shape so you will see what they come back with.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Well thanks for the Rite Aid stores that you do own I mean at this point of those 69 properties have any of those are the ones that are being sold to Walgreens?","John Case","We don\u2019t know precisely in our preliminary discussions it looks like the range could be anywhere from about 10 to 30 stores but that\u2019s preliminary and that could change one thing we like is that Rite Aid is going to use the proceeds from the sale nearly $5 billion including the termination fee from the original merger to improve its balance sheet Rite Aid is going to take its debt EBITDA from 7.5x down approximately 4.5x and they are also going to have access to Walgreens purchasing network and Rite Aid it will be more focused on the West Coast as they saw more of what they sell to Walgreens that\u2019s going to be along the Eastern Seaboard which will allow Walgreens to fully develop its footprint there. So I think it\u2019s a win-win, Walgreens comes out with significant synergies they\u2019re expecting have maybe up to 400 million in synergies from this transaction in the first 3 to 4 years and they have a bigger footprint and they\u2019re more efficient company and then Rite Aid is still the third largest player more focused out west with a much better balance sheet. So we\u2019re pleased with the outcome of this asset sale even though they couldn\u2019t get the full merger approved by the FTC.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And I know it doesn\u2019t show up as a top 10 of yours, but you have exposure to Fred\u2019s?","John Case","Yes, we don\u2019t talk about, we don\u2019t talk about tenants outside our top 20 but Fred\u2019s is now, we don\u2019t have\u2026","Nick Yulico","Okay. So you don\u2019t have any exposure to Fred?","John Case","No, no.","Nick Yulico","Okay. We trying to get a sense for what give your blended coverage on retail, but what is the coverage like for your pharmacy exposure is it meaningfully different is it lower than are you reported here for overall retail?","John Case","It\u2019s right at the average or the median.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.","John Case","Thanks, Don and we appreciate everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to seeing everyone at NAREIT in a few weeks. Take care. Have a good afternoon.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Inc.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2018 Operating Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter 2018 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q.","We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Sumit Roy.","Sumit Roy","Thanks, Janeen. Welcome to our call today. I am honored to have taken on the role as CEO and I am excited about the future of Realty Income given the strength of our diversified high quality portfolio, strong investment opportunities, and most importantly our talented team.","I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Board and the team to evolve and execute on our strategic priorities, and I am confident Realty Income can continue to capture opportunities to build and enhance our portfolio and drive value for our stakeholders.","I would also like to thank our former CEO, John Case, for his service and guidance over the years. John has played a pivotal role in building the Company into what it is today and we wish him the very best. In my seven years with the Company, I've had the opportunity to meet many of our investors and analysts and I look forward to enhancing this engagement in the future. With that, let\u2019s turn to the business.","We continue to see strength in the current market environment as well as our investment pipeline. During the third quarter, we invested $609 million in high quality property acquisitions and increased AFFO per share by 5.2%. S&P raised our credit rating to A- during the quarter, which was largely driven by our consistent track record of performance and the stability of our portfolio.","Given the current strength in our business, we are increasing the low-end of our 2018 AFFO per share guidance by $0.02, from $3.16 to $3.21, to a range of $3.18 to $3.21. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow.","At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 260 commercial tenants in 48 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties just over 12% of rental revenue.","Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.4% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12.1% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with the service, non-discretionary and\/or low price point component to their business.","We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with ecommerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate with the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.","We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.7x. Our watch list at 1.4% of rent remains consistent with our levels of the last few years.","Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.8%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the year-ago period. We expect occupancy to remain in the mid-98% for 2018. During the quarter, we released 64 properties, recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent.","Year-to-date, we have released 166 properties, recapturing approximately 106% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 2,800 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were released.","Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date. These results are consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 87% of the releases have contractual rent increases.","Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Paul Meurer","Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5% for the quarter and 5.3% year-to-date.","We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, excluding the recent CEO severance payment. We continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in 2018. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1% for the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. This compares favorably to our 2017 run rate due to lower bad debt expense and the timing of certain expenses.","We continue to expect non-reimbursable property expenses to generally be in the 1.5% to 2% range. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.81 for the quarter. As a reminder, a reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.81 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.2% increase.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure, which we believe contributed to the SMP upgrade to A- that Sumit mentioned earlier. Combined with our upgrade to A3 by Moody's a year-ago, we are now one of only a few REITs with at least AA ratings.","During the third quarter, we issued $293 million of common stock primarily through our ATM program. Our overall leverage remains modest as our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains 5.5 times, and our fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.6 times. The weighted-average maturity of our bonds is approximately nine years, which is over a year longer than it was a year-ago.","Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with only $7.3 billion of debt coming due the remainder of this year and only $91 million coming into next year and our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter.","In summary, we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and excellent liquidity. Last week, we were very pleased to announce the expansion of our $3.25 billion unsecured credit facility. The new facility increases the capacity of our revolver from $2 billion to $3 billion, plus a $1 billion accordion expansion feature.","The initial maturity date is March 2023 plus 2 6-month extension options, thereafter. The increased line capacity enhances our liquidity and provide ready access to capital for our property acquisition efforts. Our borrowing spread decreased to 77.5 basis points over LIBOR, which matches the tightest pricing grid in the REIT industry.","As part of the recast, we also issued a new $250 million term loan with a tenor of just under 5.5 years. Concurrently, we executed a floating to fixed interest rate swap, which effectively fixed the interest rate on the term loan at 3.89%.","23 lenders participated in the new credit facility, many of whom we have done business with for several years. We very much appreciate the long-term support of our banking partners as we've grown over the years and we welcomed the lenders who are new to the relationship with Realty Income.","Now, let me turn the call back over to Sumit.","Sumit Roy","Thanks Paul. I\u2019ll now move to our investment activity. During the third quarter of 2018, we invested $609 million in 238 properties located in 25 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.34% and with a weighted-average lease term of 15.3 years.","On a revenue basis, approximately 62% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 99.4% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 19 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, restaurants, and dollar stores.","We closed 14 discrete transactions in the third quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we've invested $1.465 billion in 591 properties located in 37 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.32%, and with a weighted-average lease term of 14.4 years. On a revenue basis, 67% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants.","96% of the revenues are generated from retail and 4% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 37 different tenants in 20 industries. Of the 39 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 5 transactions were above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy.","During the third quarter, we sourced more than $8.4 billion in acquisition opportunities. Of the opportunities sourced during the third quarter, 58% were portfolios and 42% or approximately $3.6 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $26 billion in potential transaction opportunities.","Investment-grade opportunities represented 39% of the volume sourced for the third quarter. Of the $609 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 7% were one-off transactions.","As to pricing, cap rates have essentially remained unchanged in the third quarter. Investment-grade properties continue to trade around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trade from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.","Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted-average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 154 basis points in the third quarter, which was slightly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted-average cost of capital.","Our investment pipeline remains robust and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remained one of the only publicly traded net lease companies that has the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis.","Year-to-date, 81% of our acquisitions have been sale leaseback transactions. We remain confident in achieving our 2018 acquisition guidance of approximately $1.75 billion.","Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 20 properties for net proceeds of $35.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.3% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.8%. This brings us to 60 properties sold year-to-date for $83 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.9%.","Largely due to the timing of dispositions, we are decreasing our disposition guidance for 2018 from approximately $200 million to approximately $150 million. In September, we increased the dividend for the 98 time in our Company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year ago period.","We have increased our dividends every year since the companies listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index.","To wrap it up, we are pleased with the current state of the company and remain excited about our prospects moving forward. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.","At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Christy McElroy with Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] on for Christy. Wondering if you could provide some color on any additional acquisitions and process that are on contract currently, just to get a better sense for timing at the end of the year. And based on opportunities you're seeing in the market today, would you expect a similar pace of acquisitions in 2019?","Sumit Roy","So as we've always indicated acquisitions are very, very difficult to forecast year out. What I can share with you, that in the fourth quarter we have a very healthy pipeline. We feel very confident about meeting our $1.75 billion guidance. We will probably exceed it by a bit. But at this point to talk about what we are planning on doing in 2019 will be premature.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then just one quick follow-up on the dispositions during the quarter. Was there anything in particular that drove the cap rate a bit higher this quarter and what should we expect as far as pricing for remaining asset sales in the balance of the year?","Sumit Roy","The cap rates are largely driven by the types of assets that are being sold. We did reduce our guidance from $200 billion to $150 billion and that was largely being driven by timing and some opportunistic sales that we pulled from the market. So we feel like, our IRR should be right around 8%, which we have historically achieved and should be able to get to $150 million in sales by the end of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And next we will go to Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.","Karin Ford","Hi, good morning out there. Sumit, congratulations on the new role. The Company's last two press releases both mentioned that you'd be working with the Board to evolve the company strategy. Can you elaborate what that evolution might entail? And could we see \u2013 be seeing investments in new asset classes or a change in the way management looks to create value for shareholders?","Sumit Roy","Thank you for your question, Karin. What I would want to emphasize is that we will continue to execute on our current strategy as we believe the market remains very strong for the product that we are pursuing. And that was quite evident in the results that we achieved year-to-date as well as in the third quarter.","The team that we have in place here has largely been together for the last five years and was the architect and devised the current strategy that we have in place that we've been executing quite successfully. Having said that, we are always looking for new avenues to grow. Four or five years ago, six years ago, we entered into the industrial market. Right along then, we also explored agriculture and ended up making an investment in Napa Valley.","So to look at new avenues of growth is something that we are constantly doing and we\u2019ll continue to do so. But having said that, we believe there's enough runway in our current strategy and we feel very confident of meeting growth rates on a risk adjusted basis that will be viewed as appropriate for this company.","Karin Ford","Thanks for that. My second question is regarding investments. You've had a lot of successes here with corporate sale leasebacks. Do you think that could continue into next year or do you expect the changing lease accounting rules might reduce demand for those deals?","Sumit Roy","The changes in the lease rules have not impacted our discussions with our relationship tenants. In fact, if anything and we've spoken about this in the past, the viable market for sale leaseback continues to grow and continues to grow with tenants that traditionally wouldn't engage in those conversations. So our take on our pipeline for 2019, the current discussions that we're having with our existing relationships and some new relationships lead us to believe that the lease changes will have a very \u2013 will have no impact and the market, the viable market for sale leaseback will continue to grow.","Operator","And our next question will come from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for taking the question. Sumit, the last time you had a very attractive cost of capital? Maybe 2 years ago, you chose to buy higher quality to a lot of drug stores, that exposure in certain areas. Just wondering now you\u2019re sitting here relative, you have a very good cost of capital to maybe other REIT asset classes. What do you plan to do with it maybe similar and maybe different?","Sumit Roy","Well, what we hope to believe is that the higher cost \u2013 the lower cost of capital that was afforded to us was a function of the strategy that we had implemented and what we had highlighted to the market as the types of retail products and the industrial products that we were most interested in.","And the fact that we've continued to be quite successful and once again find ourselves with a very low cost of capital. On a relative basis, we've always had a low cost of capital and if you look at what's happened over the last three to four years, the cost of equity for us has been on a relative basis amongst the lowest. Now with these two upgrades, the cost of debt has become even lower than most of our peers.","So on a blended basis, we've always had the advantage of having a very low cost of capital. I don't think that that necessarily comes into the calculus in terms of defining what a strategy needs to be. We want to be very true to anything. We believe we have a strategy in place that allows us to create a balance sheet and a portfolio that can do very well regardless of what the economic conditions are.","And we are going to continue to do that. And the fact that we have a very low cost of capital today, I don't think necessarily is going to change the strategy that we have in place and some of the other avenues that we are continuing to explore, given what we find in the cost of capital.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. And then just \u2013 second question I know we've talked over the last couple of weeks on this and I think everyone's just trying to get a better sense of how this change occurred? How it was taught about it seemed a bit sudden in terms of John's departure.","So I'm just wondering if you can give us some sense of how this was being contemplated anymore \u2013 more thoughts on just the discussions and maybe just to build off of one of the earlier questions on. I know you'd said nothing too different, but maybe what would you be doing incremental from here?","Sumit Roy","So to answer the question around the suddenness, I mean this was a decision that the Board and John mutually agreed upon. These are discussions that oftentimes happens. When you think about is there a good time for a change and see that never it really is.","And \u2013 but the Board and John mutually agreed to part ways, the Board believe that making the transition now is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders and given the depth and strength of our management team and it was believe that doing it now versus down the road was the right decision.","The speed question that you raised Vikram, I've said there are two schools of thought on that one, which is the more traditional route where you typically have a three to six month transition period. And that works in a situation where the incoming CEO may not be immediately ready to take on the reins.","But in this case, both the Board and John concurred that I was ready to take on the reins and incorporating a transition period would have just delayed the inevitable. So from what's transpired, I think that should pretty much address how things have come about.","In terms of what I'm going to do differently, the advantage that I've had is, I've worked with this team and have been part of this team for the last seven years and this team by and large has been intact for all of that time.","I've been along with the team very much part and parcel of defining the strategy and then executing on the strategy. So there's a sense of continuity that we continue to have and that is going to bode well.","So if you're looking to see for any dramatic changes in terms of how we\u2019re going to conduct business, et cetera. I don't believe, you're going to see that. So its business as usual and what I might do slightly differently is be on the road a little bit more, be a bit more visible in terms of meeting shareholders, et cetera.","And in terms of internally, and I think I've mentioned this in some individual conversations is have a flatter organizational structure where my connectivity with my direct reports i.e., all of the EPVs in the company, is going to be, just have one degree of separation. So those are very minor changes. But that's more in line with how I would like to run the Company, but in terms of strategy, et cetera. It's business as usual.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Hi Sumit, congratulations on the promotion.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, Todd.","Todd Stender","When you look at the 7-Eleven acquired in the quarter were these sale leasebacks and can you describe the lease terms, these are rent escalator, rent coverage, just some of the specifics? Thank you.","Sumit Roy","Sure. Yes. These are all sale leasebacks. I sort of alluded to the fact that we get very good pricing. I would go so far as to say that the pricing that we get on sale leasebacks that we are doing directly with 7-Eleven is in the tune of around 75 to 50 basis points higher than what you would get in the one-off market. They are 16-year average lease terms and they have a 7.5% growth every five.","Todd Stender","Okay. Thank you. And then Paul just looking at the balance sheet, your line balance was getting up close to $800 million just at the end of Q2, but that was on the $2 billion line and that used to be a big number, but relative to the size of the company, maybe not so. But on a $3 billion line, could we see that balance grow even higher? It may look on an absolute basis large, but maybe on a comparable basis, not so much. But how big that the line balance for you guys get?","Paul Meurer","So I think that's fair to consider from an overall risk management standpoint and variable rate debt exposure. These are relative to our peers and\/or how we view the balance sheet. Keep in mind that the larger line was more a function of giving us the liquidity and flexibility on the acquisition front that we thought was appropriate as opposed to trying to foreshadow any change in balance sheet philosophy.","Relative to the current balance on the line, I'll remind everyone that we closed on a $250 million term loan just a week or week or so ago, which then immediately was applied to that line. That was a funded term loan. And in addition, we have some property sales activity in the fourth quarter. So from a funding standpoint, the line balance will not be a very large.","It's currently, as of a week ago was under $600 million after that term loan repayment. And we're not in a position where we need to access capital for any particular reason because our leverage metrics are very good as well. But all forms of it are available to us and we'll be taking a look at all forms of it on a go forward basis, but we're not in a position right now where we have any immediate funding needs.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James.","Collin Mings","Thanks and congratulations Sumit.","Sumit Roy","Thanks Collin.","Collin Mings","Just first question for me, just going back to Karin's question actually. As your platform continues to grow, just maybe how are you currently thinking about international opportunities specifically?","Sumit Roy","We don't have immediate plans to go international. But like I've said, all avenues are on the table and we continued to look at avenues of growth of which to ignore international would be, wouldn't be correct. But we don't have any immediate plans to go international.","And like I've said, Collin, we believe we have enough runway in executing our current strategy that gives us comfort that any one of these new avenues that we come up with, we will have time to test it, make sure that this is something that fits our overall strategy of conservatism and risk adjusted growth rates, and at the appropriate time we'll be ready to speak with the market about it, but no immediate plans.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then on \u2013 as far as the 7-Eleven, you touched on the cap rate differential between what you think the pricing would be on the one-off market versus, again being a portfolio. Like you suggested, maybe 75, 50 basis points. Just maybe making a little bit broader picture here, how are you thinking about the portfolio premium or discount in the marketplace right now and at maybe what threshold of \u2013 in terms of deal size do you start to see that really take effect?","Paul Meurer","Look over 80% of what we did was sale leasebacks this particular quarter. And what we're finding is with these large institutional tenants that we have very deep relationships with. They are very open to having discussions around adjusting cap rates to accommodate the changing cap rate environment and that accrues to our favor. The fact that we've been able to do north of $1 billion of 7-Eleven in the last two years and get cap rates that are off of the one-off market to the tune of 75 basis points speaks to that point. So we feel like that there are discounts that we get by entering into these portfolio transactions, especially with sophisticated institutional tenants.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.","John Massocca","Good afternoon. And first off, congratulation Sumit on the new role.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John.","John Massocca","So were there any other tenant industries that particularly dominated this quarter's acquisition activity? I know with the 7-Eleven, obviously, C-stores would be one of them, but anything outside of that?","Sumit Roy","There were C-stores and restaurants. Those were the two dominant areas of industries.","John Massocca","And my second question here, were those casual dining or QSR?","Sumit Roy","Casual dining.","John Massocca","Okay. And then does the current strategy leave open the potential for M&A activity, especially given the strong cost of capital? Or are you really still primarily focused on what you've done in the last couple of quarters in terms of larger sale leaseback transactions and given how strong that market has been for you guys?","Sumit Roy","Yes. Look we control the discussion around the sale leaseback market. These are organic acquisitions that have served us very well over the last few years. M&A is something that we don't count on and that's not to say that we are averse of doing M&A transactions. This Company has had a history of having done some of those, but that is not something that we control and we don't count on that. We are very happy with the runway that we have executing our current strategy and the numbers speak for themselves. So John, if you're asking this is something that we are aggressively going to start pursuing, then the answer is no, but we're not averse to M&A either.","John Massocca","Color is very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we'll go to Christy McElroy with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Christy. So the question is just regarding the CEO transition. So did john get a bonus for 2018 or an accrued bonus relative to his comp level?","Sumit Roy","The severance was largely negotiated Michael and it was in line with his \u2013 the agreements that were in place as well as his employment agreement. So the 28 \u2013 approximately $28 million that we have listed was pretty much in line with his employment agreement and the agreement around his stock awards.","Michael Bilerman","I mean, if you read the proxy, it was generally in line with that, but we're sitting here in November effectively not \u2013 from a timing perspective, why would he agree to forego $10 million of a bonus if he worked basically until January 1 of next year. And I don't know many people that would give up $10 million, whether he could have rolled into next year and then decided to do it?","Sumit Roy","No, the fact that we \u2013 I think we\u2019ve also just highlighted the fact that $9 million of it had already been accrued. So you can pretty much assume that what had been accrued for this year was part of the $28 million that was paid out. So I don't believe it's accurate for you to assume that his pro rata share, he had to forego that.","End of Q&A","Operator","And this does conclude the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, Caroline, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you all at NAREIT conference next week. Thank you.","Operator","That will conclude today's conference. Thank you, everyone. You may now disconnect."],"18151":["Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) Q3 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2014  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Janeen Bedard - Associate Vice President","John Case - Chief Executive Officer","Paul Meurer - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Sumit Roy - Chief Operating Officer and CIO","Analysts","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","","Operator","Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2014 Operating Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard, Associate Vice President. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you, operator. And thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s Third Quarter 2014 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.","John Case","Thanks, Janeen. And good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our call. We're pleased with our third quarter results with AFFO per share increasing by 6.7% to $0.64. As announced in yesterday\u2019s press release, we are reiterating our 2014 AFFO guidance per share of $2.55 to $2.57 so we anticipate another solid year of earnings growth. Paul will provide you with an overview of the earnings numbers. Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks John. As usual, I will briefly comment on our financial statements and provide some highlights of our financial results for the quarter. I\u2019ll start by highlighting a few line items in our income statement. Total revenue increased 16.6% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year, as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at September 30th was approximately $912 million.","On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $52.8 million. This increase was primarily due to our two recent bond offerings, the $350 million tenure notes issued in June and a $250 million 12 year notes issued in September. Interest expense was also impacted this quarter by the reclassification of approximately one month of preferred dividends as interest expense. Because we issued the redemption notice for our outstanding Preferred E Stock before quarter-end, we needed to reclassify the Preferred E Stock as a liability at quarter-end and about one month of preferred dividends as interest expense. This increased interest expense during the quarter by $1.2 million. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.7 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.3 times.","General and administrative expenses in the quarter were approximately $11 million, a $5.6 million decrease from a year ago. G&A expenses year-to-date were $35.5 million, a $4.9 million decrease from the first nine months of last year. This decrease in G&A comes from lower acquisition transaction cost, $589,000 year-to-date versus $1.7 million of transaction cost for acquisitions in 2013 as well as lower stock compensation cost.","We had a one-time unusual $3.7 million expense during the third quarter of 2013 due to accelerated vesting of our long-term stock compensation. Our projection for G&A for 2014 remains approximately $50 million. Our G&A year-to-date as a percentage of total rental and other revenues remains well at only 5.3% of revenues. And our current projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is approximately $53.5 million.","Property expenses were $12.8 million in the quarter. However, this amount includes $8.3 million of property expenses reimbursed by tenants. So the property expenses that we are responsible for were approximately $4.5 million for the quarter. Our projection for 2014 of property expenses that we will be responsible for has increased slightly to approximately $17 million from a prior projection of $16.5 million. And our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 is approximately $19 million.","Provisions for impairment includes $495,000 of impairments we recorded on one sold property and three properties held for sale at September 30. Gain on sales were approximately $11 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO.","Excess of redemption value over carrying value preferred shares redeemed refers to the $6 million non-cash redemption charge for the unamortized original issuance costs which were paid when issuing and preferred E shares back in 2006.","Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.64 for the quarter, this would have been $0.67 per share, but it was reduced by $0.03 due to the redemption charge on the Class E preferred shares. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution and dividends was also $0.64 per share for the quarter. We again, increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to current annualized amount of approximately $2.197 per share.","Briefly, turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. As you know in mid-September, we raised $250 million of 12 year bonds priced at a yield of 4.178%. Obviously we are pleased with our continued access to low cost, long-term capital in the bond market. The primary purpose of this offering was to redeem our $220 million of preferred E stock, which had a coupon of 6.75%. So, this transaction resulted in annual cash expense savings of almost $5.7 million.","Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rate and continue to be rated BAA1, BBB plus have a weighted average maturity of 7.5 years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had only a $45 million balance at September 30th. However, $220 million preferred E redemption closed earlier this month. So, the facility has an effective balance of $265 million. We did assume approximately $7 million of additional in place mortgages during the third quarter, but we also repaid $56 million of mortgage principal during the quarter. So, our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter-end decreased to approximately $844 million.","Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure to rise in interest rate that we have is on just $39 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $8 million of mortgage principal payments due in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $120 million in 2015. Our next bond maturity is only $150 million due in November of 2015 and our maturity schedule is well latter thereafter. Currently, our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 32% and our preferred stock outstanding is less than 3% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at quarter-end was only 5.9 times.","Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on these results.","John Case ","Thanks, Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overall of the portfolio, which is performing well and continues to generate dependable cash flow for our shareholders. Occupancy remains consistent with the previous quarter at 98.3% based on the number of properties with 74 properties available for lease out of 4,284 properties. Occupancy has held steady for three consecutive quarters now and is up 20 basis points from one year ago. Occupancy based on square footage and economic occupancy are both 99.1%. Based on what we're seeing today in our schedule rollover, we expect our occupancy to remain fairly stable for the remainder of the year.","The third quarter was our most active quarter this year for lease rollover activity in the portfolio with leases expiring on 81 properties. Of these assets, we released 70 to existing tenants, 7 to new tenants and sold 4 properties recapturing a 100% of expiring rents on the properties we released. Our property portfolio management activities speak to the unique and extensive experience we have seen in our business full cycle where leases signed more than 20 years ago are rolling.","Over our 45 year operating history, we have successfully executed more than 1,700 lease rollovers. We have a team of 36 professionals, many of whom have been with the company for over a decade working in our property portfolio management department. We believe our expertise in this area is a significant asset to our company.","Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the third quarter, our properties were leased to 231 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 78% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties, while 22% is from non-retail, the largest component being industrial and distribution. This diversification continues to enhance the predictability of our cash flow.","At the end of the third quarter, our top 10 and top 20 tenants represented 37.5% and 53.5% of rental revenue respectively. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. There have been no material changes to the composition of tenants in our top 20 since last quarter. None of the top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings. The rental revenue from these non-investment grade rated tenants represents over half of the rent from our top 20 tenants.","Within our portfolio no single-tenant accounts for more than 5.4% of rental revenue, so the diversification by tenant remains quite favorable. Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.4% of rental revenue, which is up slightly from last quarter. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5.1% of rental revenue, which is also up slightly from last quarter. Our 20th largest tenant represents only 1.2% of rental revenue and our 30th largest tenant accounts for just over 0.5% of rental revenue. We also added four new tenants to our portfolio this quarter, further diversifying our tenant base.","As far as industries, convenience stores remain our largest industry at 10% of rental revenue and have continued to decline as a percentage of rental revenue for 14 quarters in a row. Our second largest industry is Dollar stores at 9.6%, down from 9.8% last quarter. As many of you know, there has been a lot in the news regarding the top three players in the Dollar store industry. With Dollar Tree and Dollar General competing by Family Dollar.","The process remains fluid and one we continue to monitor. Family Dollar shareholders will determine the ultimate outcome here. We would expect the FTC's ruling on any trust concerns associated with the merger to impact the outcome.","We remain quite comfortable with our Dollar Store portfolio. We continue to like the deep discount orientation of the Dollar store industry as lower and middle income consumers remain focused on value shopping. Family Dollar and Dollar General remain the dominant players in this industry.","Our Family Dollar and Dollar General portfolios have an average lease term of 13 years with the unit level cash flow converge well above the overall average cash flow coverage in our retail portfolio of 2.6 times. A Family Dollar merger with either side should not have a material impact on our operations.","Moving onto property type, retail continues to represent our primary source of rental revenue, currently at 78%, with industrial and distribution at 10%; office at 7%; and the remainder evenly divided between light manufacturing and agriculture. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service; non-discretionary; and\/or low price point component to their business.","Today more than 90% of our retail revenue come from businesses with these characteristics, which better positions them to successfully operate in all economic environments and to compete with e-commerce. Our weighted average remaining lease term continues to be approximately 10.5 years.","Our same-store rents increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.5% year-to-date consistent with our expectations for the foreseeable future. The industry is contributing most of our quarterly same-store rent growth for convenient stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 46% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade tenants.","Again, we define an investment grade rated company as having an investment grade rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies. This revenue percentage is up from 40% one year ago. We continue to generate solid rental growth from these investment grade tenants. Nearly 70% of our investment grade leases as a percentage of rental revenues have rental rate increases in them which average approximately 1.4% annually, consistent with our historical portfolio rental growth rate. Overall, investment grade rental growth is about 1%. In addition to tenant credit, the store level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. On average, our rent coverage ratio on our retail properties is 2.6 times on four wall basis.","Moving on to acquisitions. We continue to see a very high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced over 7 billion in acquisition opportunities and year-to-date nearly 21 billion, making this already our second most active year ever for sourced transactions. There continues to be a lot of capital pursuing these transactions and we're seeing some very aggressive pricing in transaction structures in the market today. We continue to remain selective and disciplined in our investment strategy, investing at attractive risk adjusted returns and spreads for our shareholders.","During the quarter, we completed $182 million in property level acquisitions at a cash cap rate of 7.4%, bringing us to $1.24 billion in acquisitions for the year at an initial cash cap rate of 7.1%. We're pleased with the yields, returns and spreads we're achieving.","Given our low cost of capital, we continue to be able to invest at accretive levels. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital continue to be well above our historical averages. So we are investing at spreads that are nearly a 100 basis points wider than our long-term average. We anticipate closing approximately $1.4 billion in acquisitions this year, making 2014 our second most acquisitive year ever in our company\u2019s history. Given the current environment, we\u2019re establishing initial acquisitions guidance for 2015 of $500 million to $800 million. As you know, it\u2019s notoriously difficult to predict future acquisitions activity. Volumes can be lumpy and can change significantly from quarter-to-quarter. However, we continue to see a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities.","Given the backdrop of this acquisitions environment, we are increasing our asset sales this year from $75 million to approximately $100 million to take advantage of a more aggressive market for buying; this is twice our initial expectation of $50 million at the beginning of the year. During the quarter, we sold 11 properties for $33.5 million which brings us to 28 properties sold to-date for $53 million. These are our non-strategic assets being sold at attractive pricing.","Let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss in more detail our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. During the third quarter of 2014, we invested $182 million in 49 properties located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.2 years. As a reminder, our initial cap rates or cash not GAAP which tend to be higher due to straight lining of rent. We define cash cap rates contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property including all expenses borne by Realty Income.","On a revenue basis, 53% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 96% of the revenues are generated from retail and 4% are from industrial and distribution. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are home improvement and drugstores.","Year-to-date 2014, we invested $1.24 billion in $439 properties located in 42 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with the weighted average lease term of 12.6 years. Of the total amount, approximately $329 million was invested in non-investment grade retail properties. On a revenue basis, 70% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail, 7% are from industrial, distribution and manufacturing and 7% are from office. These assets are leased to 51 different tenants in 27 industries. Some of the more significant industries represented are Dollar stores, home improvements and drugstores.","Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $7 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Year-to-date we have sourced approximately $21 billion in potential transaction opportunities, which as we mentioned last quarter would put us on pace to make 2014 the year with the second largest volume sourced in our company's history.","Of these opportunities, 75% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 25% or $5 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 48% for the quarter. Of the $182 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, approximately 48% were one-off transactions. 69% of the transactions closed in the third quarter were relationship driven. We remained selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing on less than 6% of the deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 45 year operating history.","As to pricing, cap rates remained tight in the third quarter with investment grade properties trading from mid 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from low-to-mid 6% to low 8% cap rate range.","As John highlighted, we had a very active quarter for dispositions and have increased our dispositions guidance to approximately $100 million to take advantage of the propitious cap rate environment. During the quarter, we sold 11 properties for $33.5 million at an unlevered IRR of just over 12%. This brings us to 28 properties sold year-to-date for $53.3 million at an unlevered IRR of approximately 11% and a net cap rate of 8.1% on the leased properties sold.","Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy, averaging 224 basis points in the third quarter and a 190 basis points year-to-date, which was significantly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. We are continuing to make investments above our historic spreads, whilst improving our real estate portfolio, tenant quality, credit quality and overall diversification.","In conclusion, the third quarter investments remained healthy at $182 million. Year-to-date we have invested $1.24 billion, while sourcing approximately $21 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above historical level as a tight cap rate environment in the third quarter was more than offset by improving cost of capital. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We also took advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. We remained confident of reaching our updated investment and disposition goals of approximately $1.4 billion and approximately $100 million respectively for 2014.","With that, I would like to hand it back to John.","John Case","Thanks Sumit. Regarding our capital raising activities, as Paul mentioned, we've been quite active in the capital markets year-to-date. We have raised over $1.2 billion in permanent and long-term capital to finance our business. The majority being equity with the remainder being 10 and 12 year unsecured bonds. So, our balance sheet continues to be in excellent shape with two-thirds equity and one-third debt and that debt being predominantly long-term fixed rate. We currently have more than $1.2 billion available on the line to support future acquisitions activity so we continue to have excellent liquidity.","Regarding earnings and guidance, we continue to generate healthy per share earnings growth, while maintaining a conservative capital structure. Our third quarter FFO and AFFO per share of $0.64 represented increases of 8.5% and 6.7% respectively from the period one year ago.","As mentioned earlier, we are reiterating our 2014 AFFO guidance per share of $2.55 to $2.57, representing earnings growth of about 6% to 7%. We are anticipating another solid year for earnings growth next year and we are initiating 2015 guidance with AFFO per share from $2.66 to $2.71 implying year-over-year growth of approximately 4% to 6% over the midpoint of our 2014 range; and FFO per share of $2.67 to $2.72 which at the midpoint of the range represents an increase of approximately 4% over the midpoint of our 2014 range.","Our focus continues to be the payment of reliable monthly dividends that grow over time. During the third quarter, we declared the 77th dividend increase since the company\u2019s listing in 1994. Over this 20-year time period as a publicly traded company, we\u2019ve grown the dividend by a compounded average annual growth rate of 4.6%. We remain committed to the durability and consistent growth of the dividend. Our payout ratio year-to-date has been 85.5% of our AFFO which is a level we continue to be comfortable with.","As I am sure many of you saw in our separate press release yesterday, we\u2019re pleased to announce Steve Sterrett, CFO of Simon Property Group as the 8th Member of our Board of Directors and 7th independent Board Member. We welcome Steve to Realty Income and look forward to working with him as a Member of our Board. Steve has spent 26 years at Simon Property Group, the largest real-estate company in the world and has spent the last 14 years as the CFO building a reputation of excellence in the industry. His depth of experience and relevance in our industry will enable him to be a valuable contributor to our Board.","Finally to wrap it up, we continue to be pleased with our performance for the year. We\u2019re seeing healthy volumes of acquisition opportunities and we\u2019re on track to have our second most active year for acquisitions in our company\u2019s history. We will remain selective and disciplined with regards to our investment strategy and we'll continue to acquire high quality properties quite accretively with our cost of capital advantage and at attractive risk adjusted returns for our shareholders.","At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. ","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America","Hi, good afternoon guys. I was just hoping you could give us a little color on the 2015 acquisition guidance, sort of how you came to that number and then background on any spreads or cap rates we should thinking about with regards to that number? And just optically, I know you've kind of stated and stressed that you want to be selective, but just how we should be thinking about that versus the number you put out there for 2014 for the year?","John Case","Okay Juan. Let me just spend a moment on acquisitions. We continue to see inactive pipeline of sourced acquisition opportunity, so there is good transaction flow. And as we said, our investment spreads are well above our historical average. But there is also a lot of capital pursuing these opportunities. So, it has been competitive and we remain disciplined and selective with our investment strategy. We're seeing some very aggressive pricing out there among some of our peers and structures, looking at replacement cost; we're seeing assets trade sometimes at 50% above the replacement costs. We\u2019re seeing properties that have rents that are well above market rents trading at aggressive pricing. Then we\u2019re seeing some pretty aggressive structures as well. So we\u2019re seeing for instance and some of the casual dining transactions that have crossed our gas, we\u2019re seeing them get dine at very high coverage ratios, ratios we\u2019re not comfortable with.","So we\u2019ve been in this business a long time and I think we have a pretty good idea of what\u2019s going to work and what\u2019s not going to work long-term. Clearly, given our cost of capital, we could do these transactions and initially that would be quite accretive. But when you look at them over the long-term, if they\u2019re not structured and priced properly, you\u2019re going to have some low IRRs and pay the price on the residual, and they could actually the value destructive to our shareholders long-term.","Our range for acquisitions for 2015 reflects the environment we\u2019re in today. As you know that environment can change significantly from quarter-to-quarter even month-to-month. I mean if an aggressive buyers out there that all of a sudden slows down or exits the market that could have a material impact on our volume and potentially pricing.","So at this point, predicting acquisitions guidance year in advance is always difficult. And we\u2019ve always wanted to be accurate, but not over promise. Historically, we\u2019ve exceeded our initial guidance. If you look at last year, we had $1 billion acquisitions guidance number in October of 2013 for 2014 and we're going to exceed that by about 40%. But as usual, we'll just have to see how that year shapes up next year, but one thing we're not going to do is abandon our investment discipline simply to generate volume.","Let me speak to your second point in that spreads and cap rates. Sumit addressed that on the call, but investment grade cap rates we see them get a little tighter. Investment grade is running from the mid 5s to the high 6s and non-investment grade the low 6s all the way up to 8%. As far as spreads go for the year, we've invested spreads of 190 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital. In the third quarter that was 220 basis points. And given our cost of capital today, we're looking at 240 basis points, which are near our all time record spreads. So, they remained quite attractive, but again we've got to look at this business beyond just what it's going to do over the next quarter or next year and we're looking at 10 or 11 year average 13 year or 14 year average lease terms. So, hopefully that answers your question.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America","","Definitely very thorough. Thanks John. And just a quick follow-up if you don't mind. Given how aggressive pricing is, what\u2019s the viewer on dispositions for 2015 is it anything big to the numbers?","John Case","We've assumed for 2015 $50 million for now and we're going to watch that pretty closely. We started out this year assuming $50 million and we're going to end up selling $100 million approximately. So, the environment continues to be heated. We're going to go ahead and move some assets, some additional assets off our watch list and take advantage of the strong bid in the market. And I think pricing will improve here in the next few months is my prediction in terms of disposition. So, in the model we have $50 million, but we\u2019re going to watch that pretty closely and if the environment continues to look like it does today, we could see increasing that up to $100 million.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America","Great. Thank you very much for the time.","John Case","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Hi, thanks guys. Sumit you gave cap rate ranges for investment grade and non-investment grade, tentative properties. Were those for the properties you acquired in Q3? Just want to get the range of cap rates you acquired because the blended 7.4 yield I thought was pretty high even though it worth payable to land over 50% investment grade.","Sumit Roy","Yes. So, Todd those were the ranges of assets that we saw transact in the market. We didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t believe we bought anything in the low or mid 5% cap rate range. The main reason for the yield that we were able to achieve in the third quarter of a 7.4 was being driven by 18% of the volume was coming from our build-to-suit development funding, as well as some of our forward commitments, which typically has been a much smaller portion of the total acquisition volume, it\u2019s been right around 3%, but in the third quarter that represented closer to 18%. And clearly the mix of investment grade and non-investment grade also played a part in why we were able to achieve the higher yield.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","That\u2019s helpful. And then just kind of just switching gears, can you share how some of the re-leasing discussions went with tenants? It looks like while you renewed 77 leases, just looking back at the Q2 results, about 50, only 50 leases were coming due in the second half of the year. So, I just want to see, the tenants comfort level in renewing leases ahead of time, it looks like a fair amount of those were maturities not coming due just yet?","John Case","That's exactly right. I mean we're always looking for, Todd, managing our rollover and if we can enter into discussions that are advantageous for us and our tenants to re-lease early, we will do that. So, that's why you see that 77 number versus what was scheduled to roll in the quarter. So, we're pleased with that and we'll continue to do that. We're just trying to stay in front of these maturities and our leases and stay in front of them a couple of quarters or longer if we can even.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Is there a comfort level with tenants anything that you can, any trends are developing that tenants are able to renew or their willingness to renew it little early, anything there?","John Case","Yes. Well, I think in general our tenants are in better shape than they were certainly five years ago; their operations and balance sheets are much stronger; they are more likely to renew. So, we're leasing of the lease rollovers we're executing, 90% are going to the same tenant; 10% to a new tenant. If you look at the history of the company that's been more 70% to the same tenant and 20% to new tenant and then 10% sold. So, those statistics show you that the tenants are more comfortable renewing their leases on the properties and staying in those properties. And it\u2019s a function of a better economic environment, but we also like to think it\u2019s also a function of better underwriting, better tenant selection, site selection on our part having learned from 45 years history in this business.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Thanks John. And just was there cost or what was the cost associated with retaining and attracting new tenants; have you guys put out a TI number?","John Case","Yes. We are -- that will be in our supplemental. So we spent 125,000 in tenant improvements in the third quarter to re-lease 16.3 million in rental revenue. So that number is de minimis, it usually is dominants; it runs from less than 1% of revenues up to maybe 2%. So, it\u2019s never a material number, but we\u2019re actually including that in our supplement going forward.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Great. Thank you.","John Case","Thank you, Todd.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. Sumit, could you just give us, sorry, I apologize if I missed this. But for the acquisitions that you\u2019ve taking for next year, what are the cap rates you\u2019re assuming or the range of cap rates?","John Case","We\u2019re assuming 7% for next year.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","John Case","Year-to-date we\u2019re at 7.1%. The 7.4%, if we were very pleased with but that\u2019s little higher than what we\u2019re expecting given the current market conditions.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","And then just given the numbers you quoted on market cap rates between investment grade and non-investment grade, would you expect next year to be a little different in terms of just composition between the two for deals that you do?","Sumit Roy","No. I think listen, a lot of it is going to be a function of what's going to be available out there. And I think we've stated this in previous calls as well. We don't target a particular composition with regards to investment grade versus non-investment grade when we're looking at acquisitions. This particular quarter it just turned out where investment grade represented only 53% whereas year-to-date it's closer to 70%. So, we're going to look at opportunities that present themselves. There is a lot of discussion around certain retail asset classes that tend to be more non-investment grade in nature. So it's very difficult to predict as to what the composition of that 500 million to 800 million that John has mentioned is going to turn out to be at the end.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just maybe on the competition for deals, as you mentioned, it's obviously increased but maybe looking out into '15, maybe just give us your high level thoughts on did you see that competition changing in any way? I know new regulations on the non-traded side don't kick in for a while but could that be a factor as you get towards the year end or could there just be other factors that may make the environment just more competitive or less competitive from your standpoint?","John Case","Well, we continue to compete with the other public companies and certainly the non-listed REITs. As you've said, the capital raising has slowed down a little bit there but there is still a lot of equity in those entities. We compete with mortgage REITs and institutional investment managers who are running money for sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, endowments looking for yield. So we bump in to some of them as well. I think that the last few quarters have been some of the most competitive we've seen. And there is certainly some activities out there in the sector that would lead me to believe that the competition could become a little less than tense next year. Again it\u2019s impossible to accurately forecast, but our sense is some of the more aggressive buyers maybe stepping back a bit from the market. So that would be the case. We certainly feel better about the higher-end of our acquisitions range.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then some -- okay, okay. Just last clarification is on the timing of these acquisitions, is there anything different we should assume for next year versus just normal seasonality that we see during the year?","John Case","They\u2019re normal, they\u2019re lumpy and they\u2019re really driven by portfolios. And again like last year 2013 we did $1.52 billion in property level acquisitions, the last quarter was a $140 million. This year the first quarter was $650 million and this quarter was a $182 million. You\u2019re going to see that lumpiness because it\u2019s associated with the amount of acquisitions that get done through portfolios. So, I think that will continue. So, we\u2019ll have some heavy quarters and some light quarters like we always have.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks guys.","John Case","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Lukasik with Morningstar.","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","Hi. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wondering if you could comment on the weighted average remaining lease term for the portfolio overall. And I guess let\u2019s say 5 or more years ago I kind of assume that was going to fall in the range of 12 years or longer generally. And I think now it\u2019s around 10.4 years. And just if you can comment around that I guess the change in properties that you guys own now may influence that, but also whether or not you manage to that number and what you'd expect it to be in five or ten years or how that will likely trend?","John Case","Yes. Well, I mean when you've got $15 billion in assets and each year passes the lease-term actually declines by year and it's offset partially by acquisitions. And so, if you're acquiring a $1.5 billion at 13 years, you're not going to fully offset the decrease in lease-term on the existing portfolio.","On rollovers, you are typically -- if the rollovers go to the same tenant, they are five year lease-terms, if it's a new tenant it's closer to ten years. So, it's a natural evolution for a season that lease company like ourselves to see that lease-term overtime decline.","We still focus on average lease-terms of 11, 12, 13, 14 years that\u2019s what we're seeing, that's what we're doing. But you\u2019ve got to remember on the rest of the portfolio, they're getting a bit shorter.","And I think one of our strength is to effectively execute lease rollovers. We've executed over 1,700 lease rollovers in our company's history, recapturing nearly a 100% of the expiring rent. And we've got a team of almost 40 professionals dedicated to that effort that they have been with the company; many of them 10 to 20 years. And that\u2019s where I\u2019ve said this before where the rubber meets the road in the business, that\u2019s where you really need to be able to execute and reserve value. And there are not a lot of net lease companies out there that have that expertise and that extensive experience.","So, we\u2019re very comfortable with our ability to extend the shorter lease terms and the longer lease terms that eventually need to be addressed as those leases expire. I mean some of the leases, we handled this quarter, we looked at and they were put in place 25 years ago. So again we\u2019d have a very long-term perspective. Does that help Todd?","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","Yes, it does. That\u2019s great. Thanks for all that color. And then just a follow-up question on the acquisition guidance for next year. I\u2019m curious, if you are also expecting that the acquisition volume that source is going to be lower or whether you expect that to be relatively constant; you guys are just going to a little bit choosier about what you actually try to close?","John Case","It\u2019s continuing to be active in this quarter. We would expect transaction flow in terms of sourced acquisition opportunities to be strong again next year; all indicators were pointing to that it will be. 2013 was a record at 39 billion. This year, we\u2019re already a 21 billion, which is our second best year ever just nine months into the year.","So I think that we\u2019ll continue to see that momentum, but again we\u2019ll continue to be selective and disciplined in what we buy. There are a number of discussions going on with respect to sale leasebacks with corporate board; corporate management teams; activist investors. We don't know how many of these are going to end up playing out but it's just one or two or three hit, you could see some very big sourced volumes that could lead to higher acquisition. So that activity in terms of activist investors and corporate boards and management teams scrutinizing their real estate holdings and making sure they\u2019re properly and efficiently managing their real estate is accelerating. So there are more discussions. Unfortunately we're involved in those discussions and that really could impact source opportunities next year there to monetize some of that real estate. ","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","Okay, great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions.","John Case","Okay, Todd. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes the question and answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I","will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.","John Case","Just want to thank you and thank everyone for joining us today.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator instructions) This conference is being recorded today, July 26, 2012.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.","Tom Lewis","Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our conference call where we will discuss the operations activity of the second quarter and for six months of this year. In the room with me today is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and as always, Tere Miller, our Vice President of Corporate Communications. And then on the call with me today will be Paul Meurer, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer, and John Case, our EVP and CIO.","And again, during this conference call, we will likely make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law, and the company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. But we\u2019ll discuss in greater detail in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q the factors that may cause such differences.","And as our custom, we\u2019ll start with Paul and you can do an overview of the numbers.","Paul Meurer","Thanks Tom. As usual, I\u2019ll just comment on the income statement first and \u2013 providing a few highlights and then moving on to the balance sheet. Total revenue increased 13.8% for the quarter. Our revenue for the quarter was just over $115 million, or just over $460 million on an annualized basis. This obviously reflects a significant amount of new acquisitions over the past year.","On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by about $6.8 million in the comparative quarterly period, as that expense increases as our property portfolio, of course, continues to grow. Interest expense increased by almost $3.2 million. This increase was due to our credit facility borrowings during the quarter, as well as the June 2011 issuance of $150 million of notes and the reopening of our 2035 bonds some of which appears in this quarter and not all of which appeared in the comparative quarter last year.","On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong with interest coverage at 3.6 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.7 times. General and administrative expenses in the second quarter were approximately $9.3 million, as compared to about $8 million a year ago. Part of this increase is due to higher unexpected costs related to our proxy process this year, about $550,000 more than we expected.","Our G&A expense has also increased as our acquisition activity has increased and because we\u2019ve added new personnel as we continue to grow the portfolio. We spent $392,000 of acquisition due diligence costs during the quarter, and our employee base has grown from 78 employees a year ago to 89 employees today. However, our current projection for total G&A for all of 2012 is approximately $35 million, which will still represent only about 7.5% of total revenues projected for the year.","Property expenses were just under $2.1 million for the quarter. These are the expenses primarily associated properties available for lease. Our current estimate for property expenses for all of 2012 is about $9 million.","Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company, and they were just over $400,000 during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $3.8 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We sold 14 properties during the quarter for $15 million, and a reminder again that we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO.","Preferred stock cash dividends totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter, and this number obviously increased because of the issuance of our preferred F stock earlier this year.","Excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed \u2013 a reminder again refers to the $3.7 million non-cash redemption charge stemming from the repayment of our outstanding 7.375% preferred B stock with some of the proceeds from our preferred F offering earlier this year.","Replacement of this preferred B stock in our capital structure did save us about $1 million cash annually, obviously due to the lower coupon of the newly-issued preferred.","Net income available to common stockholders was $32.95 million for the quarter. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.49 for the quarter, a 2.1% increase versus a year ago. It was $0.95 for the first 6 months of the year, but a reminder that excluding the $3.7 million preferred stock redemption charge, our FFO year-to-date would have been $0.98 per share.","Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividends, was higher again, at $0.50 per share for the quarter, a 2% increase versus a year ago.","As we mentioned recently in the last couple calls, our AFFO \u2013 we think will continue to be higher than our FFO, and we believe this differential between our FFO and a higher AFFO will continue to increase a bit. Because our capital expenditures still remain fairly low, we have minimal straight-line rent adjustments overall in the portfolio. We\u2019ll continue to have some FAS141 non-cash reductions to FFO for in-place leases when we acquire them in large portfolio transactions. And of course, this year in 2012, we have that $3.7 million non-cash preferred redemption charge. Our 2012 AAFO earnings projection is $2.06 to $2.11 per share, or an increase of 2.5 to 5% over our 2011 AFFO per share of $2.01. We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter. We\u2019ve increased the dividend 59 consecutive quarters and 66 times overall since we went public over 17.5 years ago. Our AAFO dividend payout ratio for the quarter and year-to-date was 87%.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we\u2019ve continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. In May, we were very pleased to enter into a new $1 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility to replace our existing $425 million facility. This facility has a four-year initial term plus a fifth year within our control. It also has a $500 million accordion expansion feature, and the pricing is very attractive at only 125 basis points over LIBOR. We are very appreciative of the 15 bank lenders who participated in this expanded credit line which gives us tremendous flexibility with our acquisition and financing efforts.","The credit facility had only $184 million of borrowings at quarter end. Our current total debt to total market capitalization is only 24%, and our preferred stock outstanding still is only 8% of our capital structure. And our only debt maturity in the next three years is a $100 million bond maturity in March of next year. In summary, we currently have excellent liquidity and our overall balance sheet remains very safe and well-positioned to support our continued growth.","Now let me turn the call now back over to Tom who will give you more background.","Tom Lewis","Thanks, Paul. Let me kind of run through each piece of the business and I\u2019ll start with the portfolio. The portfolio continued to generate very consistent cash flow during the second quarter. Generally, the tenants are doing well. There were no issues that arose with any of the tenants during the quarter, and I think at this point we\u2019d look for that to continue herein the third quarter. So pretty much steady as she goes for portfolio operations. At the end of the quarter, our largest 15 tenants represented about 48.5% of revenue. That\u2019s down 350 basis points from the same period a year ago and about 90 basis points from the first quarter.","So this kind of accelerated acquisition activity we\u2019ve had the last couple of years continues to help us reduce concentrations in the portfolio. Generally very healthy from an operational standpoint, to the average cash flow coverage at the store level for those top 15 tenants stayed just under 2.5 times so very, very healthy relative to the operations there. From an occupancy standpoint, we ended the second quarter at 97.3%, you saw in the release with 75 properties that\u2019s available for lease out of the now 2,762 we own. That\u2019s up about 70 basis points from the first quarter and just about flat unchanged from a year ago.","During the quarter, we had only 6 new vacancies in the portfolio. We leased or sold 21 vacant properties during the quarter. And I really have to say our portfolio management department and the leasing people did an outstanding job and have kind of gotten ahead what we\u2019ve asked them to do this year, which is quite positive.","In addition to that, we acquired 145 properties and that\u2019s the reason for the change in the numbers. I mentioned last quarter I thought we\u2019d see a, I think, 30-basis-point jump in occupancy for the quarter, and very pleased that it came in higher than that. I\u2019ve mentioned this the last couple quarters and now I\u2019ll do it much quicker than I used to. But there are three ways to calculate occupancy. The first is physical, which is taking the number of vacant properties 75 and divide it by the 2,762 total, and that\u2019s the one we publish in the press release that gets us to 2.7% vacancy and 97.3 in occupancy.","A second way is to take the vacant square footage in the portfolio and divide it by total square footage. If you run it that way, we get 2.3% vacancy and 97.7% occupancy, a little higher. And then the third way to do it is pretty much economic, which is take the previous rent on vacant properties and you can divide that by the sum of that number and the rent paid on the occupied properties and then you can run it in dollar terms. And if you use that methodology, vacancy is only about 2% and occupancy at 98%. Obviously, any of the three represent high occupancy and we\u2019ll mention each as we do these quarterly calls in the future.","Same-store rents on the portfolio decreased 1.1% during the second quarter and also year-to-date, excluding the impact of some rent reductions which was done in the reorganizations of Buffet\u2019s and Friendly\u2019s. It was a same-store rent increase of about 1.1%, so you can see the impact and where that came from during the quarter. It\u2019s likely the impact from both of those tenants will probably stay in the same-store rent number through the end of the year and then we\u2019ll have been through the 4 quarters since that was undertaken, and it\u2019s likely then same-store rent will turn positive as we get early in the next year.","If you look where same-store rent and declines came from, 6 industries had declining same-store rent, which would be auto service, auto tire, bookstores, I think of which we have one, craft and novelties and office supplies. But really, the vast majority of it came from casual dining, which is where we have Buffet\u2019s and Friendly\u2019s, and that was about $1.9 million.","There were three industries that had flat same-store rents, equipment services, shoe stores and transportation and then 22 of our industries saw same-store rent increases, with only a couple that have larger numbers, sporting goods, health and fitness and quick-service restaurant, and then the balance was really spread out amongst a lot of different industries.","And if you put the 22 industries together, they had an increase of about 1 million for a net decline between all three of down one. And the percentages, as I said earlier, are pretty much the same whether you\u2019re looking at the quarterly or year-to-date. And we remain well-diversified, being up to 2,762 properties. That\u2019s up 131 properties from last quarter. And they\u2019re in 38 different industries with 136 significant tenants in 49 states. We continue to work down our industry exposures. Convenience stores our largest industry, is down to 16.9%, down a little from last quarter and a couple hundred basis points from a year ago.","And then restaurants if you combine both casual and quick-services is down at \u2013 now down to 13.8. It was at one time over 20%, and that\u2019s down 80 basis points from the last quarter and just under 4%, 370 basis points from a year ago. Then it falls pretty quick to theaters which is under 10 at 9.6 and health and fitness came down at 6.9. And while those continue to be industries we like a lot and we\u2019ll probably do some additional acquisitions there, we think we\u2019ll be able to keep those in pretty good shape.","The only other one over 5% is beverages. So we think industry standpoint in fairly good shape and the same on a tenant standpoint. You can see in the release, AMC is our largest at 5.2, LA Fitness at 5, and then everything else is under 5% today and again, the top 15 about 48. And when you get down to the 15 largest tenant about 2.2% of revenue is what they represent, and when you get 20, it gets down, which is not on that list, but it gets down about 1.8% and falls fairly quickly. So well-diversified there, and we think also from a geographic standpoint.","Average remaining lease term on the portfolio remains healthy at 11.1 years. And as I started, the portfolio continues to generate very consistent revenue. Let me move on to property acquisitions, and I\u2019ll start with an update on where we are and kind of where we see volumes going for the year. As those of you who follow us know, we normally report our acquisitions on a quarterly basis after they have closed and don\u2019t report what is under contract since, from time to time, what is under contract doesn\u2019t close and falls out during the due diligence process.","If you recall, in our first quarter call we mentioned that, first of all, that we thought we would acquire around 650 million in acquisitions this year, given what market conditions looked like and what we were seeing in volume.","And then secondly, we said we had previously disclosed in an offering document that we did earlier this year for a preferred offering that we had 514 million under contract for acquisitions at that time. And the reason we disclosed what was under contract, the 514 million, was really twofold. Primary was it\u2019s a fairly large number and we thought, secondarily, in light of doing the preferred offering, that that was good disclosure, but not our normal disclosure.","During the second quarter, we closed on 198 million of that 514 million, and another 13 million or so for total acquisitions of just over 210 million. The remaining 316 million in acquisitions under contract we terminated during the due diligence process and will not close, and that puts us at 221 million in acquisitions as of the end of the second quarter. So we wish more of it had closed, but 221 million is where we ended at the end of the quarter.","Relative to where we see things going from here, we remained very active on the acquisition\u2019s front and continue to believe we will be still meet the 650 million in acquisitions for the year, and that there is a very good chance we\u2019ll end up exceeding that number. And obviously, most of that will now close in the third quarter where we are today, and in the fourth quarter.","And while it will be very helpful for our 2013 numbers, the impact on 2012 AFFO will be modest. And that was the reason for the $0.02 adjustment to our FFO and AFFO guidance. I still think we\u2019ll acquire 650 million or maybe even better now for the year, but obviously, the timing of when we do that is what impacts the 2012 numbers.","Interestingly, had we closed on the 316 million, we would likely be guiding to around 1 billion again this year in acquisitions, and I only point that out to say that as I\u2019ve talked about for a long time when working on these larger transactions which we tend to do, it can cause acquisitions to be very lumpy and hard to predict on a quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year basis.","And anyway, John, why don\u2019t you spend some time and make some comments relative to the activity we did and kind of what you\u2019re seeing out there.","John Case","Sure. The second quarter was fairly active for acquisitions. As Tom said, we acquired 145 properties for approximately 211 million at an average cap rate of 7.1% and an average lease term of 15 years. The credit profile of the tenants we added was pretty attractive. 98% of the acquisitions or leased \u2013 tenants with investment-grade credit ratings.","The acquisitions were leased to five tenants in five separate industries. Four of the five tenants were existing tenants of ours. These tenants operate predominantly in the general merchandise, drug store and transportation services industries. The acquisitions were geographically diversified, located in 28 states and 95% of our acquisitions activity was comprised of our traditional retail assets. That brings us to 147 properties acquired for 222 million for the first two quarters of the year at an average cap rate of 7.2% and an average lease term of 15 years.","Let me spend a second talking about acquisition yields and investment spreads. Acquisition yields have continued to come down a bit and there are two principal reasons for this. The first is cap rates are coming down as interest rates and investment yields in general continue to decline.","A second reason is we\u2019ve acquired a much higher percentage of our properties with investment-grade tenants, which offer lower yields than we had previously. 90% of the assets we have acquired during the first and second quarters are leased to investment-grade tenants.","So, we have continued to improve the credit profile of our tenant base, but we have sacrificed some yield to do so. However, our investment spreads, the spread between our initial yields and our nominal cost of equity, defined as our FFO yield adjusted for issuance cost, have continued to be very attractive relative to where they have been historically.","Our year-to-date average cap rate of 7.2% represents more than a 200 basis point spread to our nominal cost of equity at the end of the second quarter. This compares favorably to our average spread of 110 basis points over the previous 17 years, especially when you factor in that we acquired assets leased to investment-grade tenants in only two of those years; 2010 and 2011.","Our 2011 investment spread was 170 basis points when 40% of our acquisitions were with investment-grade tenants. So, we have been able to improve our investment spreads while moving up the credit curve this year, with 90% of our acquisitions leased to investment-grade tenants.","When compared to our current weighted average cost of capital, factoring in the cost of our debt, our investment spreads are, of course, a bit higher, 230 basis points this year above our weighted average cost of capital.","As you know, we also track our cap rates relative to the 10-year treasury yields, and since our IPO, you\u2019ve heard me say this before, since our IPO in 1994, our cap rates have averaged 475 basis points over the corresponding 10-year treasury yields.","In 2011, our cap rates averaged 500 basis points over the 10-year treasury yield.","This year, our cap rates have averaged approximately 575 basis points over the 10-year treasury yield. So we believe this is a great time for us to acquire at very attractive spreads while enhancing the credit profile of our tenant base.","Transaction flow continues to be strong. We remain comfortable, as Tom said, with our acquisitions guidance of 650 million for 2012. We\u2019ve sourced 8 billion in acquisition opportunities through the end of the second quarter this year. As you recall, we sourced 13 billion in acquisition opportunities in 2011 and ended up closing 1 billion of those acquisitions.","Retail and distribution properties continue to account for the majority of what we\u2019re seeing, and approximately 50% of these sourced acquisitions have been properties leased to investment grade tenants. We\u2019re continuing to pursue a number of these opportunities and anticipate an active second half of the year as far as acquisitions goes.","We\u2019re still seeing competition from property portfolios from multiple sources with a lot of capital. This is not new. We should remain competitive in the marketplace, though. This competition should continue to put some pressure on investment yields, though.","In our last call, you may recall we stated that we expected cap rates to average 7.5% \u2013 7.75% for the year. We now expect our initial yields or cap rates for 2012 to average just a shade less than 7.5%. Of course, this will ultimately be a function of the mix between investment grade and non-investment grade properties we acquire for the balance of the year.","So we believe our investment spreads will continue to hold up well in this environment and should exceed the spreads we have achieved historically, even as we acquire properties leased to higher credit tenants. Tom?","Tom Lewis","Thank you. Obviously, it\u2019s very nice to see a large transaction flow and continue to think that we\u2019ll acquire what our targets have been or more, but do wish that all of the properties under contract would have closed.","We think acquisitions is going to continue to play a big role, obviously, first in continuing to grow our revenue in AFFO which is what really drives our dividend increases. And then secondly and equally important to us right now in adjusting really the makeup of the portfolio where we\u2019re trying to more sharply define where we want to be when we\u2019re in retail, and then also as we move outside of retail and importantly, as John mentioned, up the credit curve.","Let me move on. Relative to the balance sheet, just quickly, with access to capital we\u2019re in very good shape, as Paul mentioned. Plenty of dry powder to execute on the acquisitions and the new $1 billion credit facility is very helpful in that light.","Looking at permanent capital, obviously where our share price is trading is attractive, as is \u2013 the debt markets are very attractive and as is preferred, and as we acquire additional properties and the balance builds on the facility, we look to enter the capital markets and take advantage of that at some time. But for now, only about 18% of that facility is drawn.","On earnings and guidance, we\u2019re looking \u2013 as the release says \u2013 for 2.00 to 2.04 per share and FFO that includes the $0.03 of non-cash charge from the preferred. And then AFFO of 2.06 to 2.11 and that\u2019s 2.5% to 5% growth. And that number really is our primary focus as it best really represents the recurring cash flow that we use to pay dividends.","And speaking of dividends, we do remain optimistic that our activities will support continued dividend increases. As most of you know, we\u2019ve historically raised the dividend in fairly equal amount each quarter and then looked in our August board meeting to see if a fifth larger increase in the dividend is warranted to keep our payout ratio kind of in the 85% to 87% range, which is where we\u2019re comfortable, of AFFO.","And our AFFO payout ratio is in that range now and continues to grow, and the board will have that discussion on an additional larger dividend increase in our board meeting next month.","And I think that pretty much does it, and why don\u2019t we \u2013 Liz, if we could open up the questions at this time, that\u2019d be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of RJ Milligan with Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead.","RJ Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Good afternoon, guys. Tom, you often run through the acquisition funnel in terms of deals that come in through the door versus the number that you actually close on. And I know we don\u2019t often hear about deals that are under contract that get terminated. I\u2019m just wondering what percentage of the deals that do get under contract end up getting terminated through the due diligence process?","Tom Lewis","It\u2019s very spotty and most of the properties that we put under contract generally do close but occasionally fall out. And it\u2019s hard just to put a percentage on it.","This obviously was one large one, but it does happen and kind of trickles through the year. And usually what it is, is you\u2019ll go through the approval of the tenant, you do the site checks, you do most of the work, and then what happens as you put it under contract and do a lot of the final work \u2013 if it falls out, it\u2019s usually either title issues or something with the property condition. Occasionally you can find out that there\u2019s some planned condemnations or there\u2019s some termination rights or something you know right around the lease. Obviously environmental \u2013 that happens from time to time.","And then a few times for us over the years \u2013 since we do a lot of work in larger transactions where the real estate is just one piece of the financing package for an acquisition of an entity, it can fall out by one or more pieces of that doing it. And if you look at a typical year, it\u2019ll be a few properties here and there, and with this one, it was a larger transaction that we worked on with a number of parties and everybody was moving forward and then the decision was made to pull it pretty late in the diligence.","So it\u2019s hard to see, \u201cGee, the number under contract is 100 and generally close 92.6.\u201d It\u2019ll be \u2013 we\u2019ll close it all one year, close it all the next year, close 95 one year and then in a situation like this, in a big chunk, it\u2019s hard to tell.","RJ Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","And of the 316 that was terminated, does that \u2013 is that mostly an existing tenant or is this a new tenant?","Tom Lewis","It was an existing tenant, I believe, but we had a small position with them.","RJ Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi. Good afternoon.","Tom Lewis","Hi, Josh.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Tom, you mentioned the growth outlook for the back half of the year. You\u2019re still pretty confident to get to 600 million to 650 million of acquisitions. I\u2019m just wondering how much of that is dependent on, I guess, an LBO or an M&A sort of outlook, or is that just people who are trying to modify existing real estate today?","Tom Lewis","It\u2019s pretty granular. Isn\u2019t it, John?","John Case","Yes. It\u2019s a little of both, but it\u2019s well-diversified. As usual, the ultimate number will depend on our success on some of the larger portfolios. But I would say there\u2019s some emanating from private equity-generated acquisition opportunities, some we\u2019re working on directly with private developers, and some we\u2019re working directly on with tenants. So it\u2019s really \u2013 when I look at the pipeline, it\u2019s not concentrated in one single area. Does that help?","Tom Lewis","Yes. Last year, as you recall \u2013 and John, you can help me with the numbers \u2013 we bought a billion and there were 3 large transactions that, if you totaled them up, they were...","John Case","Yes, 850 million...","Tom Lewis","Yes. And so...","John Case","Three large portfolio transactions.","Tom Lewis","It was very concentrated last year. And as I look down the list of what we\u2019re looking at, it seems to be in a lot more transactions than it was last year, although some number decent size.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Tom, you mentioned before about some of the releasing gains that were done in the quarter. What\u2019s roughly the split in occupancy gains between releasing and acquisition?","Tom Lewis","Gosh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019d have to sit down and do the math. But I think if you look at this, we leased or sold \u2013 I think it was...","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","20-plus?","John Case","And then we bought 140...","Tom Lewis","140, but that\u2019s on a base of 2,600 already. So I would think \u2013 and this is top of my head. I\u2019d have to grab a calculator. Maybe two-thirds really came from leasing.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. That sounds fair. Last question. You guys were mentioning your typical spread on cap rates versus your cost of capital. How do you think about your equity cost of capital today, I guess, given the dividend yield and given the fantastic run the shares have had over the last five years?","Tom Lewis","Yes. As we always say when we discuss equity cost of capital, we realize it\u2019s as much a philosophical and religious discussion as it is a financial one. But what we try and do, first of all, is \u2013 we\u2019re in a business kind of like a bank where you\u2019re working on spread and you need to make it upfront, and so we kind of focus on a forward AFFO yield, which is obviously AFFO divided by stock price and then we\u2019ll gross it up for issuance, and then say, \u201cOkay. Where are we coming in over that to begin?\u201d And we really start with equity, and that\u2019s the number where historically it\u2019s been about 110 basis points, and at the end of the second quarter it was about 200.","And then what we do is we\u2019ll throw in the other type of capital, which is debt, which has huge spreads today and obviously is very attractive, and then preferred, which we issued at the beginning of the year. So as I said, there\u2019s only about 18% of the line drawn right now, but as some of these get closed in the third and fourth quarter, we\u2019ll start thinking about which way we want to go.","We\u2019ll watch the markets at that time. But let me tell you, spreads are very large all over and we have, as you know well \u2013 I think we\u2019ve issued equity 20 times since we became public in \u201894 and that\u2019s been at a stock price of $19 to $34 to fund accretive acquisitions. So that\u2019s worked out pretty well for the shareholders and we\u2019ve kept debt today I think it\u2019s 23.8% or 23.9% on the balance sheet, so there\u2019s a lot of room there too. So we think that\u2019s all very attractive right now, given where spreads are.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Sounds good. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. With your bigger line, Tom, do you plan to clear it as often, I guess, from an equity issuance standpoint or will you maybe play a bit of the \u201cI think interest rates are going to stay low\u201d game?","Tom Lewis","Yes. We\u2019ve historically, as you know, not been one to play that game. The reason for getting the bigger line is we\u2019re working on bigger transactions. And with that said, though, it is efficient, particularly when you look at the debt markets when you issue to make sure it\u2019s index-eligible, and so you need to do in size. I think it\u2019s 250-plus. And also, with equity, I think we\u2019d rather go out if we\u2019re -even if we\u2019re buying a lot and funding a lot, not do small offerings five times a year. It\u2019s a little easier for, I think, the equity side of the street if you fund when you do it in bigger chunks. So we\u2019ll probably leave a little more on the line, but that is a function of not really making a call on interest rates, but a little more comfort and availability to do transactions out there when you have a little bit on the line.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. All right. Good. Thank you. And then on the disposition front, you guys accelerated a bit in the second quarter and you had talked about how you were going to do that. You had laid out quarterly for us kind of what you were thinking. But now I\u2019m curious as you have slowed the acquisitions a bit because, as you said, you might have been close to $1 billion of acquisitions as you slow that a bit, do you also slow the disposition process or are they really unrelated?","Tom Lewis","Yeah, those are levers we could certainly pull because you really want to start and making sure you have some good AFFO growth to grow the dividend. But with that said, it is a priority for us and we\u2019ll think we\u2019ll close what we probably would have last quarter, but it\u2019ll just be later in the year. But we haven\u2019t slowed disposition. We did five properties for 3.6 in the first quarter and then 14 for, I think, 15 million in the second.","And the third quarter, I think we will do more than we did in the second and I\u2019d like to do another 50 million or so the balance of the year. I think that\u2019d get us to around 70 million for the year and most important the run rate up a little bit. And then in the beginning of the year, we can kind of polish off the first 100 million that we put out there. And then we\u2019re likely just going to grab another 100 million and start off again next year.","But if we could get the run rate 50 million to 100 million a year and then we can take a look at all the other levers and all the other variables and looking at the company\u2019s cash flows and work off that. But we\u2019re very active. There\u2019s \u2013 right now we\u2019re at a point where there\u2019s 10 to 15 that are in some property \u2013 some type of closing, whether you\u2019re just putting them under LLI or whether you\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019ve gone non-contingent. And then I think we\u2019ve got 28 properties out on the market and then a good-sized group of properties behind that can go out and that\u2019s on the 100 million.","So we do intend to be active, but if I can get to a run rate of 50 million to 100 million a year at the end of the quarter. And kind of next year get into \u2013 or at the end of the year and next year get it up around 100 million, we\u2019d be happy.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Good. Thank you. And then is Crest officially gone now or is it just irrelevant? I mean, you did mention it for the first time that I can remember in the press release and I\u2019m assuming the properties are gone. So is it \u2013 have you done away with it?","Tom Lewis","No. It\u2019s still just hanging out there and I think it\u2019s got three properties in it and then two mortgages that we took back, so it\u2019s generating some income. It just didn\u2019t have any activity so we kind of left it out there. But actually, with the acquisition that was under contract and didn\u2019t close, we did plan to put some properties in there and use it. It wasn\u2019t going to be a huge number, but we will use it if we think it helps us from a diversification standpoint in doing something, but we don\u2019t look at \u2013 for it to become active over the next quarter or so.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then Friendly\u2019s and Buffet\u2019s \u2013 are we run rate at this point on those two?","Tom Lewis","Yes. I think we are on those. The leasing \u2013 I think we said that we thought the Friendly\u2019s \u2013 we would recover about 80% and I looked this morning and we\u2019ve updated that number. We think it\u2019ll be a little higher \u2013 around 82.","And then Buffet\u2019s \u2013 yes, I think we had said about a 65 recovery. That\u2019s also looking a little better just by a couple hundred basis points or so. And then the leasing in Friendly\u2019s \u2013 we had in the model not to really lease anything this year and it\u2019s gone faster than that. That was part of what this quarter was. And similar on Buffet\u2019s. So I\u2019d say run rate and just moving through and maybe a little bit above what we thought recoveries would be.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emanuel Porchman with Citi. Please go ahead.","Emanuel Porchman \u2013 Citi","Hi, guys. Good afternoon.","Tom Lewis","Good afternoon.","Emanuel Porchman \u2013 Citi","Just had a \u2013 with the properties that you ultimately terminated the contracts on, was that purely a property characteristic or a title characteristic or the environmental issue that you talked about earlier \u2013 was there pricing involved, too?","Tom Lewis","It wasn\u2019t \u2013 yes. It wasn\u2019t pricing and it wasn\u2019t one of those others; it was the overall transaction moving away from of which we part of. And I apologize. Beyond that, I can\u2019t say much. There were a number of parties involved and our confidentiality agreement was only cleared to discuss when it closed, and since it didn\u2019t close we\u2019re still under it, and since we plan to do future transactions with those parties \u2013 perhaps not on these assets \u2013 I really can\u2019t go much further. But it was the transaction itself that went away.","Emanuel Porchman \u2013 Citi","Understood. And then on last quarter\u2019s call, you had discussed about a third of what you look at being investment-grade, and obviously you\u2019re closing a hyper-percentage of stuff as investment-grade tenants. Is that really sort of a consistent run rate or was that simply the portfolio you were looking at the time, and how much of the 650 for the year \u2013 how much of it is going to end up being 650 as investment-grade, I guess is my question.","Tom Lewis","Great. Of course, it\u2019s subject to what closes and doesn\u2019t, but John, maybe you\u2019d take a run at that.","John Case","Right. The 90% we\u2019ve closed year to date that\u2019s investment-grade is high. I would expect it to come down a bit based on what\u2019s in the pipeline and what we\u2019re working on, but it is dependent upon some of these larger portfolios \u2013 some of which are not investment-grade, some of which are investment-grade. But I would expect it to be a little higher than where it was last year at the end of the year if I had to guess, and last year...","Tom Lewis","Right now, ballpark.","John Case","Yeah. 50% or so.","Tom Lewis","Yeah. It\u2019s hard to tell, but it is, as I said, one of the things we\u2019re trying to do. And above and beyond just investment grade, I would say even when you get below investment grade it tends to be on average a little higher credit than it might have been in the past. And that\u2019s intentional, too. But...","Emanuel Porchman \u2013 Citi","Perfect. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lukasik with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Paul Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Just to follow-up on the investment grade question. I guess, sort of in an ideal world, five to 10 years down the road, what percentage of the portfolio would you guys like to have in the investment grade category?","John Case","Yeah. We haven\u2019t been as exactly specific, but we\u2019d like to move that up. And again, I\u2019ll allude to what I just said, which is some of the things that aren\u2019t investment-grade will be cut, and if they have very high cash flows, we\u2019ll be happy with that.","But right now, we\u2019ve gone from zero to close to 20% in between 15 to 20 today, and in just a couple of years, and we\u2019d be very happy five, six years down the line if that was 50% to 60%. And we think that that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll be very happy about down the road. There will come a point likely, but interest rates do get higher, although they could stay low for some time, and so we are really working for five, six, seven years down the road, and if it could be 50, 60, 70, that\u2019d be just fine.","Paul Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. Thanks. And then just curious about the timing of the acquisitions that did close in the quarter, were there early, late, middle?","John Case","Virtually all of them were at the end of the quarter.","Paul Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi. Thanks, guys. Just looking at the average of investment per property in the second quarter. It looks around the 1.5 million range. Is this a reflection of the type of deals you\u2019re looking at right now, or am I looking too much into that?","Tom Lewis","Yeah. It\u2019s just what actually closed. And as John said, the vast majority of this quarter was in retail, and traditionally those are smaller and these were a little smaller, too. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really anything targeted. There was just a cluster of retail with smaller stores this quarter. That\u2019s likely to increase over the next quarter \u2013 a few quarters and be a larger number per property.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","Have you guys talked about the tenants? Have you disclosed who the tenants are and specifically what industries within retail?","Tom Lewis","John, you talked about the industries, I think, a little earlier in the call, which was general merchandise, drug store...","John Case","And transportation services.","Tom Lewis","And then I think there was a little QSR.","John Case","Yeah. A little QSR.","Tom Lewis","And so those were the industries. But we didn\u2019t do the tenants individually, but if you look into the top 15, you\u2019ll see that there were some increases in some names and some that popped in for the first time.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Thanks. And John, the blended cap rate was 7.1. If some of these properties were going to go individually, are they going for higher or is there a portfolio premium that we should look at?","John Case","I think there is a portfolio premium today in that $100 million to $200 million range. Buyers are trying to get capital efficiently invested. When you get above 200 million, that premium goes away because there\u2019s just a limited number of players who can execute transactions in excess of 200 million without financing contingencies. So there is a bit of a portfolio premium at that level, 150 million.","Tom Lewis","Todd, I think one\u2019s talking cap rates, one\u2019s talking price. I think when you do a portfolio in the 100 million to 200 million range today, it actually \u2013 you may pay a tiny bit more than you would on a one-off. Above that number, you would pay less than a one-off, and it\u2019s not a huge spread but it\u2019s a little bit of a spread, given the number of people out trying to put capital out in bulk.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Tom. And really, who \u2013 back to the disposition discussion, who are the buyers to support the volumes that go in excess of 50? If you say you\u2019re going to shoot for 50 million to 100 million, what kind of buyers are you looking at?","Tom Lewis","To date, it has been all individual buyers. The numbers, in terms of property size, is fairly small, as you can see by how many we sold and what the value were. And there is a 1031 market again today, to some extent, because with the declining cap rates, there are some gains out there in commercial property. So some have been there.","And \u2013 but that was the majority of kind of one-offs years ago. Today, it\u2019s maybe a third 1031 and the other two-thirds are just people looking for yield. They are yield-starved out in the marketplace, and so when something comes out and has a name on it and has an attractive yield, the prices are \u2013 the cap rates are lower than we had anticipated when we started doing this. We were thinking on some of these it would be up in the 9 and 10s and it\u2019s down into the 8s and 7s. So they\u2019re individuals.","One of the things we may do as we move along here, given that there are some people out there trying to look to put away money in little \u2013 larger pieces is we may package some up and work through a few people and look for a little more quasi-institutional buyer for some of the assets. But today it\u2019s been all individual.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just lastly, I\u2019ll just ask Paul a question. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much change expected in the second half of the year with your property operating expense guidance. Is it fair to say you\u2019re not expecting any new vacancies? And if that\u2019s the case, how long a lead time do you generally get for tenants, soy if you notice when they\u2019re moving out?","Paul Meurer","Well, as a general comment on that area, the estimate did go down. I think last quarter I estimated 9.2 million for the year. Now that estimate is closer to $9 million. The increase that we\u2019ve had has really not been a bad debt expense; it\u2019s been more some costs on vacant properties; insurance, legal fees, things like that.","The down time \u2013 historically, we used to say six to nine months. I\u2019d say over the past handful of years that widened, it became more nine to 12 months or sometimes more. And that has started to tighten a bit back to the more normalized run rate, which \u2013 let\u2019s call it nine months, to kind of answer your question. So it did widen even further than that, but I think it\u2019s been getting better and the folks in portfolio management have been able to release things a little quicker than they were, say, 18 months ago.","Tom Lewis","On the how much lead-time do we get when a tenant has a problem? We have a few properties in the portfolio that it\u2019s a one-man show where we released and then it\u2019s generally the rent doesn\u2019t show up. But in the vast majority of the cases, we have large tenants. And so we\u2019re trying to do some job of monitoring their situation.","We normally do get a lead-time. Not always, but normally we\u2019ll know 90 days ahead of time or so, and sometimes five, six months that mom\u2019s on the roof or something\u2019s going on. And today that \u2013 as I said earlier, there was nothing that came up during the second quarter and we don\u2019t anticipate anything in the third quarter.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And actually I did have one last question. If you could just address the development piece of the new properties that you purchased in the second quarter?","Tom Lewis","Yes. Of that total, about 3 million was development-oriented investments. So, very little of it.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","These are new construction. They\u2019re pre-leased. They\u2019re just not cash-flowing yet?","Tom Lewis","Yes correct. And I\u2019ll just comment on that right now. We have five properties under development and it\u2019s not a huge amount of money, and then three re-developments. And in those, if you look at it, the total cost will be about 31 million and we\u2019ve already funded 21 million, so there\u2019s only about 9.8 million to be funded. And in each case, it\u2019s a situation where we have the tenant and there is somebody building the building and we were able to go in and buy it during the construction period and it\u2019s going to get built when the lease is already in place. So you\u2019re not taking lease upward.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Robert W Baird. Please go ahead.","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W Baird","Hi, guys. Just standing in real quick for Paula Poskon. Most of the other questions we had have been answered at this point, but just a quick one. How much of that occupancy increase was due to vacant properties being reclassified as held for sale?","Tom Lewis","None.","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W Baird","None. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s all I got.","Tom Lewis","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of the Realty Income conference call.

Welcome to the Realty Income Fourth Quarter 2013 Operating Results Conference Call. During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for question (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Terry Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Terry Miller","Thank you Danielle and thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s fourth quarter and 2013 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. Also joining us on the call is Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The Company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater details the factors that may cause such differences in the Company\u2019s 2013 Form 10-K.","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Case.","John P. Case","Thanks, Terry. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our call. We are certainly pleased with our operating performance for the fourth quarter and our record setting results for the year. I am going to have Paul start and provide an overview of the number. So Paul?","Paul M. Meurer","","Thanks John. As usual I will comment on our financial statements, provide some highlights of the financial results for both the quarter and the year starting with the income statement, total revenue increased over 62% for the quarter and over 61% for the year. This increase obviously reflects our significant growth from new acquisitions over the past year as well as healthy same-store rental growth. Our rental revenue at December 31 on an annualized basis was approximately $819 million.","You will note this quarter that we also have added new disclosure regarding tenant reimbursement as an additional revenue line item as well as an identical offsetting amount added to our property expense line. This refers to property expenses that we simply pay first and then get reimbursed by the tenant.","There is no financial impact to our earnings they offset each other as revenues and expenses and this is simply new disclosure in our income statements this quarter. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased to over $85 million in the quarter and depreciation expense is obviously increased with our portfolio growth.","Interest expense increased in the quarter to $50.6 million. This increase was primarily due to the $750 million issuance of 10 year bonds last July, as well as some credit facility borrowings during the quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.6 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.0 times.","General and administrative or G&A expenses in the fourth quarter were approximately $16.5 million. They were $56.8 million for the year. Our G&A expense naturally did increased this past year as our acquisition activity increased and we added some new personnel to manage a larger portfolio. Our employee base has grown from 97 employees a year-ago to 115 employees today.","Overall our total G&A in 2013 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was still only 7.5% for the low end of our historic run rate of 7.5% to 8% from revenues. However, our 2013 G&A also had about $8 million of non-recurring unique expenses from accelerated stock vesting of our old 10 year grant back in the third quarter and the acceleration of our former CEO's pay compensation into the 2013 calendar year. To our current projection for G&A for 2014 it\u2019s only about $50 million or approximately 5.5% of revenues.","Property expenses are noted as $13 million for the quarter and $39 million for the year. However, as I mentioned these amounts include property expenses reimbursed by tenant. The property expenses that we are responsible for were approximately $3.7 million for the quarter and $13.9 million for the year. And our projection for 2014 for property expenses that we will be responsible if $16.5 million.","Income taxes simply consist of income taxes paid to various states by the Company and they were $670,000 for the quarter and $2.7 million for the year. Merger related costs just a reminder this line item refers to the costs associated with the ARCT acquisition earlier in the year and during the quarter, we expensed the remaining $138,000 of such costs.","Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $15.2 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We sold 22 properties during the quarter for $28 million with a gain on sales of $14.3 million. And a reminder that we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO.","Preferred stock cash dividends totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter and net income available to common stockholders was about $53.9 million for the quarter. Reminder that our normalized FFO simply adds back the ARCT merger related cost to FFO. So our normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.61 for the quarter, an 8.9% increase versus a year ago and $2.41 for the year, a 19.3% increase over 2012.","Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.52 per share for the quarter, a 12.7% increase versus a year-ago or $2.41 for the year, a 17% increase over 2012. With this growth and earnings we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. We have increased the dividend 65 consecutive quarters which is over 16 years of consecutive quarterly dividend increases.","Dividends paid for common share increased over 21% this year and our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.186 per share.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We\u2019ve continued to maintain a conservative and very safe capital structure. As you know in October, we raised $397 million of new capital with a common equity offering. Also on October we expanded our acquisition credit facility to $1.5 billion. As of today we have $583 million of borrowings on that line. We did not assume any in place mortgages during the fourth quarter. We did pay off some of the maturity, so our outstanding net mortgage debt at year-end decreased to approximately $755 million.","Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rate and continue to be rated Baa1 BBB+ had a weighted average maturity of almost eight years. Our overall debt maturity schedule is also in very good shape, but only $50 million of mortgages coming due in 2014 and $125 million of mortgages coming due in 2015, and our next bond maturity is only a $150 million due in November of 2015.","Our overall current debt to total market cap is 33% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 5% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA is only 6.1 times.","So in summary revenue growth this quarter was very significant. Our expenses remain moderate, so our earnings growth was very positive. Our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe and we continue to enjoy excellent access to the public capital markets to fund our continued growth with well priced long-term capital.","Let me turn the call now back over to John who will give you more background on these results.","John P. Case","Thanks Paul. Let me began with this overview of the portfolio which continues to generate consistent cash flow. Our tenants are doing well based on what we're seeing today. As we see, we ended the year with 98.2% occupancy based on the number of properties with just 70 properties available for lease out of our 3,896 properties. This occupancy is from 97.2% one year ago. Our occupancy based on square footage and our economic occupancy are both at 99%.","Our property management growth, the largest department in the company has done a great job managing this occupancy and handling our 1,600 lease rollovers since 1990s. We are expecting our occupancy to remain fairly stable for the foreseeable future.","Our portfolio remains diversified by tenant, industry, geography and property type. At the end of 2013, our properties were leased to 205 commercial tenants in 47 different industries and located in 49 states plus Puerto Rico.","77% of our rental revenue comes from our traditional retail properties, while 23% comes from non-retail properties with the largest component, the industrial and distribution. We believe this diversification is important and leads to more predictable cash flow streams for our shareholders every time.","At the end of the fourth quarter, our 15 largest tenants accounted for 44.6% of rental revenue. That\u2019s down from 47.1% for the same period one year ago. So we continue to make progress on this over time. In 2008, the top 15 accounted for 54.3% of our rental revenues.","Within the top 15 there was very little movement from last quarter to this quarter with 15 tenants being represented. No single tenant accounts for more than 5.2% of rental revenue. The diversification by tenant remains quite favorable for us. FedEx continues to be our largest tenant at 5.2% of rental revenue, which is virtually unchanged from last quarter. Walgreens and Family Dollar are again our second and third largest tenants at 5% and 4.8% rental revenue respectively.","Walgreens was flat from last quarter, while Family Dollar is down 4.3% and then all other tenants are at or below 3.1% of rental revenues. When you get down to the 15 largest tenants which is Walmart\/Sam's Club, it represents only 1.6% of rental revenue and the percentages trail off from there.","We\u2019ve added 55 new tenants to the portfolio this year further enhancing our tenant diversification. Convenient stores remain our largest industry but continue to check down as a percentage of rental revenue. Convenient stores now represent 10.6% of rental revenue down from 14.9% a year ago.","Drug stores are now at 9.7%, up from 3.3% a year ago. This was the fastest growing industry for us in the last year. It\u2019s well aligned with our strategy of targeting high quality non-discretionary retailers and attractive locations. Restaurants, if you combine both casual dining and quick service segments are now at 9% down from 12.4% a year ago.","Dollar stores are now at 7.1%, up from 4.3% a year ago. We continue to provide the deep value proposition this industry offers to our consumers in this economy with consumers under a bit of pressure. Health and fitness is at 6.8%, Theaters are at 5.6% and transportation services are at 5.4% of total revenues.","All other industry categories are at or below 4.3% of revenue. So, we continue diversifying our rental revenues by industry. Looking a property type retail always has represents the primary source of our rental revenues at 77% of property revenues with industrial and distribution at 11%, office at 6.5% and the reminder basically evenly divided between manufacturing and agriculture.","Of course, we know retail well we continue to focus on retail tenants that meet our investment parameters, more than 90% of our retail portfolios have a service non- discretionary and\/or low price point components to investments. We believe these characteristics better position these tenants to successfully operate in all economic environments and make them less vulnerable to Internet competition. Regarding lease length, the average remaining lease terms continues to be just under 11 years.","Same-store rents increased 1.8% during the fourth quarter, which we\u2019re pleased with, for the year they increased 1.4%. This level of growth is where we expect it to continue for reminder of the year.","Let me take a moment on tenant credit, the credit quality of the portfolio continues to be healthy with 40% of our rental revenue generated from the investment grade tenants. With upon investment grade tenants, those tenants is having an investment grade rating by one or more of the 3 major rating agencies. This revenue percentage is consistent with where it was last quarter, but it\u2019s off from 23.5% at the end of 2012 of the last four years we\u2019ve established a significant foundation of revenues from investment grade tenants, add investment spreads above our historical spreads. Creating a stronger credit profile for our tenant base.","We\u2019re also pleased with the rental growth we have been able to generate from these investment grade tenants, 70% of our investment grade leases have renovate increases in them which average 1.5% annual which is consistent with our historical portfolio rental growth rate.","Moving on to the property acquisitions, we completed $1.5 billion for the year, at an initial yield of 7.1%. This volume is a record, adding the $3.2 billion acquisition of our ARCT that closed in January of last year. We made a total of $4.7 billion in investments.","Regarding cap rates, our policy again is to announce first year cash cap rates for the market and not GAAP cap rates which tend to be notably higher due to the straight lining of rent. We continue to see attractive investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. During the year, our average spreads to our WAC, our weighted average cost of capital was 155 basis points reverting to our long-term average.","Now, I\u2019d like to hand it over to Sumit, who will provide some additional color on our acquisitions activity for the quarter and for the year. Sumit?","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. As John mentioned during the fourth quarter, we made $145.3 million in property level investments in 66 properties at an average initial cash yield of 7.3% with a weighted average lease term of 12.5 years.","62% of the revenues generated by these acquisitions is from investment grade tenants. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 16 different industries. Most significant industry is represented with discount stores, drug stores, diversified industrial and health and fitness. The properties are located in 28 states, and 80% of the investments are comprised of our traditional retail properties.","In 2013, we invested $1.514 billion in 459 properties, at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and lease term of 14 years. 65% of total rents are generated by investment grade tenants. The assets are leased to 32 different tenants in 23 different industries. Most significant industry is represented with drugstores, discount stores, health and fitness and wholesale clubs. The properties are located in 40 states. 84% of the investments are comprised of our traditional retail properties, 10% industrial and 9% in office.","Including ARCT, we have invested $4.7 billion in 974 properties in 2013. Regarding transaction flow, we continue to see mostly a record volume of transaction this year. We sourced $39.4 billion in acquisition opportunities in 2013 of which $2.6 billion was sourced in the fourth quarter.","To put it in perspective the $39.4 billion sourced in 2013 was more than double the volume sourced in all of 2012, which was a record year of sourcing for us. The volume of opportunities were primarily driven by large portfolios and entity level transactions as compared to one of transactions. However, of the 1.5 billion in property level transactions closed in 2013 over 30% or approximately $461 million where one-off transactions.","Our relationships continue to be a paramount importance to us. Approximately 66% of the 1.5 billion in transactions closed in 2013 were relationship driven. As you can see we have continued to leverage our relationships and have remained very selective in our investment and our pursuing only those transactions that offer superior risk adjusted returns and fit our strategic portfolio objectives.","Overall, we have been pleased with the investment results achieved in 2013. After pricing, cap rates have remained stable in the fourth quarter. The stickiness of the cap rates are testament to the amount of capital continuing to pursue transactions. Investment grade property cap rates range from 6.25 to 7.15. Non-investment grade properties are trading from7.25 to 8.25 cap rate.","From 2010 to 2013, we have consummated over $4.4 billion in organic acquisitions, that\u2019s excluding ARCT, of which 55% has been investment grade credit and approximately 45% non-investment grade or non-rated credit. We invested over $1.8 billion during this period in our traditional non-investment grade retail of which approximately $418 million was in 2013.","To put this in context, this was a more active 4 year period for investments in non-rated, non-investment grade retail than any other 4 year period in our company\u2019s history. Our investment philosophy of pursuing opportunities that provide the best risk adjusted returns across the credit spectrum remains consistent with our stated strategy.","For 2013, our investment spread remains healthy. Spreads relative to a nominal cost of equity averaged 112 bps for the year, as compared to our historic average of approximately 110 bps. For the quarter they were closer to 135 bps. As John mentioned, looking at our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital, we averaged 155 bps which is comparable to our historical average. We have continued to make investment at historic spreads while improving the credit its tenants and cash flows associated with those investments.","So in conclusion we saw an exceptional level of volume in the sector and have been pleased with our $1.51 billion investment in 2013. Including ARCT we invested $4.7 billion in 2013, by par a record investment year for us. John?","John P. Case","Thanks Sumit. We recently disclosed as we know a $503 million acquisition of 84 single tenant net lease properties from d diversified. We believe this acquisition should close in three trenches during the first quarter or first four months of the year. The first tranche of 46% properties closed at the end of January for $202 million. It\u2019s our policy not to announce acquisitions since or after they close, however in this case the seller was required to disclose the contract so we also disclosed a potential sale.","We are subject to a confidentially agreement within one that prevents us from commenting on the transaction, beyond what is already been publically disclosed in the file they case.","As this is our custom we will address all quarterly acquisition activity collectively on the earnings call following the quarter and which is close.","Going to property dispositions we continue selling select properties and redeploying the capital into investment that are better that our investment strategy.","During the year, we sold 75 properties for $134.2 million at a cap rate of approximately 7% on the sale of leased assets. We currently believe our dispositions for 2014 will be in the neighborhood of $50 million possibly reaching $75 million.","Moving on to the balance sheet as Paul mentioned we remain conservatively capital loss with excellent access to all forms of capital. Currently we have more than $900 million available on our line to fund acquisition. We will continue to match fund our acquisitions with permanent and long-term capital, the majority being equity. All our bond issuance in our company\u2019s history that\u2019s 14 of them at a term of 10 years or longer with the exception of one, a five-year notes insurance. We did smooth out our maturity schedule. And outside temporary borrowings on the credit facility 100% of our outstanding debt is fixed rate.","On to our earnings for 2013, normalized FFO and AFFO were both $2.41 per share for the year. Our growth in normalized FFO per share was 19.3%, more than double our previous historical volume. And growth in AFFO per share was 17% versus 2012, also a record.","As we look forward, coming off such a good year from an operational perspective, we remain quite optimistic as we continue to see a robust market for acquisitions with excellent investment opportunities in both non-investment grade retail assets as well as investment grade properties.","Over our 45-year history, we\u2019ve developed many relationships through which we are continuing to generate acquisition opportunities. We are raising our acquisitions guidance for 2014 from $1 billion to $1.2 billion.","Our earnings guidance for 2014 remains at $2.53 to $2.58 per share for both normalized FFO and AFFO. We are maintaining our earnings guidance despite the increased guidance through acquisitions due to the anticipated timing for these acquisitions. Our dividends pay during the year increased by just over 21% compared to 2012, the largest increase in our company\u2019s history.","In December, we declared our 74th dividend increase since the company went public in 1994. We remain optimistic that our activities will continue to support our ability to increase the dividend. Our payout ratio during 2013 was approximately 88% of our AFFO, which is at a level we are comfortable with.","So with that, I\u2019d now like to open it up for questions. Danielle?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good afternoon, guys. I was just hoping you could speak a little bit more about the trend you\u2019re seeing, cap rates, you said they were fairly sticky in the fourth quarter partially due to the sort of rate of money I guess. Do you anticipate that the stay that the case kind of for the foreseeable future in 2014 based on what you\u2019re seeing? And, you talked a little bit about historic spreads and the spreads you got in the fourth quarter. But could you give us a sense where spot spread is relative to your cost of capital and how you\u2019re thinking about that?","John P. Case","Sure, Juan. First of all, with regard to cap rates, we expect them to stay pretty steady. There is a lot of capital out there pursuing these types of assets. So we don\u2019t anticipate them climbing from here. With regard to spreads, our spot spread, if you will, is roughly equivalent to where we were for 2013. So at this point it looks like we\u2019re holding our spreads. Spreads are down from their peak year of 2012. Its capital has been reprised and there we just see sudden movement last year in cap rates and then they stabilized.","Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. I kind of mixed this rather quickly. The reason the guidance here are the same, yet the acquisitions was prompt for the 2014 guidance, you said it was if I understand correctly because of the timing, would it seems like you\u2019ve drawn on your revolver implying you\u2019ve done a fair chunk of the 1.2% sort of year-to-date, I was just curious if you give little bit more color as I may have missed the details.","John P. Case","Yes, it\u2019s based on timing and as you know from the time we solicit a transaction to the time it actually close, this can take up to six months. So from a timing perspective we would anticipate the additional acquisitions occurring later in the year and having more of an impact on 2015 and 2014.","And as you know the quarter is a pretty lumpy for acquisitions for instance last quarter we did a $145 million in the year end which we did $1.5 billion of total acquisition, so you can never really extrapolate from one quarter to an entire year, so we are comfortable with the guidance where it is.","Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay and the drawdown of the revolver since the end of the year that should we assume that is related to acquisitions?","John P. Case","Yes.","Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay great thank you guys.","Paul M. Meurer","Thank you, Juan.","Operator","","And our next question is from Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please go ahead.","Ross T. Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Hi guys good afternoon.","John P. Case","Hi Ross.","Ross T. Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","My question to you would this, if you are forecasting now $1.2 billion of acquisitions, what probability would you put on doing say twice that versus you are not going to do not, I\u2019m just wondering given the robust pipeline that\u2019s out there and what you\u2019ve got all ready sort of locked up. Do you still think that $1.2 billion, you guys have always been conservative in your guidance and I\u2019m just sitting here wondering are we still in an arena where you could just blow that away?","Paul M. Meurer","Well, we are quite selective Ross, as you kind of let me \u2013 over the last few years we\u2019ve been buying 6% to 12% of our source transactions, so it\u2019s always driven by what the opportunities are? Do those opportunities need our investment parameters and are they priced appropriately and so there are always difficult to forecast. Right now investor expectation is approximately $1.2 billion, for organic property level acquisitions.","Ross T. Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","And based on what you are seeing, how much of that do you think it\u2019s going to be in portfolios versus more smaller one-offs?","John P. Case","I would say, if you would normalize it for the end of the year, I\u2019d say about 65% to 70% would be portfolio deals.","Ross T. Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","And from a property type perspective what are you thinking in terms of how much of that\u2019s going to be retail versus other?","John P. Case","The vast majority would be retail.","Ross T. Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Okay, thank you.","John P. Case","Thank you, Ross.","Operator","","Our next question is from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Todd J. Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","I guess I\u2019ll start with you Paul, just on the sourcing capital front, can you just comment on the preferred market, kind of how it influences your capital sourcing activity and out for sometime that preferred market has been essentially closed and I know you guys have room in your capital stack for, but I want to as you look out over the next couple of quarters how you\u2019re budgeting your capital.","Paul M. Meurer","I think my comments can be fairly short talking about the preferred markets. It is pretty opportunistic as you know. It\u2019s going to ebb and flow kind of be more available at different times, and I have to say as a general remark, it\u2019s not the most available market at the moment. I only say that you could actually do it, but related to where you could issue and therefore have a reasonable spread really doesn\u2019t make sense. I think that case there maybe high fixes on a coupon and so that's not something we're really staring out at the moment. Over time we love preferred, no maturity obviously, and great way to match fund, long-term assets like we like to probably do the longer debt, but at the moment preferred is probably not in the cards for the foreseeable future.","Todd J. Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then on the same store growth, it seemed pretty high, was 1.8%. I think, John, you mentioned little closer 1.5%. How did you get that high\u2019s? Usually I guess where you stood may be closer to 1%, but it\u2019s made a pretty good move, I guess what\u2019s contributing to this?","John P. Case","","Well, in 2012, we were impacted by a couple of bankruptcies, Buffets and Friendly. So that put a bit of a lid on it and it\u2019s picked back up as we\u2019ve pushed through that into 2013. The growth is coming from a number of industries, in convenient stores, quick service restaurants, beverages, they're all doing quite well for us and we think it should be around 1.5% for the year and that\u2019s sort of a run rate right now we're pretty comfortable with.","Todd J. Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Just sticking with you, John, I think you mentioned this. Can you just repeat the percentage of investment grade tenant leases that contain annual rate escalators did you say 7% to 8%?","John P. Case","Yes, 70% of our investment grade leases have rent growth which average 1.5% a year.","Todd J. Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. Just switching gears, I think you alluded to this, but if not can you just talk about some of the qualitative benefits that you\u2019ve realized, I guess going back from your ECM portfolio acquisition, which got you into the industrial segment? And then you\u2019ve got ARCT, which moved the needle for you guys into the investment grade segment. Items like relationships you develop with new tenants or maybe your first look at a sale lease back, anything you can share with us that you benefited from these large portfolio transactions?","John P. Case","Yes, I think you\u2019ve hit on it. We have really been able to multiply exponentially the number of tenant relationships we have and the opportunities for investment in terms of properties. So one reason for the increase and the source volume activity has been your net lease has been mainstream. So I think everybody is seeing more of it. So we\u2019re seeing more of it in the retail alone, but we\u2019re also seeing more of it as the property types in which we can invest or expand it.","So we\u2019ve seen more activity as a result of the acquisitions we\u2019ve done and had really many more relationships through which to generate acquisition opportunities. So, I mean, we had to size today, where we feel like we see everything in the marketplace and I don't think that was the case for apps four, five years ago.","Todd J. Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And finally, just on the disposition front. How are you kind of thinking about that as you look out to 2014? Are we going to see more of the mix on vacancies, the short-term leases, any property types, any color you can provide on dispositions?","John P. Case","Yes, when you look at the dispositions, we're thinking maybe 50 million to 75 million for this year. When you look at the activity there, it's a combination of assets, where we\u2019ve seen perhaps the operating performance decline, any areas where we would like to decrease our industry exposure, or where we have the few credit concerns. And in a few cases, there is some assets that are performing all right, but just don\u2019t meet our investment strategy, in other words, it could be a multitenant asset that we are selling.","Todd J. Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","John P. Case","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Lucas with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Christopher A. Lucas \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc","Thanks and good afternoon guys. The other quick question on depositions in the convenience stores, can you kind of \u2013 looking at your portfolio today you mentioned convenience store concentration is down slightly versus Q3. What\u2019s the right level of convenience stores and casual dining restaurants in your portfolio and how long do you think it will stay together?","John P. Case","Yes. We were comfortable with where they are today. We brought and sold significantly down sea stores and restaurants and 10% were comfortable. We had selectively sold some properties in both of those sectors, but really our concentration levels were brought down through our growth and diversified asset pools like the ones that we\u2019ve been watching and a bit concerned with. We continue to look at in particular a couple of casual dining situations and then a couple of the smaller sea stores that don\u2019t produce the same sort of store sales figures that we like to see in our investments there.","Christopher A. Lucas \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc","Got it. Thanks and just one more question. Just going back to the 70% of investment grade leases that have red bumps, could you give a break down of that by property type?","John P. Case","Yes. The industrial distribution and office are both around 2% and the retail is at 1.25%.","Christopher A. Lucas \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc","Okay, got it. And then in that 70% how much of that is say, I don\u2019t know 50% retail, maybe 30% industrial in terms of the composition of actual 70%?","John P. Case","Yes, I think retail is probably about half of it. And then the other categories constitute the remaining half.","Christopher A. Lucas \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc","","Got it. Thanks guys.","John P. Case","Yes, thanks.","Operator","","Our next question is from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Rich C. Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Hi, good afternoon guys. I am curious, the boundary line in credit John, I mean you have $600 million underlying credit at the moment and I assume we will be taking that out with permanent capital fairly quickly. And then I am wondering why the 1.5 billion, are you anticipating that you will need the 1.5 billion capacity, I guess?","John P. Case","Let me start with the first part of your question. We have plenty of flexibility right now on the revolvers that we have no immediate concrete permanent capital or long-term capital plans. So that\u2019s the first answer to your first question.","Why the size? We like the additional liquidity and security and safety that provides the company and it also allows us to pursue larger transactions on a non-financing contingent basis, which really is a competitive advantage that only a few players in the market have.","Rich C. Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yes, the other is\u2026","John P. Case","The other piece of flexibility Rich is timing of the capital rates. So kind of looking now, which again John said, is not eminent in terms of definitive plans we have at the moment, but then able to time the market appropriately having the balance they are likely to do that.","Rich C. Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So, have you guys seen something of the size that you would need a credit line that big to take down?","John P. Case","Well, I mean we\u2019ve seen opportunities with all different forms and shapes and sizes. So we\u2019ve seen over the last several years a few opportunities that would have required the vast majority of that revolver.","Rich C. Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, good. Got it. Thanks. And then, I\u2019m curious on the operating expense. I\u2019m not sure why you made that change and it\u2019s interesting that you did, but it\u2019s probably just more detail, but so I guess that\u2019s each question\u2026","John P. Case","Question about the tenant reimbursement stuff?","Rich C. Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yes, including the tenant imbursements and breaking it out.","John P. Case","You know what, Rich, I don\u2019t like it. I mean, it\u2019s one of those things at the disclosure standpoint. It\u2019s an appropriate accounting approach and it doesn\u2019t add anything for you guys, because these are basically expenses that we do get reimbursed for. We don\u2019t have major outstanding receivables related to them anything like that, but disclose rate through.","The issue was they\u2019ve just gotten to be a little bit more in size. So once they reach little bit more of a material amount, which is now about $25 million annually it was prudent to break it out at some additional disclosure. But I wanted to make sure I was highlighting to you don\u2019t count that in the revenue line and forget about the fact that it offset immediately down the expense line.","Rich C. Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Right. Okay. I got your point. So, when you\u2019re looking at the small operating expenses with the operating expenses that are reimbursed, it went down a little bit this quarter, I mean, it\u2019s not a huge number to begin with, but only down. And remind me, is that just a vacant asset or do guys have some of the multi-tenant or double net type leases or something like that that is also part of that?","John P. Case","No, it\u2019s both. I mean, historically it was primarily carry cost on the vacant properties, tax of insurance, utilities. But over the last 18 to 24 months we have purchased properties with double net structure where we have some responsibilities for roof and structure and as such that budget is in there as some additional property expenses, still only $16.5 million budgeted for next year on what the current run rate of $890 million of annualized revenue. So, still not a huge number, but it has gone up a bit past few years.","Rich C. Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, good. Thanks. And then, the last thing. The other revenue line item, which you know has a couple of crazy things in it. Do you guys have an estimate for what that might be or is there just no way to do that?","John P. Case","Yes, the way I will answer that is don\u2019t put zero in because something always tends up there. Business property taking, which could be an eminent domain grab of some property line if they widened the highway, it\u2019s kind of pretty money if you will. In many cases not impinging on your parking or things of that nature.","And then, interest income. If you have cash that\u2019s received early that you\u2019re putting away in a bank briefly for some income or you\u2019ve raised something on offering that you haven\u2019t used for a day or two. So it just ends up being something. So my only advice it\u2019s to not put zero in, but I hate to give a number, but there is always going to be something there.","Rich C. Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, good. Great. Thank you, guys.","John P. Case","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","The next question is from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Hey, guys.","John P. Case","Hi, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","When you guys think about the investment spreads you\u2019ve been quoting in the spreads, your weighted average cost of capital. Do you think that was permanent financing or using a line especially in sort of spot investments?","John P. Case","No, we\u2019re looking at it based on permanent financing using roughly two-thirds equity, one-third 10-year fixed rate notes.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Got it. And then, if we think about the pipelines that we look at and maybe passed on, I think you\u2019ve quote numbers around $60 billion over the last couple of years. How much of that is ended up in sort of either public or other known hands and how much of it has been bought from the market?","John P. Case","I\u2019d say a significant portion has ended up in the hands of public or private. So we see a lot of it in terms of the exact breakdown.","Paul M. Meurer","You\u2019re right. Yes, you\u2019re right, John, I\u2019d say a majority of them have ended up in either public or private hands, but there have been occasions on large, very large transactions that we aware of where those transactions will float.","John P. Case","Yes.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","And was it mostly a pricing thing that it ended up, that you guys passed on it or where there other considerations?","John P. Case","The situations that I\u2019m alluding to you were all driven by pricing considerations.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Great. That\u2019s all from me. Thank you.","John P. Case","","Thanks, Emmanuel.","Paul M. Meurer","Thanks.","Operator","","Our next question is from Todd Lukasik with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Hi, guys. This is Todd Lukasik. Thanks for taking my questions today.","John, P. Case","Hey, Todd. ","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar Research","Hey. It\u2019s just a question on office. 6.6% of revenue, it looks like and there is a [indiscernible] submitted into the portfolio again this past quarter. I think in the past you guys have talk about that not being one of your favorite property types. I\u2019m wondering if there is anything in particular about the assets that you\u2019re buying there that are especially attractive or sellers are requiring that those be concluded in deals or that may change in thinking around those office properties?","John, P. Case","Well, the office asset, we were typically acquiring office properties that are part of larger portfolios of retail and industrial and distribution properties. That is not always the case. Times will extend our relationship, for instance, with some of our retail tenants by purchasing their office or industrial property as well. So we\u2019ll see some activity from those areas, but our objective is keep office fairly low as a percentage of our overall property rental revenue.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar Research","I know some of those are coming on the balance sheet because the seller is requiring that be part of the deal?","Paul M. Meurer","No fairly. I mean, like John said sometimes they\u2019re any larger portfolio meaning a service pack transaction that was already affected by another service pack provider in this part of a portfolio or it\u2019s the direct conversation with a strong long-term retailer relationship where the assets take a look at, say, their headquarters\u2019 location as an asset we consider doing something with. But not fortunate as that\u2019s part of a larger deal in dialog.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Got you. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, just with regards to AFFO coverage on the dividend, with more industrial and distribution facilities office assets on the balance sheet, those things expire if the tenants doesn\u2019t renew there may be more leasing cost or CapEx that needs to be put into some of those properties to define a new tenant. Is that the kind of thing that might cause you to think to lower the AFFO payout ratio overtime as those we can start to roll or is that you\u2019re comfortable with sort of 88% level in light of those possible incremental cost on the road?","Paul M. Meurer","Don I think over time we would like to see at the just bit lower somewhere in the mid 80s is the level we think we will be comfortable with.","John P. Case","Having said that we\u2019ll continue to grow the dividend, as it relates\u2026","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar Research","Sure","John P. Case","Our overall earnings growth so, if you are talking about x percent of growth, then we are going to be try and grow the dividend 0.8x or whatever might be, to try to move that payout ratio down a little bit over time but it will certainly result in what we think will be dividend growth that will be amenable to and helpful to the investor from a return perspective over time.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar Research","Yes, okay, got you. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot guys.","John P. Case","Thanks Todd.","Operator","And our next question is from Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Hey good afternoon guys.","John P. Case","Hey Jonathan.","Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Sumit I think you mentioned earlier there is a 65-35 split between portfolio and single tenant deals for 2014, is that 65 include the MN deal or I just think going forward deal yet to announced is going to be 55% portfolio?","Sumit Roy","Yes, Jonathan that was a back foot looking that is for 2010 to 2013 so it been obviously included inline transaction which has been closed which includes till 2014.\\","Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Got it, so 2014 what do you think that split ends up?","Sumit Roy","No, it\u2019s going to be similar, I think there was a question asked around where do we see a lot of our volume composition, how do we see our volume competition on the opposition side and I still believe that it\u2019s a big chunkier transaction drive volume and that will represent 65 to 70% of it. And in terms of investment grade versus non-investment grade, it;s going to function of our cost of capital and what we see in the market. There was a repricing of our cost of capital which allowed us to look at areas that we have traditionally being perusing to get the kind of spread we been able to track and so I could see it being right around that 50% to 60% investment grade for 2014 as well but it could be different.","Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird","All right, Then Paul may be a balance sheet question, on the inland purchase there another some debt that you are assuming there of the trenches that are yet to close how much more the revolver is inland going to take on?","Paul M. Meurer","Well, as you know with $202 million at the end of January close and some of that involved assuming mortgages about $50 million or so and though you cannot do the math from there because $500 million transaction the montage amount on it, is that 150 so a 100 is assumed out of the $300 million left to close so say $200 million is need on the facility to ultimately close the balance of the inline transaction.","Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Great that\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot.","Sumit Roy","Thanks Joe.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.","Chris R. Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon guys. As John I just want to see if you can give some more color on the acquisition environment and particular I guess what I am trying to under is where the most competitive size of deal, is it the one-off, is it the small portfolio, where is the market most competitive right now?","John P. Case","","It\u2019s most competitive on larger portfolios where there \u2013 you\u2019re definitely seeing spell in this market, premium cap rates, foreign cap rates for the same asset and a $300 million portfolio transaction then you would see any one-off asset transaction. And again, I attribute that to the fact that there is a fair amount of capital in our industry and business and to deploy it efficiently and quickly once they premium paid for the asset at the. So we do see that spread all things being equal, and asset acquired on a one-off basis. That\u2019s going to have a higher cap rate than one acquired on a larger portfolio. However, that is not universally the case, but that\u2019s certainly the trend perhaps.","Chris R. Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities, Inc.","","And then just a question on that. If the 10\/31 market is recovering at all, is there much activity coming from sort of that one-off buyer, the small individual tax incentive buyer?","John P. Case","","There is more activity. We saw more activity in 2013 than we did in the previous few years combined property. So it's come back. It's still not back to where it once was, pre-Great Recession, but we\u2019re seeing more activity there.","Chris R. Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities, Inc.","So what do you think changes that momentum? Is this financing availability or \u2013 well, turned up investments. What you think of kind of gain.","John P. Case","Yes this is a bit more of an impressive investment environment that you had. Again, people are getting their feet under that and feeling a bit more confident even though the economic signals appear to be mixed. They're just seeing more people go into transaction in that marketplace.","Chris R. Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it.","John P.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter 2015 operating results conference call. Discussing our results with me, John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law.","The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's form 10-K. We will be observing a two question moments the during the question-and-answer portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I would now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.","John Case","Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We had a solid fourth quarter which concluded an excellent year for our Company with annualized rental revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. AFFO per share during the fourth quarter increased 4.6% to $0.68, and 2015 AFFO per share increased 6.6% to $2.74. As announced in yesterday's Press Release, we are reiterating our AFFO per share guidance for 2016 of $2.85 to $2.90, as we anticipate another attractive year of earnings growth. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional details on our financial results. Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks, John. I'm going to provide a few highlights, just a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Interest expense decreased in quarter by $7.1 million to $52 million. This decrease was driven by less overall debt in our balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of bonds and almost $200 million of mortgages last year. The decrease was also partially due to the inclusion of preferred dividends that were treated as interest expense in the fourth quarter of last year, when we redeemed our series E deferred equity shares in October of 2014. Another larger impact was from the recognition of a noncash gain of approximately $4.1 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense. ","As a reminder these mark to market adjustments on our floating to fixed interest rate swaps will tend to cause volatility in our reported interest expense and FFO on a quarterly basis, particularly when there is significant movement in short-term forward curve rates as we saw at the end of the fourth quarter. We do adjust for this noncash gain when computing our cash AFFO earnings.","On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong, with interest coverage at 4.5 times and fixed charge coverage at 4.0 times. Our fixed charge coverage is the highest it has been and will over ten years. Our G&A in 2015 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 5%. We estimate this will remain our approximate run rate for G&A in 2016 as well. Our non reimbursable property expenses in 2015 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 1.4%. These expenses came in lower this year due to lower portfolio vacancies, faster releasing of vacant properties, lower property insurance premiums and fewer onetime expenses. We estimate our run rate for property expenses in 2016 to be approximately 1.5%.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September we established an ATM or at the market equity distribution program. In Q4, we utilized this program to issue approximately 714,000 shares generating net proceeds of $35.8 million. And in October, we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering. We used the proceeds at that time to pay down all outstanding borrowings on our unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. This $2 billion credit facility today has a current balance of $370 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only 170 million in mortgages and 275 million of bonds coming due in 2016. And our maturity schedule was well laddered thereafter. Finally, our debt to EBITDA ratio stands at approximately 5.1 times, and is only 5.5 times inclusive of preferred equity. Now, let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on these results.","John Case","Thanks, Paul and let me begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.4%, ten basis points higher than last quarter and unchanged from a year ago despite having managed our most active year ever for lease expirations. Additionally, economic occupancy remains strong at 99.2%. During the year we released 253 properties with leases expiring recapturing 101% of expiring rents. As is typical for us we achieved this without any spending on tenant improvements. At the end of the year we had 71 properties available for lease out of 4538 properties in the portfolio. Over the last 20 years, we have re-leased or sold more than 2000 properties with expired leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rents on those properties that were re-leased. Our same store rents increased 1.3% during the quarter and also for the year. We expect annual same store rent growth to remain approximately 1.3% in 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we have never had a year with negative same store rent growth since we started reporting this metric 20 years ago.","Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type all of which contributes to the stability of the cash flow. At the end of the year are properties were leased to 240 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component, outside of retail, is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the fourth quarter.","Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.9% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.9% of rental revenue. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in 2016 by Walgreens pending the acquisition of Rite Aid which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue. The store level performance of our retail tenants remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties continues to be 2.6 times on a four-wall basis, and the median is also 2.6 times.","Moving on acquisitions, during the quarter we completed $204 million in acquisitions, and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. In 2015, we sourced approximately $32 billion in acquisition opportunities, which is our second most active year ever for sourced volume. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring just 4% from nearly $1.3 billion of the amount sourced and continue to see a strong flow of opportunities in our target property types. We continue to expect to complete approximately $750 million in acquisitions for 2016.","As always, this principally reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any large scale transactions. Let may hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. During the fourth quarter of 2015 we invested $204 million in 104 properties, located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.7 years. On a revenue basis, 28% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 89% of the revenues are generated from retail and 11% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 17 industries. We closed 14 independent transactions in the fourth quarter, and the average investment per property was approximately $2 million. Year end 2015 we invested $1.26 billion in 286 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.5 years.","On a revenue basis, 46% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 45 different tenants in 21 industries. Of the 49 independent transactions closed during 2015, three transactions were about $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy.","We sourced more than $7 billion in the fourth quarter. During 2015 we have sourced nearly $32 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities 60% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $13 billion were one-off assets. As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the fourth quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.","Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter we sold 16 properties for $13.9 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.3%. This brings us to 38 properties sold in 2015 for $65.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized and unlevered IRR at 12.1%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 236 basis points in the fourth quarter which were above our historical average spreads. For the year spreads were 183 basis points. In conclusion, given the continued activity in our space we remain confident in reaching our 2016 acquisition target of approximately $750 million and disposition volume between $50 million and $75 million. With that I'd like to hand it back to John.","John Case","Thanks, Sumit. We had a very active year in the capital markets front. We made our finding needs. And 2015 we raised approximately $1.2 billion in equity capital positioning us well as we entered 2016. We are now at the lowest leverage levels we've been at in ten years with debt to total market cap at approximately 25%. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape, with plenty of liquidity and financial flexibility. And our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive strong earnings and dividend growth while remaining disciplined with our investment strategy. Last night we announced our 84th dividend increase, representing a 5% increase from this time last year. We've increased our dividend every year since the Company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio in 2015 was 82.9% which is a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we had a great year and remain optimistic for 2016. Our portfolio is performing well, and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. We remain well positioned to act on high quality acquisitions, given our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and cost of capital advantage. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And will go firs to Juan Sanabria of Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, thanks for the time, guys. On the acquisition front could you just comment about how you're feeling about opportunities maybe versus three or six months ago? Are you looking at more portfolio deals given it seems like some of the premiums have gone away and any possibilities to partner with third parties to take down larger deals?","John Case","Sure, Juan. First of all, as we look forward on the acquisitions front, we're still seeing a good steady flow of opportunities. And, we're still confident in our $750 million acquisition guidance for this year, and that doesn't include any large scale portfolios or entity level type transactions, but we are constantly scouring the market for opportunities and considering opportunities on a large scale.","As far as working with third parties, it is something we would consider. We haven't done that before, but if there were a transaction where perhaps there was a large portfolio where part of the real estate made a lot of sense for us and part of it didn't, we would certainly consider parting with someone who wanted the portion of the real estate that was not consistent with our investment philosophy.","Juan Sanabria","Thanks. And just on your cost of capital front is there any have you guys thought about taking of advantage of where your share price is today and hitting the market now ahead of any potential bigger deal flow that may be coming the way in 2016? Or have you think about that?","John Case","We're constantly monitoring all of the capital markets, equity, debt, preferred. Right now we only have about $350 million outstanding on our lines so we've got capacity of about $1.7 billion, and there's no need to access the markets unless they were particularly appealing or we had any immediate use for the proceeds. So we're paying attention to what's happening out there, looking at it to, but right now we're comfortable where we are as we speak today.","Operator","And will go next to Nick Joseph of Citi.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. I guess, sticking with acquisitions, what are you seeing in terms of pricing of portfolios compared to individual assets?","John Case","Individual assets are now priced a bit more aggressively than the portfolios, which is a flip of where we were a couple of years ago. So, we ended up looking at one off acquisitions are probably trading at cap rates of 20 to as much as 50 basis points inside of where midsize portfolios of comparable properties are trading. So there is a little bit of an [ard] there.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, John. It's Michael Bilerman. As you think about the other side of using your currency instead of just issuing new equity and raising that capital you certainly can use that equity in any sort of M&A. And I'm just curious how, you're a former banker, are you trying to shake the tree loose out of any of your competitors, just given how high your stock trades and where your multiple is in trying to drive some of that in a public to public M&A and leveraging your currency in that fashion?","John Case","We actually are constantly looking at entity level opportunities and given the multiple advantage we have, relative to the sector today, it makes sense for us to consider those opportunities. But, you've got to have to transact you got to have a willing logical seller and a willing logical buyer. So we'll see what may or may happen on that front. But it certainly is something that we're considering.","Operator","And we will go next to Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks. Just following up on that the M&A question, just trying to understand, obviously you have the cost of capital if were to just sort of prioritize, what do you do with this cost of capital from here? If we look past at least historically, you've created obviously premiums to the broader REIT group, but that premium has not remained there for a considerable amount of time, so it seems like there's a window and I'm just trying to understand what if you were to prioritize what you do with it? If you could walk us through that it would be helpful.","John Case","Yes, well we have typically traded at a premium to the sector. The premium widens during periods of market volatility and uncertainty like we're seeing today. But for the vast majority of our history we've traded at the highest multiple in the sector. As we look at what we may do with the capital advantages from a cost perspective that we have today we're really -- we want to say consistent with our investment strategies. So, on the retail front it's looking for service oriented non-discretionary low price point businesses that have good real estate and rents that makes sense, structures that makes sense. So we think those assets and property types and tenants are better equipped to work through a variety of economic cycles and to compete with e-commerce. And then on the investor side it's high-quality real estate, leased to Fortune 1000 companies with investment grade credit ratings so those are as the buckets we're really focused on. What we don't want to do is go out and wantonly use a lot of capital to buy properties that aren't consistent with the assets that have worked for the Company over the long-term. So, we don't feel pressured to buy inferior assets at times where a multiple advantage is very significant.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay and then just if you were say hypothetically there were two portfolios of public portfolio, a public Company, and a larger, private portfolio, somewhat similar return price files, similar properties. How do you think about those two, are there factors that dry you towards one or the other at this point, and would you be considering either of them even if sort of your leverage ticks up they are not leverage neutral?","John Case","Well we love to do transactions on a leverage neutral basis, and that's what we've done in the past. Whether it be on the private side or be entity level side. So really what's going to drive which opportunities we pursue is going to be opportunities that result in the most value for the shareholders of our Company. That's how we're going to look at it. We have shown in the past that we can execute public transactions, entity level transactions, or large portfolio transactions. And we do have some leverage capacity today. As you heard that at our lowest leverage levels in the last ten years so we have taken advantage of the capital markets to really strengthen and solidify the balance sheet. So we're very well positioned to grow today where we could take on a bit more leverage than we have today. Our long-term target has been two thirds equity one third debt. As you know we're inside of that today.","Operator","And we will go next to RJ Milligan of Baird.","RJ Milligan","John, to those comments obviously attractive cost of equity here, but how do you think or Paul, how do you think about your cost of debt here? How has it changed over the past couple months? Do you have any visibility where you could issue long-term debt today?","John Case","Ten years -- This is John here. Ten year debt is in the low 4s 4.10%, 4.20%. Spreads have capped out as rates have declined so there hasn't been a big pickup there, Paul, anything?","Paul Meurer","The bandwidth, all in, has really stayed in the 4% to 4.2% range in spite of wherever the Treasury or spreads have moved.","RJ Milligan","Okay in terms of acquisitions this year, has the spread between investment grade and below investment grade shifted at all given the macro volatility? Or would you say that it is still on a risk adjusted basis more attractive to be going after the investment-grade tenants?","John Case","Well I mean we're going to continue -- the spreads really haven't changed the relationship of those spreads. We'll pursue opportunities in both sectors, the ones that meet our investment parameters and make the most sense for us. On the investment-grade side you're seeing some fairly aggressive pricing as Sumit alluded to earlier, around the 5% area on the really higher-quality product. The non-investment grade you're still seeing right around 6% on the higher-quality product. That's not much different than where we were at the end of last year. Cap rates have remained stable, but the ranges on investment-grade, go up to as high as the high six's and on non-investment grade they go up to as high as 8%.","The spreads are better today from an investment standpoint given our cost of capital. So, for the year last year, we had investment spreads of 185 basis points on about the $1.3 billion that we acquired. In the fourth quarter, that was more like 236 basis points on the $204 million we acquired. Today, they're running in excess of 250 basis points. So, the margins have never been better than they are now on the acquisitions front. So, we'll be more driven by the opportunities in both the non-investment grade and investment-grade sectors, and we'll react to those versus having sort of a fixed percentage of what we want to buy each. That's consistent with how we've always done it.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Vineet Khanna of Capital One Securities.","Vineet Khanna","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So just for those tenants that provide unit level financials is there anything in those results that suggest a change in economic activity, or are there geographies that are doing better than others or anything like that?","John Case","No, and we are constantly looking at that. The tenant base is in excellent shape. There's some non-material issues as there always are that are factored into our guidance. And so right now we feel good about the tenant base and their health and condition. ","Vineet Khanna","Sure. And then as it pertains to acquisitions, are there any industries that you are looking to invest in or not invest in? And then has there been any change in sort of the buyer or seller pools?","John Case","No significant changes on the buyer seller pool, and the industries are consistent with the ones that we're in. So if you look at the 47 industries we are in today, with very few exceptions, they're going to align with in those industries. We want to stay away from discretionary industries and businesses.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Rob Stevenson of Janney.","Rob Stevenson","It looks like in the fourth quarter according to the supplemental that you guys bought 10 Rite-Aids. Are those basically straight down the middle sort of normal ten year plus leases, or have you guys started to look more opportunistically at some of the Rite Aid locations or even Walgreens locations that have five years or less in it to possibly to do a re-tenanting?","John Case","That was a sale leaseback transaction we did directly with Rite Aid who is an existing tenant of ours, and it was done before the Walgreens announcement so it worked out very well for us. So those weren't one off transactions. It was just a fortuitous timing I would say in terms of when the transaction was executed.","Rob Stevenson","Is there the capability to do anything on an opportunistic basis with short-term lease Rite Aids or even Walgreens where the current owner might be across the Street from something else from one or the other locations, might getting worried that they are going to close down on the location where you guys can buy it at an attractive rate and repurpose it to some other tenant? If that winds up\u2026","John Case","That is not a big emphasis of our business. We pay attention to those opportunities, but we are really looking for assets with long lease terms that are well positioned competitively, and we're not going to have any sort of near-term issues for. If we saw something incredibly compelling we would certainly take a look at it where we had a kind of tenant in our back pocket, and we knew we were going to sign a 20 year lease on favourable terms, on a building that was going to become vacant or vacant, we would certainly look at that. We've done that in the past. Is not a major component of our business, but we have done that in the past.","Operator","And will go next to Ross Nussbaum of UBS.","Ross Nussbaum ","Hey, John, good afternoon.","John Case","Hey, Ross.","Ross Nussbaum","It sounds like from some of your earlier comments, regarding acquisitions and in particular M&A it sounds like you are more open to M&A today than you have been in the recent past. Do you think that's a fair characterization?","John Case","I would say given the multiple advantage we have relative to the other 13, 14 companies in the sector that it's a bit more interesting today. But, at the same time, I would say that we want to end up with assets that are consistent with our investment philosophy. So we're not signaling that we go out there just to do a large transaction, take on assets that we couldn't, we'd consider to be of risk in the intermediate to long-term.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay. And, you and I have talked about this topic before but how do you think about net asset value or property value versus investment spread? So even if you theoretically could buy another public player at a multiple that would be accreted to your FFO, what if that meant paying a reasonably high, I don't know what the right word is, premium to the actual value of the assets when you know you can go into the private market all day long and pay actual NAV or property value? How do you balance that thinking?","John Case","We want to be paying NAV whether we're buying in the private market or whether we're buying in the public market. There would have to be something incredibly compelling about the opportunity strategically for us to do that, but we're focused both on spreads and accretion as well as the value of the assets. So we would not want to do anything that would be NAV dilutive.","Operator","And will go next to Amit Nihalani of Oppenheimer.","Amit Nihalani","Hi, good afternoon. Can you guys comment on the difference in cap rates for industrial versus retail?","John Case","Yes, Sumit, industrial versus retail?","Sumit Roy","We haven't really seen much of a movement in cap rates for the type of industrial assets that we pursue which is Fortune 1000 clients with ten plus years. In terms of the cost you're paying right around that $65 to $75 to $80 per square feet for brand new concrete tilt up type of buildings, and that seems to still be the case today. With retail, as depending on the product type it ranges from anywhere between 150 to 250 square feet all the way up to 400, 450 for a C store. So, and again with regards to pricing despite all the volatility that we're seeing in the market, we have not seen cap rates move in one direction or the other. They stayed fairly steady for both those products I'd say over the last six to nine months.","Amit Nihalani","Got it and just bigger picture any changes to the watch list or anything else we should be aware of on that front?","John Case","No. The watch list is down to 1% of revenues which is the lowest it's been in the last five years. Again the portfolio is in good health. There are no material issues for us.","Operator","And will go next to Tyler Grant of Green Street Advisors.","Tyler Grant","Hello, guys. Just a quick question for me. What do you see as being the right size for realty income in terms of assets?","John Case","The right size? In terms of assets? I don't think there is necessarily a right size, but we will continue to grow the Company consistent with our investments strategies and take advantage of the opportunities out there in what is a vast marketplace. So, we do not have a target in terms of size. It's really more about delivering earnings growth and dividend growth and total shareholder return.","Tyler Grant","All right. Sure. In terms of do you think that there would be anything more attractive about just having $25 billion worth of assets instead of having call it $18 billion worth of assets?","John Case","No. I don't think so. This is a very scalable business. When you look at our EBITDA margin that's nearly 94%, it's sector leading. We're delivering more of our revenues to our shareholders than the rest of the sector. Our G&A margin of 5%, very efficient. With size and scale comes increased efficiencies, which really lead to I think a competitive advantage based on size. But we wouldn't grow just to grow, we would grow to create earnings growth and dividend growth with assets consistent with our investment philosophy.","Operator","And we will go next to Todd Stender of Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","The deal flow you're seeing continues to be pretty steady and robust. Can you provide what the mix is maybe just share what the percentages if you look at where the opportunities came from, investment opportunities, came from last year whether they are marketed details, existing relationships or pension funds even bringing you opportunities?","John Case","Sure. So Sumit, do you want to take that?","Sumit Roy","Yes, sure. So Todd, in terms of the portfolio and one-off mix, I would say it's about 25% of what we sourced last year versus even in 2015 was about the same. 25% is one off, 75% portfolio deals. So when you start to focus then on the portfolio deals what we've started to notice is a lot more companies that were sort of hesitant in years past to even engage in conversations dealing with sale lease backs became far more open to those types of conversations, and in fact some of them even resulted in transactions that we were involved in, in last year. Whereas in 2014, most of the product that we saw were from companies that were very familiar with the sale leaseback market and most of the volume driven were by either other sellers of large portfolios both private and public and\/or companies that had done sale-leasebacks in the past. So the only real change in terms of the product mix I would say that we saw was new entrants coming in that had not engaged in conversations in years past. But outside of that, one-off versus portfolio, the mix is about the same. It was 26% in 2014 and 25% in 2015. So, I'd say the mix is about the same.","Todd Stender","Is it more compelling, Sumit, just because of pricing -- commercial real estate prices have been so good people are at least considering it now?","Sumit Roy","I would say pricing is definitely one piece of it, but I would also say that there has been a fair amount of external pressures by investors, etcetera rattling the cages and talking about what is it that a particular operating company should focus on. The debt markets have helped. The fact that our cap rates have compressed have helped, but I think the single biggest issue has always, the single biggest driver in my mind has been some of the investors talking about monetizing real estate and getting back to the core business. I think that has been the single biggest factor.","Operator","And we will go next to Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore","So, Sumit, are you sort of saying that -- and, John, that the -- remember when we had all these retailers that wanted to do spins, spins of their real estate, and that is sort of not happening now. The government has kind of shut that down, so is that group of potential sale-leaseback guys coming to? Are you seeing more of that, those pre-spin guys that can't do the spins anymore?","John Case","Yes, I think that was actually favorable news to the net lease industry and companies like ours to the extent they want to monetize their real estate they're going to be talking to us. I do think to add on to what Sumit was saying is that these companies that have large real estate holdings that are not real estate companies are under pressure to increase their own returns on investment and carrying that real estate when it could be sold to someone like us or someone in our sector can certainly enhance their return on investment, so there is that pressure and we're seeing that. The recent news with regard to the ability to do these spins is certainly a net positive to the sector.","Rich Moore","Okay, good, thank you. And then it's interesting because you guys probably don't sit and look at the stock market all day long like a bunch of us on the phone do, but pretty much the only thing green on my screen is you guys. That means the market is worried about something, and I'm curious how you guys monitor for bankruptcies? I mean what's the chance among your tenant base that you can have a surprise in there and how close are you in touch do you think with the health of each of these retailers?","John Case","So we have a -- as you know, you've covered us for a long time, as you know Rich, we have our own internal credit and research team, and we are constantly analyzing and scouring the portfolio in terms of credit and industry trends as well. Currently, our watch list is 1%. Tenants that we have potential credit issues with are just under 6% of the entire portfolio, but most of that doesn't make it on to the watchlist because it's really good real estate and we'd like to have it back, and we think there's upside there. So in terms of our coverages they've held steady right around 2.6, 2.7 we're not anticipating any sort of a tenant -- material tenant the issues. So we to track that very closely and don't see anything there.","Operator","We will go next to Dan Donlan of Ladenburg Thalmann.","Dan Donlan","Thank you, good afternoon. John given your comments on M&A I think you said that public debt the REITs would have to have as that are consistent with your investment philosophy. How many REITs out there do you think have such assets?","Rich Moore","Dan, you are cutting out.","Dan Donlan","Sorry. Can you hear me now better?","John Case","Yes.","Dan Donlan","Sorry about that. Given that you said that as you look at some public to public M&A that another Company would have to have assets that are consistent with your investment philosophy. I was just kind of curious how many REITs are out there that you think have assets that are consistent with your investment philosophy?","John Case","There are a number of them. Are there any that are completely pure? Maybe one or two, but in terms of the REITs that have assets that are consistent with what we're looking for and have a material amount of them, maybe they represent 50% or more. There are a lot of companies out there.","Dan Donlan","I then just kind of curious on the casual dining front. It's been a sector that you guys have steered clear of since the last recession, was just kind of curious, your appetite there. Just going back to Rich's question, given the inability of these REIT conversions to happen there's a lot of restaurants out there that that still own a lot of their own real estate, so just kind of curious your thoughts there?","John Case","Yes so right now, casual dining for us is about 3.5% of our overall revenues, and some of the stumbles the Company has made in the past have been related to casual dining. And we've learned what we want on that front, and so we have a fairly high bar in terms of what we would consider there. We want operating concepts that are stable to growing. We want box sizes that if we ever get them back are of the size that we can be more easily re-let. We want market rents. We want something close to replacement cost as well, and we want coverages that are in excess of what our portfolio averages somewhere around three times.","So if we find those types of opportunities, and of course the real estate needs to be attractive as well, we'll pursue them. So, the fact that we've not done many of them is more a function of quality and structure of some of the transactions that have been done versus us saying we won't look at casual dining, because we will look at casual dining. But the parameters around what we will invest in our fairly tight.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Collin Mings of Raymond James.","Collin Mings","First question for me you guys mentioned the watchlist remains low and hasn't really changed much. But can you maybe just highlight what the themes are as you think about the planned dispositions for this year? And could we see some shift maybe towards some more occupied versus vacant properties? And then just as it relates to that issue, going back to Rich's question, could some of the dispositions be maybe in that pool of tenants that aren't necessarily on the watchlist but maybe in lower quality given some of the economic concerns other?","John Case","Yes, I mean on the dispositions front, I think in terms of what would be selling, it will look similar to what it looked like in 2015, maybe a bit more occupied than vacant. We had more vacant than we typically have. And the types of properties on the dispositions front are casual dining, childcare, older generation, non-discretionary -- I'm sorry, discretionary tenants in theory or real estate locations perhaps with credit issues. Or they are higher quality properties, but we're looking to reduce our exposure to certain tenant or to a certain sector. So on the sales front I think you'll see a little more occupied then vacant in terms of the ratio, and we're looking to sell 50 million to 75 million this year, and that's incorporated into our guidance.","Collin Mings","I guess along those lines just as far as how does your economic outlook maybe factor into that at all? I think last year there was some acceleration in your disposition activity. Is there anything from a broader economic perspective that might again cause you to accelerate or want to jettison some more some of that exposure that you highlighted that you are relatively more concerned about?","John Case","No, again when you look at the size of the watch list and it's in your 1%, it's fairly small. So possibly we've had I think our most active year on the dispositions front was about $135 million and we've been as low as 50 million, 60 million. We're kind of thinking 50 million to 75 million, but we remain the right to be flexible there. We certainly did factor in macroeconomic conditions, but it's really that then taken down to the micro level and does it make sense for the reasons I went through to sell an asset or not.","Operator","And this concludes the question and answer portion of Realty income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.","John Case","Okay, thank you very much, Cassandra. Thanks everyone for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you at the conferences coming up and everyone have a good afternoon. Take care. Bye.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s first quarter 2017 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.","John Case","Thanks, Janeen. Welcome to our call today. We are pleased to begin the year with a successful quarter, achieving AFFO per share growth of nearly 9%. We completed $371 million of acquisitions, maintained high portfolio occupancy of 98.3% and raised $1.5 billion of permanent and long-term capital at favorable pricing. Our balance sheet strength positions us to continue pursuing the highest quality net lease properties in the marketplace, while securing attractive returns and investment spreads given our sector-leading cost of capital.","Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks, John. I will provide some highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $1.4 million to $59.3 million. This decrease is primarily driven by the recognition of a $1.3 million non-cash gain on interest rate swaps during the quarter, which caused the decrease in net liability and lowered our interest expense. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of non-cash swap gains or losses to calculate AFFO. Interest expense this quarter was also impacted by the recording of approximately 1 month or $2.3 million of preferred dividends as interest expense. Since the redemption notice for our preferred stock was issued before quarter end, we were required to reclassify the preferred stock as a liability at that time and then recognize about a month of preferred dividend as interest expense.","Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.7% for the quarter as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 2.7% in the first quarter. We tend to experience slightly higher property expenses in the first quarter, but we continue to expect non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues to be in the 1.5% to 2% range for all of 2017.","Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.71 for the quarter versus $0.68 a year ago. FFO per share was impacted by a $13.4 million or $0.05 per share non-cash redemption charge related to the unamortized original issuance costs associated with our preferred F shares. Excluding this non-cash charge, FFO per share would have been $0.76 for the quarter. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.76 per share, representing an 8.6% increase over the year ago period.","Briefly turning to the balanced sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. As John mentioned, year-to-date, we have raised approximately $1.5 billion of well-priced long-term capital to fund our acquisition activity and retire over $400 million of high coupon preferred stock. Our senior unsecured bonds now have a weighted average remaining maturity of 8.1 years and our fixed charge coverage ratio is now 4.5x. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $38 million of mortgage debt. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $276 million of debt coming due later this year and our maturity schedule is very well lathered thereafter. And finally, our overall leverage remains modest with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.5x. In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital.","Now, let me turn the call back over to John.","John Case","Thanks, Paul. I will begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged from last quarter and up 50 basis points from a year ago. We expect our occupancy to remain at approximately 98% in 2017. During the quarter, we re-leased 49 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 104% of the expiring rent, which is above our long-term average. This quarter was the third consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%.","Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the companies in our sector who also report this metric. Our same-store rent increased 1.6% during the quarter, primarily due to higher percentage rent. 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.","Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 250 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenues from our traditional retail properties, the largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.","Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.8% of rental revenue and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11.1% of the rental revenue. We remain comfortable with the momentum in the drugstore industry and continue to view our exposure favorably given the industry\u2019s attractive demographic tailwinds, nondiscretionary nature and continued growth from in-store pharmacy pickup. Additionally, Walgreens and CVS, our top two drugstore tenants, have generated 15 consecutive quarters of positive same-store pharmacy sales growth. During the quarter, we added Kroger to our top 20 tenants, representing 1.2% of our annualized rental revenue.","We are pleased with our Kroger locations and the addition of this high-quality investment grade rated grocery chain, which we view as one of the better operators in the industry. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 45% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our four-wall weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x and the median is 2.7x.","Moving on to acquisitions briefly before handing it over to Sumit, we completed 371 million in acquisitions during the quarter and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $10.8 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain deliberate in our investment strategy, acquiring only 3% of the amount sourced. Our selectivity reflects our focus on quality. We continue to expect to complete $1 billion of acquisitions in 2017. As a reminder, this estimate primarily reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large scale transactions.","Now, let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss acquisitions and dispositions.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. During the first quarter of 2017, we invested $371 million in 60 properties located in 18 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.4 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 68% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 98.7% of the revenues are generated from retail and 1.3%, are from industrial. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, automotive services and dealerships. We closed 11 discrete transactions in the first quarter. The transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately 11 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 54% of the volume sourced, were portfolios and 46% or more than $5 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 28% for the first quarter. Of the $371 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 23% were one-off transactions.","As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain flat in the first quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 195 basis points in the first quarter, which were well above our historical averages. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Regarding dispositions, during the first quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of $31.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.3% unrealized and un-levered IRR of 9.8%. In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million.","With that, I would like to hand it back to John.","John Case","Thanks Sumit. We were very active on the capital markets front in the quarter. We issued approximately $800 million in common equity at an average price to investors of approximately $62 per share. Additionally, with the highest credit rating in the net lease sector, we issued $700 million in fixed rate unsecured debt with a weighted average term of 18.3 years and a yield of 4.1%. Our credit spreads remain among the lowest in the REIT industry and our leverage continues to decline with net debt to total market cap of approximately 26% and debt to EBITDA of approximately 5.5x. We currently have approximately $1.5 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. This provides us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow the company.","Last month, we increased the dividend for the 91st time in the company\u2019s history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over 1 year ago. We have increased our dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our dividend represents an AFFO payout ratio of 83.5% based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance.","To wrap it up, we have had another good start to the year, our portfolio remains healthy, our growth prospects are attractive and our balance sheet remains in excellent shape. We continue to be well positioned to capitalize on the highest quality acquisition opportunities, given our sector leading cost of capital and financial flexibility. These strengths of our business should continue to position us to generate dependable dividends that grow over time.","At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, what I have noticed over the last maybe quarter or so and maybe you have done through \u201816, taking a bit more exposure to larger boxes so that Walmart neighborhoods, which are maybe in the 40,000 square foot range and then the Kroger\u2019s, which are maybe slightly larger, can you maybe just walk us through what makes you comfortable with exposure to big boxes and any trend you maybe seeing in your own portfolio in comparing and contrasting to the smaller exposure smaller boxes?","John Case","Yes, sure Vikram. The majority of our retail big boxes that we own are leased to tenants with service non-discretionary or low priced point components to their business. So we are comfortable with those. Only about 1% of our properties, about 50 big boxes are boxes that are leased to tenants that don\u2019t meet that \u2013 those investor parameters that are selling discretionary goods. But those tenants, many of them are strong discount merchandisers that are doing very well. So we are comfortable with the larger boxes. On the grocery side, you mentioned, that\u2019s a business we like quite a bit. 95% of grocery sales occur in brick-and-mortar locations and we are aligned with some of the top operators in the country and the top regional operators there. So that\u2019s an area where we are comfortable owning big boxes. And you will see some properties that are even at 40,000 square feet up to even 65,000 square feet, 70,000 square feet range.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just second question and just to follow-on, in terms of the watch list and the rent, the overall rent coverage, any changes in the watch list and just in that coverage, can you maybe give us a range of what the range of the rent coverage is?","John Case","Well, I think it\u2019s more important to look at the median. I mean we have coverages that are close to one, and we have coverages that are at 4x. Our median for the whole portfolio is 2.7x and our average is 2.8x. You mentioned the watch list. The watch list has remained in the low 1% area. It\u2019s still there. Not a material change. Our retail tenants have seen their sales grow at approximate 3% over the last year, so we are pleased with that as well. And then in terms of the tenants outside of our top 20, our coverages on those tenants is actually higher, notably higher than it is for our overall portfolio and I think that\u2019s important to note. Just because the tenant is not in the top 20, it doesn\u2019t mean they are not a strong tenant.","Operator","And we will go next to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Joshua Dennerlein","Hey guys. I am just curious, does Kroger coming on your top 20 list, was that from an acquisition this quarter or was it like we are all loving towards spot in 1Q or was it kind of hovering below the surface for a while and just added a property or two?","John Case","We added several properties this quarter, which pushed them up to 1.2% of revenues and knocked Home Depot out of the top 20. So it was not a single large portfolio. It was a smaller portfolio.","Joshua Dennerlein","Okay. And then are there \u2013 I now the Rite Aid-Walgreens merger, it sounds like it\u2019s kind of hitting some hiccups, if it doesn\u2019t go through, do you expect that will have to be any asset sales by the new combined company?","John Case","Right now, the FTC is asking Walgreens to sell up to 1,200 assets via the acquisition. It\u2019s expected to close in July and there have been some rumors that it may be blocked by the FTC. If it were to move forward, we have looked at our exposure in terms of asset closures and we only have 15 Rite Aids that are within 2-mile radius of the Walgreens. And even if they were re-let to another retailer, such as Fred\u2019s, which is being mentioned, our credit would remain Walgreens. And the average lease term for our Rite Aid properties is just under 10 years, so we still have that credit. So we think it will be a non-event for us.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Curious what you are seeing in terms of pricing differentials between portfolio deals and individual properties?","John Case","Sure. On an individual asset, we are seeing them trade anywhere from 25 basis points to 100 basis points below cap rates. 25 basis points to 100 basis points below where we would see them trade any portfolio. So there is still a notable difference. There is a premium cap rate for portfolios.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then just for leverage, you talked about it had been trended down, do you expect to maintain the current leverage levels, do you think you could continue to trend down or should we expect leverage to move up from here?","John Case","I mean I think we are going to maintain this level. This is a level that we are comfortable with and it gives us sufficient flexibility to operate the business.","Operator","And we will go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James.","Collin Mings","Hey. Thank you. Just as it relates to the watch list, last quarter, I believe you indicated that the below average tenant credit bucket was about 6% of revenues, any change to that or has anything slip maybe from one of the top two categories to the average bucket?","John Case","No, it\u2019s still holding to just shade above 6%, so there has been no material change to that.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then just on the same-store revenues, can you discuss what really drove the jump in the same-store revenues as it relates to the car dealerships and sporting goods buckets, was there \u2013 what\u2019s going on as far as just the lease terms and the bumps with those?","John Case","It\u2019s really percentage rents with some primary driver and they came in early in the year and gave us higher than expected same-store rent growth. Not higher than expected, but the higher than expected \u2013 what we expect for the full year, which is still around 1% to 1.2%. So it was higher in the first quarter, primarily due to that percentage rent.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott","Hi guys. Given the continued pursuit of higher quality properties within your business, I am just curious when you combine that with \u2013 if we get 10\/31 is going away and that impacted that market, wouldn\u2019t that potentially uniquely open up that avenue to you as a new opportunity somewhat with your external growth platform, I am just curious how you think about that and integrate that into your thinking with higher quality properties?","John Case","I do think that the 10\/31 buyers go away, that there will be more opportunity to play in those assets. They traded at levels that we think don\u2019t necessarily make sense, so we really haven\u2019t been a player on sell side or on the buy side in the 10\/31 market. But if that were to occur, I think you are right Michael. I think that we could see some acquisition opportunities as a result to that if we were to step in there.","Michael Knott","And what would be your \u2013 do you have any ballpark estimate you would be willing to share publicly of where those type of assets that pricing would come up to in terms of cap rate?","John Case","No. I think it\u2019s premature at this point. I don\u2019t want to speculate on where that pricing might be and where it would go if they were to actually get rid of 10\/31 exchanges in the new tax package.","Operator","And we will go next to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.","Haendel St. Juste","Hi. I guess it\u2019s still good morning out there. Can you talk a bit about your \u2013 what you are seeing in the corporate sale lease back market and your appetite for larger corporate lease back type of transaction?","Sumit Roy","Yes. This is Sumit. We continue to see a healthy flow of sale leaseback opportunities on the corporate side. This is something that we touched on even in our last call. The quality of discussions, the number of discussions have continued to trend up over the years and it\u2019s no different this quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the last year.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. And on the 7-Eleven, the corporate lease back \u2013 the corporate transaction, curious the convenience store is something that number of your peers have seem to be moving the opposite direction, so I am curious as to your comfort level with that type of transaction here, while others seem to be taking a different view?","John Case","Well, we are focused on the highest quality convenience stores like a 7-Eleven, Couche-Tard, Circle K who are both in our top 20. We want 3,000 square feet or more where they have a significant inside store. 70% of the store sales are generated by customers not buying guest, so the emphasis is really on convenience. These are great locations and good markets run by solid operators. So we are still bullish on the C store industry and it\u2019s our second largest industry today. And I think it will continue to be one of our top industry investments. We are selling on some smaller kiosk and smaller store convenience store operations. So we are focusing on the top tier, the highest quality C stores.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Carroll","Yes. Thanks. John, can you talk a little bit about your underwriting standards and how, if it has at all changed with the current concerns in the retail space right now?","John Case","No. We continue to be very selective as is evidenced by our 3% acquisition ratio, relative to what we sourced in those last quarter. We have run anywhere from 3% to 7% in the last several quarters. So our investment parameters continue to be quite tight on the retail side. We are investing in service, non-discretionary and low price point businesses that compete in all economies effectively and better compete with e-commerce. So I think we remain selective and cautious and we are very judicious with our exercising the use of our cost of capital, which is the lowest in the sector. Sumit, anything to add there?","Sumit Roy","No.","John Case","No.","Michael Carroll","Are there any specific property types or industries that you are shifting away from or you are starting to focus more on, given I guess the current environment?","John Case","Well, I think it\u2019s really summed up what I said. What we are focusing on are service, non-discretionary and low price point retailers and businesses. So you look at drug stores, C stores, dollar stores, grocery stores, QSRs. Those are all areas that we continue to focus on. And if an asset and tenants don\u2019t meet the definition, don\u2019t meet our investment parameters and investment strategy, we are not going to pursue it.","Operator","And we will go next to Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Dan Donlan","Thank you and good afternoon and good morning. Just wanted to talk a little bit about your exposure to child care and education, just looking at Slide 17 it looks like that has continued to decline annually since 2012, so I am just curious how you see that trend in next 5 years, it seems to be a portion of the market that your peers [indiscernible 0650] to invest and so I am just curious if it\u2019s going turn back up or you are comfortable with your current exposure?","John Case","Dan, we are comfortable with our current exposure. If anything, it will stay where it is or maybe trend down just slightly. We haven\u2019t been big on education or schools for a variety of reasons we have discussed in the past. And childcare, we have seen some of those companies over the years struggle a bit. Some of our tenants and locations actually are doing quite well and those are the ones we intend to hold. But it\u2019s a business where demographics within a neighborhood can change over time and what you thought you had when you bought the asset 20 years ago is much different than what you end up with 20 years later. Those are assets that where we are seeing changes in demographics and more challenging situations. We have sold over the years, which has decreased our exposure.","Dan Donlan","Okay, it\u2019s helpful. And then as far as the cap rates going forward, I know you have come in at this low 6% level, we have seen a nice pick up in the 10-year treasury, is your expectation or maybe hope that we should start to see that lift, just kind of given the treasury yield?","John Case","Well, it\u2019s certainly our hope and it\u2019s our expectation that if your capital cost and treasury prices actually for a sustained period of time hold at a higher level, we would certainly expect cap rates to increase as well. Cap rates have always followed the cost of capital. When our cost of capital was 10%, we were buying assets at caps of 11.5%, so there is always a lag period. Bond prices and yields, bond yields can move 10 bps in a day or greater than that. That just doesn\u2019t happen in the real estate market. The cap rates are a bit more sticky and they lag by a quarter or two quarters and you need to see some more stability of interest rates at a certain level. Just because they tick up to the 10-year ticks up at 2.70 per week and back down \u2013 it holds for several weeks and then it ends up within a few days back to 2.30, that\u2019s not really going to drive cap rates. You are going to need to see it \u2013 see rates stay at a sustained higher level. And then you will see with the lag period, cap rates move.","Operator","And we will go next to Jason [indiscernible] from Wells Fargo.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. I guess first on your lease expirations in the quarter, just wondering how much you all spent in CapEx to re-tenant those leases that rolled over in Q1 and how much you expect to spend for re-tenanting over the balance of the year?","Paul Meurer","Yes. For re-tenting in the first quarter, we had CapEx of right at about $2.5 million and that was primarily \u2013 most of that was in expansion for a industrial tenant where we received an 11% yield on the incremental invested capital. And the tenant extended their lease term by a factor of 2x. So when we have those opportunities, we would like to deploy capital with those sort of returns and qualitative results as well. So looking forward, we will continue to have some of that. It won\u2019t be a huge number, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we have other quarters right at the same amount or even a little bit higher.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, it makes sense. And secondly, can you just touch on your investment grade tenant mix, I know that ticked down a little bit in the quarter, how happy are you with where that is currently and is there an ideal level or you would like to see that shakeout going forward?","John Case","Yes. We don\u2019t have a target for investment grade. We went from 47% to 45%. And that\u2019s primarily a result of the Diageo completing their exit on our lease on the wineries and vineyards in Napa Valley and Treasury Wine Estates picking up that lease. Now, that they have bought those operations from Diageo, Treasury is the largest vendor, publicly traded vendor in the world. Has a market cap at about $9 billion. It\u2019s not rated. Its credit metrics in terms of debt to EBITDA are actually stronger than Diageo\u2019s. It\u2019s not as large as a company as Diageo, but we are very comfortable with that investment. We are comfortable with our tenants in the top 20 and outside of the top 20, both investment grade and non-investment grade. So I think you will continue to see the investment grade number kind of fluctuate. If the Rite Aid-Walgreens merger happens, it will tick up about 1.8%. But it will ebb and flow in this general area I think. Our acquisitions in the first quarter were about 67%, 68% investment grade. So as long as we continue to stay at that level, we will slowly pull it up, but it\u2019s not something we do consciously. It\u2019s sort of gravy to get that investment grade rated tenant and a really good property underwritten conservatively.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.","John Case","Thanks Tracey and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you soon. I am sure we will be seeing some of you at NAREIT in June and if not before then. Have a good afternoon.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.

Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions).","This conference is being recorded today Thursday, the 1 of May 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard, Associate Vice President. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you Lorenzo and thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s first quarter 2014 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The Company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater details the factors that may cause such differences in the Company\u2019s Form 10-Q.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Case.","John Case","Thanks, Janeen and good afternoon and welcome to our call. I\u2019m pleased to report an excellent start to 2014, with AFFO per share increasing just under 7% to a record quarterly amount of $0.64.","Paul, you want to expand on the numbers?","Paul Meurer","Thanks John. So as usual let me comment on our financial statements just provide a few highlights of the results for the quarter, starting with the income statements. Total revenue increased 26.3% for the quarter obviously, this increase reflects our significant growth from new acquisitions over the past year as well as some healthy same-store rental growth on an annualized rental revenue basis, at March 31st, our annualized rental revenue was $867 million.","On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased to almost $90 million in the quarter as depreciation expense has obviously also increased with our portfolio growth. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $51.7 million. This increase was primarily due to the $750 million, issuance of 10 year bonds we did last July as well as some credit facility borrowings during the quarter.","On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong with interest coverage at 3.9 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.2 times. General administrative, or G&A expenses in the quarter were approximately $12.9 million. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues has decreased to only 6%.","Our projection for G&A for 2014 remains the same at approximately $50 million. Property expenses were $10.6 million for the quarter. However, this amount includes $6.4 million of property expenses reimbursed by tenants. The property expenses that we are responsible for were approximately $4.2 million for the quarter. And our projection for 2014 our property expenses that we will be responsible for also remains the same at approximately $16.5 million. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company and they were just under $1.1 million for the quarter.","As we explained in the press release we\u2019ve chosen immediate early adoption of the new accounting regulations related to discontinued operations, which were just released a few weeks ago. So our property sales, gains, impairments and other related revenues and expenses will now appear throughout the income statement as oppose to being aggregated in the discontinued operations line.","During the quarter we did record impairments of $1.7 million and gains on sale of $3.9 million on properties sales and properties held for sale at March 31st, and if see there is new line items in the income statement. Some of this information continues to appear in the discontinued operations line however, if it was associated with properties that were already held for sale at December 31st. And this topic is discussed and explained in more detail in our 10-Q.","Preferred stock cash dividend totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter and net income available to common stockholders was approximately $47.2 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.65 for the quarter and 8.3% increase versus a year ago and as John mentioned adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash, we have available for distribution as dividend was $0.64 per share for the quarter, a 6.7% increased versus a year ago.","We again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter, we've increased the dividend 66th consecutive quarter, a 16.5 years of consecutive quarterly dividend increases and our dividends paid per common share increased 6.4% this quarter versus a year ago. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.19 per share.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continue to maintain a very conservative and safe capital structure. As you know in early April, we raised $529 million of new capital with a common equity offering, which used to repay borrowing on our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility.","Our acquisition credit facility today currently has a balance of approximately $285 million, we have plenty of availability on that facility. We did assume approximately $46 million of in place mortgages during the first quarter so our outstanding mortgage debt at quarter end increased to approximately $799 million. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed rate and continue to be rated BAA1, BBB plus, our weighted average maturity of 7.4 years. Our overall debt maturity schedule continues to be in very good shape of only $48 million of mortgage principal coming due in 2014 and $125 million of mortgage principal in 2015.","And our next bond maturity is only $150 million due in November of 2015. Our debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was only 6.1 time. Currently our total debt to total market capitalization is approximately 30% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 4% of our capital structure.","So in summary revenue growth this quarter was significant. Our expenses remained moderate, so our earnings growth was very positive. Our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe and we continue to enjoy excellent access to the public capital markets to fund our continued growth with well priced long term capital.","Now let me turn the call back to John who will give you some more background.","John Case","Thanks, Paul. I will begin with an overall of the portfolio which continues perform well. Our tenants are doing well, based on what we are seeing today. We ended the quarter with 98.3% occupancy based on the number of properties with 73 properties available for lease out of 4208 properties. This is our highest occupancy since the third quarter of 2007, and occupancy is up from 97.7% one year ago.","Occupancy based on square footage and economic occupancy are 99% and we expect our occupancy to remain fairly stable for the foreseeable future. Our portfolio remains diversified by tenant, industry geography and to certain extent property type. At the end of the first quarter, our properties were leased to 211 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 78% of the rental revenues from our traditional retail property types while 22% is from non-retail property types, the largest component being industrial and distribution assets. We believe this diversification leads to a more predictable cash flow stream for our shareholders.","At the end of the first quarter, our 15 largest tenants accounted for 46.4% of rental revenue. This is up a 180 basis points from the last quarter. We made additional investments in two of our top 15 tenants, Walgreens and Dollar General which drove this slight increase. In 2008, our top 15 accounted for 54% of rental revenue, the percentage is moved down, while the composition of tenants from a credit perspective has markedly improved.","Today, 61% of our top 15 tenants based on rental revenue has investment grade credit ratings. In 2008, none of the rental revenues from our top 15 tenants came from investment credit rated tenants. So, we've made good progress on improving the credit profile of the top 15.","Our top 15 tenants remained unchanged, however there has been some movement within the top 15. No single tenant accounts for more than 5.4% of rental revenues, so a diversification by tenant is favorable. Walgreens is now our largest tenant at 5.4% of rental revenue, which is up slightly from last quarter.","Walgreens replaced FedEx as our largest tenant. FedEx is now our second largest tenant at 5.2% of rental revenue which is unchanged from last quarter. Dollar General moved up six places and is our third largest tenant today at 5% of rental revenue. We continue to like the deep value proposition, the dollar industry offers to consumers in this economic environment with consumers continuing to be under pressure. And Dollar General remains a dominant player in the sector. ","Family Dollar and L.A. Fitness that's our fourth and fifth largest tenants at 4.7% and 4.6% of rental revenue respectively. All other tenants are at or below 2.9% of rental revenues.","If we get to the 15th largest tenant which remains Walmart, Sam's Club, it represents only 1.5% of rental revenue and the percentage is trail of from there. If you move another five spots and go to our 20th largest tenant, it represents only 1.2% of rental revenue. We also added five new tenants to the portfolio during the quarter.","Convenient stores remain our largest industry, but continue to decline as a percentage of rental revenue. Convenient stores now represented 10.3% of rental revenue down from 10.6% last quarter, drug stores are now at 9.5% down slightly from 9.7% last quarter, and dollar stores are now at 9.1% up from 7.1% last quarter as a result of a dollar generals we added during the first quarter.","Health and fitness is at 6.9% virtually unchanged from last quarter. Theaters are at 5.4%, transportation services are at 5.3% then all other industry categories below that or at or below 4.5% of rental revenue.","Looking at property type. Retail, as it always has represents our primary source of our rental revenues currently at 78% of the portfolio, with industrial and distribution at 11%, office just over 6%, and the reminder basically divided between manufacturing and agriculture properties.","We continue to focus on retail tenants that meet our investment parameters, more than 90% of our retail portfolio has a service non-discretionary and\/or low price point components to their business. We believe these characteristics better position these tenants to successfully operate in all economic environments and make them less vulnerable to Internet competition.","Our weighted average remaining lease term continues to be just under 11 years. And our same store rents increased 1.5% during the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2013, some of the industries that drove our rent growth include convenient stores and quick service restaurants.","We believe 1.5% is the solid growth rate and expected to continue around this level for the foreseeable future.","Let me take a moment to discuss tenant credit. The credit quality of the portfolio continues to improve with 44% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade tenants which is up from 40% at the end of last year. Again, we defined an investment grade rating company, it\u2019s having an investment grade rating by one or more of the 3 major rating agencies.","This revenue percentage is also up from 36% at the end of the first quarter in 2013. We\u2019re also pleased with the rental growth we\u2019ve been able to generate from these investment grade tenants approximately 70% of our investment grade leases as a percentage of rental revenues, have rental rate increases in them which averaged 1.5% annually consistent with our historical portfolio rental growth rates.","Property acquisitions, we had a very busy first quarter. We completed $657 million in acquisitions during the quarter at an initial yield of 7%. This is the second most active quarter for acquisitions we\u2019ve had in the company\u2019s history. As a reminder our initial yields or cash yields are not GAAP cap rates which can be higher due to straight lining of rent. We continue to invest in attractive investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital.","So now I\u2019d like to hand it over to Sumit to provide additional details on our acquisitions. Sumit?","Sumit Roy","Thank you John. As John mentioned during the first quarter of 2014 we invested $656.7 million in 337 properties at an average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with the weighted average lease term of 14.2 years. 84% of the revenues generated by these acquisitions is from investment grade tenants. These assets are leased to 22 different tenants in 15 different industries. Most significant industries represented with dollar stores and drug stores.","The properties are located in 35 states, 88% of the investments are comprised of retail properties and 8% are industrial assets. Regarding sourcing, we continue to seen from last year of seeing record transaction flow. We sourced $8.1 billion in the first quarter approximately 85% of the transactions closed in the first quarter were relationship driven.","We continue to utilize our relationships and remain very selective in our investments. As to pricing cap rates remained tight in the first quarter with investment grade properties continuing to trade in the 6% to 7% range. Non-investment grade properties are trading from 7% to 8.5% cap rate. But first quarter 2014, our investment spreads remained healthy. Looking at our spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital, we averaged the 156 basis points, which is comparable to our historical leverage. We have continued to make investments at historic spreads whilst improving the credit quality of the tenants and cash build associated with those investments.","In conclusion, we feel like we have had a good start to the year with $657 million in investments in the first quarter and continue to see record volume of net lease acquisition opportunities. Despite a very competitive environment, we feel confident regarding leasing our investment forecast of $1.2 billion for 2014. Thank you.","John Case","","Thanks, Sumit. During the quarter, we closed just over half of the $503 million transactions with Inland diversified that we announced at the end of last quarter. Our quarterly acquisition figures include $274 million from this transaction. The beginning of the second quarter, we closed an additional $94 million of Inland and we expect the majority of the remaining properties to close during the remainder of the second quarter. We continue selling select properties and redeploying the capital into investments that better fit our investment strategy. During the quarter we sold 11 properties for just under $30 million at an unlevered IRR of approximately 10% which is consistent with where the company has been realizing returns on dispositions over the last couple of years. We now believe our dispositions for 2014 will be approximately $75 million versus our previous guidance of $50 million to $75 million.","Moving on the balance sheet as Paul mentioned we remain conservatively capitalized with excellent access to capital. On April we executed a $529 million equity offering, our second largest equity offering in our history, the offering was upsized from $10.5 million shares to $13.8 million shares. Following the offering we have ample liquidity for our initial funding of acquisitions activity. We will continue to permanently match upon our acquisitions with equity capital and long term debt with the majority being common stock. Outside of the credit facility, a 100% of our outstanding debt is fixed rate, so the balance sheet continues to be in excellent shape.","We achieved record quarterly AFFO per share of $0.64 in the quarter representing increase of 6.7% from a year ago. Our earnings guidance for 2014 remains at $2.53 to $2.58 per share, again an increase of 5% to 7% over 2013. Our growth and earnings led to an increase in the dividend paid per share by just over 6% compared to one year ago. In March we declared our 75th dividend increase since the company went public in 1994. And we remain optimistic there are activities will continue to support our ability to increase the dividend.","Our payout ratio during the first quarter continued to decline to approximately 86% of our AFFO, which is at a level we are comfortable with. 2014 is shaping up to be another solid year for the year, we continue to see a robust, but also competitive market for acquisitions.","With opportunities in both in investment grade and non-investment grade retail assets. Our long-term relationships for tenants, owners, developers, advisors, continue to generate excellent acquisition opportunities to us and we continue to anticipate $1.2 billion in acquisitions for the year.","With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And our first question is from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America","","Hi guys. Just a couple of questions, first on the Dollar store exposure, Family Dollar had a bit of a tough go I think they have announced store closing. Can you comment on your exposure there and sort of how you view the real estate and the rent coverages?","John Case","","Sure Juan. We continue to like the sector due to discount orientation and the fact that these formats are appealing to the aging demographic and we feel good about Dollar General and Family Dollar. You're referring to Family Dollar's quarterly conference call a couple of weeks ago, where they disclosed for the first six months of their fiscal year, they had a decrease in same store sales and they also announced that they were going to close some of their older and smaller formats about 5% and of their 8,500 total stores, the impact to us should be not existent to minimal because we don\u2019t own those types of stores, our stores have healthy, cash flow coverages and are performing well and the average lease term on our family dollar portfolio is 13 years. So of course any stores that would be closed would continue to pay rent during the remainder of the lease term, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see any material if any impact our portfolio.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America","","Okay thanks for that its good color. And on the restaurant side, it\u2019s been a big driver of incremental growth across retail landlords platforms, can you speak to your sort of historic results on being able to release restaurant leases upon maturity kind of what their rent profile looks like over time, I know you guys have a deep history with initial beginnings?","John Case","","Yes, that\u2019s right Juan and I\u2019ll address that question in two parts, first is, our experience on the quick service restaurants has been outstanding, virtually everyone that\u2019s rolled in the company\u2019s history it\u2019s been re-leased to the same tenant. A couple of sales and I can\u2019t think off the top of my head any examples where we gone out under re-lease the QSR to a new tenant.","So the performance there, is been very solid and we\u2019ve been pleased with that. On the casual dining sector, as you know it\u2019s an area that we're less pleased with and over the years we had a number of issues in that sector with the phase and families and there we\u2019ve had more lease rolled where the existing tenant that not renew or exercised their auction and often we will re-lease those to local non-chain affiliated restaurant operators and take a bit of a discount on the rents relative to the expiring rents.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America","","Great thanks. And I think you noted this earlier but I just missed it. What percentage of the overall portfolio I know you mentioned for the top 15 is investment grade?","John Case","","Yes. 44% of the overall portfolio is investment grade.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America","","Great. Thanks John. I appreciate the time.","John Case","","Hey thanks Juan, appreciate it.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Pong with RW Baird. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Pong - RW Baird","","Hey good afternoon guys. We\u2019ve not heard about how the more traditional single tenant retail net lease assets like the Walgreens, (inaudible) going for low 5 high 4 cap rates as you look forward is your acquisition team adopting to that environment by maybe going after assets with more unconventional service tenants like child care for instance that would be technically considered retail, but aren\u2019t could only a meaningful part of the portfolio?","John Case","","No, I am we\u2019re still focusing on the retail tenants in the industry that meet our investment plan, we have not changed those. I mean I think we\u2019re fortunate based on our deep relationships with the tenants that we\u2019re seeing transactions and investment opportunities that are not fully on market, but I am not aware of where properties are trading that type and those properties types.","Jonathan Pong - RW Baird","","Got it that also. And then I guess if you think about the corporate sale lease back pipeline historically it seems like that\u2019s almost feel like a two that it seems to get refilled, but with all the new competition looking for those kinds of assets these days, do you see that pipeline shirking into deeper into the cycle?","John Case","","Well, I think there is more competition, but the opportunities continue to be plentiful. And so I don't really see the sale lease back opportunities declining. But I would say that the overall competition is probably greater than even it was your 12 to 24 months ago.","Jonathan Pong - RW Baird","","Okay. And then maybe just a quick (inaudible) from that question. The supply that retailers there building out, I guess let's say your future sale or lease back pipeline. Do you still think that the growth is rational or are there some categories where you could see becoming another Family Dollar situation where they have to (inaudible) growth and close a few stores?","John Case","","Well, going back to Family Dollar, they're actually going to increase their store count. So they're going to add more stores than they close.","Jonathan Pong - RW Baird","","I meant just bringing down the rate of growth that they won\u2019t expected?","John Case","","Yes, yes. Well, we monitor that very carefully and look at potential saturation issues and we're certainly comfortable with tenants in the industries and our portfolio right now. And we're not Jonathan we're really not seen any of that.","Jonathan Pong - RW Baird","","All right. Thanks a lot John.","John Case","","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","","Hi guys, good afternoon. Could you give just give us a break down after 1.5% same-store rent courses how that kind of pan across maybe retail in the other segments?","John Case","","On the investment grade is that what you're asking?","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","","No, the same-store rent the 1.5% same-store rent growth. Could you just kind of break that out between maybe retail and office industrial, et cetera?","John Case","","Yeah, the majority of that came from the retail sector, I don\u2019t have the exact percentage Paul do you have that in front of you?","Paul Meurer","","Yeah, there were good, we call it good surprises, you are talking about the percentage rent, right?","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","","Yes.","Paul Meurer","","Yes, the percentage rent was quite robust, generally speaking about 50% of our percentage revenue get in the first quarter, about 30% we get in the fourth quarter and remainder throughout the other parts of the year, so its going to be a twin factor on first quarter results and that\u2019s actually where you are seeing of robust revenue number this quarter was from the percentage rent, and we had what I would describe as very good, unlike these we are surprised renewal is going to be solid but the percentage rent came in really nicely from a couple QSR tenants and just a couple of other historic tenants where their results were better than we thought.","I wouldn\u2019t say there is the story to share with you as it relates to trying to nail down maybe where consumer spending habits or anything like that so we don\u2019t really haven\u2019t seen like that to convey.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","","Okay, sorry I was about, I mean, that\u2019s useful Paul I was just kind of trying to get a sense the 1.5 was it like 2% on the industrial and office side versus like 1.5, 1.25 on retailer I was just kind of get the breakup of that 1.5%? The same store rent grow that you reported for the 2,700 properties?","Paul Meurer","","Yes, roughly speaking on retail it was about 1.2% on industrial just under 2 manufacturing, which we don\u2019t have much 1% office about 1.75% and then agriculture again about 1.3%.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","","Okay, got it. And then just the 7% yield on the acquisitions, is that assuming that's a cash yield, initial cash yield?","John Case","","Yes, that's a cash yield.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. And so as you, I mean look at kind of future acquisitions, do you feel comfortable that kind of that you mentioned between relationships and non-relationships that kind of split will remain kind of be in that range over the next few quarters. And is that, given all the competition on for deals, do you think the kind of the little bit benefit that you get on the pricing standpoint from relationships for whole crew as well?","John Case","","Yes, I think we said achieved about, up to 20 to 25 basis points greater yield on relationship driven transactions, and as we look at what we're working on in the pipeline. And really just from judging from our business model over the last couple of years, we know that we're going to run somewhere in the neighborhood of 75%, 80%, 85% of our activity should be relationship driven.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. Thanks guys.","John Case","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, thanks. What were the annual rentals on the investment grade rated properties that you made in the quarter? I know it's the overwhelming majority. And then the remaining portion of that either below investment grade or non-rated kind of break out the rent bumps?","John Case","","Yes, on the investment grade for the quarter, we had lease growth of about just under 1.5%. And on the non-investment grade, it was actually about the same, a bit more.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities","","It was then on your portfolio, because where I was going with this is the acquisitions you made in the quarter?","John Case","","That's on the acquisitions for the quarter.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities","","Okay. Thank you, John. And Sumit, you gave the spread of your cost of capital, I think you it was in excess of a 150 basis points. Do you have the spread that was just over the cost of equity?","Sumit Roy","Yes. It was 35 basis points.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And how does that kind of look relative to your raise you made in October and as well as March of last year?","Sumit Roy","I think the equity that we raised in April was right around $40 and the way we\u2019ve calculated our nominal cost of equity is on a volume graded average priced for the quarter. So the price that we\u2019ve assumed is $41 as the stock price, and then of course we\u2019ve taken -- the way we\u2019ve traditionally calculated our cost -- nominal cost of equity.","John Case","And Todd today where the price is, the cost of equity is about [6.3], so, it\u2019s about 70 basis point spread. Our 10 year debt costs are just a bit over 4%, so our blended WAC is right at about 5.2% today. So actually, our spreads are bit wider as we sit here today than where they were for the quarter. And 160, 155 for the quarter is right around our historical average. So we're well north of our historical average today.","So we\u2019ve been pleased with where our spreads held up here even though that market continues to be competitive and pricing tight.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you John. And Paul, you tapped the accordion\u2019s feature, that extra 500 million. Do you need it now, is there a finite period for you to keep that outstanding, I mean you just paid it down are you lying down the equity, just kind of seeing what you\u2019re -- how you feel about looking into midyear to have that $1.5 billion outstanding?","Paul Meurer","Yes, we\u2019re going to leave that in place if you will that $1.5 billion of liquidity if you will run till May of \u201816 plus a one year extension option within our control, so really May of 2017, so we feel really good about that having that running room with that. And we see ourselves carrying some level of a balance on that facility. Those of you like yourself have known us the long time might not be familiar with that, you\u2019re still just kind of pay down the line to zero pretty quickly at times but that\u2019s when we had a smaller line, was part of that. And so now you\u2019ll see us run a balance where we are today, $285 million today and feel comfortable with that given the size of the company, given that it really is our only piece of variable rate debt exposure in the balance sheet. So we feel good about the $1.5 billion, having that sort of capacity and how long we have left on that maturity wise. And like I mentioned we\u2019ll have a little bit of a balance on it on a regular basis.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","All right, thank you. You were talking about 75% plus of your acquisitions this quarter with relationship tenants. How much of that is a first generation sale lease back versus acquiring properties with existing leases with tenants you have a relationship with?","John Case","Yes. You know about half, 50% was sale lease back directly with the tenant and the other half were existing leases that we acquired primarily with tenants that we had established existing relationships with.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","","Okay. When we think about the additional spreads you are talking about first generation sale lease back?","John Case","","Well, it can be more than that. When we define relationships, it\u2019s we\u2019re directly in negotiation with the tenant that we\u2019re the only buyer. But it also includes where we\u2019re provided by the seller at last look, the look at the investing in the property based on our relationship or we are able to secure the property at a lower price given our relationship with that tenant. So it\u2019s not exclusively sale lease back.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","","Okay. In terms of the assets that were disclosed, obviously it\u2019s a small amount but it gets about $1 million per property. What kind of assets were and how many of those were vacant?","John Case","Yes. Well, the number of vacant properties of the 11 were 3, 8 were leased and the types of assets these are we say that the assets that no longer fit our investment strategies. It was some casual dining and some childcare centers that we had owned for a while that were neighborhoods squared, the demographic that changed. And really the neighborhoods were no longer going to support that use for the property and we elected to sell those.","So, it\u2019s generally in one of those segments that are very much out of favor with us.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","","Okay. And just final question in regards to leasing, so when I look at the occupancy gain this quarter, it appears to me that I think a lot of that would come from acquisitions given that you buy 100% property, it seems the vast majority of the occupancy gains are actually due to buy 100% assets. How many properties that came due for renewal were renewed this quarter, and how many of the vacant property that you have at December 31 has been really and are currently occupied?","John Case","Okay. Well, so far we\u2019ve had, I think it was 45 this year that we rolled and renewed either for the existing tenant -- 90% of those went to the existing tenants with remainder going to new tenants. And then you\u2019re right, with regard to the occupancy, we had 70 properties vacant a year ago, I am sorry a quarter ago and then we had 73 vacant at this quarter end. So occupancy really would have been flat rather than ticking up by one tenth of a percent; acquisitions [drove] that. But on a year-over-year basis it would still have grown just a bit, because we have 73 properties vacant at the end of the quarter versus I think it was 81 at the end of the quarter in 2013.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Okay. So how would you describe the environment in terms of being able to lease the currently vacant property, where you at negotiations, [what are] the offices you can lease them versus deciding to sell them?","John Case","Yes. Well, the portfolio is performing well and the tenants are doing well, and that environment is leading some more releasing on these vacant assets than sale. And it\u2019s very attractive term, so the majority, the vast majority of these taken assets are being re-leased rather than sold right now.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thank you.","John Case","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Yes, hi guys, good afternoon. Just to expand for a second on Cedrik\u2019s question, you have a 119 leases expiring for the rest of the year and I'm curious are you saying that probably 90% of those are renewed, is that the idea that's through the renewal rate, as you think about the years going forward including this year?","John Case","Yes, this year we're expecting about 90% of those to renew, probably 5% will be leased to tenants and 5% sold. Over the longer history of the company, if you go back to since the mid 90s that number has been 70% of the [roles] would go to the existing tenant, 20% the tenant and 10% would sold and reinvested in new properties.","We've gotten a bit better at that over the last 10 years and certainly a bit of stronger economic environment today leading to even better numbers. So that's where the 95% and 5% are coming from, Rich.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, good John. Thank you, that's helpful. Then just in general, I mean how are you viewing the whole, I mean we watched the mall guys for example report and they have all seen increases in bad debt, they talked more about bankruptcies picking up. And I'm curious do you guys seeing more store closings, more bankruptcies? And then what is your bad debt situation or your aging on your accounts receivable, I mean are you seeing any changes I guess with regard to tenants on any of that?","John Case","Right now, the tenants are in good shape and even the ones that -- the casual dining tenants that we've had that is gone through a couple of bankruptcies are performing well. So, our watch list has gone from probably 23% four years ago to just over 5% today and that watch list is that flat category that we are looking at those tenants very closely and monitoring their operations because they\u2019ve been under some level of stress. In fact couple of these casual dining concepts and one of the QSRs that we\u2019ve been concern about from a credit perspective contributed to our percentage rents this quarter and are performing well.","So I\u2019m not going wood here Rich, the portfolio is in good shape.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","","Okay. So no pick up in bad debt for you guys, or\u2026","John Case","","Let me add Paul address the bad debt.","Paul Meurer","","Yes, and I\u2019ll give you a few numbers Rich that might be instructive in 2009, bad debt expenses 1.9 million; 2010 1.2 million; 2011 650,000; 2012 500,000; last year 250,000. And the first quarter of this year so far it\u2019s been 59,000. So obviously there is no issue there that\u2019s popped up in those numbers and that will be, figure that on an annualized basis, what about 240,000 or the lowest bad debt expense here we had in about 10 years.","So from that standpoint I think we\u2019ve done a nice job pruning the portfolio of a lot of these tenants that have given that these computations in the past.","John Case","","So while we are not had an outstanding economic environment by any stretch of the imagination over the last five years we\u2019ve seen it slowly improve and we're pleased with the progress there.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","","Very good, yes that\u2019s impressive, you guys always come prepared I like that great. And then the last thing for me is, the disposition strategy, I\u2019m not sure quite understand that you guys are so big 44,000 plus properties and you sell a dozen, almost seems like it\u2019s not worthy effort to even bother with dispositions if it\u2019s so tiny. I mean how do you view the whole family, I mean is it someone approaches you and is looking at property that kind of thing, is that what\u2019s happening?","John Case","No, we have an asset management group that looks at assets where we think we\u2019re better off selling those. And we\u2019re also looking at the roles and the vacant properties and considering selling some of those. So it\u2019s a proactive and not a reactive approach. And it\u2019s one that we\u2019ve only put into place in the last couple of year. So we\u2019ve grown it last year. We\u2019ve sold $134 million in dispositions and again the properties that really don\u2019t meet the investment parameters today or perhaps they are a property that may meet the investment parameter today but longer-term we think they could be turned into an issue for some reason, maybe the markets declining or maybe we have some exposure on our rents or something like that. So, it will continue to be more material than it has in the past. This year we\u2019re seeing $75 million now but it\u2019s a worthwhile exercise. And fortunately we don\u2019t have a $1 billion slug of assets that we need to sell. I think we\u2019ve done a pretty effective job of underwriting and managing the portfolio.","So, this is about a level that we\u2019re comfortable with. And I think we\u2019ll continue to see it around the $75 million to $100 million upto maybe a $150 million in some years. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be significantly larger than that. Remember, a lot of our growth has come over the last five years and I think we\u2019ve underwritten those opportunities well and they\u2019re not going to be really considered to this type of activity for the most part.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer potion of Realty Income's conference call.

(Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded April 26, 2012.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead.","Tom Lewis","All right. Good afternoon, everybody and thank you, Elisa, and welcome to our call to talk about the first quarter. In the room with me is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Case, our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer and Mike Pfeiffer, our General Counsel and he is also an Executive Vice President, and Tere Miller, who is our Vice President of Corporate Communications.","And, as always, during this call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail on the company\u2019s Form 10-K the factors that may cause such differences.","And with that, we\u2019ll open it up as we usually do, going over the numbers, to Paul and he will handle that.","Paul Meurer","Thank you, Tom. As usual, I will comment briefly on our financial statements, provide a few highlights of the results for the quarter and start with the income statement. Total revenue increased 17.9% in the quarter. Our revenue for the quarter was approximately $115 million or about $450 million annualized run rate. This obviously reflects the significant amount of new acquisitions over the past year. Other income was only $255,000 for the quarter.","On the expense side, depreciation and amortization increased by about $8.6 million in the comparative quarterly period. Obviously depreciation expense increased as our property portfolio continues to grow. Interest expense increased by just over $3.8 million and this increase was due primarily to the June 2011 issuance of $150 million of notes in the reopening of or 2035 bonds as well as credit facility borrowings during the quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remains strong with interest coverage at 3.5 times and fixed charge coverage is at 2.7 times.","General and administrative or G&A expenses in the first quarter was $9.2 million. Our G&A expense has increased a bit as our acquisition activity has increased and we invested this past year in new personnel for future growth. G&A also includes the expensing of additional due diligence costs on the acquisition side, which totaled $242,000 during the quarter.","Our current projection for G&A for all of 2012 is approximately $34 million, which will represent only about 7.25% of total revenue projected for the year. Property expenses were $2.5 million for the quarter. These expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance and insurance expenses which we are responsible for on properties available for lease. Our current estimate for property expenses for all of 2012 is about $9.4 million. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various state company and there were $405,000, during the quarter.","Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $851,000 million and this income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We did sell five properties during the quarter, a reminder again that we do not include these property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO.","Preferred stock cash totaled $9. 5 million for the quarter and this increase reflects our issuance of 6 and 5.8% preferred F stock this year. Excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed, refers to the $3.7 million non-cash redemption charges stemming from the repayment of our outstanding 7.38% preferred D stock from some of the proceeds from our preferred F offering this year. Replacement of this preferred D stock in our capital structure pays us about $1 million cash annually. Obviously, due to the lower coupon of the new preferred F stock that we just issued.","Net income available to common stockholders was$26. 1 million for the quarter. Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.46 for the quarter, although excluding the $3.7 million preferred stock redemption charges our FFO for the quarter would have been $0.49 or 2.1% increase over the fully $0.08 earned in the first quarter of last year.","Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividend was higher, at $0.50 per share for the quarter , an increase of 2% over $0.49 AFFO earned in the first quarter of last year. As we have always mentioned, our AFFO will continue to be higher than our FFO, and we believe this differential between our AFFO and higher FFO actually continue to increase likely.","Our capital expenditures are fairly low. We have minimal straight-line rent adjustments in our portfolio. And we do believe that over time we will continue to have some FAS 141 non-cash reductions to FFO when they purchase large portfolio to have some in place leases.","In addition, in 2012, of course, we will have a $3.7 million non-cash preferred redemption charge, which effects our FFO, but not in the calculation of our AFO four. Our 2012 AFFO earnings projection is $2.08 to $2.13 per share, an increase of 3.5% to 6% over our 2011 AFFO per share of $2.01.We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter. We\u2019ve increased the dividend 58 consecutive quarters and 65 times overall since we went public over 17. Years ago. Our AFFO dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 87%.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet for a moment, we believe we continue to maintain our conservative and very safe capital structure. We were very pleased to raise $409 million with our 6 5\/8% class F preferred stock offerings this year, including the 1.4 million share reopening add-on offering that we did earlier this month in April.","As I mentioned, the proceeds were used to redeem or higher coupon class D preferred stock and also to repay borrowings on our acquisition credit facility. So our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to support our acquisition growth. Our current debt to total market capitalization is 24% and preferred stock outstandings still represent only 8% of our capital structure. Our $425 million credit facility had just $43 million of borrowings at quarter end and of course some of that were paid off with the preferred add-on offering earlier this month in April. We have no debt maturities until 2013. So in summary, we currently have excellent liquidity and believe our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe.","Let me turn the call back over to Tom, who will give you a little more background on the results.","Tom Lewis","Thanks, Paul, and I\u2019ll kind of run through the various areas of the business. Let me start with the portfolio. The portfolio continued to generate very consistent revenue throughout the first quarter. And at the end of the quarter, our 15 largest tenants accounted for about 49.4% of our revenue. That\u2019s down 440 basis points from the same period a year ago and 40 basis points from the fourth quarter, but the acquisition efforts and (inaudible) portfolio continue to reduce concentration.","Relative to the health of the portfolio, the average cash flow coverage at the store level for those top 15 remains very high and very stable from previous quarters at about 2.4 times and so overall the operations of the tenants in those properties are doing pretty well.","We ended the first quarter at occupancy of 96.6%, 90 properties available for lease out of the 2,631. That\u2019s down about 10 basis points from the fourth quarter and down about 20 basis points for the same period a year ago. During the quarter, we had 16 new vacancies in the portfolio, eight came really from buffets and friendly leases that were rejected during the reorganizations and then the balance from the normal operations portfolio, which is (inaudible).","And then we also leased or sold 13 vacant properties during the quarter and that basically gives you the reason for the movement in the asset. I mentioned last quarter that we thought that we \u2013 during the first quarter, we could see another 30 basis points or sort of occupancy decline. Obviously, we were able to do better than that. And we think throughout the year, absent anything material change that the portfolio occupancy will remain very high. Our best guess will be around 97% at the end of the second quarter, third quarter maybe high 96, 97 , and then a little over 97% in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s how the things, are looking stable, and up a bit.","And the formula for how we do occupancy is basically the vacant number of properties, 90, divided by the occupied total number 2631, and that gets to the 3.4% vacancy and 96.6% occupancy. As I mentioned last quarter, we also run a couple of other ways, one is to take the vacant square footage and divided by the total square footage, and that gives you a different number.","That number today is vacant square footages is about 790,000 square feet, you divide that by our total of 27,377,000 square feet, that gives you 2.9% vacancy, and about 97.1% occupancy. And then in the third way we run that is to take the previous rent on vacant properties, and divide that by the sum of that number, and the rent on the occupied property.","And if you run that today, the vacant property former contractual rent in the first quarter was about 2.87 million, and if you combine that with the rent on all the occupied properties, which is a 114.6, you will get 117.47 million, divide that by the 2.87 million, and essentially, you will get to on a dollar basis about 2.4% occupancy, or 97.6%. So if you look at the three ways, number of properties, 96.6 square footage, 97.1 by dollars, 97.6. And each quarter, probably we will not go through the definitions in the future, we will mention what they are utilizing each method. And in each case, I think it still represents our very good occupancy.","Our same-store rents on the core portfolio decreased 1.1% during the first quarter, while fairly small, that is unusual, and it is really a function of the impact and the kind of coming to flourish in the first quarter, and reorganizations. Excluding those, same-store rent would have increased 1.1% during the quarter, that is the dead light saying, hey, it is up to the bad stuff, the good stuff look like this.","And we believe that those numbers should turn positive over the next couple of quarters, and if we had to make a guess right now, the same-store rents over the course of the year, it should be flat to slightly up.","If we look where really that came from, there were only three industries that had declining same-store rents, one was bookstores, we only have one bookstore, home furnishings, and then casual dining restaurants. And that includes above Buffets and the total decrease was about 2,57, 000 million of which 2 million came from the Buffets and the Friendly\u2019s.","Four industries have flat same-store rents, business services, equipment services stores and transportation, and then there were 24 industries that saw same-store rent increases with the majority coming from sporting goods, motor vehicle dealerships, health and fitness theaters, quick service restaurants and childcare. The 24 industries together that had increases was about $1.1 million and that gets you to the net decline of about $990,000.","From a diversification standpoint, the portfolio continues to be well diversified. We have 200 \u2013 2,631 properties at the end of the quarter and that\u2019s down three from the previous quarter, 38 different industries, 137 different tenants in 49 states and we anticipate as we said, materially adding to that in the second quarter through acquisitions.","Industry exposure continues to be well diversified (inaudible). Our largest industry convenience store, you can see in the release, is 17%, that\u2019s down about 20 basis points from last quarter. And then restaurants, if you combine both casual dining and QSR, quick service restaurants, are down about 180 basis points from last quarter. QSR is actually up a bit and casual dining is where most of that drop came from. Some of it from reduced rent on the buffets and friendlies, which is really not the way we want to reduce the concentration.","And then it\u2019s really theaters to 9.7%, it\u2019s down 10 basis points, health and fitness up 10% and 7%. And then very quickly, the only other area over 5% is beverages, which was unchanged. So we continue to try and diversify out by industry.","On a tenant basis, the largest you can see there is AMC at 5.3%. (Inaudible) also over 5%, just slightly, and all of the rest of the tenants under 5% again with the 15 largest at about 49.4%. You can see when you get to the 15th largest tenant, you are down to 2.2% of revenue. When you get to number 20, by the way, it\u2019s down to 1.5% and 10 down from there, so fairly well diversified by tenant and then lastly by geography.","The average remaining lease length on the portfolio remains healthy at about 11.1 years. If we look forward to the balance of the year on the portfolio, we feel pretty good about things for the years and we think we should have a good year in operations. Friendlies releases on the 19 properties that we got back are ahead of schedule. In our model, we had assumed that the first releases would occur next year in January in the model and we leased three of those in the first quarter, have contracts out for two more and LOIs, letter of intent on five, so we think the 10 of the 19 should get done here relatively quickly and then we\u2019ll follow on on the other ones.","With buffets, we got seven back in the first quarter. One has been leased. We have LOIs on three more. So running a bit ahead of schedule there. And then third, we had assumed an assumption that tenants equal to about 5% of rent might have some issues going forward, and we\u2019ve said that in the last couple of calls. Yeah, I\u2019m sorry, Paul.","Paul Meurer","2% to 3% of rent, not 5%.","Tom Lewis","Excuse me, 2% to 3% of rent, but basically our concerns there are abated, quite a bit as in talking to the tenants, they have seen that their business have improved. So a bit more positive there relating to how we do the portfolio going forward this year. I would also say that leasing and sales activities is rest in the portfolio management department is in pretty good environment right now, and overall, we think the portfolio should be pretty stable going forward. And there are no new issues that have emerged over the last quarter. So a little bit more positive comp related to the portfolio.","Moving on to the property acquisitions, the first quarter was obviously quiet, but second very busy, and I\u2019ll let John Case, our Chief investment Officer comment on acquisition.","John Case","Thanks, Tom. We remain quite active on acquisitions front, we continue to see a high volume of acquisition opportunities. While we only invested 10.7 million in the first quarter, we expect to see a very active closing calendar over the next two to three months. Our quarterly closing activities typically driven by the timing of our larger portfolio of transactions of which they were none in the first quarter of this year.","As we stated in our earnings release, subsequent to the end of first quarter, we have acquired or placed under contract acquired 500 to 14 million in acquisitions, which we expect to close during the second quarter. The two large portfolios transactions are driving the bulk of these activities, these acquisitions are comprised of 250 properties, leased before in the four different industries, all of which are industries were currently invested in.","Virtually, all of the acquisitions of the retail properties of about 36% our investment in our tenants, we will provide more color on these acquisitions once they close. We have seen a broad range of investment possibilities, we sourced approximately 6 billion in acquisitions opportunity so far this year. Again, this is everything that is come in the door, that acquisitions team has reviewed.","This activity is comprised of 1300 properties, leased to 115 tenants, and 33 industries. The majority of what we\u2019re seeing continue to be retail and distribution property. And about half of the properties were analyzing are released to investment-grade tenants. While we are no longer evaluating the majority of these acquisitions, we continue to pursue a number of these investments.","Given our level of activity to date this year, we\u2019re raising our acquisition estimates for 2012 of 650 million from our previously announced $500 million. We currently believe our initial cap rates should average from 7.5% to 7.75% for the year. Our initial lease terms should continue to average 15 years or longer. While the acquisition market is active, it is also competitive. So investment yields remain under pressure.","Our investments spreads continue to hold up very well though. Our anticipated acquisition cap rates reflect about a 175 basis point spread over our year-to-date average nominal cost of equity. This again is taking our average price year-to-date and adjusting it for the forward FFO yield and \u2013 calculating the forward FFO yield on that and grossing it up for our equity issuance cost. This spread compares favorably to our long-term average of 110 basis points and it\u2019s just a shade of our 2011 average spread of 170 basis points.","At our current share price, our expected investment spreads are in excess of 200 basis points. Tom?","Tom Lewis","Thanks. So obviously spreads remain very, very wide even on slightly lower cap rate. Obviously we\u2019re pleased with what plan on the second quarter with the $514 million that we\u2019ll have coming in the door during the quarter. As John mentioned, it\u2019s 250 properties. So it\u2019s a lot of retail properties leased to four tenants in all industries that we are in already and then the vast majority of it is retail.","The other thing is it\u2019s very typical of what we thought over the years. It has fairly high cash flow coverages that would be in line with the balance of our larger tenants and about a third of it is investment grade. So I think normal write-up, the middle of \u2013 the middle for us in terms of what we require.","Normally, we would not have announced it obviously until they closed which is what we typically do, but we needed to disclose that we did have those accusations coming in because we were doing the additional preferred offering.","And those transactions, some of them are part of larger transactions that tenants are undertaking and those will transpire over the next couple of months and then we\u2019ll comment further on those after we get them done and then the tenants are able to complete the overall transactions and then we are freed up of confidentiality agreements and be able to talk a little more about them. And we believe that all of them should close in the second quarter. There could be a little leakage into the third quarter, but obviously very positive.","John mentioned, we\u2019re using $650 million in acquisitions in our numbers for now. Transaction flow is excellent. So we could exceed that, but it really is, as we\u2019ve said for a long time, lumpy quarter-to-quarter and highly dependent on the larger transactions closing in a competitive environment and it\u2019s really instructive now in the first quarter, you\u2019re looking at 10 million and in the second quarter, 514 million, that is a very good example of how it can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and how to take what you do one quarter and then annualize that.","We think the acquisitions will continue to play a big role obviously in our ability to grow the revenue, and the AFFO, which will drive dividend increases, but also really adjusting the make-up of the portfolio, where we want to move up the credit curve relating to tenant quality and then be selected in terms of retail, in what sectors we want to be in, and also outside.","So if you look at the last couple of years, we have been trying to do this movement, as of the end of the second quarter that would take us for kind of 2010, 2011 and 2012 about 2.2 billion of property that we have acquired, about 1.4 billion of that has been in retail, 800 million in other areas outside of retail that we think will do well for us.","And then of the 2.2 billion just under 800 million would investment-grade tenants or the subsidiaries, and these amount of the balance of the acquisitions pretty close to investment-grade, and that\u2019s a trend that we would like to continue, but given the volumes we\u2019re looking at now, and kind of where it is coming from the best guess this year would be a little heavy in the retail than we have in the last two years, and more to what we have traditionally done and that is just really a matter of the transaction flow that is coming across. And we will see how that goes as the year goes on.","Relative to funding those acquisitions as I mentioned last quarter were all living in a very low interest rate environment, and it\u2019s easy to get the assumption of what was being that way. And we want to make sure on the capital that we were raising that we are not really creating any near-term maturities, and that if interest rates go up in the future, we will have appropriately match funded long-term leases and long-term capital.","And that\u2019s what we have been trying to do in the last couple of years, it has been a little over 1 billion of equity, obviously, with no maturities. 150 million debt offering last year, that matures in 2035, and then the 400 million of preferred that we\u2019ve done recently. So that\u2019s about 1.5 billion of capital where we are making too much creating the near-term maturities.","Going forward, today, and looking what we might do long-term debt, obviously looks very attractive but be nothing with the short maturity, obviously the equity is trading very well and attractive and over the next couple of months, we\u2019ll watch the markets with what\u2019s going on, try and make an appropriate decision relative to what type of permanent capital , we will use with these acquisitions. As mentioned in the balance sheet, and power today\u2013 continue to grow, so we feel that the capital markets are obviously open and available in a very good pricing.","Let me go on to earnings and guidance. The acquisitions and high occupancy obviously had an impact on the numbers here, and will benefit us for the balance of the year. We\u2019ve increased the guidance for 2012 depending on both ends on FFO of 202 to 206 and then on AFFO of 208 to 213, which is about 3.5% to 6% AFFO growth.","As we continue to raise the monthly dividend a bit each quarter, it has been our custom every year in August that our Board Meeting to sit down and see if a fixed dividend increase is warranted each year, and now we are seeing AFFO payout ratio which falls at 87%, excuse me, and that should drop further as the year goes on when we see FFO growth.","So I would anticipate that the board will meet and consider a fifth and larger increase this year, which obviously would be positive for shareholders.","And with that, I think what we will do Elisa is, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, good afternoon.","Tom Lewis","Hi, Josh.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","I\u2019m wondering if you guys could give a little bit more comments about your two to three year outlook on sales process. I know you noted that the sales have been kind of slow in the first quarter. But this is sort of a question within a question. A, what do you expect in the sales process over the next couple of years and B, is there some right size of the enterprise that you\u2019d like, we\u2019ll be able to get over the next few years, just given that you guys have gotten bigger, and probably necessitates larger deals to continue growing?","Tom Lewis","I\u2019ll start with the last part of that. I think we will continue to get bigger, notwithstanding sales because the acquisitions will outstrip them, and fortunately we have been able to do more acquisitions as the market has been, there has been at lot of product on the market. We have been very active and with good spreads and cost of capital, it\u2019s really an nice window here to jump through, but size over time, is certainly an issue down the road.","Relative to sales, talked to linked again in the last two about kind of re-rating the whole portfolio and starting to sell off some things that we don\u2019t want to hold over the long term, and we targeted initially 106 properties out of the portfolio, a fairly small was about 114 million and asset size and really just stack that really and additional departments to do that in January and started the process, obviously these are aren\u2019t like selling securities where you can push a button.","They do take some time, but I think that initial 114 will take the balance of this year, and probably into the first quarter of next year and than what we will do is, we will probably just have another 100, 150 right behind that that we try and do over a year. So if I could targeted run rate once we get up and operating here, it will be $100 million, give or take $25 million, $50 million on each side. And that should be something that should continue, I would think, for the next three, four years based on how we\u2019ve analyzed the portfolio.","If you look at the 106 that we targeted, again, really (inaudible) in January, there is 49 of those right now where we\u2019re out talking to brokers in the communities where those properties are and going through due diligence, getting the broker opinion of value and coming to some agreement with the person who\u2019ll use. We have another 24 that are listed on the market right now and available.","There are 13 that we had on the market that have letters of intents and then two under contract and we closed one. And then there is another 17 or so that we need to initiate. So I think we are off to a good start, but it will take a couple of quarters to get it going, we should start seeing sales ramp up, a little bit in the second quarter and then in the third and fourth, I would hope that it becomes very, very active, but we\u2019re up and running there. If I had to guess, it would be $100 million give or take that we\u2019re selling each year.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","That\u2019s very helpful. One last question. Have you seen the high yield market, which has been, as you know, very strong this year, has that been impacting tenant decisions on whether to go with the triple net financing or have you seen \u2013 it sounds like the deal flow this year has been pretty good. Has the high yield market been impacting that either positively or negatively?","Tom Lewis","The high yield market is on fire and that does give an alternative to tenants, but they\u2019ve also realized that net lease is permanent financing, and we are very low interest rates and I think that some people have sat down, really thought their way through it and said, look, we have these properties on the books, let\u2019s go out and get some very long-term financing, which I think is smart for them to do. John, you want to comment?","John Case","I can think of just a couple of transactions involving private equity firms where they opted to pursue more high yield financing than sale leaseback financing over the last three to four months. It hasn\u2019t really been a significant impact on our business, but we\u2019re seeing a little of it given the strength of that market right now.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Right. So for the triple nets, you don\u2019t get (inaudible) at the last moment?","Tom Lewis","We try very hard to make that point when we\u2019re doing a transaction.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks very much. Good luck.","Tom Lewis","You bet","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W Baird. Please go ahead.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W Baird","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","Tom Lewis","Hi, Paula.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W Baird","Tom, you described the transaction flow as excellent. Does that reflect just the velocity of opportunities that you\u2019re seeing or does that reflect the suitability of the opportunities relative to your acquisition criteria?","Tom Lewis","Yeah, I think it is, as John mentioned, that in (inaudible) acquisitions this year, about $6 billion had come in the door and for the whole year, last year, if I recall, it was about $13 billion, and then we\u2019ll use last year numbers. Of the $13 billion, about $8 billion gets seriously analyzed and then about $3 billion goes into committee and we actually had a very high hit rate last year though we bought $1 billion. So looking at six and closing about 500 million, the numbers in terms of are pretty high and then the suitability is also very high. And a good part of it a good percentage, again, is investment grade that we\u2019re looking at.","Tom Lewis","Yeah, about half of what we are seeing is investment grade, and what we\u2019re invested in projected to invest in, it\u2019s about 36%.","John Case","And it\u2019s also across a lot of different industries and that tells us sometimes there is something going on in convenience stores or restaurants where those industries don\u2019t have capital or there is a lot of M&A and that\u2019s really what causes people to come into the market, but today it\u2019s pretty broad-based across industries, which tells us, people saying, hey this is a good time while interest rates are low to go out and do something, and I think they are right and then conversely this for us too given where spreads are and we can get long-term financing.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W Baird","And what are some of the industries that you\u2019d like to be in that you are not currently?","Tom Lewis","Well, in retail, we kind of got fully funded and if there you just kind of say anything in there that is non-discretionary to meddle up our income we love, and in retail if it\u2019s going to be the kind of lower income, better be value, club stores, dollar stores, or along those lines.","And then outside, it\u2019s really kind of the Fortune 1000, we\u2019re trying to fall in a little bit and look into those industries that\u2019s cannot be as capital intensive and we would benefit from some of the trends going on conversely, in retail like in when the Internet retailing and transportation, we are looking in that area and we\u2019ve been we\u2019ve done some business with FedEx and looking at some others and so it\u2019s kind of up the credit curve outside of retail and non-heavy equipment type businesses, service business or really Fortune 1000 type companies.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W Baird","That\u2019s really helpful. And then finally, one last question, what do you think the spread is in the cap rate between what you are buying and selling at?","Tom Lewis","That\u2019s a very interesting question. We had targeted for our modeling selling at a 10 cap and we had probably bought those assets at 8 and today they are yielding us \u2013 happen to yield us 883, those we want to sell on the sales. We only have one sale but in through looking at the LOIs and others, it\u2019s down closer to where the cap rate spread is, it\u2019s pretty tight I think in the four or five to date is about 9.","So I think we\u2019re going to have a better range of cap rates and some are lower than what we\u2019re holding at so we\u2019re doing pretty good. If you look today, it\u2019s hard to really say, here\u2019s what we\u2019re buying, here is what we\u2019re selling, we\u2019re selling generally those tenants that we think that might be challenged in the future or in industries that we like to move away from, and we\u2019re buying going up the credit curve, so there should be a spread there is any type of credit spreads that go on in that lease business?","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W Baird","And I\u2019m sorry, one last question, this is really big picture. As you sort of think about long-term really long-term about the trends of consumer spending patterns and what not, is there anything kind of emerging to you of where you definitely want to be or don\u2019t want to be and sort of using that this next generation coming out where I\u2019d be long (inaudible).","Tom Lewis","Right. Yeah. Very much so and will do have some very strong feelings about that, and it\u2019s a function that we think A, retail will be tougher and then secondly, the interest rates will be something that comes in as a problem in the future. And we \u2013 it\u2019s interesting, we kind of thought that recession was coming. We\u2019re doing a big picture dive relative to where we were and where we kind of missed it for a couple of years in the last couple, it\u2019s really come up front for us is dividing the consumer up to upper income, middle income and lower income and then looking at discretionary versus non-discretionary items.","And saying in the upper income, you can do both the discretionary and non-discretionary, we will do very well with that money. And then when you get into middle income, it\u2019s a little bit of a shrinking group, so you want to say with non-discretionary things, they have to buy and when you are looking at discretionary be careful.","And then in the lower income, it\u2019s a really tough going forward. Credit is tough, it\u2019s a lot of people out of work and it\u2019s not improving rapidly and we think we are discretionary spending, it\u2019s going to be huge problem and so we don\u2019t want anything that we view as discretionary spending of the low-income consumer.","We made some significant investments in restaurants in 2007 and 2008, and I wish we would have looked at what we thought would be was going to happen with the economy and tied it to the consumer a couple of years earlier because a lot of that was casual dining and comes right down to the low end consumer on discretionary spending, and that\u2019s really kind of where we don\u2019t want to be and in retail, we want to make sure, it\u2019s primarily the middle income, upper income consumer and then we can play in both discretionary, and non-discretionary.","So if you did that and I will give you an examples, if consumer discretionary, it\u2019s the middle and upper income, health and fitness, theatres, supplies, that was pretty good and you have to watch where you\u2019re buying from a demographics standpoint.","If it\u2019s consumer non-discretionary kind of at the middle take, auto collision, auto service, tires, sea stores, drug stores, those look fairly attractive to us. And then kind for all demographics, those retailers could have good value propositions as kind of whole sale clothes, dollar stores, discount, volume retailers.","And then, to couple it given where we think the fixed rates might go in the future by trying to go a bit up the credit curve.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W Baird","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi. Thanks, guys. Tom, just circling back to your comments on the disposition, the real opportunity for you to sell properties on a one-off basis, I know it might be a little more time consuming, but you get that tend you really want to exchange buyer, it might not be as price sensitive, and if an urgency to close. Any color on the \u2013 if these are going to be portfolios group or maybe just the one-off?","Tom Lewis","Yeah, we will do a few \u2013 in pieces, but I think, we\u2019ll come with the conclusion the best buyer for the \u2013 their good locations, is to the buyer in the community where the property exists, because these tend to be on main drag, people know them if they go buy, and they\u2019re comfortable with their community and they\u2019re comfortable with that location in their community, and that\u2019s sold by I think the local brokering there. And since they\u2019re fairly small asset size, they fit kind of that type of buyer.","With that said, along the way, we\u2019re getting a few calls where somebody says, we would like to do four or five. What we learned in crust though, over a number of years, if you get people coming and try and tie up four or five, and then try and work the transaction, it\u2019s got one out here and one in there, and we\u2019ve just been better off, unless you\u2019re really going to discount them and do a good volume block, you will get maximum value, kind of one-off. And that is a system that we\u2019re trying to build, as we do the sales.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a couple with that. Any geographic pockets that concern you, maybe some macro issues related to the housing market not coming back that are skewing you to sell more across the country?","Tom Lewis","That\u2019s a great question and I have to say, a soft. No, there are some areas that are little less attractive, but we did a really interesting study, we went and studied all of the tenants last year and the industries, and we rate them, and it took a year.","We undertook the same project with properties and started defining real estate characteristics to them relative to income, population, demographics, and really going through the portfolio and when it was done weighted and weighted the properties from real estate characteristics, then they could marry to the credit statistics of the tenant. And we thought it\u2019ll be interesting the back cast was real estate characteristics. So we basically took the last couple of three bankruptcies the company have had, we took both properties and rated, and the correlation to whether we got the properties back, or they were successful is almost zero.","The co-relation was almost cash flow coverage, and then there was the rating for consumer discretionary as the consumer. So we\u2019re more focused in that area because when we backed up, it was stunting to me that you take \u2013 you\u2019re looking at traffic flows, the traffic demographics and all the other things, and all that really matter with the cash flow coverage.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Tom. And last question, with the new acquisition you announced the pending one that\u2019s going to close in the second quarter. Is there any secured debt that comes along with that?","Paul Meurer","No, there is none on this one.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yeah, hello, guys. Good afternoon.","Tom Lewis","Hi, Rich.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Staying with that last question for a second. Your acquisition facility, I assume it is at about zero I think, how you\u2019re basically saying and as you add these acquisitions this quarter, that\u2019s going to pretty much match you out. Is that about right?","Paul Meurer","Yeah, and so obviously options include the utilizing the accordion on the facility, which has $200 million that can be added to the $425 million or access in permanent capital, which whether be common preferred or bonds or all, very available at the moment and very well priced.","Tom Lewis","I\u2019ll also say add-on to that that we have a fabulous group of banks that we have a great relationship with and have been told over time that it\u2019s an environment where pick up the phone if you need something. So we don\u2019t have a concern in that area.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Tom, your confidence level, I take it is high that you closed on these. So you could say you were going to equity, you could do that really at any point, right?","Tom Lewis","You could, but we have found that the best ideas to match those things up while we think there is a very, very high chance that they\u2019re closing, given where we are on them. We generally like to make sure they are going to close and close them before we got a lot of money.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That sounds pretty intelligent. When you look at Friendly\u2019s and Buffets, is there any more impact in the second quarter and what do you think happened beyond 2Q?","Tom Lewis","I think the impact lags throughout the year. I think same-store rents will be a little soft in the second quarter and gets a little better in the third and fourth. And I think the leasing happens over time, and obviously since we are comping off last year\u2019s number pre-bankruptcy on both of these and some of the concessions we made on a comp basis, those will show up this year.","But in terms of handling it, I\u2019d say it gets done in the first three quarters. I think most of it could do and I know our portfolio management group is listening and now knows what we need to do. And then that will pretty much in and we\u2019ll look forward from there. And as I mentioned earlier, there is nothing that\u2019s jumped up we see as of right now in the portfolio above or beyond those.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks. And one more thing. It looked like you \u2013 you added two stores in the quarter and it looked like you added one retail chain. And I was curious, two things, one what the retail chain was, and why you would add one store of one new retail chain?","Tom Lewis","The retail chain increases were released of a property.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, I got you.","Tom Lewis","As part of the acquisition efforts. We agree, relative to the acquisition front, for the most part, you\u2019re not going to see that sort of situation.","John Case","I was just going to say that I don\u2019t know.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yes, exactly. Okay, good, very good. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer portion of the Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the call over to Tom Lewis for closing remarks.","Tom Lewis","Thank you.

Welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2013 Earnings conference call. During today\u2019s presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today Thursday, July 25, 2013.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.","Tom Lewis","Great. Thank you, Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the conference call and thank you for joining us. In the room with me today, I have Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Pfeiffer, our EVP, General Counsel; and Sumit Roy, our Executive Vice President, Acquisitions.","And as always during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in the forward-looking statement. We will disclose in greater detail on the company\u2019s Form 10-Q the factors that may cause such differences.","And as is our custom, why don\u2019t we start with Paul to walk through the quarter.","Paul Meurer","Thanks, Tom. As usual, I\u2019ll comment briefly on our financial statements, provide a few highlights of our financial result for the quarter starting with the income statement.","Total revenue increased 63% for the quarter. Our current revenue on an annualized basis now is approximately $765 million. And of course this increase reflects positive same-store rents of 1.1%, but more significantly it obviously reflects our growth from new acquisitions over the past year.","On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased significantly to $78 million in the quarter as depreciation expense has obviously increased naturally with our portfolio growth.","Interest expense increased in the quarter to $39.1 million. This increase was primarily due to the $800 million of bonds that were issued last October as well as some credit facility borrowings during the past quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong with interest coverage at 4.1 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.3 times.","General and administrative or G&A expenses in the second quarter were approximately $12 million dollars. Our G&A expenses naturally increased this past year as our acquisition activity has increased and we added some new personnel to manage a larger portfolio. Our employee base has grown from 89 employees a year ago to 104 employees at quarter end. However, our total G&A as a percentage of total revenues has decreased to only 6.5% and this compares to a historic run rate for G&A of about 7.5% to 8% of revenues. Our current projection for G&A for all of 2013 is about $58 million. Property expenses were just under $3.3 million for the quarter and our property expense estimate for all of 2013 remains about $15 million.","Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company. They were $722,000 for the quarter. Merger-related costs, obviously this line item refers to the costs associated with the ARCT acquisition. During the quarter, we expensed $605,000 of such remaining costs. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $3.9 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We sold 17 properties during the quarter for $23.7 million with gain on sales of $5.7 million. And just a reminder that we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO.","Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest refers to the limited partners of the operating partnership that we purchased in the ARCT acquisition and a new Realty Income LP, we formed this past quarter. The assets and operations of these two subsidiary partnerships are 100% consolidated into Realty Income.","Preferred stock cash dividend totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter. Net income available to common stockholders was about $44.2 million for the quarter. Reminder that our normalized FFO simply add back the ARCT merger-related costs to FFO. We believe normalized FFO is a more appropriate portrayal of our operating performance and it\u2019s consistent with our public FFO earnings estimates and first call FFO estimates that analysts have published on us.","Normalized FFO per share was $0.51 for the quarter, a 24.5% increase versus a year ago. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividend was $0.59 per share for the quarter, an 18% increase versus a year ago. We again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. We have increased the dividend 63 consecutive quarters and 72 times overall since we went public over 18.5 years ago.","Dividends paid per common share increased 24.5% this quarter versus the same quarterly period a year ago. Our current monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.179 per share. Our AFFO dividend payout ratio year-to-date has been 87%.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. Earlier this month as you know, we raised $750 million of new capital with a 10-year bond offering at 4.65%. Our $1 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility currently has zero borrowings and this facility also has a $500 million accordion expansion feature. We assumed approximately $65 million of in-place mortgages during the quarter as part of our property acquisitions. We now have 51 assumed mortgages on 229 properties, totaling approximately $793 million. Our upcoming mortgage maturities though are only $24 million the reminder of this year and $64 million in 2014. Our next bond maturity is only $150 million, which is not due until November of 2015. Our overall current total debt to total market cap is 29.5% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 4.5% of our current capital structure.","So, in summary, revenue growth this quarter was significant and our expenses remain moderate so our earnings growth was very positive. And our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe and we continue to enjoy excellent access to the public capital markets to fund our continued growth.","Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom, who\u2019ll give a little bit more background on these results.","Tom Lewis","Thank you, Paul. Let me start just by saying I think in the second quarter, we continued pretty good positive momentum from the first quarter and had I think, excellent results in each facet of the business and I\u2019ll start with the portfolio, which again generated very consistent income during the quarter pretty much across the board the tenants are doing well no issues arose with any of the tenants during the quarter and based on what we see now that should be the case during the third quarter very, very smooth.","At the end of the quarter, our largest 15 tenants and they are listed in the release accounted for 43.5% of our revenue that\u2019s down 500 basis points from the same period a year ago and up 90 from the first quarter. There may be some I think ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter in that but our acquisition efforts continue to help us reduce concentrations pretty much throughout the portfolio. And we have made continuous progress in that over time. If you look back say five years ago to 2008, our top 15 tenants accounted for 54.3% of our business, of our revenue and today that\u2019s 43.5%.","Relative to occupancy, we ended the quarter at 98.2% with 68 properties available for lease out of the 3,681 we own that occupancy is up 50 basis points from the first quarter and up 90 basis points from the same quarter a year ago and really is a function of very good progress on leasing during the quarter. And I would say looking forward here in the third quarter, we think occupancy should remain at this level or perhaps up a bit more and overall occupancy is very strong.","We reported occupancy this way for very long time, which is taking vacant buildings against those that are occupied to figure those numbers. There is another way to do it. We can do it by vacant square footage and divided by total square footage that would give you occupancy of 90% or the third way is to take previous rent on vacant properties and divide that by the sum of that number and the rent on occupied properties and if you use that methodology vacancy is only 0.9% and occupancy 99.1%. So, each obviously of the three methodologies indicates very good occupancy.","Same-store rents on the portfolio increased 1.1% during the second quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. As you recall, during last year, same-store rent was just modestly positive for the year so getting back up to a run rate of 1% plus is pretty good. And I think a good rate for the portfolio and we think that will continue over the next few quarters. Diversification of the portfolio continues to widened we are up to 3,681 properties we have 194 tents we\u2019re in 46 industries and 49 states around the country.","I think industry exposures are well diversified given we have 46 industries and the concentrations on the major ones continue to come down a bit and this has been going on really for the last few years. Our largest industry right now is convenient stores that\u2019s at a 11.4% that\u2019s down 60 basis points from last quarter and 550 basis points from a year ago that was once closed to 20% of the portfolio and so getting it down and inside 10% is something we want to do.","Restaurants if you were to combine both categories casual dining and quick service we now have down to 9.9% or below 10 that\u2019s down 60 basis points from last quarter and 390 basis points from a year ago and I\u2019ll note that was once 22% of revenue. We then jumped to drug stores at 6.9% theatres at 6.3% and health and fitness and transportation at 5.9% and then dollar scores at 5.6% and all of the other industry categories that we have are under 4%. So I think pretty good shape and keeping an eye on concentrations by industry.","I think that\u2019s true also from a tenant standpoint. Our top three tenants number one is FedEx at 4.3% that\u2019s down 40 basis points from last quarter. L.A. Fitness is at 4.5%, Walgreens which we have been adding to the portfolio is at 4.1% that\u2019s up about a 120 basis points and every other tenant we have is below 3.5% and when you get to the 15th largest tenant which is Wal-Mart Sam\u2019s Club. You are looking really only to about 1.7% of revenue and it goes down from there.","So certainly well diversified from a tenant and we also think geographic standpoint. Average remaining lease term remains very positive at a 11 years and overall we are really pleased with the portfolio and it\u2019s generating very consistent income with very high occupancy. Relative to portfolio dispositions. We continue to sell some properties out of the portfolio during the quarter. The goal obviously is further strengthening the credit quality, the portfolio and doing that by reducing exposures to industry and tenants and properties where we think they might be particularly sensitive to reduce economic activity or a slowdown in the economy.","We are also maybe with tenants whose balance sheets are significantly levered and might be impacted by higher interest rates and that has been a theme for us for a while. Paul mentioned during the quarter we sold 17 properties for $23 million. For the year it\u2019s 34 properties with $83 million. For those that are on the call on a regular basis you will recall that our goal was over a $100 million and perhaps up to a $125 million and sales will have been flow on a quarter-by-quarter basis but $100 million plus is definitely where we are heading and where most of the way they are now and we may up that estimate in the coming quarters and do some additional dispositions above and beyond that.","And once again the sales primarily during the quarter we are in the restaurant industry which we continue to reduce and the child daycare industry and both are targeted we would like to sell off some properties in those area. I think overall we are very pleased with the operations of the portfolio and have made good progress.","Let me move over to property acquisition for a moment. As I\u2019ve said virtually every quarter forever but it\u2019s a good remainder acquisitions can be quite lumpy quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year and a challenge to predict certainly by the quarter and that continues to be the case.","In the second quarter we were very active on the acquisitions front and pleased with the really high level of activity in acquisitions. We acquired $738 million in properties invested in a 190 different properties and that is the most accusative quarter for property level acquisition in the company\u2019s history and average cash on cash cap rates were at 6.8% kept nice along lease terms and the acquisitions at 14 years and also 70% of the properties acquired during the quarter were leased to investment grade tenants as most of you know that has been one of our focuses.","Also good diversity they released a 19 different tenants in 16 industries with the most significant industries represented were in drug stores, wholesale clubs and in convenient stores and well diversified geographically in 32 states and 90% of the acquisitions during the quarter were in our traditional retail properties that gets us for the first six months of the year then to $867 million that we invested in 206 properties. Cap rates there 7% and long-term leases again at 14 years and about 61% of the acquisitions leased to investment grade tenant.","That\u2019s obviously well above at 860 excuse me $867 million our initial full year 2013 guidance of $550 million. Couple of weeks ago we\u2019ve bumped that guidance up in excess of $1 billion and given really some transactions that have come to fruition in the last few days yesterday in the release we changed that to $1.25 billion and very, very pleased with that process but we think a good share of him as we get now later in the year we\u2019ll close towards the end of the third and fourth quarter that\u2019s fairly typical. And so the impact to 2013 numbers maybe modest depending on when the closings actually happened but obviously very accretive to the 2014 numbers and that $1.25 billion will be in addition to the $3.2 billion acquisition of ARCT that we did in the first quarter.","Looking at transaction flow I talked about it being very, very robust last quarter and it\u2019s really been a record amount of flow that has come into the market substantially. During first six months of the year we\u2019ve sourced about $20 billion in acquisition opportunities that have come through the door and $15 billion of that alone came in the door during the second quarter. To put that in perspective that\u2019s more in sourced acquisition opportunities year to-date then we\u2019ve ever seen in a full calendar year.","Last year was very heavy year for acquisition opportunities at $17 billion. The year before was $13 billion and previous to that it had never really exceeded much over $5 billion so the $15 billion during the quarter and $20 billion year to-date represents really just a stunning level of opportunities that were out there in the market place with people bringing properties out for sale.","A number of those as some people have probably noticed we\u2019re large portfolio entity level acquisition opportunities but also there were a lot of very small kind of granular individual property opportunities that came to market during the quarter so it remain very active. I think we remained very selective in the acquisitions and have been trying to pursue only those things that match where we are trying to take the portfolio strategically and we continue to look at few of the acquisition opportunities that came into the second quarter but have elected not to pursue the vast majority of them.","And again number of the transactions for us had issues relative to the industries the tenants were in and who the consumers are also with pricing and structure. And I think it\u2019s generally been the case then in the large portfolio unless the overwhelming vast majority of the properties fit the invest strategy will likely elect to pass on them and not pursue growth just for gross purposes but overall obviously very pleased with acquisition volume and also very pleased that in past years and we had some descent size acquisitions go through this quarter that just as I said a moment ago a lot of the acquisitions have been property by property and smaller organic level transactions and really allowed us to make some good progress with the portfolio.","Let me talk to pricing and cap rates which I think is really interesting. Cap rates have ticked up a bit over the last six weeks or so as we saw movement in rates in the capital markets. Cap rates started moving and at the same time and probably seen about a 25 basis point move up in cap rates overall just in the last six weeks or so. And historically that does not usually happened this fast and usually it takes longer for cap rates to adjust movements in the capital markets and sometimes they may even lag by six to 12 months.","And in the recent kind of movement in the capital markets things seem a bit different this time and put some thought to it and I think the reason that the cap rates started to moving quicker this time is that more and more of the acquirers in the net lease business now are institutional buyers such as ourselves certainly then was the case in the past.","And I think our business historically has been dominated by a very large group of one-off transactions primarily driven by individual investors that had a big impact on the pricing in the market and that\u2019s flip-flopped a bit as more institutional buyers have emerged and it\u2019s a smaller group albeit of large players that seem to be impact the pricing. So really a movement in the cap rates stands by a few larger buyers, I think like can adjust cap rates a bit faster than what we\u2019ve traditionally seen in the net lease market for a very long time and I think that\u2019s been the case here.","In the market right now investment grade properties \u2013 properties leased to investment grade tenants cap rates have moved kind of in the 6.25% up to 7.25% certainly up 25 basis points maybe a few basis points more, and I think the same thing with non-investment grade cap rates which were in the 7.25% to 8.25% range also up 25 basis points and again that\u2019s just really over the last five, six weeks or so and normally I\u2019d wonder about that and wonder if its anecdotal but, given the flow and the volume of activity that we see and that we\u2019re working on I think it\u2019s pretty representative of what\u2019s going out happening in the market. So caps moving up with capital cost this quickly as unusual, but obviously we\u2019re pleased by that.","Looking at spreads, our investment spreads remained very healthy in the second quarter, as I mentioned a minute ago invested $866.5 million at a 7 cap rate. We financed basically almost all of that recently with the 10 year unsecured bond offering that Paul talked about with a 4, 6, 5 coupon, so a spread of little over 230 basis points which is excellent and that\u2019s pretty much everything that we\u2019ve done year-to-date.","And as we frequently discuss, when we talk about spreads historically, we\u2019ve looked at our spreads first relative to a nominal cost of equity which is taking a forward FFO yield dividing it by the price of the stock and then grossing it up for issuance cost. And if you look back over the last 20 years that spread over a nominal cost of equity is averaged about a 112 basis points and I had mentioned that during the last 20 years the vast majority of the time we were acquiring properties leased to less than investment grade tenants.","And if you look today with well over half of the acquisitions little over 60% going to investment grade tenants cap rates for the first six months were at 7% and that nets you about a 130 basis point spread to the nominal cost of capital if you calculated it where we are today. And that\u2019s a good 20 basis points over the 20 year historical average. So in a little a bit, but still quite healthy and then relative to what we did in the quarters obviously spreads are higher using debt issuance.","So I think we still like the spreads relative to what we\u2019ve achieved historically out there when most of our acquisitions were less than investment grade and today the majority are investment grade and obviously on the spread fund caps \u2013 cap rates ticking up a bit is helpful. Relative to the volume and what we\u2019re looking at going forward, we feel it is still a very robust market with a lot of product to look at, we\u2019d be very surprised to see the volume of opportunities in the third and fourth quarters that we saw in the second quarter, the $15 billion again was pretty exceptional.","But going forward there is still very active flow and we expect our activity there to remain pretty robust remainder of the year, but likely as always continue to be lumpy, but we\u2019re very optimistic we\u2019ll have a banner year. You noticed in the release, we moved the estimate as I mentioned to $1.25 billion we\u2019re highly confident on that and then we\u2019ll see if we can make some additional progress for the remainder of the year, very positive on acquisitions.","Let me just get back to the portfolio for a second and all this acquisition activity obviously has had a big impact on the financials, revenue earnings and dividend which is apparent the number is here. But it\u2019s also had a material impact on the makeup of our portfolio and where we\u2019re trying to move it up to credit curve and we continue to make good progress on that. The percentage of our revenue during the quarter that is generated by investment grade tenants was up to 38.2% for the quarter that\u2019s up 240 basis points over the first quarter and I just to update a few numbers here that I went through in the first quarter and I think it\u2019s helpful to do. Over the last 36 months or so we\u2019ve acquired about $6.6 billion in property about $4.5 billion of that is in retail which is traditional for us and sectors that we think will continue to perform well if we get a tough retail environment goes on. And then $2.1 billion we\u2019ve acquired in areas outside of retail almost all investment grade that we think will do well for us. Out of that $6.6 billion, $4.1 billion or 62% has been with investment grade tenants and a good part; I think of the balance of the acquisitions will amount our investment grades certainly are further up the credit curve than we had averaged in the portfolio just a few years ago.","Some other interesting numbers and I\u2019ll track this back over the last five years from 2008, as I mentioned earlier in 2008 the top 15 tenants did 54.3% of our business, if you look at their average DAR score and as a lot of you know that\u2019s the credit score internally we use that approximates the credit score somewhere to what the rating agencies do. The DAR score on average for the top 15 tenants was a 6.92 which equates to about a BB minus credit rating and in 2008 none of the top 15 tenants had investment grade ratings.","Today the top 15 do 43.5% of the revenue that average DAR score is now 11.78 which approximates to about a really BBB that closer to a BBB plus credit rating that\u2019s up substantially and eight of the top 15 tenants now carry investment grade ratings. So if you look at really in the last for the top 15, 4.5 years percentage of revenue from 54% to 43%, the DAR score from 6.92 to 11.78 and then from zero to eight of the top 15 tenants with investment grade ratings, and so pretty pleased with \u2013 with those trends.","At a couple of the industry meetings lately and I\u2019ve alluded to this on the call there is another way to look at the adjustments, I\u2019ll spend a minute on and if you go back two years ago from right now in July of 2011 we went back and re-underwrote our largest tenants, we did that for 67 tenants that produced 83% of our revenue and really did that using 19 different metrics to try and assess the risks that they might represent to our revenue stream in a rising interest rate environment or a weak economy and it included rankings on each industry based on that industry and how it operates just margins and the consumer that really they serve, an analysis of concentrations, balance sheet and income statement analysis and then a pretty heavy sensitivity analysis where we stress tested them moving their revenue and their margins and then their sensitivity to interest rates on refinance and their balance sheets.","And based on that if you took the portfolio at least the 67 tenants that did 83% of our revenues, we broke them up into four categories and I\u2019ll do and one is green, which is strong buy, one is yellow which is buy, red which hold, black what you sell. And back in 2011 tenants representing about 22.8% of our revenue were in the green strong buy category, 21.4% in the yellow or buy category, about 15.9% in that red or hold category and then 22.9% in the black or sell. And again they represented about 83% of our revenue. Pretty much two years here exactly we just recently updated that and given the pretty robust acquisition and disposition activity, we now do that each quarter and it represents a 121 tenants that do 88.1% of our revenue, but if you look at the breakdown today the green or strong buy category tenants in that category have moved from 22.8% of our revenue in 2011 to today over 45.1%. In the yellow and buy its gone from 21.4% to down a bit 18.4% in the red from 15.9% to 15.8%, but most importantly in the black or sell category which was 22.9% of our revenue in 2011, it is now 8.8% of the revenue.","So substantial and I think material progress in moving the portfolio to some degree would dispositions obviously to a lesser extent, but certainly with all the acquisitions we\u2019ve done it had a pretty material impact. Let\u2019s move to the capital side for a minute, you know I mentioned that we\u2019ve bought about $6.6 billion over the last three years, I think how that\u2019s been capitalized is important, I\u2019ll run through the numbers. We\u2019ve issued about $1.8 billion of long-term notes or bonds at very good rates. We\u2019ve assumed on some larger transactions about $793 million in mortgage debt.","We also generated about a $178 million from property sales and then $409 million in perpetual preferred offerings, but most importantly in the last three years we\u2019d issued equity six times during the period equivalent to about $3.7 billion. So that\u2019s about $6.8 billion in capital total, over $4 billion of it was common and preferred and of the remaining none of the capital is variable rate most all of it long-term and I think that puts us in pretty good shape relative to if we see a further rising interest rate environment and as those of you who were on the calls know preparing for a rising rate has been a theme for us on the calls in the last three years relative to capital issuance and trying to grow up the curve. And I think we\u2019ve been able to do this while moving the needle pretty well on FFO and dividends.","Let me finish off with just a few relative access to capital now as Paul mentioned we\u2019re in good shape, plenty of dry powder and no balance on the line and even with the tenure moving up we have accessed to capital at good rates and more importantly good spreads on the acquisitions.","Earnings for the quarter as Paul mentioned, we\u2019re very strong so let me just move on to guidance. We made the adjustments a couple of weeks ago to a $1 billion and then as I have said a couple of times up to a $1.25 billion, however on earnings guidance we did not change I mean, we did a couple of weeks ago and that is now 237 to 243 on normalized FFO and at 17% to 20% growth and on AFFO 235 to 241 or 14% to 17% growth. And even though we think acquisitions will now be larger than expect as we left the guidance where we took it a couple of weeks ago.","I noticed in some of the research notes this morning there were some question on that. So let me \u2013 take a moment and kind of go through the thoughts there. we just up the guidance a couple of weeks ago by a nickel on both FFO, AFFO and it was really just some transactions coming together in the last couple of days that really made this confident to move the acquisition\u2019s guidance too $1.25 billion and that again causes us to be very confident on current guidance.","But I think there is some \u2013 variables or levers in the business I\u2019d like to maintain some optionality on for now rather than moving guidance up further. One is the timing of the closings, and how that\u2019s going to impact numbers, obviously sooner creates a little more FFO on the 2013 numbers than later and as we get here later in the years the acquisitions have less impact. And then next trying to discern what if any volume there is going to be above and beyond that. And I think that will lay itself out over the next couple of months or so.","Next is \u2013 what are permanent capital costs, given the volatility lately we liked to hedge that a bit and so we\u2019ve done that. And then I think also one of the levers we\u2019d like to keep is whether or not we expand the disposition level a bit over the $100 million to $125 million level and we may do that. And then finally I think it comes down to trying to assess what type of capital we would use next, do we use equity or something else and those would have different impacts on the numbers, different share count. And \u2013 and then really it\u2019s just you know trying to maintain some optionality primarily on capital and dispositions. So we will revisit it down the road we don\u2019t want to get too far ahead on the numbers at least for right now, but obviously the growth numbers and the guidance having recently up to the very positive.","Finally I\u2019ll end with our for our shareholders who were primarily \u2013 who\u2019s primary focus is dividends which as you know is a great deal of them, Paul mentioned dividends paid were up 24.5% quarter-over-quarter, we\u2019ve increased to three times this year and we remain optimistic that our activities will support continued increases in the dividend.","Want to thank you for your patience with an active quarter. And Sheryl, if you\u2019ll come back we\u2019ll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good afternoon. I just had a quick question with regards to your capacity from a balance sheet perspective. How much could you debt fund out for you\u2019d be a bit uncomfortable with your leverage ratio? And I guess the second question what I\u2019ve got the floor is just what are your views on acquiring assets with lease terms below 10 years what sort of cap rate spreads, which you have to see relative to your traditional focal point?","Tom Lewis","Well from an overall leverage standpoint Juan, we historically have run kind of in the \u2013 I\u2019ll give a broad range for a second, 20% to 35% leverage range, 5% to 15% preferred, when I referred to 35% debt and 15% preferred I\u2019m referring to maximum that we\u2019re comfortable with relative to that. So today debts around 30%, preferreds around 5%, we obviously do have capacity in both buckets and certainly stayed in concert with issuing equity as well. We would continue to have capacity in those buckets, but we view maximum levels of kind of a 35% debt, 15% preferred.","And actually preferred that they be more in the 25% debt level and in the 5% to 10% preferred level. So we have an all phrase we use internally which is go equity first so to the extent that common equity is well priced and accretive that\u2019s something we would \u2013 always keep our eye on as something we\u2019d be more likely to take a look at before we looked at the fixed income side.","Paul Meurer","On the second question Juan, relative to shorter leases it has been very, very, very rare for us to go much inside 10 years the only time I can remember is when we bought a large portfolio on just a couple of three, four, five of the properties would be inside of that. We\u2019re really trying to go longer up in the 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 to keep the lease duration on the portfolio long, and allow the revenue to be very stable. When you\u2019re in the net lease market and you\u2019re out there selling properties if you\u2019re lease linked is 10 years or longer generally the cap rate will command, we\u2019ll be much, much better than when it moves inside 10 years and as you get shorter down in the 6,5, 4 cap rates rise pretty dramatically. And that\u2019s generally a function of released risk that is hard to tell on a lot of net lease assets.","And when you\u2019re out buying shorter-term leases generally those aren\u2019t generated in a direct transaction with a retailer or a large corporate tenant generally you\u2019re buying those out from another owner in the open market. And if you didn\u2019t underwrite them to yourselves you may not have cash flow coverages or the profitability, the individual stores that you\u2019re buying and that\u2019s makes it difficult to assess the risk of whether the tenant will re-lease certainly in the case of retail, and you want to make sure you have that and if you didn\u2019t have it then the cap rates going to rise because of the uncertainty relative to rollover.","So you\u2019d really have to be assessing what you paid per square foot and what the rent is per square foot, and what you think the market would be, but generally those command much higher cap rates and it\u2019s very rare our strong, strong prejudice is not to go into that game. We\u2019ve looked at that business may be 15 times over the last 20 years but really found it difficult to underwrite. So generally we\u2019re looking up in the 12, 13, 15 to 20 year lease when we\u2019re \u2013 acquiring properties.","Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan with Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead.","R.J. Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Hey guys, good afternoon and good evening.","Unidentified Company Speaker","Hey R.J.","R.J. Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Just curious Tom, what \u2013 the volume \u2013 the $15 billion in the second quarter is that \u2013 was that a reaction to the tenure moving or was there something else driving that surge in volume?","Tom Lewis","Yes. And that was really pre the temper tantrum as somebody said at the other day, and the movement in the tenure because most of that that hit the market came in middle earlier the quarter and also came of course was structured before that in the decision to bring it to the market generally is a few months before that. And it\u2019s a couple of things going on one is, is just there has been a growing knowledge of net lease sale and leaseback and I think that\u2019s a function of a lot of the talk in the fourth quarter and the first quarter with bankers out calling on really Fortune 500 and \u2013 every tenant they have or every company they have about using the real estate take it up balance sheet.","So just a wider knowledge of using sales and leaseback is part of the capital structure by corporations. I think also there is just been a lot of potential M&A transactions a number of those had been noted in the press and, those came to market and I think it was also representative the companies are figuring out the rates are pretty good, and it might be a good time to do it if you\u2019re going to couple with some of the private REITs or fund business that is really the part of the cycle where they need to come to market and the confluence evolve so one time led to a lot coming on the market very quickly. A lot of that will get done, got done some of it won\u2019t and then when the tenure moved you saw the \u2013 saw cap rates move a bit. But it was just a heavy quarter and it was all of those things coming together and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that this quarter and next quarter but the volume still remains very elevated over where it was a couple of years ago.","R.J. Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","So, it\u2019s slowed since the middle of May or\u2026","Tom Lewis","Yes, I mean $15 billion is a ridiculous number. But if you go back again two, three years ago I think $5 billion a year was the number and it\u2019s certainly running way the heck ahead of that. It\u2019s still very strong. We saw $5 billion in the first quarter and assume you want to hazard a guess so what you think we\u2019ll see in the third and fourth\u2026","R.J. Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Subset of the $5 billion for the remainder of the year.","Tom Lewis","Yeah, okay.","R.J. Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hey, good afternoon guys.","Tom Lewis","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird","(inaudible) thoughts as you look at the potential large portfolio deals you have done on the publicly traded side and the non-traded side that might need a liquidity event over the next year or so. What says your appetite right now for those kinds of deals and all of equal and tenant quality lease duration, which says that the yields probably need to see between the portfolio deal and one-off deals that would make you more constructive in pursuing those?","Tom Lewis","Yes it\u2019s really interesting \u2013 that\u2019s an interesting question. Let me comment it a few ways. I said in last quarter\u2019s call something very strange in the business right now is because of the additional institutional buyers. Traditionally, if you had a large portfolio transaction the cap rate on that would be higher than a one-off really rewarding the person for putting out a lot of capital in one fell swoop and starting about a year ago that all reversed as you had a number of institutional buyers, who were trying to put capital out and had raised funds and had difficulty putting it out and a one-off transaction would move the needlework for them.","So, it\u2019s only time in and then came in at $75 million or $100 million, $200 million, $300 million all of a sudden there were a lot of people looking at it and so cap rates really inverted where those were going trading inside a one-off of the same tenant. So, that\u2019s unusual as long as I\u2019ve been in the business but I think still where we are.","And so if I \u2013 I said earlier that investment grade cap rates worth 6 in a quarter and 7 a quarter rate, I think a large transaction would fit in bidding that and same thing in a less than investment grade. And relative to us looking at them we\u2019d love to do it. We\u2019re more than happy to do it but one of the terms brought up here recently is given all the volume that came to market the odds were good but the goods were also odd.","So, when you start looking at the quality of portfolio we\u2019re trying to move more investment grade and there was a number of the things that came to market that were not and some that didn\u2019t had a makeup in the portfolio. They didn\u2019t fit some other characteristics rather the industry, who want to be in. And so, we\u2019re really going to limit what we do on those unless the vast majority of the properties I said earlier kind of fit. But with that said we\u2019re open to it. There is some floating out there and we\u2019ll have to watch where they are.","Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird","I guess if I look further out into that pipeline that M&A pipeline are you thinking of deals that might come to market that you are sort of holding off or are you sort of taking a more short-term view?","Tom Lewis","Yeah no I mean we\u2019re just taking them as we come. As I said, we\u2019re really happy Sumit Roy, who is running acquisitions and John Case our Chief Investment Officer kind of took our acquisition group and split them up into different areas earlier in the year. And we\u2019re very happy with kind of the granular one-offs that we\u2019re able to bring in much more than in the past.","And that\u2019s really led from the reliance I think for us on larger transactions but we\u2019re pretty happy with the volumes coming in. So, we don\u2019t feel compelled to go out and grab them. But we\u2019re more trying to watch what\u2019s really steaming up out there and what would fit. And then when those come wanting to make sure that we pursue them fairly aggressively and on the other ones not a high level of interest if it doesn\u2019t fit, where we\u2019re trying to take the portfolio.","Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, Tom since it\u2019s a big number in Q2 that $15 billion that came in is that absolutely everything that\u2019s being marketed or is that has been screened through you guys and then from there you break it down to see if it fits your long-term lease profile?","Tom Lewis","Yeah I\u2019m sure that there were sort of things that we didn\u2019t see particularly smaller but those are all of the things that came in the door that would reasonably be assumed that they would fit into categories that we would buy. And then we started screening and from there what happens is the acquisition group and they all have financial backgrounds do the initial screening, understanding our objectives.","And they can start throwing things out pretty quick with just a day or two looking at them and trying to be more selective with what we then released and it goes over to research, the financial analysis are done and we get deep into it and then goes to the investment committee from there. So, that is the all-in kind of number of everything we see that is net lease that Realty Income would look at the category, look at the type of tenant that comes in the door.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","And is it reasonable to assume that that could be a long runway for you guys its stuff you are looking at in Q2 could still be closing in Q4 and Q1 of next year should this really provide a pretty visible runway for acquisitions?","Tom Lewis","Sumit, why don\u2019t you take that?","Sumit Roy","Sure. Most of the $15 billion that we referenced we\u2019ve decided to pass on. Some of them we\u2019ve already found out who the eventual buyer is. Some of it is still going through the process and I\u2019m sure the eventual buyer will emerge over the next couple of quarters. But none of those $15 billion that we\u2019ve referenced are portfolios that we\u2019ve decided to pursue outside of the ones that we\u2019ve either pursued or is in the pipeline to close and that\u2019s a very, very small percentage less than 5%.","Tom Lewis","Yes. And the comfort level for the $1.25 billion is really taking those and the ones that we pursued and we are going to get and kind of looking at the timing and closing and that\u2019s how we kind of jump from the $866 to $1.25. And there is a few exceptions but then you really want to start thinking that anything additional will come from what we\u2019re looking at right now not what we look at last quarter.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","And that\u2019s helpful. And then Tom, you referenced the cap rate movement up about 25 basis points in the last six weeks. Is it fair to say that that was more on the low investment grade and that investment grade cap rates a little more sticky.","Tom Lewis","No, actually we believe they both moved. We\u2019ve seen a lot of volume in it and that was the major point of our discussion a few days ago sitting there just parsing everything coming in the door. So, we\u2019ve seen it across the board.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And then Paul you get pretty good color on how you are dealing the preferreds and it sounds like the preferreds at the bottom half of your range or what should expect maybe 5% to 10%. Can you just kind of go under what the current market pricing is for preferreds and tenant of your philosophy of convertible preferred would be considered?","Paul Meurer","The, as you know the preferred pricing widened over the last 45 days or so with the moving interest rates may be even more so than bonds. It kind of made a big jump and it\u2019s taken a while for that to settle down. Current pricing for us would be in the 6.5% range call it from a coupon perspective. We suspect that will continue to tighten as things settle a bit in that preferred market and there is some demand on the horizon in that market but not at a level that it makes sense so for example to issue and takeout our existing preferred or that sort of thing but it is a bucket that we have capacity for and its reasonably priced and of course has a great maturity date if you will. So, it matches up well in our balance sheet for long-term assets and not matching with long-term liabilities.","Convertible preferred is something we are open minded about. I think it would need to be done in concert with a larger strategic entity level type situation, where an equity element would be something to be considered. But as a normal ongoing corporate finance product in the balance sheet it\u2019s not really how we choose to match fund our assets and not how we chose demand into the equity side of the balance sheet but it\u2019s something we listen to. We\u2019re open minded about and are knowledgeable about and we\u2019d, never say never but it\u2019s not something we look to in the near term or as a regular course of financing.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom Lewis for concluding remarks.","Tom Lewis","Great.

(Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas Lewis","Thank you, Tager and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call today to discuss the first quarter operations for Realty Income. Before I start, in the room with me is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; John Case, our President and Chief Investment Officer; Paul Meurer, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Pfeiffer, our General Counsel.","As always I must read and say that during this conference call we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law and the company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail on the company's Form 10-K the factors that may cause such differences.","Also in the room with me today are some spring allergies so if we go radio silent for a second or you hear a loud noise I would appreciate your understanding. Paul, as we always do, if you\u2019ll start by running through the numbers for everybody.","Paul Meurer","Thank you, Tom. As usual, I will comment on the financial statements, provide a few highlights of the financial results for the quarter and start by just walking briefly through the income statement.","Total revenue increased 52.9% for the quarter. Our current revenue on an annualized basis today at 3, 31 is approximately $718 million. This increase reflects some positive same-store rent of 1.5% in the portfolio, but more significantly it obviously reflects our growth from new acquisitions over the past year.","On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased significantly to just under $70 million in the quarter. Of course that depreciation expense increased with our portfolio growth.","Interest expense increased in the quarter to $41.5 million and this increase was primarily due to the $800 million of bond that were issued last October as well as some credit facility borrowing during the quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both improved and remain strong, with interest coverage at 3.7 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.0 times.","General and administrative or G&A expenses in the quarter were approximately $11.6 million dollars. Our G&A expenses naturally increased this past year as our acquisition activity increased and we added some new personal to manage a larger portfolio. Our employee base has grown from 86 employees a year ago to 92 employees at quarter end. However, our total G&A as a percentage of total revenues has decreased to only 6.7%. Historically our G&A had a run rate at about 7.5% to 8% of revenue.","Our current projections for G&A for all of 2013 is about $45 million. Property expenses were just $3.8 million for the quarter, these expenses historically have been primarily our carry cost associated with properties available for lease. However, as we noted last quarter, our 2013 property expense estimate is higher at about $15 million, as we have recently purchased a few double properties where we are responsible for some of the property expenses.","Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company and they were $671,000 for the quarter. Merger related costs, obviously this line items refers to the cost associated with the ARCT acquisition. During the quarter we expensed approximately $12 million of such costs. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $39.5 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We sold 17 properties during the quarter for $60 million with a gain on sales of $38.6 million. An important reminder that we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO.","Net income attributable to non-controlling interest refers to the limited partners of the operating partnership we purchased which holds the ARCT property. These LPs own 0.7% of the equity of the OP. All of the assets and operations of the OP are 100% consolidated into realty income. Preferred stock cash dividend totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter and net income available to common stock holders was about $61.3 million for the quarter. Reminder that our normalized FFOs simply add back the ARCT merger related costs to FFO. We believe normalized FFO is a more appropriate portrayal of our operating performance and it's consistent with our public FFO earnings estimates and our first call FFO estimates that analysts have published on us.","Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.51 for the quarter, a 32.6% increase versus a year ago. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO, or the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.60 per share for the quarter, a 20% increase versus a year ago. Also you will note that in our press release we continue to affirm our same earnings estimates for 2013. As you know, we have also increased our cash monthly dividend significantly over the past year. In addition to our regular quarterly increase, we did a $0.35 annualized dividend increase in January. We have increased the dividend 62 consecutive quarters and 71 times overall since we went public 18.5 years ago. Dividends paid per common share increased 17.6% this quarter versus the same quarterly period a year ago. Our current monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.175 per share. Our AFFO dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 86%.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain a very conservative and safe capital structure. In March, we raised $755 million of new capital with a very successful common equity offering. We sincerely thank the 16 investment banks involved in the placement of our common shares with investors and their respected brokerage system. At quarter end, our $1 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility had a balance of only $116.6 million. Our credit facility also has a $500 million accordion expansion feature. We did assume approximately $565 million of in place mortgages during the quarter as part of our property acquisition, primarily in the ARCT acquisition.","We now have 48 assumed mortgages on 185 properties, totaling approximately $729 million. In March, we did repay at maturity $100 million of bonds which were placed back in 2003. Our next bond maturity is only $150 million and it is due in November of 2015.","Our overall current total debt to total market capitalization is 24.5% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 4.5% of our capital structure.","So in summary, revenue growth this quarter was significant and our expenses remain moderate so our earnings growth was very positive. And our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe and we continue to enjoy excellent access to the public capital markets to fund our continued growth.","Now let me turn the call back over to Tom who\u2019ll give a little bit more background.","Thomas Lewis","Thanks Paul. I\u2019ll start with just the general comment that was in the release which is obviously the first quarter was the best quarter I think operationally in the company\u2019s history and each facet of the business had solid results. So we\u2019ll keep the commentary here a little shorter than usual because I think the results speak for themselves. But let me start with the portfolio which continued to generate very consistent cash flow in the first quarter and general accounts pretty much all of the tenants are reporting doing pretty well. There are no issues that arose with any tenants during the quarter and we believe that will be the case here in the second quarter. So very smooth.","At the end of the quarter, our largest 15 tenants that are listed in the release accounted for 42.6% of our revenue. That\u2019s down 680 basis points from the same period a year ago and down 450 basis points from the fourth quarter. So the recent acquisition efforts continue to help us reduce any concentrations in the portfolio. And we made continuous progress on this over time. In 2008 the top 15 accounted for 54.3% of revenue and we\u2019re now down to 42.6%.","We ended the quarter with 97.7% occupancy and that\u2019s 81 properties available for lease out of the 3,525 that we own. That\u2019s up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter and 110 basis points from the same period a year ago. And here in the second quarter we would anticipate occupancy remaining very strong, likely to be flat or up slightly again this quarter and very pleased with that.","I mentioned in the past there are three ways you can do occupancy. The one we use in the release is to take just the number of properties that are vacant, 81, divided by the 3,525 and that\u2019s how we get to 97.7%. If you wanted to run it on a square footage basis that would get you to occupancy of 98.6%. The third way you could do it is take the previous rents on any vacant properties and divide that by the sum of that number and the rent on the occupied properties and using that methodology occupancy is 98.8% and obviously any of the three indicated higher occupancy.","Same store rents on the core portfolio increased 1.5% during the first quarter. As you recall during last year\u2019s same-store rent was a small negative in the first three quarters and barely positive for the year. So getting to 1.5% is a good rate I think for a net lease portfolio and it\u2019s good to get back to that number.","Diversification really continued to widen substantially in the quarter. As I mentioned before 3,525 properties. That\u2019s up 512 properties from last quarter in 46 different industries now with 195 different tenants in 49 states and Puerto Rico. And then the industry exposures also continue to climb substantially. Our largest industry today convenience stores is at 12%. That\u2019s down 290 basis points from last quarter and up 500 basis points from a year ago. Restaurants as you know is an area that we had targeted to reduce. If you combine both the casual dining and quick service is now down to 10.5% and that\u2019s down 190 basis points from last quarter and 410 basis points over the same period a year ago. I\u2019ll just note we once I think had 22% of our revenue in that sector.","Theatres are at 6.7. That\u2019s down 200 basis points quarter and 300 for year. And then you get to health and fitness and drug stores, both about 6%. Health and fitness down a bit and then the three industries really that have been moving up, drug stores is at 6% now, up 270 basis points from last quarter. The dollar stores is up to about 5.6% and then transportation services at 5.2%, when you get below that, any other category is below 4% and a very good shape keeping industry concentrations reasonable.","Same thing on the tenant standpoint. Our largest at 5.7% is FedEx, that\u2019s up over the last year because of some acquisitions we made and the ARCT portfolio. L.A. Fitness is second at 4.5%, that\u2019s down 60 basis points from the last quarter. And then everything else is now down below 3.5% exposure in the portfolio. And as I mentioned, the largest top 15 are down 42.6%. And when you get to the 15s, you will notice you are about 1.5% of revenue, so that this continues to widen on our tenant and also on an industry standpoint and certainly the same could be said from a geographic standpoint. [Average leasing] due to acquisitions has remained very healthy at 11.1 year and as I mentioned, the portfolio continues to generate very stable income with high occupancy.","Relative to property dispositions, we accelerated the asset disposition program a bit during the quarter with a focus on the intent of trying to further strengthen the credit quality of the overall portfolio, and doing that by reducing exposures in certain industries and properties that we think might be particularly sensitive to any economic weakness or a tenant whose balance sheet is levered, and if interest rates were to go up, we think that they might be somewhat at risk. During the quarter we sold 17 properties for $60 million. As you recall, we were looking in our guidance for a little over $100 million in dispositions for the year, and so getting $60 million of that done in the first quarter is very positive. And we think that going forward that we will easily hit that 100. I think we said 75 million to 100 million, we believe we hit that and I would say well over 100 for the year at this point.","Most of the sales for the quarter were in the restaurant and (inaudible) industry relative to number of properties. We also sold a multitenant investor property that we had had in the portfolio for about 25 years that had 375 tenants that we think exposure to economic weakness might be substantially more than the balance of our portfolio, and so we moved that out with a sale. I think it's safe to say the amount of sales just like acquisitions will vary quarter-to-quarter and be a bit lumpy, but they could accelerate a bit more as the year goes on.","Let me move on to property acquisitions. As I have talked about for some time, acquisitions will vary quarter-to-quarter and they are a challenge to predict for any individual quarter. But given really excellent transaction flow that we are seeing right now and what we did in the first quarter, which is a little more than we generally do, we are off to a very good start for the year. The first quarter as I mentioned, is a little slow. If you recall, last year I think we did $1.2 billion and I think we did $10 million in the first quarter. So at $128 million, we view that as a positive.","I also think that transaction volume at that this point tells us, this should be another very good year for acquisitions. We initially had in the guidance, $550 million. I can say now, and we are sitting in fairly early April but that should not be an issue for us. And we should be able to meet that and exceed that which is very much a positive at this time of the year. Let me have John Case, our President and Chief Investment Officer make some comments about what we did and kind of what we are seeing out there in the marketplace. John?","John Case","As Tom said, we remain active on the acquisitions front. During the first quarter we made $128 million in property level investments in 27 properties at an average yield of 7.9%. These properties had a weighted average lease term of just under 14 years and 22% of these assets are leased to investment grade tenants. The properties are leased to 14 different tenants and 11 different industries, so well diversified. Two of the tenants are new to our portfolio and the most significant industries represented were transportation services and [health] business.","Properties are located in 16 states and about 80% of the investments are comprised of our traditional retail properties. Of course this activity was in addition to our $3.2 billion acquisition of American realty capital trust which added 515 properties and closed in January. So our combined total investment in real estate for the first quarter was just under $3.3 billion and 542 properties. This was clearly our most active quarter in our company's history by a significant margin.","Let me spend a moment here and talk about the market environment today. I\u2019ll start with transaction flow. Tom just alluded to that. We continue to be very busy. So far in the first quarter we sourced $4.3 billion in acquisition opportunities. So transaction flow continues to remain strong. We continue to work on a number of these opportunities and we\u2019re expecting another active year for transaction flow.","While investment opportunities are fairly abundant, competition for these acquisitions is also abundant. There are plenty of well capitalized buyers in the market today led by private and public lease REITS, but we\u2019re also seeing some other private institutional buyers seeking yield in our space. These buyers are using more leverage with the CMBS market in our space that has gained strength here in the past quarter or two. And that\u2019s helping our private buyers better compete. But we expect to continue to close on a fair share of these opportunities.","As far as pricing goes, cap rates remain low relative to historical standards. Given the strong bid in the market today they\u2019re coming under a bit more pressure. Non-investment grade properties are trading in the 7% to 8% cap rate range. Investment grade assets are trading in the 6% to 7% cap rate range. However, our overall cost of capital has also continued to decline. So our investment spreads remain very healthy relative to our historical averages.","The current market portfolios in the $50 to $250 million range continue to trade at premium pricing relative to single assets. So buyers are willing to pay a portfolio premium in order to deploy larger amounts of capital efficiently. This is the trend we\u2019ve been seeing for the last year or so and we expect to see it continuing.","So to recap our outlook, we do remain optimistic about achieving our previous acquisitions guidance of $550 million for this year. We are still modeling a 7.25% initial yield on acquisitions for 2013. But that number will depend on our ultimate mix of investment grade and non-investment grade acquisitions. In the first quarter, our property level acquisitions yielded 7.9%, it's really reflective of investment grade assets accounting for 22% of the total volume. We would expect our near-term quarterly average cap rates to be a bit closer to the 7.25% rates we have communicated to the market.","Thomas Lewis","Thanks, John. John likes to use the term to get our fair share. I would prefer us giving our disproportionate fair share. Either way, we are pleased with the start here for the year and very pleased where spreads are in the marketplace. It's a very good time due to acquire. Obviously, the recent acquisitions have certainly contributed to our revenue earnings and dividend growth, and that is very visible in the numbers here in the first quarter. But the other thing we are doing, they also and equally important to have, continued to help us adjust the makeup of our portfolio where we are focused on moving the portfolio up the credit curve and obviously we have made very good progress on that throughout this quarter, with investment grade tenants now making up around 35% of the portfolio.","As I talked to it bit about last quarter, over the last 36 months or so, we have now acquired about $6.2 billion of property including RT. About $3.7 billion of that is in retail and really pointed towards sectors that we think should continue to do well in what we anticipate is a somewhat more sluggish retail environment over the next 15-20 years than it had been in the past. And so we are really happy to get that invested and focused in the areas we want.","About $2.5 billion of what we acquired are in areas outside of retail that we think will do well for us, all with investment grade tenants. And of that total $6.2 billion, about $3.9 billion or 63% of what we acquired over the last 36 months have been with investment grade tenants. And what's interesting is a good measure of the rest of the tenants and acquisitions while not investment grade, are also further up the credit curve than the average in the portfolio just a few years ago and we are pleased with that. It's kind of interesting to watch that move and I will share some statistics with you.","If we go back and really look at having set out and thought that we should do this from 2008 and really started executing it in 2010. If you look in 2008, our top 15 tenants did 54.3% of our revenue. Their average [DAR] score, and the [DAR] score is our credit score, that approximated credit score similar to what the rating agencies would do. So the average [DAR] score on our scale is about 6.92, which would equate to a single B plus or Double B minus credit rating. And also none of the top 15 tenants had investment grade ratings.","Having undertaken this project starting three years ago, today the top 15 are down to 42.6% of our revenue. The average [DAR] credit score is up to 11.67. That approximates to approximately to a triple B minus credit rating for the tenants and six of the top 15 carry investment grade rating. So, really most of the work has been done in the last three years. But looking out, it was 2008 we have gone from 54.3% of revenue to 42.6%. The DAR score is 6.92 to 11.67 and we are now up to where six of our top 15 tenants are investment grade. And that\u2019s over really just about four years of activity. And we anticipate that trend will continue in that what we are trying to accomplish.","I think the other thing about, that\u2019s important to us is, how we paid for the acquisitions over the last three years. We did issue about $1.2 billion investment grade notes, most long-term at very good rates. As Paul mentioned, we have assumed some mortgages in the portfolio as we have taken over that we intend to pay off as quickly as we can. And we have done in that period about $162 million of property sales. More important to us is issuing a little over $400 million in perpetual preferred. And then we have issued equity in the last three years or so, six times and generated about $3.7 billion in gross proceeds. So about $6.24 billion in capital overall, of which $4 billion was common and\/or preferred. And as we all live here in this very low interest rate environment, I think we want to remember that these rates there\u2019s a possibility they won\u2019t persist for ever and be mindful of where they could go, what funding costs could be and what has to be rolled over. So getting a lot of preferred in the equity done has been very positive and we intend to keep the balance sheet in really good shape that may even modestly delever from here on a bit to keep us in really good position.","Relative to capital, we\u2019re in very good shape. As Paul mentioned, there\u2019s plenty of dry powder to execute on the acquisitions as they present themselves. Raising a net $755 million in equity a few weeks ago was very helpful to make sure the $1 billion credit line with the $500 million [quoting] was available. And so now we\u2019re in very good shape there.","Capital obviously is extremely attractively priced and spreads are very wide. So I really think that we\u2019re in great shape. I would note that we\u2019re particularly pleased watching how the equity has performed here in recent weeks. If you think about it, we\u2019ve put about $2.8 billion of equity into the market in the last 90 days between our T and the offering. And so for the equity to perform this way I think it\u2019s fair to say the market seems to have absorbed it fairly well and we have good access.","Earnings as Paul mentioned, normalized FFO at $0.61, up 32%. That\u2019s a percentage number we haven\u2019t seen before. Same thing with FFO at $0.60, up 20%. Relative to the guidance, we are staying with our previous guidance for now. We think April at this point we feel very good about all facets of the operations and very comfortable with the primary drivers to achieving the guidance which is as John mentioned $550 million in acquisitions and we think it will easily hit that and likely exceed it. But for now we\u2019ll stay where we are and revisit the numbers over the next quarter. So things on hold. That puts normalized FFO for the year at $2.32 to $2.38 which is around 15% to 28% growth and AFFO at $2.33 to $2.39 which is 13% to 16% growth.","I\u2019ll finish with dividends. We remain optimistic that we\u2019ll be able to continue to increase the dividend. Obviously had nice movement in that in the first quarter as Paul mentioned and we look forward to have additional increases over the year.","And with that, Tager, if you\u2019ll come back and help us with questions we\u2019d appreciate it. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Please come ahead, sir.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","John, if we can go back to your previous comment of I guess acquisitions [since] you\u2019re hanging that, let\u2019s call it 7.25% range. What was the driver of such a higher cap rate in the first quarter?","John Case","Yeah. It was primarily the percentage of non-investment grade assets we closed. We closed 22% in investment grade which was a bit lower than we had been closing in the previous quarters and certainly 64% in investment grade investments we did in 2012. So that\u2019s the main driver, Manny.","Thomas Lewis","Yeah. There was one transaction we did in the first quarter with a tenant we like a great deal and it had a very attractive yield for what is a non-rated company. But if they were rated it would certainly be considered investment grade. So we were able to secure a good deal there and it just happened to be where what came in this quarter versus what may come in next quarter.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","And then maybe Tom you could tell us a little bit more about how competition has been split between the investment grade product and maybe the stuff that looks less perfect on paper but at the end of the day is all good property.","Thomas Lewis","You mean the transaction flow that\u2019s come in the door?","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","And maybe just the competitors that are looking at those types of assets.","John Case","I\u2019ll take that Manny. We\u2019re seeing a fairly broad group of competitors on both sides. I would say there are a bit more on the traditional retail product on the institutional larger buyers than there are on the non-retail product. And on the investment grade side, there\u2019s good competition out there, but primarily from the higher quality companies with lower capital cost that can pursue this type of product. So it's probably not quite as extensive as on the non-investment grade. Is that what you were looking for?","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","Yeah, perfect.","John Case","And there is plenty of people looking to buy properties in both sectors, Manny.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","And maybe just to dig in a little bit deeper on what you were saying earlier, Tom, that it sounds like you have kind of stuck to you guns in the retail space, though I guess [RT] was the biggest mix of retail and non-retail. What can we expect for the rest of the year? Are you guys kind of literally going to look at things just on what comes through or is there a goal to diversify more out of retail?","Thomas Lewis","You know it's, we are willing to do either, what we are really focused on is taking a look at the retailers and the consumer they serve. And it's discretionary goods and services or what they sell and there target markets better be the upper middle income or the upper income, because it it's lower middle or lower, we don\u2019t want to buy it. So focus there. And then on the non-discretionary type goods and services, if that\u2019s what the retailer is selling then we are pretty good at the upper and middle income, but if it's lower we want to make sure that there is very deep value proposition and that\u2019s why we have gotten into the Club Stores and Dollar Stores and others. And that is a big focus when we are in retail.","And then generically moving up the credit curve, and in retail there are investment grade credits but there is a limited number. And so to get the portfolio up to credit curve, we are more than willing to look outside of retail. But it really has to be the Fortune 500, maybe Fortune 1000 and investment grade and what we think is property that they would consider it very very important to their business. So whether it comes in an either basket, we don\u2019t really mind. And we are happy to have both sides expand a little more so if retail went up a little bit, it wouldn\u2019t bother us as long as it was hit right where we wanted to go and generally up the curve. But we would be happy if retail, which I think in the quarter was around 79, if that falls to 75 or 4, or 3 or 2, that\u2019s fine too. But I don\u2019t have a numerical target on either one of those. It's really just those boxed we are trying to hit in terms of what we want to acquire and what we want to stay away from.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Joshua Barber with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus","Quick one, can you tell us what the disposition cap rate was on your assets during the quarter?","John Case","That is a great question and let me see if I have that sitting here in front of me, which I may or may not have. Well, for the year, Manny, our estimate for call it a 100 million plus, it's going to be 8.75%, if that\u2019s okay.","Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus","Do you know what it was in the quarter?","Thomas Lewis","Disposition cap. No, we have got it here, I am sorry. It was a little, actually lower than what we were planning for the year. I do know that because the one larger multi-tenant sale was substantially lower than that. Do you remember the cap rate on the transaction? Yeah, it was like a 7.5, and that was a big piece of it. So I would guess it is probably is closer to the 7-7.5 range but we will try to....","Paul Meurer","I think we will do better than the 7.5, we tend to model that conservatively depending on what we chose to sell later in the year.","Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Maybe there is a broader question, but you guys have been very clear over the last few that you are trying to minimize the retail and get more investment grade, get slightly different property types. Is that a trend that you expect to [give in] or do you think that there will be some other move that you would like to make to really reshape the portfolio over the next couple of years?","Thomas Lewis","Yeah, I do think we will continue doing what we are doing. And as I said in the last question, we were happy to be in retail and we haven\u2019t moved away from it and we are happy to buy. We are just going to be more particular in terms of who the tenants are, who they serve and what their balance sheet looks like. And so if we think they are investment grade or close so there is not a big refinance risk when interest rates go up, we are happy to do it. And as long as we are staying away from consumer discretionary to just kind of lower income is who they market to, then we are happy to do it. And we would be just (inaudible) retail space right where it is.","However, we are also focused on generically moving up the curve. And so if it's out to do that, we are happy to do it. We don\u2019t have a target. It's right now 78 or 79, 21-22 is the mix, and over the course of the year if I had to guess, we will probably see a little more outside of retail, but we\u2019re probably in the year where retail is still over 70% of the portfolio.","Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus","Last question. When you\u2019re looking at some larger scale acquisitions, given that you have significantly [priced] your enterprise value than you have in the past, do you think you have a little bit more room today to take on secure debt from another company, from another portfolio? Would you have a little bit more ability to do that or would that be something that you just don\u2019t want to risk the balance sheet on?","Thomas Lewis","We have done that. We\u2019ve got over $700 million of secured debt naturally come from buying portfolio. So we\u2019re willing to do it. But when we do it we try and pay off anything we can that doesn\u2019t have significant prepayment penalties and is an economic payoff. And then we will even place if there\u2019s one, two, three, four year debt and see and pay that off as soon as we can. So it is our preference not to have any secured debt, but given size to buy portfolios I think that that will be the case from time to time. But it\u2019s going to remain a very small part of our balance sheet. And it is something we could consider, but as soon as we get it on the books the purpose is get it off.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Robert W. Baird. Please come ahead, sir.","Tom Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co.","I\u2019m just standing in for Paula. I just wanted to follow up on an earlier question about the competition. I know you guys talked about competition across the credit spectrum already, but are you seeing increased competition in certain industries relative to other industries that you\u2019re looking at acquiring?","John Case","Not really. There\u2019s pretty strong competition across the board and we\u2019re not really seeing it vary by the industry of the tenant.","Thomas Lewis","Yeah. There\u2019s enough people that are broad in terms of what they\u2019ll look at, whether it\u2019s investment grade or non-investment grade, but I don\u2019t think there are any sectors that are just standing there with gaping holes with nobody investing in them. And we look through all the industries we\u2019re in. we buy convenience stores. Other people do. We buy theatres. Other people do and you can go right across it. We\u2019re not buying casual dining, sit down dinner house restaurants, but other people are. So the fact we\u2019re out of that doesn\u2019t mean I think there\u2019s a gaping hole. It\u2019s competitive throughout. The performance of the net lease companies obviously has been relatively good for most of just the last few years and with the demand for yields, both institutionally and retail, given the yield characteristics in that lease it\u2019s pretty much across the board everywhere. We\u2019re fortunate that we have done this a long time. We have the experience and size and so the deal flow has been equally good. But it\u2019s competitive all the way across.","Tom Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co.","And then secondly, I just wanted to hone in again on the disposition guidance. I know you mentioned $100 million plus. In your comments you said well over $100 million potentially and it could accelerate through the year. Could you ballpark that as maybe $100 to $150 or $100 to $200? How much of a disposition pipeline or backlog do you guys have that you\u2019re trying to get through?","Thomas Lewis","That\u2019s a good question and let me take a little time here and give some clarity how we look at it. First the number of saying 75 to 100 and that\u2019s up from 50, it was up from 25 or so the year before. So I now would be surprised if we didn\u2019t hit over 100, but I don\u2019t have this backlog of stuff that I really feel I need to get out because I\u2019m very much worried about it. The objective is just generally sell if it will increase the cash flow, if it materially increases credit quality or if it reduces concentration. Bu the primary area is where we\u2019ve gone through the portfolio really parsed it and seen where we see risks. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to sell and we originally targeted, if you recall I spent some time on a previous call and maybe it\u2019s a good time to talk a little bit of that now, focusing around what we\u2019re trying to do and changing the portfolio.","I think you know that will do it quick and then related to because of that we look at dispositions. As I mentioned, we\u2019re trying to go up the credit curve and really trying to hit retailers that hit the consumers in certain way and stay away from the rest of them. That\u2019s just a function of how we see the economy going forward and interest rates. A few years ago, what we did is we sat down and reenter the whole portfolio and it was 67 tenants that do 83% of revenue. And we rerated all the industries based on our views and then the consumer they serve. And then there were 24 different metrics which were a lot of debt, fixed charge coverage and margin and the big part of it though was saying if they had to refinance the whole balance sheet and permanent financing costs were 300 basis points higher, what it would look like, and then 600 basis points higher. And then we model the perfect storm which is revenues down, margins tightened and then interest rates up by 600 basis points. And when we finished, we really dropped everything in the four categories. And we had a kind of green color code which is strong buy, that was 23% of our revenues were generated by tenants who did that. Yellow, which was buy, was 21% of revenue. Red, which was hold, was 16% of revenue. And then kind of black, and this is for retailers who are in 23% of the revenue, and that\u2019s kind of sell.","And so we looked at that and said, okay, we want to materially change the composition of the portfolio. And starting three years ago, the easiest way to do that is acquisitions. And when you do it with acquisitions, there is a side benefit and that is, it increases your earnings and your dividends materially. So that really was the focus. And so we drove in and said, as I talked about a couple of times now, consumer non-discretionary, the value propositions. Consumer discretionary, making sure it's low price point in ticket and going up the credit curve and outside of retail. And the result, we bought the $6.2 billion, it's a 120 different tenants, 41 industries. 60% of it was retail, 40% wasn\u2019t. But 63% of everything we bought in the last three years was investment grade.","And so that took investment grade from zero to about 35% and it really changed the portfolio. The property sales program is the other way to do it. And if you take what was 23% of revenues that comes from retailers that are rated black or sell, that\u2019s the first step. But the second step is then, we don\u2019t own their bonds and stock, we own their property. So we need to look at the individual properties we own and we want to look at their profitability to see how big the margin of safety is. And that might cause us to want to keep the property even though we are not particularly enamored with that particular retail and the area they are in. And then we want to look at if the rent on the property is above or below market. And if it's above, see where the risk is and if it's below, if there is an opportunity to capture rent if it came off lease.","And then we will want to probably keep the rest, even though the retailer might be rated down in that area. So initially, we came up with a list of 190 million of property sales that we wanted to make that we thought would make a material dent in reducing the risk of our existing portfolio coupled with a pretty large acquisition pipeline. Today we have sold 162 million of that 190. So I do have a list there. And then we will move further into kind of black or so rated tenant but with some better properties. And at that point we may just move into the red a little bit. So there I don\u2019t have this pressing, pressing need. And if you combined the sales and the acquisitions -- you want to grab a pen, these might be interesting numbers.","In 2011 when we reentered the portfolio, it was 67 tenants that did 83% of our revenue. And I mentioned a minute ago, 22.8% were in the green strong buy. 21.4% were in the yellow buy. 15.9% were in the red hold. And then we have 22.9% of our revenue came from people at black, sell. Now roll forward to be in the first quarter, and it's now 118 tenants that make up 87.2% of our revenue that are in these numbers. And we now have, in the strong buy green category, 58 tenants that now do 42.7% of our revenue. So we are from, in that category, up from 22.8% of revenue to 42.7%. In the yellow we have got 21 tenants that are 21.9% of revenue. So that\u2019s up a bit. In the red or hold, we have moved to 25 tenants that are only 9.8% of revenues. So we have gone from 59% to 9.8% there. And then in the black that was 22.9% of the portfolio, is down to 12.8%, and its only 14 tenants.","And I think of one individual tenant that\u2019s chunky in that 12.8%. And in that one we went through and did an analysis at property level and found that we had properties where the rents were above market and the cash flow coverages were okay and we have sold those. We had some where the rent were about at market and the cash flow coverage were just okay and we have sold those. But in that particular tenant there was just a lot of property where the cash flow coverage was modest but the rent substantially below market. We actually think there is a recapture there, so we won't sell those. But that\u2019s kind of it. I mean we can make more progress on this in the acquisition side and we also increase earnings and dividends and we have done a lot of what we were really worried about on the sales. So I am going to plug it at $100 to $125 million and then if over the course of the year we decide to do a little more we\u2019ll communicate that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities","The same-store growth you highlighted was 1.5% in the quarter. It\u2019s historically only been about 1%, maybe a little bit better than that. Is this a rate we should expect the rest of the year and what do you contribute this a little bit above the average growth to?","Thomas Lewis","It\u2019s funny. I think it was a little above average and if you want a run rate I think 1% is a good one to use. Interestingly enough if you go back a few years ago in the recession you\u2019ll recall we had a few tenants out of our very large group of tenants that went through some chapter 11s and one of the things we did when we set some rents lower for them, we were also to build in some recapture if their business rebounded and their business has now rebounded and so strangely enough a good part of that comes from the restaurant industry and it comes from tenants that there was a problem and their rent accelerated over the last few months as their business was better and our leases had been changed to capture part of that. But we think going forward and particularly with the RT coming into the numbers over time, I think 1% is a good run rate.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities","And then you guided for 7.25% for 2013 acquisitions. And the average lease term was up around 14 years in the quarter. What\u2019s the fair lease term average for the remainder of the year? You think it will be that long or closer to the in-place average of about 11?","John Case","I think it could range from 11 up to 15, 16, right in there. It\u2019s hard to tell at this point. But they are all pretty much initial terms above 10. You see some 20. You see a fair amount of 15. It just depends on how much you end up doing at each lease side.","Thomas Lewis","And then it could be impacted if one of the larger transactions come through and that can change the cap rate up or down depending on who the tenant is. Those numbers John gave you are the ones that we\u2019re using for modeling.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities","And just to stay on that theme, if a good portfolio of assets was presented to you with an investment grade tenant roster, would you deemed an attractive price, what would be the shortest average lease time you would consider?","Thomas Lewis","Interesting. I would never say never and I think that\u2019s smart to do. But when you get inside of 10 years it starts growing some concern from us and you would have to be able to get in and establish that the rents were at or substantially below market before you want to go much inside 10 years I think. And that\u2019s in a chunky one or two tenant acquisitions something that could be done, but in a broad M&A type situation it becomes a bit more challenging. So on any granular acquisition 10 years is where we just draw the line and if it was an M&A situation we\u2019d like to think 10 years subject to review of where rents are verse market.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities","That\u2019s helpful Tom. And Paul, I assume you used a line to meet your March debt maturity?","Paul Meurer","That\u2019s correct.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities","Is that factored into guidance and how long would you assume if that would sit there and how long is that factored in and I guess how much is factored in the guidance?","Paul Meurer","Well, that was factored in the guidance. We just planned since it was only $100 million to do it on the line and then let the line balance run up a bit before we would consider a more permanent financing activity in concert with the acquisition deal flow run rate and what happens there. So we sit here today in very good shape in terms of what that line balance is and no imminent capital needs. But that would really at this point be dependent upon the acquisition deal flow and when that stuff closes.","Thomas Lewis","We also when we were looking at whatever financing we do next and plugging in what it would cost us, tried to use a rate substantially higher than where debt is sitting today and then that gives us the option of doing equity preferred without materially moving the model. And if we decided to do debt it would have an impact.","Paul Meurer","Yes. We basically modeled it where we could do anything if you will at that time, equity preferred or debt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of [Daniel Dowling with Landenberg Dowling]. Please go ahead, sir.","Unidentified Analyst","Just real quick on the 7.9% acquisition cap rate. Is that (inaudible) cash?","Paul Meurer","Yeah.","Unidentified Analyst","So on a GAAP basis, what would that be?","Thomas Lewis","More.","Paul Meurer","It would be probably 8.10%, in that area.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then what is the interest rate -- what is the average interest rate on the 700 million that you guys (inaudible) that ARCT?","John Case","That\u2019s part ARCT and parts other we have taken.","Unidentified Analyst","Right. So the total portfolio of mortgage is 729 million then?","John Case","Yeah. As a weighted average and straight right now of 5.4%.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. All right. And then as we look at kind of the rent increases or decreases, I guess you could say, on the subsequent expirations versus your initial lease expirations. Who should we look at that, would you expect to see higher rent growth on the initial expirations and then less on the subsequent or does it...?","John Case","We do better on the subsequent then we do on the initial. And traditionally, the subsequent has done very well and is up and the initial is down. Roll overs, this year so far and the ones we have done are up about 3.3%. Modeling for the year will kind of just assuming that they will be pretty much flat. Traditionally, and this gets back very historical, we had rolled down. And the roll down, I think back in 2002, was about 24% in that peak. And one of the things that we did, started seeing in the mid-90s, is that roll down at the end of the lease was really starting to hit us, and this is in the mind-90s. And we dramatically changed how we acquire. Previous to that, everything we acquired was a new store, and we didn\u2019t have cash flow coverages, and they were all less than investment grade. And we found they did pretty well throughout the lease, but at the end of the lease if we bought a bunch of new stores, about a third of them were below average, a third average and a third above.","So we totally changed our underwriting in retail to pre-select those with high cash flow coverage and profits. So we would not preselect the one-third that were underperformers. So over the years what's happened is the burn that we get in lease rollover keeps declining pretty substantially. And yet the portfolio that\u2019s rolling over is stuff that was bought still quite a bit ago, particularly the subsequent. So the last year there was a roll down of about 4%. And so far this year it's up 3% and we are thinking it will be closer to zero. And I think that\u2019s a good way to think of it.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. I appreciate that. And then just two quick housekeeping items. What is the amortization of net mortgage premiums that you guys recognize in the AFFO line? What's the run rate there, (inaudible)?","Paul Meurer","Yeah, obviously, that\u2019s associated with any portion of the mortgages that we assume that are above market. And the projections for the year is about $9.2 million. You see the quarterly amount, just trying to grab the AFFO page, indicated in here, just under $2 million that occurred in the quarter. But the projections for the year, right now based on the mortgages that we currently own is about $9.2 million. And that is an amount that we reduced from AFFO, in order to arrive a real bottom line cash flow amount for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And the capitalized interest in the quarter?","Paul Meurer","That\u2019s a pretty small number. I don\u2019t really have that handy. You don\u2019t mean capital expenditures?","Unidentified Analyst","No, no, just capitalized interest. I was just curious if you guys are doing any, funding up developments and what not. I know you have done that back in the past, so.","Thomas Lewis","We are, and I don\u2019t know, John, if you have the number handy, but we definitely have some development commitments underway. But it's a pretty small amount. And total for the currently...","John Case","Let me give those numbers, Tom.","Paul Meurer","Yeah, in the first quarter of our activity, 11 million of that was in development funding and funding of expansions on existing assets. And we have $21 million in development funding or banking. So it's a pretty small number relative to our overall size. But I don\u2019t have the capitalized interest associated with that.","Thomas Lewis","And (inaudible) those numbers and is not looking for capitalized interest but thinking about development risk. All of those are on existing properties where a lease has been placed so there is no lease-up risk on that. It's just expansions or we bought the land and we are funding the development, but we have the lease in place from the tenant already.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar. Please go ahead, sir.","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","Just a quick one on property site distribution. I know that healthcare is now on the roster. It\u2019s just under 2% of revenues. I just wonder if you could explain a bit more about what that is and then in general if you could talk about your attitude toward triple that lease healthcare and whether or not you expect that to be an area that grows in the portfolio.","Thomas Lewis","Most of that came from the RT acquisitions. The tenants there are DaVita which most people know is one of the largest in the dialysis area an also Fresenius. There\u2019s also a few express scripts properties, actually a few leased to GE Healthcare and then like four MOBs I believe they are that are at the Saint Joseph\u2019s. So it\u2019s fairly limited. It is not an area we\u2019re targeting. If it grows it would surprise me as of now. I guess it could a little bit. But those are mostly that came out of that area and I don\u2019t think I have a formal attitude towards it outside that it\u2019s an area and an industry that is very well financed by some very smart folks. And if we find something at the margin time but it\u2019s not anything we\u2019re pointing to.","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","And then just wanted to see if you could update us on rent escalators related to inflation across your portfolio. I know a few years back you guys were trying to get more of those written into your leases. I was wondering if you could tell us what percentage the portfolio now has escalators specifically related to something like CPI and whether or not you have better success today than you did in the past on new sale lease back transactions, getting something like that written into the initial leases.","Thomas Lewis","Today the number is 15.61% of like real inflation percentage sale, that type of stuff going into it. And that\u2019s up substantially from a few years ago and I would give us a C to D grade at best in getting that done. It is extraordinarily difficult. It is not the norm in the industry and is really an out wire and is probably one of the more frustrating things in the management of the business and something that we really continue to work on. And as we drop back into a strategic planning mode which we\u2019re going to do this year, that is something that we\u2019re really going to think about where we could go to try and accomplish that. But today in the net lease business it\u2019s C&O. it\u2019s the fountain of youth that comes daily on but nobody ever finds. And I really think that\u2019s the case and you have to really parse how you ask the question because if you say do you have CPI accelerators in your leases? Well yeah. It would be a massive number for us, but they\u2019re capped. So what they really are is fixed increases. So, it really does need to be asked, but it\u2019s unrestricted and that\u2019s about 15.6% for us and very unusual to get.","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","And then just last question with regards to the assets for divestiture. I know you had an industrial property in there I guess you said this quarter. Going forward, is it reasonable to assume that those are pretty much going to be all retail or are there any other property sectors that you guys have invested in more recently that have properties that are falling into that bucket for divestiture?","Thomas Lewis","I think the bucket is going to be retail and I think it\u2019s going to be the ones that have fallen down in that category. And tenants that are very levered and it will probably be dominated by restaurants and there may be some convenience stores and then a smattering of other things.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Right now about a third of your portfolio is investment grade and that\u2019s obviously up substantially over the last couple of years. As we listen to the call, Tom, I\u2019m wondering, the ultimate goal clearly is 100% investment grade even though you keep moving up the investment grade curve and during the quarter you had below one third investment grade tenants come up. And I\u2019m wondering, has big move in investment grade change to the portfolio occurred and 35% is about right for the total? Or is there much more to go from this point?","Thomas Lewis","I hope it hasn\u2019t occurred and I hope there is much more to go because I\u2019d like that number to be substantially higher. But I want to modify it in that it\u2019s not just buying investment to buy investment grade. The reason we want to do it, is over the last 30 years the tenures quite frankly have just gone from 15% to 1.7% when I looked at it this morning. And that has made a lot of very levered business strategies that involve a lot of financial engineering work. And should interest rates go up, which were really low, I want to focus on companies that would really have trouble refinancing their balance sheet.","Now that means generally investment grade companies are going to be less impacted. There are tenants who are not investment grade. Who don\u2019t have a lot of debt but they are not investment or a even a [shallow] rating might be less than investment grade because of their size. But if they are size and they don\u2019t have big refinance risk exposure and the customer they serve doesn\u2019t, then still interests us very much. Even though they are not investment grade because we are really for that lack of risk relative to refinance. However, the bigger the entity, the lower the default rate. The rating agencies will tell you, all your research tells us that. But I don\u2019t want to say always, but I would like it to continue to increase. But we are happy to have some of the tenants not being investment grade.","But even those that aren\u2019t, I will tell you, have moved up the curve where they are closer to investment grade substantially then they were a number of years ago. Much less of the highly levered private equity M&A type of stuff.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Good. I got you. That makes sense. Then on the disposition just for a moment. How much of the portfolio is double net, non-triple net, maybe multi-tenants which I assume aren\u2019t as attractive, that fall in not so much into a tenant category but fall into a tight category that you would want to divest. Is that part of the strategy as well?","Thomas Lewis","Yeah, I mean you know the industrial property that we sold during the quarter was like 400,00 square feet with 375 small tenants. And so you start looking at a weak economic environment, you would worry there. But we are kind of pretty much done with that. We have sold most of what we had there. The double net that we might have is actually more up the credit curve with people and it's just that it\u2019s 2.5 net where you may have some responsibility with it. But those aren\u2019t things that we are really looking to get out of. We are looking at those when we underwrite them relative to the cap rate we get and try and amortize some type of expense ratio for them, even if the expenses are lumpy.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Obviously, so you didn\u2019t get multitenant from RT that you are trying to get rid off?","Thomas Lewis","No. No, that portfolio was almost all pretty straight net lease. You know if we get a bunch of grocery anchor centers, we will think about (inaudible).","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Yeah, I got you. Okay. And then on the G&A front, it sounds like you are just annualizing this quarter pretty much for the year, which means that you have done the hiring and the additional infrastructure that you need to support things like RT. Is that true? So you are pretty much done with that sort of aspect of business?","John Case","Well, yeah. That\u2019s part of the answer, and then the other part is we did have some G&A reduction because some of the employees who were associated with the large multi-tenant asset we sold, effects that employee count if you will. So that kind of offset the number a little bit but got ahead in the last one (inaudible).","Thomas Lewis","Yeah. And I will tell you one of the reasons I don\u2019t want to move the guidance right now, we feel very comfortable where it is, is I think it could get better but I also think we may do some more G&A this year. We are kind of doing a project in house from looking at, if the company was twice as large, what it would need to look like, how would reporting look, what would people be doing. And then we have identified a number of areas where we want to add staff and expertise. And there's probably a number of people and acquisitions where we are going to do that. A number of people in research, we want to do that. There has been some movement internally, so we need to do that portfolio management. And we will have a, I think a pretty good increase in employee count during the course of this year. We just kind of earned the midst of our recruiting and the undergrad out there and we will probably do a much bigger class this year then we have done in the past. So we have grown substantially and I think we need to add a few people for that even though this addition to the RT is very efficient, but we also want to plan for growth. And so we are going to need, I think a couple of more executives around here and a good group of professionals added in. So there will be more.","Paul Meurer","And most of that won't affect the 2013 estimate too much, Rich. But it will certainly increase the annualized run rate as we add in people over the course of the year on a go forward basis.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, I got you. So that\u2019s all in the $45 million. So it sounds good. The last thing, Paul, the other income line items was, I think, substantially higher. What was that exactly?","Paul Meurer","That\u2019s always a mixed bag of interest income on cash if we do a capital raise and the cash sits around for a few days or a week if you will. Interest income in that sense also evenness in takings which are a normal part of the portfolio manager process. So if you have a situation where there\u2019s an eminent domain or a portion of your parking lot, sometimes it doesn\u2019t mean it affects the viability of the asset itself. It actually ends up being pretty positive proceeds that we receive in this situation. So that\u2019s all that 1.4 is is a mixed bag of those items if you will. Nothing different about the normal business.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","So that goes back down I assume most likely in 2Q?","Paul Meurer","Correct. I don\u2019t think 1.4 million is an appropriate run rate. No.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer portion of the Realty Income conference call. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis for concluding remarks. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas Lewis","Thank you everybody for joining us for this.

Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","During this conference, we will make statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue.","I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.","Sumit Roy","Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. We are pleased to complete another solid quarter on a very solid first half of 2019. During the quarter, we invested approximately 1.1 billion in high quality real estate at investment spreads well above our historical average. Which brings us to $1.6 billion invested during the first half of the year. Of the 1.1 billion invested during the quarter, $549 million or approximately 434 million British pounds was invested in the United Kingdom through a sale leaseback transaction with Sainsbury's. We plan to continue to grow our international platform as we are well positioned to capitalize on a significant addressable market in the UK, and mainland Europe. Given our portable size, scale, and cost of capital advantages, we believe we have a unique ability to execute sizable portfolio transactions with best in class operators. We look forward to further developing relationships with other industry leaders like Sainsbury's, as we expand our international platform.","To finance our robust investment activity. We raised $1.9 billion of attractively priced capital during the quarter, including $1 billion of equity. We entered the second half of 2019 very well positioned with virtually full availability on our $3 billion line and a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.4 times. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property ties, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow.","At quarter end, our properties were leased 265 commercial tenants in 49 different industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico, and the UK. 82.5% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial property at nearly 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.8% of rental revenue. Convenience Store remains our largest industry at 11.9% of rental revenue.","Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and our low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent US retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.","We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio or our retail properties is 2.8 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list at 1.65% of rent is relatively consistent with our levels of the last few years. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, flat versus the prior quarter. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2019.","During the quarter, we re-leased 86 properties recapturing 100.4% of the expiring rent. During the first half of 2019, we re-leased 157 properties, recapturing 102.2% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,000 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.","Our same-store rental revenue increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.5% for the first half of the year. Our projected runway for 2019 continues to be approximately 1%. Approximately 86% of our leases have contractual rent increases.","Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Paul Meurer","Thanks Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursements, was 5.3% for the quarter and 4.9% year to date, both of which were below comparable year-ago periods. Consistent with prior years, G&A tends to be slightly higher in the first half of the year due to the timing of stock vesting and costs associated with our annual meeting and proxy. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and expect our G&A margin to remain below 5% in 2019.","Our non-reimbursable property expenses as percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursements, was 1.4% for the quarter and 1.3% year to date, which is better than our full-year expectation in a 1.5% to 1.75% range. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was 82 cents per share for the quarter, which represents a 2.5% increase","Briefly turning to the balance sheet and we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure, and we remain one of only a few REITs with at least AA ratings. As Sumit mentioned during the second quarter, we raised approximately $1.9 billion of favorable price long-term capital to fund our acquisition activity. In May, we issued 315 million of sterling denominated 15-year senior unsecured notes via private placement at a yield of 2.73%. Proceeds from the offering allowed us to partially finance the acquisition of the Sainsbury's portfolio in the UK. We were pleased with the pricing and high quality order book for our first ever private offering. And we very much appreciate the support of the investors who participated. The sterling denominated offering allowed us to finance the Sainsbury's transaction with a natural currency hedge, while taking advantage of low interest rates abroad.","In June, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at a yield of 3.33%. The offering allowed us to term out borrowing on our revolving credit facility and the bonds fit nicely in our debt maturity schedule as we have no other maturities in 2029.","During the second quarter, we issued approximately $1 billion of common equity through a combination of overnight and ATM offerings. And thus we finished the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.4 times and virtually full availability of our $3 billion revolver. Our fixed-charge coverage remains healthy at 4.4 times, and the weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 8.8 years, which closely tracks our weighted average remaining lease term.","Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $18 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter with just over $300 million of debt, maturing in both 2020 and 2021. So, in summary, our balance sheets in great shape, we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics, and excellent liquidity.","And now, let me turn the call back over to Sumit.","Sumit Roy","Thanks, Paul. During the second quarter of 2019, we invested approximately 1.1 billion in 102 properties located in 28 states and the United Kingdom at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. On a total revenue basis, approximately 12% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 99% of their revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the more significant industries represented our UK grocery stores, theaters, and automotive services. We closed 20 discrete transactions in the second quarter, and approximately 86% of second quarter investment volume was sale leaseback transactions.","Of the 1.1 billion invested during the quarter, $546 million was invested domestically in 90 properties at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.9% and with weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. International investments during the quarter were $549 million or approximately 434 million pounds in 12 properties as at average initial cash cap rate of 5.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. All 12 International properties are leased to Sainsbury's, a top grocer in the UK.","Year-to-date 2019, we invested 1.6 billion US dollars in 199 properties located in 34 states and the United Kingdom at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.6 years. On a revenue basis, 80% [ph] of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 99% of the revenues are generated from retail and 1% are from industrial. Of the 45 independent transactions closed year-to-date, four transactions were above 50 million US. Approximately 74% of our year-to-date investment volume was sale leaseback transactions. Of the $1.6 billion invested year-to-date, nearly $1.1 billion was invested domestically in 187 properties at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.8% and with a weighted average lease term 15.9 years.","Transaction flow continues to remain healthy, as we sourced approximately $19.1 billion in the second quarter. Investment-grade opportunities represented 29% of the volume sourced for the second quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 34% were portfolios and 66% or approximately 12.6 billion were one-off assets. Of the $19.1 billion sourced during the quarter, $15.9 billion were domestic opportunities and $3.2 billion were international opportunities.","Year-to-date 2019, we have sourced approximately $30.8 billion in potential transactions. Of these opportunities, 41% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 59% or approximately $18 billion were one-off assets. Of the $1.1 billion in total acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 13% of the volume was one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates in the US were essentially unchanged in the second quarter. Investment-grade properties are trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties are trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.","Regarding cap rates in the United Kingdom for the types of assets we are targeting, investment-grade or implied investment-grade properties are trading from the low 4% to mid 5% cap rate range. Non-investment-grade properties are trading from 5% to low 7% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 290 basis points for domestic investments and 209 basis points for international investments, both of which were well above our historical average spreads.","We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less a nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our invested pipeline remains robust. And we remain the only publicly-traded net lease company that has the size, scale, and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Based on our robust investment pipeline, we continue to expect 2019 acquisition guidance at $2 billion to $2.5 billion","Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter, we sold 18 properties for net proceeds of $28.6 million at net cash cap rate of 7.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.9%. This brings us to 36 properties sold year-to-date for $50 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 6.8%. We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of non-strategic assets, recycling the sale proceeds into properties that benefit our investment parameters. We anticipate between 75 million and 100 million of dispositions in 2019.","In June, we increased the dividend for the 102nd time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents an approximately 3% increase over the year-ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 82.2% based on the midpoint of 2019 AFFO guidance. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994. growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in S&P high-yield dividend aristocrats index.","To wrap it up, we completed another strong quarter. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Our investment pipeline remains strong, and we are well positioned to pursue new opportunities for growth both domestically and internationally.","At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Looks like our first question will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.","Greg McGinniss","This is Greg McGinniss on for Nick. Sumit, based on some prior commentary, it seemed like acquisition -- an acquisition guidance range was possibly on the table for this year. How are you thinking about acquisition range today? Has the environment -- investment environment become more competitive with lower interest rates? And any color would be appreciated there.","Sumit Roy","Sure. As of today, we have obviously reaffirmed our acquisition guidance. If you look at the sourcing we've done year-to-date, it is at historic levels, especially if you just focus on the domestic side. We've done 27 billion US dollars of domestic sourcing, and it's through the end of June, which on a run rate basis is going to be far beyond the high 30 million that we have sourced historically. Yes, the market is competitive, but the cost of capital allows us to continue to win our share of deals, and we feel very comfortable about the pipeline that we have today and about the guidance range that we have shared with you.","Greg McGinniss","Okay. And just following up on some other guidance items. Paul, as you noted with your opening comments, property expenses have been lower than the full year range. On the opposite side, same-store rent growth have been higher. Should we take that to mean that there's going to be some slowdown in the back half of the year? Or how should we interpret first half results versus full year guidance?","Paul Meurer","No, I think both of those are running favorably. And we would probably lean towards both of those doing -- doing well the remainder of the year but not such that we thought it was prudent to make a specific change in that guidance at this time. But I certainly wouldn't -- wouldn't think of a downturn in either of those areas to normalize back at where our guidance is. We've been pleased with the same-store rent growth this year, partly related to just the timing of contractual rent bumps this year. But in addition, with property expenses running lower, we suspect both of those trends will continue through the remainder of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi.","Katy McConnell","Good morning, this is Katy McConnell on for Christy. Can you provide some color on the types of international deals that you're looking at or underwriting today? And how are you thinking about the rest of the year, as far as the mix between deals that you could potentially do in the US versus abroad?","Sumit Roy","The vast majority of the deals that we're going to be doing will be US focused, you know, and I touched -- to the previous person, I'd answer the question with regards to why we feel so optimistic about you know, the -- the deal flow here in the US, it's -- it's -- it has been at historical levels. With respect to the UK, we continue to see transactions and the volume that we have seen has exceeded our original underwriting. I'm not in a position today to tell you precisely the transactions we're going to be, you know, getting over the finish line. But suffice it to say that it wouldn't be, you know, out of the realm of possibility to do a few more transactions in the UK. ","You know, our goal when we first did the Sainsbury sale leaseback was to establish our footprint in the UK, to make sure that we had our processes in place. And having closed this transaction, closed the books in the second quarter with the financials, we feel very good about where we stand today. [Technical Difficulty] resourced in the UK, like I said was above [indiscernible] range is right around $2.5 billion, that's $900 million delta from where we are today. I would say the vast majority will still be US focused, but some of it will certainly be from the UK.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Kevin Egan","Hi, this is Kevin on for Vikram. Just a quick question for me. I know that the original underwriting of the Sainsbury transaction, I believe it was $1.30 what was going to be represented to be a British pound. I know now it's about $1.22, I know the vast majority of the 85% is hedged, but in terms of the remaining 15%, is there anything there that we should be thinking about?","Sumit Roy","No, because if you recall, the way we structured the transaction, the entire principal balance was 100% hedged and 85% of the cash flows that we are generating on an annual basis is also hedged. And keep in mind that, you know, off the financing, only 30% of the financing was equity based. We finance 70% of the transaction using domestic GDP denominated debt. So we feel very comfortable that, you know, the volatility that you see in the currency market has next to not zero but very, very limited impact on our cash flow statement. And the 15% that remains on hedge we are going to continue to keep it in the UK. And you know, you heard my previous answer. We have seen plenty of deals flow to be able to invest, reinvest those proceeds. So, you know, the volatility is going to have very little impact and zero cash flow impact.","Kevin Egan","Okay, so is it safe to assume then that the remaining 15% it's not hedged? Basically, just it is not repatriated [indiscernible] [00:21:49] going forward, you think?","Sumit Roy","Absolutely. That is absolutely going to be our strategy going forward.","Kevin Egan","Okay, and then just one last for me, I noticed there was a slight uptick in impairment, I think it was impairment charge of about 13 million. Can you give us any color on what that was about?","Paul Meurer","You'll see a few more impairments when you think about how much larger our company has gotten size of company, size of the asset, base, etc. So you'll -- you'll -- you'll have a little bit larger number there. But it's also related to what I would describe as more aggressive asset management approach on our part, to work through assets much more quickly, to the extent that we don't see a releasable opportunity or a -- an opportunity for redevelopment that we will, you know, sell something a little quicker, maybe then we wouldn't have passed and redeploy that capital. So kind of along those lines. Obviously, it's a non-cash impact to the company. And just one statistic to kind of give it some materiality context. And since 2012, it's only represented about 0.1% of our gross book value. So it's really not a significant issue for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Rob Stevenson with Janney Capital.","Rob Stevenson","Good afternoon, guys. Given the robust pricing on several industrial deals over the last few months and the amount of capital chasing those deals, have you guys thought about selling either part or all the industrial portfolio and redeploying that capital into higher yielding retail assets, given where your yields are on domestic retail?","Sumit Roy","We decided to go down this path of diversifying across asset types in 2010. It has held us in very good stead. Despite some of the, you know, higher cap rates you have on the retail side, I can tell you that some of the opportunities that we've been able to uncover on the industrial side has created tremendous value for the company. And, in fact, you know, a lot of which you see coming through what our asset management team is currently being doing. So, you know, our long term, you know, and we believe that the long-term value creation is -- is not necessarily going to be driven by trying to time markets and maximize IRRs. We believe we can maximize IRRs playing the long game. And as long as we hold the right industrial assets with the right tenants in the right markets, we will create similar if not superior value for the company. So, yes, we could -- we could sell a -- you know, our -- our entire industrial portfolio at incredibly aggressive cap rates, but that is not really our business strategy. ","Rob Stevenson","Okay, and then looking to Europe, main, how much of what you're looking at today and tomorrow are going to wind up being office industrial versus traditional retail. And are you guys going to need this to take up headcount over there and pick up G&A to accomplish what you want to get to?","Sumit Roy","I\u2019ll answer the last bit first. My focus has been to bring down our G&A from the run rate that you have seen in the company over the last couple of years, which has been right around 5%. And our goal for 2019 is to make sure that it is below 5%. So regardless of what we do, in terms of, you know, being able to right size the -- the team in the UK, to help manage UK and the rest of Europe, that is not going to change that objective for the company will not change. You are absolutely right that we are in the process of building out the team in the UK, I think I've already spoken about having one of our acquisition team members, a senior acquisition team member move to the UK to basically see the office there.","And we are in the process of supplementing that team with one additional person, that's going to be the scope initially. And the rest of the servicing, such as on the accounting side, etc. We felt like an outsourced model, at least today, is far better and more cost effective strategy than to sort of bring that in house. But the goal is there is going to be an inflection point, and that is going to be dictated by the assets that we continue to buy and the portfolio that we build. And where it makes sense, we will bring those functions in house. But the goal is not to do that day -- day one. It's to do it over time and let the portfolio dictate when that's going to occur.","Rob Stevenson","And then the -- the question about the mix in terms of Europe, in terms of retail versus office industrial? Are you targeting office industrial over there now?","Sumit Roy","Yeah, sorry, it's old age, forgetting parts of questions. Look, we've always said that we are predominantly a retail oriented company and we love the industrial product. Lon-term leases with tenants that we want to do business with. Those are primarily going to be the two asset types that we're going to continue to pursue. I'm not going to say no office. But office we have stated very clearly and unequivocally that here in the US, investing in office has not been a core strategy of ours. And, in fact, over time, our portfolio for office assets has dwindled. And so, I don't believe that that will change just because the geography has changed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets.","Brian Hawthorne","Hi, how does the volatile currency fluctuations impact your ability to make acquisitions? Is there a certain level that -- that starts to either slow or help you guys out?","Sumit Roy","Well, the trend that it's going certainly helps us. You know, the pound continues to depreciate vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar. And, you know, the value creation opportunities just continues to accrue to us. The question is, you know, what's the long game, but today, as long as your view on the tail risk of Brexit is not draconian and some of that gets mitigated by where you invest, i.e. non-discretionary operators, then I think, you know, and this is our -- our house view that it is a very propitious environment for us to continue to invest and create tremendous value for our shareholders. So, the current environment actually is, unfortunately, it's tough to say that, but from an economic perspective, it's the right environment for us to be investing in because we do have unprecedented spreads that we can sort of realize for our investments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.","John Massocca","Good afternoon, and good morning still in San Diego.","Sumit Roy","Good afternoon.","John Massocca","Just about. Yeah. Were all of the $3.2 billion of international transactions sourced in the quarter in the UK or any of the transactions in Western Europe?","Sumit Roy","Yeah, predominantly the UK, there was one transaction we saw in Spain, but the vast majority of that $3.2 billion was UK.","John Massocca","Okay and then could you maybe provide some color on the increase exposure to the theater industry and Regal in particular and if it was one individual transaction, what was the rough size of the transaction and what kind of maybe was the impact that had on your reported domestic acquisition cap rate?","Sumit Roy","I'll answer that last piece first. By and large theater transactions occur in the low to mid 7% cap rate range. So you can assume comfortably that this particular sale leaseback that we did was in that range. So, this was a sale leaseback that's Sinovel ran, and we were very comfortable with the 17 assets that we looked at. We looked at their profitability per screen, their sales per screen. We looked at the demos and this was right down the fairway for us in terms of what are the qualities that we look for in theater assets, and so the size of this was roughly $280 million, $290 million and like I said, these are precisely the type of assets that that we would have gone out and picked off on a one-off basis. But having it delivered to us as a portfolio by Cinema World. It was something that we really liked and we felt like it was priced appropriately and we were very happy with the transaction. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Thanks. And just to stay on the Regal, any specifics on the lease, maybe the term? And then any annual escalators tucked in there?","Sumit Roy","Yeah. I believe these were 15-year leases. We had annual escalators. We don't want to make it a precedent talk to talk about specific transactions, but you can assume that the cash flow coverages were not of where we typically see these assets. These were 15-year leases with annual growth and on pretty much all of the metrics that you would want to measure theaters, this was either at or superseding our hurdle rate and so right down the fairway really.","Todd Stender","Okay Pretty clean. Thanks, Sumit. And then Paul you did the debut offering. I guess the private placement on the UK at 15 years, but you've got the A-rating here. Is it-- to do the private placement, is that would you do first? Is there an order of operations and then the next offering is the public bond, you just have to grease the wheels, so to speak with investors over there? What would be teed up next?","Paul Meurer","Yeah, I mean, not necessarily. So what we did was we wanted to create a natural currency hedge. So we wanted to do predominantly debt financing for that purpose. And we looked at all the alternatives, whether that be a public bond offering, a private placement offering, mortgage debt and the private placement offering was the one that was most favorable in terms of the depth of that market, the size of what we could do, the flexibility with the maturity and then of course the pricing was excellent. And what was fascinating was, it was really the same investors that we know real, real well. US life insurance companies that we have a terrific relationship with on the unsecured public bond side here in the US and essentially we were talking to those same shops. So we were kind of an improved credit with them. They were again quite amenable to a maturity length that we wanted, which was the 15 year. We wanted to do that to match more so the lease length of course.","And the depth of that market we uncovered is quite significant. Longer term, could we consider public bond offering there entering that market in that fashion. That certainly feels like something we'd want to explore. I think we'd want to probably build up a little bit more of a local brand and commitment to the market before making that decision. But in the meantime, there is plenty of depth in the private placement side, the pricing is excellent and we\u2019re real pleased with how that went.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.","Chris Lucas","Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a quick one. Paul, you had noted that the same growth profile was impacted by, I guess, some timing on rent bumps. I guess just thinking about this over the longer haul, is the 1.5% rate that you guys are -- seem to be running at this year, is this something that we can expect going forward? Or is this more of an anomaly within the sort of more traditional 1% bump rate that you guys have generated historically?","Sumit Roy","Yeah, Paul's been kind in letting me answer that question, Chris. So forgive me. You know what happened in the second quarter and this is very straightforward. Quite a few of our leases don't have annual growth built into them. They have step growth, which could be every three years, every five years and that's typically how some of the leases are structured. And what we noticed in the second quarter was that of all -- if you were to compare it to second quarter of 2018, there were 15% more leases that had this step growth that just coincidentally happened to fall in the second quarter, which is what resulted in that 1.5%. And so now that they've had that growth in the second quarter of 2019, you're not going to see that the following year. And that's the reason why we continue to believe that, this year, yes, is it possible that it is slightly not at 1%? Yes, but our run rate within our portfolio, we have always said is right around 1%. And that's -- that continues to be the case.","Chris Lucas","Okay, great. Thank you, Sumit. And then I guess while I have you, on the portfolio pricing of the theaters, I guess, just more generally, your cap rates first quarter were sort of better than last year\u2019s. Certainly, the domestic cap rates this quarter were better than sort of last year's average, rates are down relative to last year. I guess, I'm just wondering, sort of, is it just purely just sort of the mix issue that you're dealing with this year versus last year? Or is there some value to portfolio pricing that you're seeing that maybe is being more predominant this year versus last year? I'm just trying to kind of get a understanding between last year\u2019s results and this year\u2019s?","Sumit Roy","Sure. Very good question, Chris. We don't see too much of a movement in the portfolio discount that we saw last year versus this year. The reason why you see higher cap rates, it's predominantly a question around the mix of assets, the type of tenants, the type of properties that we've been buying. As we've talked about the theater assets, they tend to be higher cap rate assets, some of the other assets that we've closed on, they just tend to have higher yields on the high-6s, low-7s, mid-7s in some cases. I think that has predominantly driven our overall cap rate than seeing shifts in cap rate.","Having said that, we're certainly seeing intra property like within certain sub sectors in retail, cap rates have moved, and in some cases, they've gotten more aggressive, as you would expect, given the current environment. And in some cases, they've remained flat. But by and large, the opening remarks that I've made around cap rates remaining somewhat steady is true for us, despite the fact that you're seeing us amplify cap rates that are higher on what we have closed. But that's predominantly driven by the mix.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows","Maybe just following up on that last question. You're talking about how the certain mix of assets has impacted your cap rates so far this year on acquisitions. I guess going forward, do you expect to continue that potentially Numix called it or do you think you could go back to what you've done more historically?","Sumit Roy","Caitlin, we always like higher cap rates, but it needs to fit our investment thesis. And like I answered Chris's question, it just so happened that everything aligned and the mix that we're looking for, the opportunities that we saw that fit our transaction -- our acquisition criteria, it just happened to trade at higher cap rates. I'd love to be able to tell you that we\u2019ve continued to see that same mix and we'll be able to continue to post high 6% cap rates and therefore create more value, but some of it is driven by the opportunities available in the market. And so I wouldn't necessarily count on that. But we are not averse to continuing to do transactions, just because it has a higher yield, as long as it fits our investment philosophy.","Caitlin Burrows","And then maybe just on the volume or deal flow side. I know, you mentioned earlier that you were seeing historical, very high levels of domestic deal flow. So just wondering, is there anything you can think of that's driving that, in particular, and do you expect that activity levels to continue?","Sumit Roy","I do think, even if we were to sort of normalize over the next six months, this year could turn out to be one of the highest year that, not the highest year in terms of sourcing, some of our sourcing is of course, going to get supplemented by what we are seeing in the UK as well, which we haven't had in years past. But, do I see a particular trend in the market? No, that I can point to that sort of answers as to why we're seeing this unprecedented volume of sourcing. It just happens to be the case. We know that there are larger portfolios that have come to market, there are a lot of opco, propco situations that we find ourselves discussing with potential operators on. So it's, for whatever reason we find ourselves at a point with the cost of capital and the scale to be able to act on it, so we are very excited about it. But I can't really point to any one variable that is causing this phenomena, it's just, it is what we see and we're very excited about it.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s second quarter 2017 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that maybe considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law.

Our business continue to perform well in the second quarter with healthy AFFO per share growth of 7%. During the quarter we completed $321 million in high-quality acquisitions and increased portfolio occupancy to 98.5%, while maintaining in our conservative balance sheet.","Given the confidence we have in our business, we are increasing in our 2017 acquisitions guidance from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We\u2019re also increasing our 2017 AFFO per share guidance, as we now expect 2017 AFFO per share to be $3.03 to $3.07, which represents annual growth of 5.2% to 6.6%.","Let me hand it over to Paul now to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks, John. I\u2019ll provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Interest expense increased in the quarter by $6.3 million to $63.7 million. This increase was primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance in the second quarter following our March issuance of $700 million of long-term unsecured bonds.","Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.5% for the quarter and 5.1% year-to-date. We\u2019re so projecting approximately 5% for the year and we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease sector. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues were 1.6% in the quarter. Our guidance remains 1.5% to 2% for all of 2017.","Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.75 for the quarter versus $0.70 a year ago. We\u2019re revising our 2017 FFO guidance to a range of $2.96 to $3.01 per share. I reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition, which includes various non-cash items, such as quarterly interest rates, swap gains or losses, amortization of lease intangibles and the $0.05 charge incurred in connection with the redemption of our Series F Preferred Stock in April. This $0.05 Preferred Stock redemption charge is the primary difference in our FFO and AFFO guidance.","Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO, where the actual cash we have available for distribution is dividend was $0.76 per share for the quarter, representing a 7% increase over the year ago period.","Briefly turning to the balanced sheet. We\u2019ve continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $55.1 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7.9 years. And our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.4 times. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $23 million of mortgage debt.","And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $213 million of debt coming due to the remainder of this year and our maturity schedule is well lathered thereafter. And finally, our overall leverage remains modest with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.6 times. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital.","Now, let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on our results.","John Case","Thanks, Paul. I will begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.5%, the highest occupancy we have achieved in 10 years. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2017. During the quarter we re-leased 53 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 113% of expiring rent, which is well above our long-term average. This quarter was the fourth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%.","For the first half of 2017, we have re-leased 102 properties to existing and new tenants recapturing approximately 109% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the companies in our sector who also report this metric. Our same-store rent increased 0.4% during the quarter, primarily due to the timing of percentage rent increases on a year-over-year basis. For the first half of the year, our same-store rent increased by 1%, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2017.","Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 250 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenues from our traditional retail properties, the largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.","Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.7% of rental revenue and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. As you all know, due to regulatory concerns Walgreens terminated its agreement to purchase Rite Aid and instead plans to purchase about 2,200 Rite Aid stores. All the proposal must still clear regulatory approval. The completion of the transaction would have benefits for both companies. Walgreens would fill in gaps in its geographic footprint and achieve additional financial and operational synergies. And Rite Aid has stated, it would deleveraged balance sheet and it would remain the third largest player in the industry, while gaining an access to Walgreens purchasing network.","Within our retail portfolio over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and\/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today\u2019s retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcy\u2019s this year have been in industries that do not share these characteristics.","We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8 times on a four-wall basis, and the median remains 2.7 times. Our watch list has declined by approximately 15 basis points and remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years.","Moving on to acquisitions, we completed $321 million in acquisitions during the quarter at attractive investment spreads. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain selective in our investment strategy acquiring less than 4% of the amount we source.","Our low cost of capital allows us to simultaneously acquire the highest quality properties that provide favorable long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth. Given the continued strength in the investment pipeline, we are increasing our acquisitions guidance for 2017.","We now expect to complete approximately $1.5 billion of acquisitions and increase from our prior estimate of $1 billion. This estimate does not account for any unidentified large scale transactions.","Now, let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. During the second quarter of 2017, we invested $321 million in 73 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 13 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 33% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 91% of the revenues are generated from retail and 9%, are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 16 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, quick service restaurants and theatres. We closed 26 discrete transactions in the second quarter.","Year-to-date 2017, we invested $692 million in 126 properties located in 30 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. On a revenue basis 51% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 95% of the revenues are generated from retail and 5% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 34 different tenants in 20 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our grocery stores automotive services and health and fitness. Of the 37 independent transactions closed year-to-date, two transactions were above $50 million.","Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately 7 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $18 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities 46% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 54% or approximately $10 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 35% for the second quarter. Of the $321 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 72% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over 48 years of operating history.","As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain flat in the second quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 221 basis points in the second quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.","Regarding dispositions, during the second quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of $12.3 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6% unrealized and un-levered IRR of 9.5%. This brings us to 28 properties sold year-to-date for $43.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.9% unrealized and un-levered IRR of 9.7%. In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1.5 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million.","With that, I\u2019d like to hand it back to John.","John Case","Thanks, Sumit. Last month, we increased the dividend for the 92nd time in the company\u2019s history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over the year ago. We have increased our dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our dividend represents an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 83% based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance.","To wrap it up, we\u2019re pleased with our company\u2019s operating performance and remain confident in our outlook. Our real estate portfolio is performing well. Our acquisition pipeline is robust and our balance sheet is conservatively capitalized. Our cost of capital remains a competitive advantage in the net lease industry, which we believe allows us to continue generating favorable risk adjusted returns for our shareholders.","At this time, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joshua Dennerlein","Hey, guys, good afternoon.","John Case","Hey, Josh.","Joshua Dennerlein","So I saw on page 24, there\u2019s an additional invested capital line, a bit higher than normal this quarter. Could you walk us through that line item? How we should think about it?","John Case","24 of the supplement I think is what you\u2019re referring to. Virtually all of that, what\u2019s related to an expansion of an existing industrial distribution property, where we doubled the size of it, and extended the lease term with an investment grade credit by 10 years. Our incremental yield on that investment capital was 7.5%, which is about 150 basis points above where our acquisition yield would be on this type of property. So the value creation exercise for the company and shareholder, so we were pleased with that.","Joshua Dennerlein","Great. And do you think this will become more common for your business on a go-forward basis. Or is this just \u2013 was this kind of one-off here.","John Case","We hope so, I mean, these expansion opportunities are quite attractive for us and deliver attractive risk adjusted returns and returns beyond what the acquisitions typically yield the company. So I think as we move forward, we\u2019ll see that number grow a bit and we\u2019d like to see it grow a bit. Right now overall we have $90 million under development, which we have $16 million defined. We would like to see that number pick up, that does include expansions and redevelopments","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker","Hey, good afternoon guys or good morning out there. I guess just \u2013 I wanted to talk a little bit acquisitions you obviously increase your guidance for the year by pretty lost to $500 million. Can you just give us some color on what you guys are seeing out there? Is it larger portfolios that seem to be coming to market? I know there\u2019s been a lot of expectations that maybe volumes might slow this year or next year. Sounds like you guys aren\u2019t seeing that, just any color would be helpful.","John Case","Sure. We\u2019re not seeing volume slow year-to-date we sourced $18 billion in investment opportunities and we\u2019re still remaining quite selective and what we\u2019re investing. Then a year-to-date 4% of what we\u2019ve sourced, we\u2019ve actually closed on.","When we look forward, we\u2019re seeing a combination of some larger portfolios, but also strong activity in our aggregation program where we\u2019re looking at assets on a more granular basis or small portfolios. So the increase is predicated on both types of acquisitions, smaller portfolios as well as couple of large sale leaseback opportunities we\u2019re working on and would expect, we would hope to hit those as well. So again not seeing any sign whatsoever of the transaction opportunities for, Ryan.","Ryan Meliker","All right. Great, that\u2019s helpful. This is a quick follow-up. Are you changing any of your underwriting standards driven by what\u2019s going on in the retail environment and some of the uncertainties surrounding some retailers\u2019 with regards to e-commerce?","John Case","Well, on the retail side we continue to focus on service non-discretionary and\/or low price point businesses, which we have done now for nearly 10 years. And we do that because those types of tenants have been much more resistant to the impact of e-commerce. So we\u2019ve not changed our investment parameters on the retail front or on the industrial front. We continue to hear to those investment parameters. And when you look at the selectivity as I\u2019ve said just a moment ago we\u2019re not increasing the percentage of opportunities we see in terms of what we\u2019re closing on over the last few years, that\u2019s average probably 8% and this year we\u2019re running at 4%. So again I think that selectivity metric is something the market can look at and be comfortable that we\u2019re not changing our investment parameters.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks. Just on the pipeline \u2013 sorry, the watch list you mentioned some that watch list decline. Can you maybe give us some color, what actually fell off the watch list and has a composition changed in any way?","John Case","Well, the overall watch list declined by 15 basis points. It\u2019s still in the low 1% area and that\u2019s a combination of some sales we made and also some improving financial metrics on some properties that were in that watch list that we took out given the improvement in the financial metrics for those particular properties.","So Vikram, that\u2019s a fluid concept, that\u2019s changing almost on a daily basis based on conversations we\u2019re having with our tenants and the information we\u2019re receiving in our research and credit group. But it is trending down. Then I would add to that our credit watch list has been running around 6%, but this past quarter it was less than 5%. So we\u2019re seeing the credit profile within the portfolio improved as well.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up in your expiration over the next two years. Are any of your top 10 or 15 tenants or any of them in there anything sizable we should be aware of?","John Case","No nothing sizable on our top tenants rolling within the next one to two years.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Collin Mings with Raymond James.","Collin Mings","Hey, thanks and good morning out there guys.","John Case","Hey, Collin.","Collin Mings","Just first one for me, can you guys just update us on how you\u2019re thinking about capital markets activity over the remainder the year with about $650 million or so on the line at the end of June. Just remind us, how much you\u2019re comfortable carrying on that. And how you see that the back half playing out from a capital markets perspective?","John Case","So in our line of credit has a base amount of $2 billion and with an accordion future at our option of another $1 billion, and has two years remaining in terms of term plus one year extension option at our option. So we are seeing \u2013 we have plenty of liquidity today. As we look forward, what we\u2019ll do with regard to financing is we\u2019ll look at all of the markets, the unsecured market, the debt market, the hybrid markets and if they appropriate time pick the right form of capital to term out our line balance.","So as we sit here today, we don\u2019t have any specific plans in terms of what we want to issue, but asset line balance grows we\u2019re comfortable with it up until billions, but we want to be opportunistic and access capital at the appropriate time and certainly the right types of capital.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then maybe just switching gears as far as the entry of NPC International into the top 20 tenant roster, any color you can provide on that.","John Case","Yes. NPC has been a relationship in a tenant for us for probably 20 years now and they are the largest Pizza Hut franchise in the U.S. and they\u2019re the largest Wendy\u2019s franchise in the U.S. and we did a Wendy\u2019s portfolio last quarter that brought down back into our top 20. They\u2019ve been in our top 20 before, but it\u2019s a result to the portfolio acquisition of Wendy\u2019s.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi.","John Case","Nick?","Operator","Hello, you may have [indiscernible] (31:22)","John Case","We got to the next question and Nick can rejoin.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Carroll","Yes, thanks. John, can you provide some color on the health of the leapy market versus the historical trends. It looks like company has been driving much higher recapture rates over the past few years. Is this a trend and if so, what\u2019s driving it?","John Case","Well, it\u2019s been a trend. We\u2019ve had over the last five quarters of strong numbers on that trend. And I think it\u2019s just speaks to the portfolio help of the tenants, quality of the properties, and specifically those tenants operations at those specific properties. So we\u2019ve been pleased with it, over the life of the company, we have had recapture rates right at about 100% just a hair below, I think it\u2019s 99.4%. So realizing these recapture rates in the 113% range very healthy. And I think it speaks to the quality and health of the portfolio.","I\u2019ll tell you, we have a tremendous team in our portfolio management group that is working these properties in some cases years in advance negotiating with our tenants to retain them in those assets, and if it makes sense for their business, but also for our business. So it\u2019s been a real focus of ours over the last several years. And one which we continue to have and we hope that will yield some more results, it\u2019ll vary from quarter-to-quarter. But the trend certainly has been positive for us.","Michael Carroll","Okay. I might be nitpicking here a little bit, but given your success you had in the first half of 2017. Why was it necessary to remove the top end of the same-store rent guidance range this quarter?","John Case","Yes, we went out with the same-store rent guidance at the beginning of the year 1% to 1.2% growth. So as we\u2019re here at the mid-year point, we\u2019ve got more visibility and of what the same-store pull is going to look like for the remainder of the year. And it looks like it\u2019s going to be closer to 1% and this is the time of the year, typically, that we update our guidance numbers. And we thought it be appropriate to move that to 1%. It\u2019s not related any tenant credit issues as I\u2019ve said our credit watch list, as well as our overall watch list have continued to decline. It\u2019s just fine tuning at the mid-year point, really nothing to read into that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Dan Donlan","Thank you. Just two questions for me. John, just curious if you can comment on what portion of the portfolio is taken, but still paying rent and then kind of how do you manage that down especially if you have a lot of lease term left. How do you guys kind of look at that?","John Case","Okay. Well, we have \u2013 Dan, about 0.75% of rent that is current, but on they can assets. And that\u2019s inline with where our company has been for a while now a number of years the average lease term remaining on those properties, it\u2019s about 60 properties in six years. 61% of those closed current as we refer to them, our investment grade rated tenants. And we remain in close communication with those tenants in terms of releasing or subleasing and we\u2019re not releasing those primary tenants from their rental obligations.","We\u2019re spending more time working on those properties expected to roll in the near-term, so within the next three years of course than we are properties that may not roll for six, seven, eight, nine years and have an investment grade tenant paying rent. So that\u2019s part of the business and has been for a long time.","Dan Donlan","Okay. And then just curious on our Gander Mountain, what the thought process is there are \u2013 I think if I look at the list there you\u2019re maybe one of your nine properties is going to be kept. If you look at the new build list that they put out if you it may be three of nine. We\u2019re just kind of curious, how your discussions are going there and you have any replacement tenants lined up? Any additional commentary would be helpful.","John Case","Sure. Well, Gander is interested in the majority of our properties and they have been purchased by camping more on. So we know Freedomroads, Camping World very well they\u2019ve been a tenant of ours for a long time. We\u2019re in discussions with them, the list that are being put out there, I would say aren\u2019t always completely accurate. But in some cases, Gander may want to stay, but not at a rent level that makes sense for us.","So we\u2019re having conversations with other tenants beyond Gander for those properties that may yield a better result than what Gander staying would be. So clearly, those start staying on a handful and we\u2019ll see what happens to the others.","We\u2019ve been \u2013 we\u2019re current on Gander rent through the month of July and we have factored I think fairly conservatively our expectations of the impact of Gander into our guidance for this year. And we\u2019re not expecting any surprises from that standpoint. And collectively on an annualized basis, Gander is less than one half of 1% of our rent. So that\u2019s not completely insignificant, but it\u2019s not a large material issue for us. And we think the locations that we have are attractive than major metropolitan areas, and again we\u2019ve seen good interest from other tenants in those locations. So I think we\u2019re going to be buying there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our next question from Karin Ford with MUFJ Securities.","Karin Ford","Hi, good afternoon. Have you seen any change in the tone of your discussions with any of your retail tenants? Are they, say, more wary of extension plans less likely to renew anything like that?","John Case","No, in our renewal rates are up more considering expansions in our conversations with them carrying, they\u2019re optimistic about their business. The portfolio overall is in very good health and I\u2019d say we\u2019re not experiencing any more tenant credit issues when we have an any year and in the last four or five years of this cycle.","So this year has been pretty much business as usual the largest issue we just talked about and that\u2019s Gander that\u2019s not that material for us. And then once you get beyond that there are few moms and pops that have had some credit issues, but even on a collective basis they\u2019re not material for our company.","Karin Ford","Okay thanks. And my second question is, given that success and the fact that your credit is held us so well with your service non-discretionary low price point tenant in the retail \u2013 on the retail side. Are you seeing more competition for those assets? Are people starting to chase some more? Are you seeing a widening of GAAP and cap rates between those types of retailers and deals with other types of retailers?","John Case","Well, I think retailers that are e-commerce resistant and have proven to be at this point and are well capitalized, high credit, well managed businesses. We\u2019re going to trade at cap rates that are more aggressive. And fortunately for us, we\u2019ve got overall lowest cap cost of capital in the business. We have the greatest access to capital and we have the ability to do larger scale transactions with these larger companies without creating tenant revenue concentration issues for the company. But we\u2019re really an advantageous position, we\u2019ve developed great relationships with these \u2013 those tenants tend to be larger, and those relationships are resulting and some opportunities on the acquisitions front that are being done on a purely negotiated basis. So we\u2019re happy with that.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott","Hey, guys just a quick question on just more generally what\u2019s happening with yields in the investment marketplace. Your yield that you achieved on acquisitions this quarter was higher than it had been the last couple quarters. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on what you\u2019re seeing and what you expect to happen over the balance of the year in that marketplace?","John Case","Yes, Michael. Yields vary from quarter-to-quarter. The yield this quarter was 6.6%, and the first quarter it was 6.1% year-to-date, it was 6.3%. That\u2019s fluctuating yields really a \u2013 between the first and second quarter, the function of two items, one is we did more investment grade in the first quarter then we did in the second quarter. And that\u2019s really a function of the opportunities available to invest in the market.","And then the lease terms were slightly longer in the first quarter than the 13-year term that we had in the second quarter, and hence you had a bit of a pricing differential on cap rates. But year-to-date that leasing terms of 15 years and over the course of the last three or four years our lease terms by quarter vary quite a bit sometime, they\u2019ve been as low as 10 years and as high as 17 years. So coming in at 15 year-to-date is fine. And the cap rate, we\u2019re still guiding to something for the year in the low 6s. And what will impact that is just simply the quality of the properties in both quarters were very strong. And when you do get investment grade on top of strong real estate location with strong operating metrics, you\u2019re going to \u2013 that is going to be reflected in a more aggressive cap rate.","Michael Knott","And then can we get your views on traffic and trends in the restaurant space. Maybe more specifically on QSRs, I guess, if that\u2019s the way you\u2019re focuses more so. And then also with my last question, can I get you to make any comments on your view of grocery changes potentially with Amazon entering into whole foods?","John Case","Sure. I\u2019ll start with Amazon on the grocery front, obviously, there\u2019s been a lot in the news about that. Our grocery exposures just under 5% virtually all of that is with two of the leading grocers in the marketplace, that\u2019s Walmart neighborhood markets and Kroger, which are both developed successful online businesses, omni-channel businesses and continue to expand those businesses and incorporate their real estate locations, which are favorable. They\u2019re also very well capitalized companies, who have the ability to continue to invest in their e-commerce initiatives and they\u2019ve shown with their results to date in terms of their investments in those initiatives, good growth and good results. So they\u2019re well positioned to compete with the Amazon Whole Foods.","And I think we\u2019ll see how this plays out. But we have very strong grocery stores there. And we have the ones we want, I think the ones that will be impacted or the ones that are smaller regional don\u2019t have an omni-channel presence, and don\u2019t have the capital strength to invest in that business. On QSR traffic, Sumit, you want to take that?","Sumit Roy","Yes, sure. So we continue to invest in QSRs and we feel that this particular subs sector in the restaurant space this continue to improve. Our specific portfolio has coverages in the high-2\u2019s in this particular area, and the fact that John alluded to Wendy\u2019s portfolio that we just closed on. This is an area that we feel very good about and we\u2019ll continue to invest in.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Crum, Senior Associate, Realty Income. Please go ahead sir.","Andrew Crum","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's first quarter 2019 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","During this conference we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.","Sumit Roy","Thanks, Andrew. Welcome to our call today. We are pleased to begin 2019 with another successful quarter. During the quarter we invested approximately $520 million in high-quality real estate and investment spread, well above our historical average and we continue to see ample transaction flow that meets our investment parameters. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced our international expansion through a GBP429 million sale leaseback transaction in the UK with Sainsbury's under long-term triple-net leases.","This represents a natural evolution of our Company's strategy and we will continue to grow our international platform as we are well-positioned to capitalize on a significant addressable market in the UK and mainland Europe. From a strategic standpoint, we believe there is a dearth of large institutional buyers pursuing the quality of single tenant net leased assets in Europe that we intend to invest in. Given our portable size, scale and cost of capital advantages, we believe we have a unique ability to execute sizable portfolio transactions with best-in-class operators.","This transaction was relationship-driven and was completed on an off-market negotiated basis. We look forward to further developing relationships with other industry leaders like Sainsbury's as we expand our international platform. Concurrent with the announcement of our sale leaseback transaction with Sainsbury's, we increased our 2019 AFFO per share guidance to a range of $3.28 to $3.33 from a prior range of $3.25 to $3.31 and we increased our 2019 acquisition guidance to a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.","Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to 261 commercial tenants in 48 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 82% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at nearly 12% of rental revenue.","Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.1% of rental revenue. Convenience store remains our largest industry at 12.2% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service nondiscretionary and\/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments.","These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.8 times on a four-wall basis while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list at 1.6% of rent is relatively consistent with our levels over the first few years.","Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.3%, a decrease of 30 basis points versus a year ago period. We expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2019. During the quarter we released 71 properties, recapturing approximately 105% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 2,900 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1.5% during the quarter. Our projected run rate for 2019 continues to be circa 1%. Approximately 86% of our leases have contractual rent increases.","Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Effective in the first quarter we adopted the new lease accounting guidance. And as a result we are now consolidating tenant reimbursement revenue within rental revenue in our income statement. To aid financial statement users we will continue to separately disclose the component of revenue attributable to reimbursable tenant expenses in both our 10-Q and in our financial supplement.","Our G&A expense as a percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursement, was 4.5% for the quarter, below our G&A expenses in the year-ago quarter from both a margin basis and a dollar basis.","We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and expect our G&A margin to remain below 5% in 2019.","Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursements, was 1.3% for the quarter which also remains ahead of our full year expectation in the 1.5% to 1.75% range. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.82 per share for the quarter, which represents a 3.8% increase.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and of course we remain one of only a few REITs with at least AA rating. During the first quarter we issued $2.2 million of common equity through our dividend reinvestment stock purchase plan. Note that we entered 2019 with a very low leverage after issuing almost $540 million of common equity in the fourth quarter of 2018. We finished this quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.2 billion available on our credit line.","Our fixed charge coverage ratio increased from 4.4 times to 4.5 times. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 8.5 years which closely tracks our weighted average remaining lease term. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, selling $19 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2019 and our maturity schedule is well-laddered thereafter with just over $300 million of debt maturing in both 2020 and 2021.","In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage ratios and excellent liquidity. Now let me turn the call back over to Sumit.","Sumit Roy","Thanks, Paul. I'll now move to our investment activity during the quarter. During the first quarter of 2019 we invested approximately $520 million in 105 properties located in 25 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.7% and with a weighted average lease term of 17 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 31% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 98.7% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 25 different tenants in 14 industries.","Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, automotive services and grocery stores. We closed 25 discrete transactions in the first quarter. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy as we sourced approximately $11.7 billion in the first quarter. Investment-grade opportunities represented 31% of the volume sourced for the first quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during first quarter, 53% were portfolios and 47% or approximately $5.0 billion were one-off assets. Of the $519 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 42% of the volume were one-off transactions.","As to pricing, cap rates have essentially remained unchanged in the first quarter. Investment-grade properties are trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties are trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging approximately 261 basis points in the first quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.","Our domestic investment pipeline remains robust and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain the only publicly traded net lease company that has the size, scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. During the first quarter approximately 50% of our acquisitions were sale leaseback transactions and we continue to identify strong corporate partners for future sale-leaseback transactions.","As previously mentioned, due to the strength in our current domestic investment pipeline as well as our international expansion, we have raised 2019 acquisition guidance to a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter we sold 18 properties for net proceeds of $21.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 9.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 5.4%. The low IRR on our disposition activity during the quarter was primarily driven by one sale of vacant property previously leased to a sporting-goods retailer. Absent this disposition, our IRR on dispositions during the quarter was 7.2%.","We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of non-strategic assets, recycling the sale proceeds into properties that better fit our investment parameters. We continue to anticipate between $75 million and $100 million dispositions in 2019. In March, we increased the dividend for the 101st time in our Company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 3% increase over the year-ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 82.1% based on the midpoint of 2019 AFFO guidance.","We have increased our dividend every year since the Company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index.","To wrap it up, we completed another strong quarter. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Our investment pipeline remains robust and we are excited about the Company's next chapter as we continue to pursue new opportunities for growth, both domestically and internationally.","At this time I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Hi, good morning guys. So given that ATM issuance is pretty wide in Q1 relative to your normal pace, wondering if you were in a quiet period given the timing of the Sainsbury deal and would you expect it to pick up again now that the deal has been announced? And maybe have you issued any equity post the announcement?","Sumit Roy","Good question, Christy, and you're spot on. Because of the nature of the transaction with regards to Sainsbury's, we were in a blackout period. And so that was the primary reason. The second and equally important reason was in the fourth quarter we had overequitized our balance sheet in anticipation of this particular transaction. So even at the end of the quarter if you look at where the balance sheet is, it's 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA, north of 4.6 times coverage on a fixed charge basis. It leaves the balance sheet in a very good stand. So with regards to capital raising, all avenues are open to us and we will perpetually choose the best available avenue going forward. But those were the primary reasons.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then just looking at the occupancy rate ticked down a bit, any main drivers of that that we should be thinking about and maybe comment on sort of what the outlook looks like for the rest of the year? I think you said 80 -- I'm sorry, 98%. But I wasn't sure if that was sort of a year-end number or an average number.","Sumit Roy","Yes. Again, good question. These two was anticipated which is why if you look at what we guided The Street and which is what's reflected in our earnings guidance, we had guided The Street to a 98% occupancy number. We had 101 leases expiring in the first quarter which was disproportionately high. And for the remaining three quarters we've got 158 leases expiring. So we anticipated that the 98% was going to come down. As we've always shared with the market that we believe our operational occupancy is right around that 2% ZIP Code. And so having an occupancy number at 98% is what we forecast and is what we believe we're going to be running our business at.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then if I could, just one last quick one. Paul, I thought I heard you mention that you'll continue to disclose the revenue component breakout in the Q also. I'm just curious, will that be in the footnotes or the MD&A?","Paul Meurer","So you can see it right now by the way in the supplement so that you have it immediately.","Christy McElroy","Right. We have it in the supplement, yes. I'm just curious about what the -- in terms of the Q what the SEC and FASB guided to you in terms of allowing that in the Q?","Paul Meurer","It will be in our MD&A.","Christy McElroy","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. I guess I was just wondering in terms of, you know, when you look at the retail industry in the US, is your thinking evolved on drugstore exposure given what seems like a little tougher operating environment more -- are there any other industries where you might be making more or less of a capital investment based on some changes in the retail environment?","Sumit Roy","Good question, Nick. This is a question that we often get asked based on our exposure to the drugstore industry. It continues to be our second largest industry exposure. And it's primarily driven by two operators, Walgreens and CVS. And if you look at Walgreens, for instance, they're generating north of $5 billion in free cash flow. If you look at CVS, it's one of the best operators out there in the drugstore industry. We are very positive of the drugstore business. Is it going through some changes? Absolutely. But we feel, we believe that by and large these two operators are very well-positioned to take advantage of these changes that we see unfolding before our eyes.","Some of which, the answers are not very clear, what does the drugstore layout of the future look like today? It's not very clear. But what it is clear is that both CVS as well as Walgreens have made it part of their strategy to figure out how to optimize their stores. If you look at the pharmacy same-store sales growth, they continue to comp positively, both for CVS as well as for Walgreens. And what they're trying to figure out is what to do with the remaining two-thirds of the footprint.","And there are experiments under way as to how to optimize that. On the retail side on the front end, is it, should they be focusing more on beauty products? And that has much higher margin and that continues to be a sub segment that continues to do well. And the rest of the footprint, they are trying to figure out how to provide services. That was one of the genesis stated reasons as to why CVS and Aetna merged, is to how to we provide healthcare services, both for acute as well as chronic illnesses, using the footprint that is already available?","Another piece that we had is being closer to the consumer, they believe, will be the best way to lower the cost of delivering healthcare. And not all of that has played out, but they're certainly experimenting with different formats et cetera. And we believe these are the two operators that will continue to do well and will figure it out eventually.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just in terms of any sub-sectors within retail where you would like to have less exposure?","Sumit Roy","Yes. Look, casual dining continues to be an area that we focus on. It used to represent a very large portion of our portfolio 10 years ago. And today, it's right around 4%, sub-4%. And the ones that we are exposed to, by and large we're very happy with. But that's an area that we continue to be very cautious and an area that we continue to focus on very closely. Anything that falls in the discretionary bucket of retail from furniture stores to other types of discretionary product like sporting goods et cetera, those are again industries that we are very, very cautious in looking at and certainly trying to invest in. And then there are certain other asset types that are much more either demographically driven such as child care centers.","We like the child care business, but the format of the 1980s which worked and have been cash flow positive for us and we've gone full cycle, but demographics have shifted in the neighborhoods where some of these concepts seem to have worked 20 years ago but don't seem to work today. Those are assets that we have on our watch list and are looking to dispose off, and at very good total return profiles. A similar story with regards to the format are the kiosk C-stores. We love the C-store business, but we like the 3000-plus square foot convenience store business. And the ones that have these kiosks that essentially sell lottery tickets and tobacco products are ones that we are actively trying to dispose off. So that's the area that I would say that we are either trying to minimize our exposure to or not invest in at all.","Nick Yulico","Thank you. Just one last question if I may. On the leasing activity page in the supplement you have where you give the recapture rate, could you give a little bit more detail on the four leases where you had essentially about a 30% markdown in rents? And it says it's without vacancies. So I guess I'm just wondering why if you had a tenant, why you released it at a lower rent?","Sumit Roy","Well, those are the ones where the tenant decided not to stay. And for us you're always looking at those assets and trying to come up with the economic scenario of selling those assets vacant or releasing it. And it is not atypical. If you go back and look at our supplemental, to have assets that have even with zero vacancy lease rates that are sub-100%, so the fact that this was right around 70% doesn't really drive the overall profile. We still came out at 105% recapture rate.","And as you can see, it's largely driven by leases with tenants that choose to exercise the existing options. And for us that's really the crux of what we are trying to underwrite, it is to make sure that the retail product continues to be of relevance to the existing tenant because they exercise those options, those options tend to have growth in them and that is the best way for us to recapture a positive spread with almost always zero dollars of additional investment. But in situations when we have had vacancy or even with no vacancy, when you're trying to attract new tenants, sometimes taking a 30% drop in a recapture rate proves out or at least to our analysis proves it to be a much better economic outcome than trying to sell those assets vacant. And that's the story behind that.","Nick Yulico","Okay, appreciate it, thank you.","Sumit Roy","Sure.","Operator","Our next question will come from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead.","Rob Stevenson","Good afternoon guys. Just follow-up on Nick's question. So there's roughly 100 vacant assets in the portfolio. I mean what's the sort of mix between what you guys expect the retenant versus market for sale?","Sumit Roy","It's been roughly, if you look at it historically speaking, 80% of every lease that comes up for renewal gets exercised by the existing tenant. I would say 10% to 15% of the remaining leases we end up leasing to new tenants and 5% to 10% we end up selling. More recently that mix have shifted. We are tending to dispose off assets, vacant assets because we feel like the economic recapture rate is superior to going down the path of releasing it, and for Nick's question, releasing it at levels that don't make a lot of sense.","And in some cases we are holding on to vacant assets and this is where some of our active asset management comes into play because we believe we can reposition those assets and actually recapture well north of the expiring rents. But that does take time and which is why we have said that our frictional vacancy rate is right around that 2% because we are more than happy holding on to these assets and repositioning them and potentially holding them for 18 months to two years because we believe that the economic outcome in those areas is superior to either retenanting it as it is or selling it vacant.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. What's your thoughts on adding casinos or hotel assets in the portfolio?","Sumit Roy","Good question. There are players in our space that are dedicated to pursuing casinos. We feel like they're very well suited to pursue that strategy. We obviously monitor the asset type, but we really don't have a thesis at this point as to whether we will do anything about entering into that front.","Rob Stevenson","And hotels as well?","Sumit Roy","Yes, I would put both of them in the same bucket.","Rob Stevenson","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from Collin Mings of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin Mings","Great, thank you. Last week you provide a lot of detail an the opportunity to grow in Europe, I guess, where you want to take your international platform. Where could Canada fit in? Are you evaluating any opportunities there as well?","Sumit Roy","We've always looked at Canada. We've looked at countries south of the border as well and we've not been able to pencil the economics. And then the product that is available in these alternative geographies haven't been the ones that we have wanted to pursue based on the economic profile.","But look, I mean one of the main reasons why we wanted to provide all that detail, Collin, was to make sure that you understood the thesis behind why we chose to go into the UK and potentially into mainland Europe. And it's because the economics do pencil and in fact they pencil very well especially given the current environment and the product lends itself to what it is that we've been pursuing here in the US.","And so this is truly the way we think about, you know, if you're going to change anything or if you're going to introduce any level of new paths for us to pursue, it needs to sort of be along the lines of what we have presented as to why we chose the same space of portfolio. And so this was a long and drawn out way of answering that, yes, Canada certainly is one of the countries that we have looked at in the past and if the right product with the right economic profile comes along, we will absolutely pursue it, but we haven't been able to find one yet.","Collin Mings","Okay. It doesn't sound like there's any bigger push now that you've established an international platform necessarily to go in that direction, is that fair?","Sumit Roy","It's now that we've done, more people are aware of the fact that we're open to doing it. So I would say that that's not entirely fair, Collin. We are certainly getting a lot more inbound calls as was expected and so transactions perhaps that we may not have seen because people weren't aware that we were a potential player in the past. That dynamic has changed. And, which was completely expected and the team here is ready to respond to those calls. So, time will tell.","Collin Mings","Great. That's actually very helpful clarification there. Just switching to investment activity during the quarter, there really weren't huge moves in your top tenant roster just on as far as the Dollar General property, obviously that was up somewhat notably. Maybe just take a second and kind of, if there's any additional color you can provide there and then talk about just Dollar Stores exposure overall at this point?","Sumit Roy","Yes. A lot of it was parts of small portfolios that we acquired. We continue to like Dollar Tree and Dollar General. Both of those are operators that's filling a very specific mission to market and they are both outstanding operators in our mind. Dollar Tree has taken a bit longer than any of us had expected to sort of unfold Family Dollar, but that is now well on its way and all signs are that those are the two operators that we want to continue to partner with.","Having said that, I think our exposure to that business is right around 5.2%. And will we propitiously grow that piece? Absolutely, with the right trends, with the right growth profile. We will absolutely continue to look to grow that. But we are not going to actively pursue these development-driven Family Dollar, Dollar General, Dollar Tree assets because those tend to not to be the type of assets with the right type of leases in terms of the triple-net nature that we like to pursue.","Collin Mings","Okay. Thank you very much for the color.","Operator","Our next question will come from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.","Karin Ford","Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering, Sumit, should we still expect to see broaden your verticals out in the US this year or do you feel like you have enough on your plate with the international initiative that you announced?","Sumit Roy","I'm smiling, Karin. Last week we came out with something huge and our hope is that we will continue to explore. And the timing is what remains uncertain as to whether it's going to be next quarter or next month or maybe even a year from now that we can come up with something different. This international foray is a big step for us. It does increase the potential market from $4 trillion to potentially $12 trillion now and we want to make sure that we do this it right on the international front.","But that certainly does not preclude us from continuing to explore some of other paths that we have been exploring over the last three months. And if something does take shape and becomes actionable and we decide to pursue it, we will again do something similar to what we did last week and come and share that with you.","But I can't really tell you what the timing on some of those other avenues are going to be and I think I had been asked this question before as to why not, and the answer is pretty obvious because some of these avenues that we are pursuing today we may choose not to after we've done our diligence and, or all the product doesn't lend itself to those avenues even if the avenue seems to theoretically makes a lot of sense. So that's tied down to that question, Karin.","Karin Ford","Understood. Appreciate that. My second question is along the same line. You've generated very consistent FFO and dividend growth over the years with below average volatility. Is one of the goals of the new strategic initiatives to push earnings growth higher than it has been historically?","Sumit Roy","No. Look, I think our only goal was to continue to look at expanding the potential viable investment set. The idea here is to not compromise on either our balance sheet strategy or the types of businesses that we are pursuing with the profile of the businesses that we are pursuing. I mean, those remain intact, Karin. I think most people who invest in us, they invest in us because of the fact that we have this low-vol, dependable growth business. And I don't think we're going to compromise on that particular front.","But that does not preclude us from looking at new avenues of growth. That sort of lend itself to this profile that we've designed for ourselves. And there is in certain products we believe a mismatch where the perception may be that it tends to be higher risk or higher volatility and it's for us to then -- if we decide to pursue that to-- if we decide to pursue that, it is on us to then show to you why we believe that it's sort of falls in line with the profile that we've designed for ourselves.","So for us growth is really an output of this exercise rather than the driver of this exercise, and that is nuanced but something very, very important to us.","Karin Ford","Thanks for taking my questions.","Sumit Roy","Sure.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from John Massocca of Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.","John Massocca","Good afternoon.","Sumit Roy","Hi, John.","John Massocca","So, as you stated investment-grade rated assets as a percentage of acquisitions came down or a little bit low this quarter maybe versus kind of what you've done in the first nine months of 2018. Was this a similar situation to 4Q 2018 where it was just the mix and there's a lot of assets in there that simply aren't rated? Or was there maybe a better risk-adjusted return you felt you were getting by going after sub-investment grade-rated companies?","Sumit Roy","Yes. I would say that a lot of them fell into this non-rated bucket. And given our conservative nature, we obviously do our own underwriting to figure out what the implied rating would be if there were to be rated. But we categorized them as sub-investment grade for your purposes. And so, look, again, people have often said we only pursue investment grade-rated tenants that is and we compromise on growth and on initial yield but that has never been what we've done. Again, this is an output of the strategy that we have put in place and it just happens to be that a lot of the assets that we closed on in the first quarter have a profile that again low-vol, predictable business models that have high drop to breakeven in sales if it's a variable cost business or -- sorry, I said it the opposite way.","And that is very important to us. But just because we had a 30% investment grade-rated tenants in the first quarter, that really was the output of the types of products that we ended up closing on. But the industry and we've shared that with you, the industries that they belong to, the tenants that they happen to be, these are tenants that are very high quality and somebody mentioned LifeTime Fitness, that\u2019s a business that we really like and they are well north of the coverage ratio -- rent coverage ratios that our overall portfolio has and their breakeven in drop to sales is over 40%, but yet that's going to fall in the non-investment grade-rated bucket because it's a private company that doesn't have a rating.","So I wouldn't look anything into that particular number. It is going to continue to move around and a perfect example would be Sainsbury's next quarter. It's a non-rated company but if you run the metrics through the S&P credit model which is what we did, it would be rated investment-grade. But there again, that's a very large transaction that is going to not have the investment grade, it won't be part of that investment-grade profile. Hopefully that helps.","John Massocca","No, that makes complete sense. And then, can you maybe provide a little color on any tenant credit-driven vacancy in the quarter? If I heard you right, you had 101 leases expire. If I kind of look on page 21 of the sup, that would imply there were around 10 or so assets that were vacant because of -- not because of the expiring leases but because of tenant credit. What drove that? I know it's not a huge number, but just any color there would be helpful.","Sumit Roy","Sure. Happy to address that. We have eight Shopco assets and these were largely second-generation assets for us. And few of those 10-odd came from the Shopco assets. And we expect most of them to come back to us. But it is -- I want to say 17 basis points of rent. So completely immaterial, but those definitely drove some of that 101 vacancies.","John Massocca","I appreciate the color. That's it from me. Thank you.","Sumit Roy","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.","Karin Ford","Hi, just one quick one for Paul. Any plans to refinance the line balance later on this year with the bond deal? And are you considering a commercial paper program or forward equity?","Paul Meurer","Yes. Well, as Sumit commented earlier, we obviously given the new Sainsbury's we felt compelled to not issue new capital in Q1, thinking that that was material information for a potential equity investor, for example. In addition, we had raised a fair amount of capital end of last year. So we sit here today with that $800 million plus balance, but it is a $3 billion line, so we have plenty of liquidity. We don't feel compelled per se relative to a need for capital relative to our acquisition pipeline in the near term or anything of that sort. And all forms of capital are available to us.","So, equity, bonds, each are really well priced right now. Bonds are something, let's say, by year-end we would certainly be considering as part of the mix. Typically our mix is going to be two-thirds plus of equity and the remainder thinking about unsecured bonds. So we could definitely see that as a part of it in. And the relative to commercial paper, it's kind of on that list of new ideas that we are looking into and considering. And it's something I think is very possibly part of our future, but you won't see it in the immediate near term.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I'll now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.","Sumit Roy","Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everyone in a few weeks at ICSC and in the summer at NAREIT. Thank you everyone.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas Lewis","Thank you, Katya and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our conference call and as Katya mentioned, we will go over the fourth quarter and our results for 2012 and a bit about what's happened since year-end. In the room with me today, is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Case, our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer and Tere Miller, our Vice President of Corporate Communications.","As I am obligated to do, I will say that during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law and the company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in the forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail on the company's Form 10-K the factors that may cause such differences.","As is our custom, Paul, perhaps you can begin with overview of the numbers.","Paul Meurer","Thank you, Tom. So, as usual, I will walk through our financial statements briefly and provide some highlights of our financial results for the quarter and where appropriate for the year as a whole, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 16% for the quarter and for the year. Our revenue for the quarter was approximately $130 million or about $520 million annualized run rate at year-end.","This increase reflects positive same-store rent but more significantly it reflects our growth from new acquisitions over the past year. Pro forma, for the ARCT acquisition completed in January, our current annualized total revenues as of 12\/31 are now $712 million. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by about $8.6 million in the comparative quarterly period, as depreciation expense obviously has increased as our property portfolio continues to grow. Interest expense increased in the quarter by about $6.1 million and this was due to the $800 million of bonds that were issued in October, as well as some credit facility borrowings during the quarter.","On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong with interest coverage at 3.6 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.7 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the fourth quarter were approximately $10 million and $38 million for the year. Our G&A expense increased this past year as our acquisition activity increased, also because we added new personnel and our proxy process last spring was more expensive than usual. We ended up expensing $2.4 million of acquisition due diligence costs during the year. Our employee base grew from 83 employees a year ago to 97 employees today. However, our total G&A was the still less than 8% of our total revenues.","Property expenses were just under $1.7 million for the quarter and $7.3 million for the year. These expenses historically have been primarily our carry cost associated with properties available for lease. However, our 2013 property expense estimate is higher at about $12.5 million as we have recently purchased more double net properties double net properties whereby we are responsible for some of the property maintenance cost.","Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company. They were only $215,000 for the quarter and $1.4 million for the year. ARCT merger-related costs, obviously this line items refers to the cost associated with the ARCT acquisition. During the fourth quarter we expensed approximately $2.4 million of such costs, and for all of 2012, we expensed just under $7.9 million.","Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $3.6 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity. We sold 14 properties during the quarter for $16.3 million and a reminder that we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO.","Preferred stock cash dividends totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter and it increased compared to last year, reflects our issuance of the preferred F stock earlier this year.","Excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed refers again to the $3.7 million non-cash redemption charge in the first quarter of last year associated with the repayment of our preferred D stock with proceeds from our new preferred F offering at that time, and reminder of course that the replacement of this preferred D stock in our capital structure did save us about $1 million cash annually and income available to common stockholders was about $28.5 million for the quarter.","Reminder that our normalized FFO noted here simply adds back the ARCT merger-related costs to FFO. We believe normalized FFO is a more appropriate portrayal of our operating performance and it is consistent with our public FFO earnings estimates and first call FFO estimates that analysts have published on us.","Normalized FFO per share was $0.56 for the quarter, a 9.8% increase versus a year ago and $2.02 for the year, a 2% increase versus last year. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.55 per share for the quarter, a 5.8% increase versus a year ago and $2.06 for the year and 2.5% increase versus last year. And also you will note that in our press release, we did affirm our same earnings estimates for 2013, which were previously disclosed last month when we were finalizing the ARCT transaction.","As you know, we also have increased our cash monthly dividend significantly over the past year. In addition to a regular quarterly increases we did a $0.06 annualized increase last August, and this month we have a have a $0.35 annualized dividend increase. We have increased the dividend 61 consecutive quarters and 70 times overall since we went public over 18 years ago. Our current monthly dividend is now just over $0.18 per share, which equates to a current annualized amount of just over $2.17 per share. Our estimated AFFO dividend payout ratio for 2013 is about 91%.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we believe we have continued to maintain a conservative and safe capital structure. In October, as you know, we raised $800 million of new capital with our issuance of $350 million of 2% unsecured fixed rate notes due in 2018 and $450 million of 3.25% unsecured fixed rate notes, due in 2022. At year-end, our $1 billion acquisition credit facility had a balance of only $158 million. However, we did utilize our credit facility for the cash portion of our ARCT acquisition in January, which then increased our credit facility balance to about $700 million.","Our credit facility does have a $500 million accordion expansion feature above the $1 billion amount. Our current total debt to total market capitalization is 32% and our preferred stock outstanding only 5% of our capital structure. Our only bond maturity over the next two-plus years is $100 million bond maturity in March of this year.","We do plan to raise the new capital during the early part of this year. Use of proceeds will be to repay our credit facility borrowing and thus free the facility up for further acquisition financing this year.","So, in summary, we think our overall balance sheet remains healthy. We continue to enjoy excellent access to the public capital markets. Let me turn the call now back over to Tom, who will give you a little bit more background on these results.","Thomas Lewis","Thanks, Paul. As is our custom, I will just kind of run through the different segments of business and let me start with the portfolio.","Once again, the portfolio continued to generate very consistent cash flow in the fourth quarter. Generally the tenants are doing very well. No issues that rose with any of the tenants during the fourth quarter and we look for that to be the case here in the first quarter. Also there is nothing out there that we are looking at.","On our calls, normally what I will do is talk about some of the metrics relative to the portfolio and how and why quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and as we have added in this release the supplemental disclosure on the closing of ARCT post year-end, I will also mention, on a pro forma basis, what that does to some of those metrics and give everybody a flavor of how we sit today and then obviously all those numbers will be integrated into our first quarter results little later in to the year.","At the end of the quarter, our largest 15 tenants accounted for about 47.1% of our revenue. That\u2019s down 270 basis points from the same period of year ago and now, on a pro forma basis, post ARCT, the top 15 have drop from 47.1% to 42.1% or another 500 basis points. So obviously the acquisition efforts relative to both normal acquisitions and ARCT has had a significant impact in reducing concentrations in the portfolio. That obviously is included in our largest 15 tenants.","Cash flow coverages on the retail properties that we have in our top 15 tenants continue to be very strong at about 2.5 time for EBITDAR to rent coverage. So the portfolio continues to operate well there. From an occupancy standpoint, we ended the fourth quarter with 97.2% occupancy and 84 properties available for lease out of the 3,013 we own. That occupancy is up 20 basis points from the third quarter and up 50 basis points from the year ago. On a pro forma basis, post ARCT, that increases another 40 basis points to about 97.7% occupancy as we sit here today.","Back on the year-end, before ARCT, as I mentioned, the last few quarters there's three ways to calculate occupancy. The one I just used which is on vacant buildings versus occupied buildings calculation. That\u2019s 97.2. If you add it on vacant square footage versus occupied, it would be at 98.2%. Then the third way uses previous rent on vacant properties against total rent including the previous rents and that would be a 98.5%. So all three are very healthy and all three would be higher under the ARCT calculations.","Same-store rents our core portfolio increased 0.4% during the fourth quarter and 0.1% year-to-date. As most of you recall same-store rents have been off a little bit the first three quarters, primarily as a function of a couple of tenants and those are moving out of the numbers. So it went positive in the fourth quarter and volume went up to make it positive for the year overall. Looking forward, we think same-store rent growth should accelerate and move to a more normalized level in the 1%, 1.5% plus range in each quarter in 2013 and we think that will start in the first quarter.","With all these acquisitions, obviously the diversification of the portfolio continues to widen substantially. At the end of the year we are at 3,013 properties. That is up 175 properties from last quarter. Then, with 44 different industries now represented in the portfolio with 150 tenants in 49 states. On a pro forma basis, adding in ARCT, it is 3,528. That is up another 515 properties in 48 industries, 202 tenants in 49 states.","Industry exposures are well diversified and with the closing of the transaction, specific exposures in certain industries have declined quite a bit, which I think is really meaningful when looking at the portfolio I would note that in some of our larger segments, convenient stores, as an example, is our largest industry at 1,231. That was 14.9% of revenue, down 140 basis points from last quarter and 230 basis points year-over-year. Then pro forma that drops another 330 basis points. So down to around 11.6% of rent. So substantial reductions.","Restaurants, and here I will just combine both casual dining and quick service, are now at 12.4%. That is down 80 basis points in the fourth quarter and 400 basis points for the year, and now pro forma drops another 220 basis points to only 10.2% of rent. And importantly, and I have talked about this before for what we want to take the portfolio that the gets the casual dining portion on a pro forma basis down to only 5.6% versus 15% of the portfolio a few years ago. That also take figures of [12-31-7], and that's down 80 basis points and then pro forma, it drops to process 66, so we continue to decrease concentration in some of these larger segments, which is very good progress there.","We've also increased the percentage of revenue that is generated from several of the industries on a pro forma basis that we are targeting. Transportation services moves up to about 5.7%, almost all of that comes from our investments in FedEx. Drug stores increases to 6.6%, mostly through additions of additional investment with both, Walgreens and CVS, and then dollar stores now increases to about 5.6% of rent and those investment are primarily with Family Dollar and Dollar General. And the majority of where we added, we believe in those industries are with investment-grade tenants and under long-term leases.","The largest industries on a pro forma basis then will be the C stores 116. That's the only industry over 10% now drug stores at 66%, theaters at 64%, transportation services at 57% and then the dollar stores and casual dining, both at 5.6% of revenue and then all other industries come in below 5%, and for those of you too have been with us for a while looking back three, four years, that's pretty meaningful reduction.","If we look at it from an individual tenant standpoint, the recent acquisitions ARCT make a lot of changes there also. The largest tenant now is FedEx at 5.5% of rent and L.A. Fitness who we like a lot at 39%, Family Dollar and AMC both, 3.5, Diageo, which are wine operations and BJ's posted 3% and then takes everybody below 3%, so a reduction there too.","I mentioned our largest 15 tenants are 42.1% of rent pro forma, and when you get to the 15th largest tenant, we are now down to about only 1.6% of revenue, so very well diversified. Also that's the case from a geographic diversification standpoint. Our average remaining lease length on the portfolio is healthy at about 11.2 years, that's up a bit.","Let me kind of circling back to the top 15 tenants for a minute and take a look at that group post the those the ARCT acquisition in 2008 and 2009 as most of you know and we've talked about on a lot of our calls, we went through a strategic evolution where we decided to make some adjustments on a go forward basis in the portfolio, and really just started implementing that in 2010 and kind of the themes we are looking at is targeting certain retail industries relative to the consumer base they serve and really are looking at kind of is it upper income, middle income, or low income consumers and then trying to differentiate between those retailers that sell discretionary goods and services versus those that non-discretionary and trying to focus mostly towards retailers to focus on non-discretionary items.","Secondarily, when with middle and lower income consumers to make sure that the retailers we are getting really have a deep value proposition and then thirdly trying to stay with a long-term theme of convenience and necessity. Then as you can see pretty clearly right now in the makeup of the top-15 on a pro forma basis, Family Dollar, Dollar General, BJ'S, Walgreens and CVS are all now in the 15, so that matches with those themes.","We also decided to pursue acquisitions outside of retail. That's now little over 22% of our revenue and the FedEx being largest one, and virtually all of those leases and properties are long-term leases to very large tenants with investment-grade ratings. And as a general theme also, both for retail and outside moving the portfolio up the credit curve and working more and more with investment-grade tenants.","And if you look at the five of the top-15 tenants were now rated investment-grade versus three years ago and was about 34% of our overall revenue on a pro forma basis now coming from investment-grade. If you include leases with the subsidiaries of investment-grade tenants, that's about 37%, so we really think doing that along with portfolio sales if those initiatives be through, added diversification by industry and tenant or geography or whether its tenant credit or the industries we are targeting and investing in, we believe the quality the cash flow generated by the portfolios have been significantly enhanced over the last three years. We will continue to pursue those initiatives. I am very pleased so far.","Let us move on then to first the property dispositions that continues to grow a bit. During 2011, we sold 26 properties for $24 million. In 2012, we sold 44 for $50 million. For 2013, we would anticipate to be at least $100 million and we think we will get more than half of that done in the first half of the year. So we may be able to exceed that number going forward and that will be a thing that we just slowly move ahead.","The focus there is really trying to improve the credit quality of the portfolio and decrease our exposures in certain industries. To date, that\u2019s been primarily in restaurants, primarily casual dining which, as I mentioned, continues to decline as a segment in the portfolio. Then we also have targeted convenient stores for a number of sales. Then any properties with tenants that tend to be smaller and we think are more exposed to a downturn in the economy.","The focus there is really trying to reduce exposure to this discretionary purchases from (inaudible) income consumers and if you watch them today there is a lot of these people in this country that are living on paycheck-to-paycheck and without savings and any movement or economic event really has an impact on them on a current basis relative to their expenditures. So we are trying to move away from that area and either have a deep value proposition or, as I said, stick with basics.","Lets move on to property acquisitions. 2012, as we noted, was a record year for acquisitions. That\u2019s before we get to the ARCT transaction. We continue to be very active moving into 2013.","Let me turn it over to John Case who is our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer and he will walk you through the year and where we see things going. John?","John Case","So the fourth quarter was a very active quarter for us for acquisitions. As you know, we acquired 189 properties, investing approximately $447 million in acquisitions. This was third most acquisitive quarter in our company's history, finishing only behind the fourth quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of last year. The average cap rate of the fourth quarter acquisitions was 7.4% at an average lease term of 15 years.","Credit profiles of the tenants we added was quite attractive. 63% of the acquisitions are leased to tenants with investment-grade ratings. These properties were leased to 13 tenants in 10 separate industries. Five of the 13 tenants are new tenant and dollar stores and health and fitness were the largest industries represented. These properties were geographically diversified located in 27 states and 80% of the fourth quarter acquisitions were comprised of our traditional retail assets.","So for the full year 2012, that brought us to $1 6 billion in acquisitions activity comprised of 423 properties. This is the most we have ever completed in any calendar year and it surpassed our previous record in 2011 of $1.02 billion. The full year acquisitions were done at an average cap rate of 7.22% with a weighted average lease term of just over 14.5 years. We continue to improve our tenant credit profile, as Tom has alluded to, last year 64% of the acquisitions were leased to tenants with investment-grade ratings.","They were leased to 29 tenants in 23 separate industries. Dollar stores, wholesale clubs and fitness were the largest industries represented in last year's acquisitions. We were able to 16 new tenants in four new industries. The properties were located in 37 states and 78% of the acquisitions were comprised of our traditional retail assets. About 80% of our acquisitions activity last year was comprised of larger portfolio transactions. These are transactions that are $75 million or greater. So those larger transactions are really what drive our volume from year-to-year as you know.","Let me spend a few minutes talking about the acquisitions market today. It continues to be as active as we have ever seen it. In 2012, we sourced $17 billion in acquisition opportunities. Now this outsourcing number is everything that comes in our door in terms of acquisitions' opportunities that meet some of our investment parameters, so we analyze this and we are on a fair amount of amount of it and eventually we ended up closing the $1.1 6 billion. The $17 billion was also a record year for acquisitions, sourcing and transaction flow for us surpassing 2011 when we sourced $13 billion in acquisition opportunities.","Of the properties we sourced last year about 55% were leased to investment-grade tenants. Today, the market continues to be competitive. Looking forward, we continue to see an active pipeline of opportunities. There are a lot of sellers in the market that are attracted by the attractive pricing and significant transaction volumes we are seeing in the net lease sector today.","We're engaged in numerous discussions and we are currently projecting $550 million acquisitions at an initial yield of 7.25% for 2013, but the ultimate amount now we complete will be determined by our success on the larger portfolio of transactions as we've discussed before.","Let me spend a moment on pricing. Cap rates are holding steady to where they were in late 2012. Investment-grade properties ranged from a low 6% to low 7% range, non-investment grade properties range in the low 7% to the low 8% cap rate range. Cap rates have continued to decline over the last few years. Of course, year they averaged 7.2%. In 2011, they averaged 7.8% and in 2010, 7.9%. This is a function of declining yield and interest rate environment and also more importantly are working up the credit curve and doing substantially more acquisitions with investment-grade tenants.","Our investment spreads and margins, however, continue to increase and are at historical highs. Let me spend a moment this. Our 2012 average cap rate of 7.22% represents the 190-basis point spread to our nominal cost of equity. And again, that's our FFO yield adjusted for the cost of raising the equity. That 190 basis points compares favorably to our average spread of 114 basis points over the previous 19 years of our company since right our IPO, and with the acquired assets primarily leased to non-investment-grade tenants.","In 2011, our spreads to our nominal cost of equity was 170 basis points with 40% of our acquisitions were with investment-grade tenants, so we improved our spreads by 20 basis points year-over-year, while we increased our percentage of acquisition leased to investment-grade tenants from 40% in 2011 to 64% in 2012. This was a very attractive outcome for us.","Now, as you know, we also track our cap rates relative to 10-year treasury yields. Since our IPO in 1994, our cap rates have averaged about 475 basis points over the corresponding 10-year treasury yields. In 2012, our cap rates averaged 545 basis points over the average 10-year treasury yield with 64% of our acquisitions leased to investment-grade tenants. In 2011, our cap rates averaged 505 basis points over the 10-year treasury yield with 40% of our acquisitions again leased to investment-grade tenants.","So, we've been able to improve our investment spreads based both, on our nominal cost of equity and 10-year treasury yields while continuing to move up the credit curve in 2012. Tom?","Thomas Lewis","Thanks, John. We are obviously very pleased with acquisitions closed for the year and where spreads are given increasing credit as John said and remain optimistic about additional acquisitions this year and what is pretty robust flow of opportunities to look at right now. I would like to note the timing of the acquisitions that came in for 2012. It's kind of interesting to examine. In the first quarter of last year, we acquired a grand total of two properties for $10.7 million. In the second quarter we acquired 145 properties for $210.8 million. Third quarter, acquired 87 properties for $496 million. Then, in the fourth quarter acquired 189 properties for $446.5 million.","Couple of thoughts on that. Our acquisitions, and we have talked about this over the years, but for anybody new, it tends to be lumpy. That was the case in 2012 and we think that will continue to be the case quarter-over-quarter. I wouldn\u2019t look at that as a trendline. They tend to bounce around during the year. It is also ultimately, the volume, as John said, the function of how many larger transaction we closed or don\u2019t close.","So far this year, we think $550 million we are using for planning purposes. It is the most we want to model this early in the year. Even though we think, at this point, the first half of 2013 will be stronger than the first half of 2012 but we will adjust that as the year goes on but that\u2019s what our guidance is based on. Again, the big transactions are really going to drive that.","The other ongoing observation is that acquisitions tend to accelerate late in each quarter and certainly later in the year. That was again the case in 2012 with $942 million of the $1.16 billion coming in the second half of the year. That means a couple of things. The first is the majority of the revenue and FFO from 2012 acquisitions will manifest itself here in 2013. That\u2019s pretty typical.","It also means we bought and closed on 276 properties for $942 million in really the last five months of the year and that was at the same time that we were working on preparing for the closing of the ARCT transaction with another 500 plus properties. I would really like to take a second and give credit to our staff, particularly acquisitions and legal and accounting teams for their efforts over the last few months of the year when the productivity, to say the least, was really outstanding and the hours put in were long.","We have talked a couple of times over the last few years about working on our systems and adding staff to handle additional growth which we have been doing for a couple of years. I will tell you doing that really paid off and allowed us to process that additional volume and move to efficiently integrate it into our systems and portfolio. I would note though that we will need to do that again to continue to grow at a substantial rate. Gary Malino, our President, Chief Operating Officer and I will spend a fair amount of our time this year focused on that again on people and systems.","Let me talk specifically for a moment about the ARCT integration process. That\u2019s going very smoothly, as a great deal of the work was done during the solicitation process on the transaction. But it is a huge volume of work. The tough stuff that was done really as we went along and are mostly done, are the loan assumptions, the entity consolidations, lease reviews, property reviews, title and accounting is pretty much finished. We are really just down to a few outliers here and there. So I would characterize the integration overall as about 80% to 90% finished here just a couple of weeks after closing.","We were helped significantly by the fact that both companies utilize the same software platform, which really helped the integration and then also as you recall in this, there were no management or employee integration issues that came with the transaction. So the majority of what is left is primarily additional data entry and submerging the files and in some remaining lease compliance work. We think we can get almost all of it, if not all, done here in the first quarter.","Anyway, to tie-up acquisitions, we think both on a granular basis and on larger transactions, it will continue to really be acquisitions but it is going to drive the revenue and play the largest role there in our AFFO and our dividends and certainly in the efforts to make ongoing change in the portfolio. To put it in perspective relative to those changes, the last 36 months or so, we have acquired, about $6 billion of property, including ARCT. $3.6 billion or 60% of it is in retail and most in sectors that we are targeting and we think we will continue to perform for us in what's been a pretty tepid retail environment","$2.4 billion or 40% is outside of retail in the sectors with very large tenants. We think will do fine. Then of the $6 billion, $3.8 or 63% was done with investment-grade tenants and a good measure of the rest of the acquisitions, all were also up the credit curve from where the portfolio stood if you go back four or five years. So good progress on that plan.","The other side of that is also funding these transactions. In funding them last three years, we've executed four equity offerings that generated about $1 billion in proceeds. And then in the ARCT transaction did a direct issuance of about $2 billion of equity, so it was about $3 billion of issuance. We did as you recall last year about little over $400 million in perpetual preferred, about $1.12 billion in investment-grade rated bonds and notes that we put out and assume $710 million in mortgages, most of which we plan to pay off in the next few years and then generated about $100 million property sales, so about $5.3 billion of capital on that $6 billion in acquisitions.","Relative to the balance sheet and access to capital, we are in pretty good shape as Paul mentioned. We do have dry powder to close acquisitions. The $1 billion credit facility with $500 million accordion is very helpful in that, but obviously and as Paul alluded to given the closing of ARCRT and the balance on the line, we'll look to access additional capital.","Equity is attractive here as is debt preferred and they are all available and the rates are good. And, for those of us who has followed us a while, I think will want to keep the balance sheet conservative and so the mix of capital should remain pretty similar relative to the debt equity and preferred to where we've been for a number of years now.","2012, good year as I mentioned. A lot of activity that will accrue to our benefit this year. Paul mentioned, we are keeping with the FFO guidance at of $2.32 million, $2.38 million. That's 14.9% to 17.8% growth and AFFO of $2.33 million to $2.39 million, which is 13.1% to 16% growth.","Last comment will be on dividends. Obviously the last six, eight months have been active with substantial increases in the dividend approaching around $0.42 a share and we remain optimistic that our activities will support continued dividend increases during 2013, and I appreciate everybody's patience, but I think we got the most of it. And, Katya, we will now open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman. Please come ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","Good afternoon, guys. Just given John's commentary earlier on the call about an attractive environment for sellers and pricing staying flat to let's call it a little bit richer than it's been over the last couple of years. Why aren't you selling more into it? I mean, 100 million of dispositions, especially as you try to ramp up, your investment-grade portion of the portfolio seems like it's a low number.","Paul Meurer","Well, I noted it is accelerating, but you are right and we would like to do more, but one of the things that John mentioned was about 80% of the acquisitions are in large transactions and about 100% of the sales are in one-off transactions and rather granular. And if you look at what we have been trying to sell with the C stores and also casual dining restaurants, those are fairly small number, so it is a fairly labor-intensive operation and we also probably would have had a higher volume this year, but we did have a big block of properties probably another $50 million, $60 million that we just started to put on the market and then some M&A activity with the tenant started and that turns out we are getting an upgrade in some of the credit and may not want to sell it. So, I agree. We would like to accelerate it. It is a good market to do into, and if we can go well past the $100 million, we would like to do it.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","Got you, and then I think you touched on this earlier. I might have missed it. the 0.1% same-store growth. Can you first of all clarify if that's GAAP or cash, and then I think you said that that would accelerate as some tenants get pulled out of the mix. Maybe if you could just repeat that for me?","Paul Meurer","Sure. Yes. It was 0.1% for the year overall and 0.4%. That is cash not GAAP, and normally will run from 1 to 1.5, and if you recall at the start last year we had to tenant issues Friendly's and Buffets, where we did have some rent reductions and during the year we disclosed both, what it would be without and with it for the year that's how you get to that 0.1% numbers, but a lot of that burned off the fourth quarter.","Absent that, I think, same-store rent growth this year would have been 1.3% to 1.5%, somewhere in there. And, so with that burning off and the way the leases were structured, no tenant issues. We really anticipate the first-quarter will bounce back closer to 1.5% and then during the year run between 1% to 1.5% same-store rent growth.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","Perfect. My last question, I think you mentioned something about double net properties. Maybe you could help me figure out what that would be?","Thomas Lewis","Sure, it is a large portfolio. So there is a lot of everything and for the most part, it is tripled net lease but in some of these properties that we buy, the lease structure particularly contained from a developer maybe different and maybe taxes, maintenance, insurance, but we may have roof responsibilities, then it\u2019s a new roof down the line. There could be some other things that are in there.","So when it's not triple we just call it double but it is probably more like two and three quarters or two and a half. Anybody else want to add in to that?","John Case","That\u2019s right. Most of it is on little bit of property maintenance responsibilities.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","But it typically wouldn\u2019t be anything outside of that. So you wouldn\u2019t be responsible for taxes or anything more major than\u2026","John Case","That can happen all the time but that\u2019s primarily not the case with most of non-full triple net stuff that we own.","Thomas Lewis","It's primarily just responsibilities with regard to roofing and parking on 90% of those.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","Right","John Case","There, a minority of the properties that we think it is important to bring it up that if you see a little bit of property expenses that\u2019s where the words coming from. But don\u2019t see a huge acceleration.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","But otherwise they are similar to the rest of your portfolio in being single tenant large (inaudible).","Thomas Lewis","Yes, and we have had these issues over the years on an ongoing basis. It is just a little larger now. So we brought it up.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","Thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber. Please go ahead.","Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, good afternoon. Tom and John, as you were mentioning that increasingly more and more of your regular acquisitions are on investment-grade properties. I am wondering why a lot of those tenants are increasingly looking at net lease financing especially given that they should have other credit availabilities? That should be there. It used to be, I guess, the trade-off for a lot of the tenants was the high-yield market or nothing or net lease financing but I am wondering why more and more of those are looking at net lease financing given the absolutely high coupons that seems to be out there as opposed to other sources of financing? Can you maybe walk us through that a little bit?","Thomas Lewis","Yes, there's always been, I think, in retail, which is a smaller preponderance of it. If somebody is really trying to rollout over time using net lease financing relative to their immediate construction. So that\u2019s has been around, and you have particularly seen it in the drugstore segment. So it's become kind of normal and then crept around more in retail. Sometimes it's with people on the street are really putting some pressure on companies to look at their balance sheet and try and unlock some value.","As you know, there is a lot of those discussions today going on around the country on the Opco\/propco side and when you get those discussions going, even if people don\u2019t do it then they start looking at what's on the balance sheet and start running the numbers relative to their return on investment and other areas. I think it also started just happening a little bit going back to 2008, 2009 where even some very strong credit started looking at some issues relative to financial flexibility and coming out of that started thinking about real estate a little bit.","Traditionally it was less than investment-grade. It was really early 2000, 2001, we started working a lot with private equity and bringing that up. But its a very common discussion now on the street relative to looking at the real estate and using it. So if you get to the Fortune 500 and Fortune 1,000, a lot of their real estate decisions are outsourced with a group of developers and very often there is just a decision when working with the developer that they not going to keep those assets and some of them come off that way.","But I think there is just more and more talk going on about what's on the balance sheet and how you provide flexibility and use it. So we haven\u2019t seen it like this relative to those discussions particularly in the investment-grade for as long as I have been doing this.","Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Especially after the Diageo acquisition a couple of years ago and as you mentioned with increasingly a greater numbers of REITs out there with the Opco\/propco structure. Is that something that you guys would look at with increasingly different asset classes that are out there? Or you would that be a lot less likely to happen?","Paul Meurer","It is it is very interesting. There is an awful lot of discussion and you know we have had a few companies announce that they are either looking at it or going to do it. Then there has been some movement in our equity and that always causes bankers and lawyers and accountants to more and more discussions and that\u2019s kind of the phase it's at right now. Then the question is, will they get done and if they get done, what will a single tenant REIT trade out and are traditional REIT investors going to accept that or is going to trade at a higher yield?","If a bunch of them get going then typically the first one's probably do pretty well and then you have to see but relative to what it means to us, I think from a tax standpoint for most of those to be done on a tax-free basis more than 50% of the equity has to remain with the company spinning off and that has to happen for a couple of years, so it would take a bunch of those, A, happening and, B, a couple of years going by. And then C, probably valuations not meeting expectations before there would be some opportunities. And given the size of the portfolio now there might be some places where we could invest. If all of that happened, given our size it really wouldn't hit massive concentrations.","Absent that, we just think it's positive to, again begin the discussions are going on in boardrooms around the country about now you can add value using the real estate, and I think it will accrue to our benefit. How much? We just don't know.","Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus","I think the single tenant concept does concern a lot of people, but if that was a 2% tenant exposure for realty income I think a lot of people may just about that differently.","John Case","Perfect. And if it is an investment grade tenant or somebody that we really like an assets or special you could also make that five and six, because if you just look, I mean obviously FedEx does get the real estate off balance sheet that's 5.5%, so now we could take those on and I think in larger numbers as we get larger, but we'd step too if they are.","Paul Meurer","Nothing in the near-term by the way.","Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon. Please go ahead.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Two housekeeping questions. First, apologies if I missed this in your earlier remarks. What was the acquisition expense in 4Q aside from ARCT cost?","Paul Meurer","$2.4 million for the year and I just don't have it on my fingertips on what it was in the fourth quarter.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","I'll follow-up offline. Then secondly, what was the difference between the impairment amounts on the income statement versus the FFO calculation?","Paul Meurer","Where you looking?","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","The first was provisions for impairment on the income statement, let me put my spectacles on, 28.04, and then add back in the FFO calculation was 44.72 and I am just wondering what that difference represents. I recognize that's a smaller number.","Paul Meurer","Right. I am trying to find where you are looking at in the add back, Paula, those are two we'll go figure out.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","That's fine. No problem. And then just sort of a bigger picture just to sort of stay on the theme of the acquisition environment, Tom, I appreciated your color in your prepared remarks on the lines of trade diversification. And aside from your comments about continuing to want to gravitate away from those tenants that have a customer base that are paycheck-to-paycheck, how does that diversification across the line of trades stack up relative to your sort of ideal target. And, how does that compare with the opportunity set that you are seeing currently.","Thomas Lewis","Yes. I mean, the opportunity set is wide, so there is a lot of things that comes across the transom that we might have done a few years ago that we are not doing and moving away from casual dining would be one. We still like convenience store, but that might be another so we could buy a lot more if we really didn't have this view in terms of where we want to take the portfolio.","One of the things that's happened that's been very fortunate is a few more of the investment-grade retailers are out in the market with opportunities where they just weren't few years ago, and then also that, we've widened than that, so we can move outside of retail dealing with larger tenants, so that's really given us the opportunity to do that. I think if I could stop my fingers and make an instantaneous change in the portfolio is one of the questions was earlier why don't you go faster. We would like to, but part of this is matching up opportunities and growing cash flow and dividends with what may be burn rate on that selling a few things.","So, right now there is plenty of opportunities out there, some of which weren't a few years ago and we really, really do want to migrate the portfolio, particularly up the credit curve and away from casual dining. I keep using that, but I use it because obviously have the consumers in the United States are more are middle lower income and that's where like we are currently seeing with the payroll tax and if $20 or $40 goes out of their paycheck, it goes out at other spending, because there is not a buffer.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Great. Thanks very much. That's all I had.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik. Please go ahead.","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","Hi. Good afternoon thanks for taking my questions, guys. Just a few more on the acquisitions, on the $550 million expectation built in for 2013, does that includes an expectation of any portfolio deals within that 550 million, or would they all be incremental to that?","Thomas Lewis","No, I think it includes portfolio transactions but it's one of those where it looks like the first quarter is going to be pretty good and then you move on from there. We are looking at some portfolio transactions but you don\u2019t know how many come through. So, as you know, in the past we started at 250 and kind of guided up as the year went by, but given the last three years of $1.1 billion $1.7 billion. The flow, we sit here and look at each other, look at the first quarter and say, during the course of the year we ought to get there, but as John mentioned 80% last year was larger transaction.","So in this, I would say, at least half is.","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","Okay, and then you mentioned the increase in staff and adding people to help deal with larger flow of acquisitions. Is that were the majority of the increase in staff is going and could you maybe compare the staff that\u2019s responsible for evaluating these deals today versus what it was, say, in 2009 before you embarked on the portfolio diversification strategy?","John Case","Yes, we probably added a couple people down there in that and in acquisitions a couple people. Then it just floats around the building because a lot of this was systems and just volume. I think looking forward to this year, that\u2019s where the differential will be. I think we may have a pretty good add this year in acquisitions once again and a pretty good add maybe five or six in the research area, be it in real estate research and then maybe an executive or two with specific expertise. Then again, I think, just looking at all the volume we added this year and moving towards capacity, you have to add ones and twos throughout the building by department.","So I think this will be the year and it may not be exactly calendar that that will flow in and I am really thinking specifically in research and specific segments with some people we can bring in that have done a lot of work there and research and acquisitions, primarily.","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","Okay, then the $17 billion you mentioned in deals that came through your door last year. Does that include ARCT?","Paul Meurer","Yes, that does include ARCT.","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","Okay, and then with regards to the industry exposures you were talking about, I guess in recent history you were comfortable in then some of those industries being near about 20% of revenues. Is there a new target that you have in mind in terms of where you wouldn\u2019t want to go beyond now? I know the C stores are around 12%. Could some industry concentration go higher than that or are you still looking to lower those across the board?","Thomas Lewis","Well, we are at about 20% as the farthest we would ever go but we don\u2019t like 20% near as much as we did, and one of the things just really watching going through the recession, while we sailed through it is those exposures you did sit and worry about, and as we get to the size in 44 different industries, which is very fortunate that you can bring that down. So I now look at 10% as being on the high side and it needs to be just because there is a particular opportunity that came along and its something we really like but we can keep them down around five that is just great the would be a great event.","The exception obviously is if you end up working in an industry where you have got three or four really top light Fortune 500 type credit sitting in there. But the answer is, yes, the lower number is better.","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","Okay, and then last one for me. I think you guys had announced that you would do a dividend increase early this year regardless of whether ARCT closed and I am just wondering what thoughts are going forward in terms of evaluating the fifth dividend increase throughout the year and whether or not you expect that to continue to happen around the August time frame? Or whether those will be more fluid discussions throughout the year?","Thomas Lewis","With the payout ratio, if you look about where guidance is up around 91, I will tell you, we are comfortable, given the size of the portfolio and the added diversification you referenced. We would like to walk that back down but it is really rose been a mid to high 80s type companies. So its not material and whether that happens over a year or two, we are open to.","So I am going to first say, it will be a more fluid decision. I think the four increases or something that we would plan on. then it is going to be really taking the pulse. We recently use August. It is usually by then we put a fair amount on the books and then we have some clarity relative to how the third and fourth quarters are going to look. That gives a little ability to see what the impact of that fifth dividend is. Not so much in 2013 but 2014.","So we are really not to be in a position to know until we get later in the year, but given obviously we did the increase in August $0.06 a share and then we did $0.35. We front loaded it a little bit of it but I wouldn\u2019t want to take it off the table at this point.","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","Right, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore. Please go ahead.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good afternoon, guys. Tom, did you guys looking at Cole at all? The Cole that is sold to, in the portfolio, but sold to the Spirit?","Thomas Lewis","We look at lots of stuff, and as you can imagine given the size get an opportunity. Look, we think most everything comes across the line and that be a logical thing to do, but on everything that comes in John references the $17 billion. There is a tremendous amount we've signed confidentiality agreements on and so it's our policy not to reference transactions that we didn't do and so I wouldn't want to go beyond that, but I will tell you there has been a lot of activity in the space over the last year and I did it would be surprising if there were things we didn't look at.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Fair enough. Then do you think there are more of those kind of entities that will be coming along? I mean, is that are we done or is it just coal and ARCT, or they are more out there currently. I am just wondering if they will be making their way to market. ","Thomas Lewis ","It's interesting a lot of that is generated by the private REIT space, where there's just a tremendous amount of money being raised through the financial advisor community for those type assets and traditionally if you go back, had this longer life which as of late, Scott, shortened up because the liquidity event is something that obviously is considered favorable by those people that would put these on the client's portfolio for a number of reasons economic being some of it and then secondarily I think it also enhances the, say, business model of the sponsor, and so I would see more coming since there's a lot being raised.","And if you look at that business, where traditionally it was a lot wider relative to the property types they were dealing in a good part of businesses net lease today. I think there is more out there and then I would reference back to just a lot of the Opco\/propco-type stuff. So, it's hard to what it will be property type stuff, so it's hard to know what it will be but I think there will be some larger transactions coming out there.","The good time to mention, we over the years on an M&A slide and you and I have talked about this about, have had a lot of opportunities and things presented that could have been done and one of the real challenges is, underwriting in one fell swoop, big portfolio like this. We spend a lot of time underwriting on a very granular basis and this comes along and it really puts pressure on the underwriting side of it.","And if you look at this particular transaction it was one where it was mostly investment-grade and it was a lot of the same tenants we work in, in areas that we had targeted and that was one of the reasons we are do it and it was also a fairly new portfolio, so the leases were long. But, with some of these as they age and they come to market, then it brings up a lot of those issues that might make it a little more troublesome for us, but we do want to look at all them.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Good. Thanks, and that kind of answers a little bit the next question I have which is going back to selling of assets, I mean, I am curious why you guys might not do a portfolio-type sale given that, I understand that there is cash flow implications, but you are obviously buying a lot of things as a matter fact. If you only about $550 million worth of stuff this year, you kind of wonder you would even have to clear the line of credit, so I kind of think you will do more than that. So if you are doing more than that, I mean, why not a portfolio transaction if there is someone that can evaluate the portfolio and then get rid of the bottom 2% of your portfolio kid of thing?","Paul Meurer","Right. While they may be our stepchild, we love our stepchild, and doing it in volume presents some issues for the ongoing cash flow stream and its consistency, which since will be monthly dividend company. That's very important. We did look at a couple of those ideas I referenced earlier about block of C stores and ended up pulling it off the market so we may do a bit more of that.","And as were buying like ARCT, I have been asked are you guys going to sell part of that. We really as you know have taken the entire portfolio and do it again and stratify it, and we do have about I would say 20% of the portfolio that we would like to move up over time, but some of those are also properties that have been on the books, so the leases are little shorter and some of them have some other characteristics that make it a little more challenging in a bulk transactions. So, again, I think if people think towards the hundred-and-over number for this year, that's probably the right one.","Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. very good. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer portion of the Realty Income's conference call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Crum, Senior Associate. Please go ahead, sir.","Andrew Crum","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter 2018 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.","Sumit Roy","Thanks, Andrew. Welcome to our call today. We completed another year of strong operating performance, delivering favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. We are pleased to have provided our shareholders with a 15.2% total shareholder return in 2018, meaningfully outperforming major benchmark indices. During the year, we invested $1.8 billion in real estate properties and increased AFFO per share by 4.2% to $3.19.","We ended 2018 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.3 times, which positions us well entering 2019 with ample liquidity and flexibility to pursue our growth initiatives, while maintaining a conservative capital structure. 2019 marks the 50th anniversary of our company's founding and the 25th year since our public listing. And we are proud to have increased the dividend 100 times in our company's history as of the February 2019 dividend payment.","We entered 2019 from a position of strength and we are introducing 2019 AFFO per share guidance of $3.25 to $3.31, which represents annual growth of approximately 2% to 4%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property types, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At year-end, our properties were leased to 262 commercial tenants in 48 different industries, located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 82% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties.","The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at just over 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.3% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12.4% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio approximately 95% of our rent come from tenants with a service nondiscretionary and\/or low price point component to their business.","We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants.","The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9 times, on a 4-wall basis, while the median is 2.7 times. Our watch list at 1.5% of rent consistent with our levels of the last few years. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.6%, an increase of 20 basis points versus the year ago period. We expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2019. During the quarter, we re-leased 62 properties, recapturing approximately 94% of the expiring rent.","There were three leases that primarily contributed to the lower rent recapture in the fourth quarter. And absent these three leases, our rent recapture would have been approximately 100%. During 2018, we re-leased 228 properties, recapturing approximately 103% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2,900 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.","Our same-store rental revenue increased 0.8% during the quarter and 0.9% in 2018. These results are consistent with our projected run rate for 2019 of approximately 1%. The methodology for our same-store pool excludes properties that were vacant, underdevelopment or redevelopment or involved in eminent domain actions during any point of the comparable periods.","Our methodology is consistent with how we manage our portfolio, isolating our rental rate trends on leased assets. However, we recognized that some in the investment community prefer to analyze this metric without excluding any properties. Consistent with last year we are presenting an additional disclosure on an annual basis, which reflects our same-store rental revenue growth, inclusive of all properties owned for the entirety of the comparable periods. In 2018, our same-store rental revenue growth for all properties owned in both comparable years was 0.5% of rent. Approximately 87% of our leases have contractual rent increases.","Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Paul Meurer","Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter and year, starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 4.7% for the quarter and 5.1% for the year, which was in line with our full year projection, but these percentages exclude approximately $18.7 million of severance related to expenses associated with our prior CEO's departure in the fourth quarter. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net leased REIT sector.","For 2019, we expect our G&A to be less than 5% of rental and other revenues. Our non-reimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 1.8% for the quarter and 1.5% for the year, which represents an improvement from 2% in 2017. The improvement was largely due to lower bad debt expenses in 2018. For 2019, we expect non-reimbursable property expenses to be in the 1.5% to 1.75% range.","Funds from operations or FFO per share were $0.73 for the quarter and $3.12 for the year, both of which includes the $0.06 per share impact of the CEO's severance recognized during the quarter. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.79 per share for the quarter and $3.19 for the year, which represents a 4.2% increase over 2017.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and we remained one of only a few REITs with at least AA ratings. During the fourth quarter, we issued $539 million of common equity, primarily through our ATM program at approximately $63 per share. For the full year, we raised approximately $1.1 billion of equity at approximately $59 per share, finishing the year with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.3 times. And our fixed charge coverage remains healthy 4.4 times.","The weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 8.7 years, which closely tracks our weighted average remaining lease term. Our overall debt maturity schedule remained in excellent shape. After repaying the $70 million Tau term loan, that matured last month, we now have only $21 million of debt coming due for the remainder of 2019. And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. As we discussed in detail during last quarter's call, we were pleased to close on our new $3.25 billion unsecured credit facility in October and we ended 2018 with only $252 million outstanding on our $3 billion revolver. Our revolver borrowing spread of 77.5 basis points over LIBOR remains the tightest pricing grid in the REIT industry.","In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and excellent liquidity.","Now, let me turn the call back over to Sumit.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, Paul. During the fourth quarter, we invested $332 million in 180 properties located in 30 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.2 years. As a reminder, our initial cash cap rate is cash and not GAAP, which tends to be higher due to straight lining of rents. On a revenue basis, approximately 24% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 97.1% of the revenues are generated from retail.","These assets are leased to 16 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are quick service restaurants, childcare and convenience stores. We closed 10 discrete transactions in the fourth quarter. During 2018, we invested $1.8 billion in 764 properties, located in 39 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years.","On a revenue basis, 59% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 96% of the revenues are generated from retail and 4% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 44 different tenants in 21 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, restaurants and childcare. Of the 49 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 8 transactions were above $50 million.","Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. During the fourth quarter, we sourced more than $6.5 billion in acquisition opportunities. Of the opportunities sourced during the fourth quarter, 34% were portfolios and 66% or approximately $4.3 billion were one-off assets. During 2018, we have sourced approximately $32 billion in potential transactions. Of these opportunities 54% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 46% or approximately $15 billion were one-off assets.","Investment grade opportunities represented 32% of the volume sourced for the fourth quarter. Of the $332 million in acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 9% of volume were one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates were generally unchanged in the fourth quarter. Investment grade properties continued to trade from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trade from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.","Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging approximately 197 basis points in the fourth quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.","Our investment pipeline remains quite healthy and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remained the only publicly traded net lease company that has the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis.","During 2018, approximately 75% of our acquisitions were sale leaseback transactions and we expect this channel to remain a core contributor of our future investment activity. We had an active year in acquisitions during 2018 and are introducing 2019 acquisitions guidance of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.","Consistent with our historical acquisition guidance practices, this estimate reflects our typical flow business. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 67 properties for net proceeds of $56.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 15.2% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.3%. This brings us to 127 properties sold year-to-date or $139.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 11.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.1%.","We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of non-strategic assets, recycling the sale proceeds into real estate properties that better fit our investment parameters. We are anticipating between $75 million and $100 million of dispositions in 2019.","Last month, we increased the dividend for the 100th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 3% increase over the year ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 82.5% based on the midpoint of 2019 AFFO guidance. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index.","To wrap it up, we've entered 2019 well-positioned to continue to drive shareholder value and we are excited about our prospects moving forward. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now go first to Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.","Greg McGinniss","Hey, good afternoon. This is Greg McGinniss on for Nick. Sumit you mentioned previously about becoming more bullish on development versus acquisitions if yields are higher compared to acquisitions but how actively are you actually pursuing opportunities in this space? Could we see a major expansion of this investment over the next few years or maybe even sooner?","Sumit Roy","Look development has always been something that we focused on since we introduced the asset management team about 4-5 years ago, repositioning of assets, working with our tenants on expansion opportunities that is very core to what we do. The program itself has ranged anywhere between $50 million to call it $150 million. And what I've stated in the past is a desire to grow that. And it's going to be our definition of major, what does that mean? Are we suddenly going to tomorrow announce that we are doing $600 million of development, probably not. But it is a focus within the four-walls of this company and this is something that we believe is a low-hanging fruit, given the higher yields that we can generate.","And by taking on risk that is very well quantified, most of these are built to suit. It's working with our existing tenants and it's essentially working on the portfolio that we have. So I think of it more as development financing than true development as defined by the real estate space. But it is absolutely a focus and we hope to increase the size of the development pipeline that we have.","Greg McGinniss","So maybe some modest gains in development pipeline over the next few years then?","Sumit Roy","Yes. Modest to -- depending on how this program takes off. We would certainly like for it to be larger than what it is currently, which is a $50 million development pipeline.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Christy McElroy with Citi.","Christy McElroy","Hi. Good afternoon, guys, or good morning to you. Just in regard to your occupancy guidance of 98% in 2019. I'm not sure if that's referring to property or economic occupancy and I know it's rounded so it could be something like 98.3%. But either way it looks like you're expecting occupancy to trend down a bit from the current level. How should we be reading that?","Sumit Roy","Yes. To answer your question, it's 98% in terms of property count, so it's physical occupancy that we generally tend to, to give out Christy. Part of what we have always shared with the market is a desire for active asset management and there are certain decisions that we have to make when it comes to a particular property that is getting handed back to us. Do we hold onto the asset, because we feel looking at it from an economic perspective, that the outcome is greater from an economic perspective by holding onto this asset. The down side of that decision obviously is that it impacts your occupancy numbers. But that is a decision that we, as a company, have chosen to make and we believe that the normalized level of occupancy is right around that 98% line.","And like you correctly pointed out, it could be 98.3%, 98.4%, 98.2% or even just 98%. So that's the ZIP Code that we want to play in. To put our 98.6% in perspective that we achieved at the end of 2018, if you look at the year-end occupancy numbers for Realty Income over the last 12 years, this is the highest occupancy that we have achieved. One other things that we are trying to do is in the event we decide to make -- we decide we do the analysis and we come to the conclusion that an asset should be sold, we are not going to hold onto it for longer than it needs to be. And that has clearly helped in the recent years to build that occupancy number higher. But at the same time, if the decision is -- and it could be disproportionate for a given year to hold onto certain assets, because we feel like that the economic outcome is superior by holding onto those assets then that is a decision that we are very comfortable making which will have a negative impact. Having said all of that, the guidance that we are giving for 2019 is approximately 98%, but we hope to beat that and is it going to be 98.6%? I can't tell you that today. But it should be north of 98%.","Christy McElroy","Okay. Thank you for that. And then just in terms of the equity issuance you overfunded what you needed during Q4 obviously. It seems like you effectively prefunded some of your planned investment activity for 2019. Is that fair? Maybe you can give us your thoughts on that and sort of what's embedded in your guidance for 2019 for equity issuance?","Sumit Roy","Yes I'll have Paul take that question.","Paul Meurer","Yes. Hey, Christy. That's fair. We wanted to take advantage of a good trading environment for the stock towards year-end. We thought that it was prudent to do so. And as we sit here today where we couldn't be happier about the state of the balance sheet in terms of the overall leverage and where it stands. In addition, we are always mindful of investor interest if you will. And some of that issuance occurred toward year-end based on investor appetite and some direct inquiry that we were receiving at that time for investment in our stock and that's something we pay attention to as well.","When we sit here today with balance sheet we're very, very pleased with and lots of good alternatives really on all fronts in terms of where the equity is priced, where our debt is currently priced and our ability to access the markets on either front to fund our growth for next year. But we don't have to lean in any one direction, so we certainly have the ability to be opportunistic relative to common equity or bond issuance.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for taking the question. Have one on just drugstores overall. I've just recently heard both Walgreens and CVS maybe more Walgreens they've been sort of looking at their leases, pushing pretty hard on getting sort of rents down and maybe they've been doing this all the time, but there seems to be more of an emphasis now. I'm wondering if you've heard or seen that? I know your leases don't expire, but I'm wondering if you've heard or seen that, one, as it pertains to drugstores; and two, if you can just let us know if any of the CVS stores you have are candidates for the new health hubs that's they're creating?","Sumit Roy","Thanks for your question, Vikram. As you correctly pointed out most of our -- the drugstore asset that we own through sale leasebacks they are in the -- probably in the 20% of the leases into 15- or 17-year leases that we have left. So we haven't really had to deal with near term expirations on Walgreens or CVSs. The one thing I will point out is anytime you start to see rents north of $25, $26 per quare feet and this is a general comment, obviously some of it will be dictated by the markets that these assets reside in, but anytime you see rents above that, you should expect to get into a pretty heated negotiations with CVSs and Walgreens. Part of the reason why we did and we grew our drugstore portfolio through sale-leasebacks was because we were very cognizant of trying to right size the rent. There are some assets that we have that we've attained through portfolio transactions where we didn't control and we do have some higher rents. But by and enlarge we are very happy with our average rents on the Walgreens that we have and some of the CVSs that we have. So that's the first part of your question.","On the second part of your question, I don't think they've still made up their minds in terms of what is the prototype that they would like to make ubiquitous across their platform. I know that they're trying multiple different prototypes and in some cases, it's very much geographically driven.","And so we haven't really received calls on the CVSs that we own, and some of which have them in the clinics as to -- hey, is there -- should we be repositioning it? I think they are still in the point -- still in the phase of trying to figure out what is the prototype that'll work and then potentially we may be getting calls for repositioning assets and working with them in that regard. But so far we haven't received that call.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, okay. And then just a second question. A bigger picture since you've become the CEO you've talked about following the traditional process that the company has done for many, many years. But at the same time you're exploring newer avenues for growth and maybe even newer subsectors. Any updates you can give us even a sense of the types of characteristics or sectors you are looking at for over the next few years?","Sumit Roy","So, look we just came out with an acquisitions guidance of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So we feel very comfortable in sharing with you that the pipeline, the sourcing within our existing strategy remains very strong. And fairly we have some level of visibility in the middle of February in terms of what we think we can do. But part of what -- and I think any good management team would be doing is to continue to explore avenues that are what I would consider to be adjacent verticals if you will of what we are currently doing.","And we have been doing that. We've -- an adjacent vertical could be just looking at something that we're doing and making it grow. That was the previous question on development. Would we want to grow that? Absolutely. And that is not doing something that we haven't done in the past, it's just doing more of what we have done in the past, because we feel very comfortable with the risk associated with doing build-to-suit development financing.","To talk about any of the other avenues that we are exploring, in my mind Vikram would be a bit premature. Let us do our work and at the appropriate time when we have something to talk about, we will absolutely bring it to the market and we will give you an explanation as to our thesis. But what I do want you to walk away from is knowing that it's not \u2013 we are not going to suddenly start investing in multifamily, it is going to be adjacent to what we do. It is expanding the envelope as we phrased it internally.","But it's going to be something that we are very comfortable taking on. We understand the industry, we understand operators and\/or it\u2019s adjacent to an industry that we are very comfortable with and we've done our underwriting and we feel very, very comfortable with that. So that's how I would want to answer that today.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.","Karin Ford","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I'm just trying to reconcile your guidance for 3% AFFO growth at the midpoint with the interesting chart you show on page 31 of your investor presentation. Based on about a $1.75 billion of acquisitions and 100 and 150 to 200 basis point spread between your cost of capital and your yields, the chart implies that AFFO growth should be in the 4% to 5% range. So should we read into guidance that you think spreads will actually be lower than what you've been achieving recently, or is there something else dragging on AFFO growth in 2019?","Sumit Roy","Thanks for your question Karin. No this is purely predicated on timing. If we believe that a lot of our acquisitions are going to be back-end loaded then, obviously, you don't get the benefit of a full year's worth of accretive acquisitions. A part of it could also be dictated by the spreads that we are able to achieve. But I don't think you should read that suddenly we are compromising on the spread and that is what's dictating our 3% growth and the midpoint of the range that we have shared with the market. So it's a combination of timing. It's a combination of the spreads.","If suddenly we start to trade off of where we are trading off that spread could get compromised. But it's not going to be a function of the cap rate. The cap rate is largely along the lines of what we have shown to the market over the last couple of years. So that's the product that we are pursuing and that's the product that's dictating the $1.5 billion to the $2 billion acquisition number.","Karin Ford","That makes sense. Just one more on guidance, last February you said initial acquisition guidance at $1 billion to $1.5 billion. You obviously raised it, through the years you got more visibility you ended up completing $1.8 billion. This year you started out at that higher level. Did you approach acquisition guidance any differently this year? What amount do you have line of sight on and how does the pipeline compare to last year?","Sumit Roy","Yes. Again, Karin, very astute. Yes we do have a bit more visibility as we sit here today versus a year ago in terms of what it is that we are seeing. There are some very large portfolios out there and that could be quite interesting. Now, obviously, we have to go and see if we can win a few of them. But that is what gives us confidence in terms of the sourcing and in terms of what we believe we can complete. And so it is absolutely being dictated by the visibility that we have that allowed us to come out with an acquisitions guidance that is the highest that we've ever come out with.","Operator","We'll now go to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Hi. Thanks. Just looking at the tenant profile can you guys provide more color on the tenants and properties you acquired in Q4? I know that number dropped from what, I guess, we're used to in previous quarters, but maybe those tenants don't have a credit rating, just maybe touch on that. Thanks.","Sumit Roy","Are you specifically, Todd, asking about our investment grade representing only 25%? That is absolutely\u2026","Todd Stender","Yes, you're more articulate then I am. Yes, go ahead, thanks.","Sumit Roy","Okay. Oh, that's a first, I'll tell you that. It is absolutely a function of the types of assets that we closed. There was a very large quick service restaurant portfolio that we closed with a large franchisee. They tend to be non-rated. And that's why you probably saw an uptick in the QSR restaurant industry over the third and fourth quarter. And then some of the other transactions were in that particular space that tend to be non-rated.","It is not something by design. It really is just a question of when some of these transactions close. If you look at overall, I think we were still in the high 50s in terms of investment-grade closed. And we've said this in the past and we will say it again and Todd I know you already know this, we don't go after transactions based on whether or not they have an investment grade rating, we go after a particular acquisition based on whether or not they fit the profile that we are looking for.","In some cases, they tend to be investment grade and in others like quick service restaurants with franchises that are well-established, they tend to be non-rated. And that along with a small portfolio of childcare was essentially what dictated the drop in investment grade for the fourth quarter.","Todd Stender","That's helpful. Thanks, Sumit. And then Paul, just for the following of equity you tapped in Q4 through the ATM. We're just now getting into, I guess, overnight sized ATM issuances, I guess, if you spread over the whole quarter. It's got to really help on a per share basis: One it's cheaper than an overnight; but two, your match funding deals, I guess, as they come through. Is it fair to look at it on a couple of pennies basis? Are you able to quantify any of that?","Paul Meurer","Yes. I think you see the ATM product as a very favorable one both in terms of its flexibility. It's daily or weekly ability to match fund with your acquisition activity. The issuance cost obviously that's associated with it. And having said, that it doesn't mean we've made any decision to not pursue other forms of equity issuance.","In the past, obviously, we've done a fair amount of overnight offerings that also give us the ability to place some shares in the hands of individual investors. We've done odd deals in the past. We've done index trades. We're kind of open-minded as it relates to how we access the market with all types of securities. Common equity in particular, there's a lot of different alternatives.","So we look at all of those. And it will really come down to our overall capital needs. As Sumit referenced, like if there's a large portfolio at some point or something of that sort, where your capital needs are greater at a moment in time and that's something we might consider a larger overnight offering as opposed to kind of ongoing ATM issuance.","So it really matches up with deal flow, and it is nice, however, to have ATM be a part of that overall equity issuance given the cost-efficient nature of it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our next question from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.","John Massocca","Hello. Can you may be give a little more color around the 15.6% cap rate on dispositions in 4Q 2018?","Sumit Roy","Sure, John. Now this was a casual dining concept that we've been in negotiations with the operator for a while on. And we were very thrilled to get this off our books. That was part of the original discussion of the $150 million that we had come out with in terms of dispositions. This was a big chunk they just happened to close in the fourth quarter. It's suffusive to say this had been on our watch list for a while. The credit had been on our credit watch list for a while as well. And so to complete this transaction, it's absolutely the right goal for the company and we were very happy to get it off our books.","Even though the cap rate was very high, if you look at the overall return profile of this particular acquisition, it was almost 8% unlevered IRR. And part of our concern had always been around the rent that was on these assets. And clearly, it's -- in our mind, it's was one that weren't very comfortable having to deal with. And so that's what's obviously dictating the very high cap rate. But from an investment profile perspective, our overall return was like I said very close to an 8% unlevered IRR. So very happy to have gotten -- to have sold that particular portfolio.","John Massocca","And then maybe switching more to the acquisition front. Have you seen any increased competition from large private investors for target net lease assets? And did the potential for them to maybe be more flexible with their leverage versus public players give them a leg up and how do you kind of compete with that?","Sumit Roy","Yes. That's a very good question John. They clearly can play the leverage game. But here's what they can't play. Their expectation on equity tends to be in the high-teens low 20% ZIP Code. And even in today's environment, if they can lever up 60%, 70%. If you factor in their expectation on equity, they can't compete with us. So yes, we are seeing some of these larger private equity driven companies in the market. We are going up against them. But if we lose to them it is primarily being driven off of our thesis around what we want to pay. It's not our ability to pay.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it appears this concludes the question-and-answers portion of Realty Income's conference call. I'll now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.","Sumit Roy","Thanks, Jessica, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everyone at the upcoming conferences. Have a great rest of the week. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to Realty Income Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is also being recorded today, Thursday, October 25, 2012.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host for today, Mr. Tom Lewis, CEO Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.","Tom A. Lewis","Thank you very much, operator, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the conference call to review our operations and results for the third quarter. In the room with me today, as usual is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and John Case, our EVP and CIO and Tere Miller, our Executive Vice \u2013 excuse me, Vice President, almost promoted you, Tere, of Corporate Communications.","And as always, we\u2019ll say, during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in the forward-looking statements and we will disclose in greater detail on the company\u2019s Form 10-Q, the factors that may cause such differences.","On our call today, we\u2019ll focus on our third quarter and year-to-date operational performance for the company. But before we get into that, let me start with just a brief comment on our merger with American Realty Capital Trust or ARCT. As most of you know, we announced on September 6 that we had reached an agreement to merge the two companies and then after our announcement of the agreement, we filed an S-4 proxy with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is where it sits today and it is currently in review.","Following that review, which we anticipate will conclude in the near future, we also anticipate getting a final and then effective proxy sent out to all of the shareholders of both the companies. And at that time, we\u2019ll be having an opportunity to talk to all of the parties involved about what we think is an attractive opportunity for the shareholders of both companies and we then move forward towards an approval of that transaction and ultimately close it, but we\u2019ll engage in that time and I\u2019m sure a fair amount of discussion about it.","We continue to anticipate closing the transaction towards the end of the year. So we look forward to more discussion on that once the transaction proxy is effective for us. I\u2019d invite those with any additional questions for now. If they haven\u2019t reviewed the S-4, it is currently filed at Securities and Exchange Commission and is available on EDGAR. And obviously, after we have comments, we\u2019ll make any changes and get that out.","Moving then on to our operating results, let me start with an overview of the numbers and Paul as usual, if you\u2019ll do that for us.","Paul M. Meurer","Thanks, Tom. So as usual, I\u2019ll just comment briefly on our financial statements, provide a few highlights of our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 13.2% for the quarter. Our revenue for the quarter was approximately $120 million or $480 million on an annualized basis. This obviously reflects a significant amount of new acquisitions over the past year.","On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by about $6.2 million in the comparative quarterly period. Depreciation expense obviously increased as our property portfolio continues to grow. Interest expense increased by almost $1.2 million and this increase, this quarter was due to our credit facility borrowings throughout the quarter.","On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong with interest coverage at 3.7 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.7 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the third quarter were approximately $9.3 million similar to the rate for last quarter.","Our G&A expenses increased this year as our acquisition activity has increased. We have added some new personnel throughout the year and our proxy process this past spring was more expensive than usual. We\u2019ve spent $795,000 of acquisition due diligence costs during this quarter and our employee base has grown from 80 employees, a year ago to 92 employees today. However, our current total projection for G&A for all of 2012 is approximately $36 million, which will still represent only about 7.5% of total revenues.","Property expenses were just under $2 million for the quarter and these are expenses associated primarily with the properties that we have available for lease. Our current estimate for property expenses for all of 2012 remains about $9 million.","Merger-related costs, this new line item refers to the cost associated with the ARCT acquisition. During the quarter, we expensed approximately $5.5 million of such costs and this amount includes accruals for some of the expected total cost for completing the transaction.","Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company and they were just over $400,000 during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $1.9 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We sold 11 properties during the quarter for $15.8 million, an important reminder that we do not include property sales gains in either our FFO or our AFFO.","Preferred stock cash dividends totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter. This increase compared to last year obviously reflects the issuance of our preferred F stock earlier this year.","Excess of redemption value, we\u2019re carrying by our preferred shares redeemed, was not this quarter, but it is in the year-to-date column. This refers to the $3.7 million non-cash redemption charge in the first quarter associated with the repayment of our outstanding preferred B stock with proceeds from our preferred F offering. Reminder, that a replacement of the preferred B stock in our capital structure did save us about $1 million cash annually.","Net income available to common stockholders was about $27 million for the quarter. Beginning this quarter, we\u2019ve included a normalized FFO calculation. Normalized FFOs simply adds back the $5.5 million of ARCT merger related costs to FFO.","We believe normalized FFO is a more appropriate portrayal of our operating performance and is consistent with our public FFO earnings estimates and first call FFO estimate that analysts have already published on us. Normalized FFO per share was $0.52 for the quarter, a 4% increase versus a year ago.","Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.52 per share for the quarter; a 2% increase versus a year ago. Year-to-date AFFO was $1.52 per share, also a 2% increase versus last year. While it may vary by quarter, our AFFO annually will continue to be higher than our FFO.","So far this year, our AFFO has been $0.05 higher. Our AFFO has been higher because our capital expenditures are still fairly low in the portfolio. We continue to have minimal straight line rent adjustments in our current portfolio and we have some FAS 141 non-cash reductions to FFO for in-place leases acquired in some of the larger portfolio transactions that we\u2019ve done. And then in 2012 specifically, we have the $3.7 million non-cash preferred redemption charge.","We increased our cash monthly dividend twice during the third quarter including the larger $0.06 annualized increase in August. We\u2019ve now increased the dividend 60 consecutive quarters and 68 times overall since we went public 18 years ago this month. Our AFFO dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 85%.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we\u2019ve continued to maintain a conservative and safe capital structure, we think. Earlier this month, we raised $800 million of new capital with our issuance of $350 million of 2% unsecured fixed-rate notes due in 2018 and $450 million of 3.25% unsecured fixed-rate notes due in 2022. We were very pleased with the successful offering and we are grateful for the bond investors who continue to support us with their capital.","With the bond offering proceeds, we were able to completely payoff the borrowings on our $1 billion dollar unsecured acquisition credit facility, which continues today to have a zero balance. We also have today an excess cash balance of approximately $160 million from the bond offering proceeds.","Our current total debt to total market cap is 30% and our preferred stock outstanding still is only 7% of our capital structure. And our only debt maturity in the next three years is $100 million bond maturity in March of next year.","So in summary, we currently have excellent liquidity. And our overall balance sheet remains very safe and well-positioned to support our acquisition growth including the ARCT acquisition later this year.","Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom and he\u2019ll give you more background on these results.","Tom A. Lewis","Thanks, Paul. And I\u2019ll kind of walk through as is our tradition, the different areas of the business and let me start with the portfolio. During the third quarter, the portfolio continued to generate very consistent cash flow with tenants doing well and no significant issues arising outside of our normal operations.","At quarter\u2019s end, our 15 largest tenants accounted for 46.8% of our revenue, that\u2019s down 520 basis points from the same period a year ago and 170 basis points from the second quarter. So our acquisition efforts continue to reduce concentrations in the portfolio.","The average cash flow coverage rent at the store level for the tenants remains high at just over 2.5 times, which is very little movement from last quarter with a similar number, but quite healthy.","We ended the third quarter with 97% occupancy and 84 properties available for lease out of the 2,838 we own. That occupancy was down about 30 basis points from the second quarter. For the quarter, we had 27 new vacancies. That is a little higher than we usually get and was really a function that we have 25 buffet restaurants that came off lease right at the beginning of the quarter. And we have seen those coming off so I think made some comments on last quarter\u2019s call that occupancy maybe a little softer, but not much, 97% for the quarter.","During the quarter, we did release 15 of those. We\u2019ve released another couple since the end of the quarter and they make a good a good part of the 18 properties that we leased or sold during the quarter. We also acquired 87 properties and that was the reason for the movement, but quite solid at 97%.","As I\u2019ve mentioned, for the last few quarters and we will each time now is, there is three ways to calculate occupancy: one is taking the number of vacant properties, which is 84 and dividing it by our total of 2,838 properties and that\u2019s how we get to 3% vacancy and 97% occupancy.","Second methodology is, take the square footage that is vacant and divide it by the total square footage that would give us a 2.1% vacancy and 97.9% occupancy, 90 basis points higher than the first method.","And then the third way, which is more of an economic way of looking at it is, take the previous rent on vacant properties and divide it by the sum of that number and rent on occupied properties. And if you use that methodology, vacancy is only about 1.7% and occupancy 98.3%. Obviously, any of the three represent fairly high occupancy. And in the press release, we use physical occupancy, which is the lowest of the three.","Looking to the next few quarters, leasing activity today is brisk. Lease rollover is reasonable. The tenants are generally doing well. So we think occupancy should increase a bit in the fourth quarter and increase a bit going into early next year. So we think the portfolio is fairly sound very soon from an occupancy standpoint.","Same-store rents in our core portfolio decreased 1% during the third quarter and 0.8% year-to-date. As we\u2019ve talked about for several quarters now, if we exclude the Buffets and Friendly\u2019s reorganization rent adjustment, same-store rent and the balance of the portfolio increased 1% during the third quarter and 1.1% year-to-date.","As we look forward, the impact of those two will now start rolling off. And we think that we\u2019ll probably have flat same-store rent in the fourth quarter and then in the first quarter likely go back to the more typical increase that we\u2019ve had in the past of about 1% same-store rent growth. So we\u2019re optimistic relative to occupancy and same-store rent growth over the next couple of quarters.","Diversification in the portfolio continues to widen. 238 properties, which is up over last quarter; 44 different industries, 144 different tenants and the footprint in 49 states. From a geographic standpoint, there are no meaningful concentrations around the country. And probably, more important, industry exposures are very well diversified.","Again, with 44 industries now and concentrations in the larger industries are generally continuing to decline each quarter. As you probably saw in the press release, convenience stores, which is our largest industry at 16.3% is down 60 basis points from last quarter and 200 basis points versus a year ago.","Restaurants, if you combine both casual dining and quick service, now down to about 13.2%, that\u2019s off 60 basis points from last quarter and 410 basis points versus a year ago. And I think more importantly of note there to us is really the decline that we\u2019ve had in casual dining as we acquire in other areas and we\u2019ve been selling off properties in this area and we think that\u2019ll continue.","Casual dining is down, I think, 360 basis points year-to-date. And as the chart on Page 11, I believe, in the press release shows, we\u2019re down to about 7.3% in that sector from over 14% in the last five years or so. And we will continue to reduce that.","Theaters are at 9.5%, that\u2019s down a little bit, up for the year. Health and fitness also down a little bit at 6.7%. We continue to like both of those sectors, theaters and health and fitness and I think we\u2019ll be adding to them. And then the only other category industry over 5% is beverages. And additionally this quarter, we added six new industries for the portfolio for the first time. So I think we\u2019re in very good shape and keeping industry concentrations reasonable and generally widening out the diversification.","This quarter in our industry table in the back of the press release, we separated our retail industries from our non-retail industries for the first time, which should make it a little easier for everybody to see the activity in each of those areas and basically how it\u2019s moving over time and we hope that is helpful.","From an individual tenant standpoint, no tenant now represents more than 5% or more of our overall revenue in the portfolio. Of an interesting note, this is the first time in the 43-year history of the company that that has been the case where no tenant is over 5%. So we continue to become more diversified there.","Our largest at forayed is AMC. That\u2019s down a bit. LA Fitness and Diageo are at 4.7% and then everything else is under that. The 15 largest tenants I mentioned is 46.8% of revenue. When you get to the 15th tenant, you\u2019re looking only about 2% of revenue and when you get to number 20, it\u2019s about 1.5%. So we continue to be well diversified.","The other thing I would note is the continued transformation in our top 15 tenants over the last few years. As I mentioned, concentrations are down quite a bit. Tenant quality continuing to move up a bit and industry representations are changing as we continue to focus on moving up the credit curve and away from some areas, we think are vulnerable to a consumer downturn and we think the list will continue to transition in the coming quarters based on the transactions we\u2019re undertaking now where we\u2019re quite active.","Relative to moving up the credit curve, three years ago essentially none of our rent came from investment grade tenants or the subsidiaries; 43-year old company that\u2019s worked very well, in that entire period, occupancy has never gone below 96%. And obviously earnings and dividend growth has been excellent. But it really is \u2013 we are trying to make a move in that direction.","And as of the end of the third quarter that number stands a little over, now 20% of the portfolio is generated by investment grade tenants. And upon the closing of the ARCT transaction, that would be roughly 35%. And we continued here in the third quarter and we will in the fourth quarter to buy additional properties leased to investment grade tenants.","We\u2019re also adjusting the portfolio by accelerating property dispositions a bit in certain industries. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve sold 30 properties for $34 million. That\u2019s for us about $12 million of sales for the same period a year ago and we think that will continue to increase. We\u2019ll likely sell around $20 million or so in the fourth quarter. That will get us up around $55 million. And then we think likely to run in the $75 million to $100 million run rate, perhaps a little higher over the next year or so.","Almost all of the sales to-date, as a matter of fact, all of them out of the investment portfolio what we\u2019re targeting in the industry have been out of the restaurant category with the majority being casual dining restaurants.","We have been pleased that the cap rates for sales have been a little better than we thought. The properties would have been closed to-date. The cap has been about $8.19 and on the properties that we currently have under contract for sale now, it\u2019s about $7.55. So it\u2019s been a good environment to be active out in dispositions for us.","Finally, on the portfolio, our average remaining lease term remains very healthy at 11 years and so given the long-term leases that we have and increased diversification in the portfolio and then the idea we think that same-store rent should accelerate and also occupancy debt, we\u2019re very optimistic and continue to see very stable revenue production out of the portfolio.","Let me move on to property acquisitions. We\u2019re obviously having a lot of success on that front for the first three quarters of the year. We see that continuing this quarter and in the next year.","And let me turn it over to John Case, our Chief Investment Officer and you can walk people through what we\u2019re seeing.","John P. Case","Okay. We had a very active third quarter for acquisitions this year. We acquired 87 properties for approximately $496 million. That was our second most acquisitive quarter in our company\u2019s history. We acquired these properties at an average cap rate of 7.11% and the average lease term was 13 years.","The credit profile of the tenants we added was very attractive. 51% of the acquisitions are leased to tenants with investments grade credit ratings. These properties are leased to 19 tenants in 18 separate industries and 11 of the 19 tenants are new tenants for us.","Approximately, 70% of the acquisitions were in the dollar store, wholesale club, food processing and apparel industries and the acquisitions were well geographically diversified and 19 separate states. Just under 70% of the acquisitions we\u2019re comprised of our traditional retail assets, the majority of the balance of the properties were distribution properties.","So through the third quarter of this year, we\u2019ve acquired 234 properties for approximately $718 million at an average cap rate of 7.12%, which we believe is attractive as we continue to improve our tenant credit profile. 64% of the acquisitions year-to-date are leased tenants with investment grade credit ratings.","The average lease term of these year-to-date acquisitions has been 14.3 years. There are at least 21 tenants and 19 separate industries and are located in 33 states. 77% of these acquisitions were comprised of our traditional retail assets, and again, the majority of the balance of the properties are distribution assets.","Let me spend a minute talking about the current status of the acquisitions market. The market is as active as we\u2019ve ever seen it in our company\u2019s history. To give you an idea of that, year-to-date, we\u2019ve sourced $14.9 billion in acquisition opportunities as a company. Last year, during the entire year, we sourced $13 billion of acquisition opportunities, which was our most active year ever for sourcing acquisitions. About 60% of these properties sourced are leased to investment grade tenants.","Now, while the market remains competitive, we\u2019re continuing to pursue a number of these opportunities and expect to close over $1 billion in organic property level acquisitions for 2012. And of course, this would exclude our acquisitions that will be part of our merger with ARCT.","And looking forward, we really don\u2019t see a slowdown in acquisition opportunities. There are a lot of sellers in the market for a number of reasons today and we continue to be engaged in a number of discussions with those sellers. We remain optimistic relative to both our near-term and intermediate-term acquisition opportunities.","Let me spend a second on cap rates. As you may have noticed, the cap rates have contracted a bit more during the year. However, we believe we\u2019ll end the year with average cap rates in the 7.25% area. The investment grade properties that we pursue are currently trading in cap rates in the low 6% to low 7% range. And the non-investment grade properties are trading in the low 7% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads continue to be at historical highs, though.","Our year-to-date average cap rate of 7.12% represents a 185 basis point spreads, our nominal cost of equity, which again, is our FFO yield adjusted for our cost of raising equity. That 185 basis points compares quite favorably to our average spread of 110 basis points over the previous 17 years when the vast majority of our acquisitions were with properties \u2013 on properties lease to non-investment grade and investment grade tenants.","In 2011, our spreads or our nominal cost of equity on our acquisitions was 170 basis points when 40% of the acquisitions were with investment grade tenants. So we\u2019ve been able to improve our investment spreads to 185 basis points while continuing to move up the credit curve this year with 64% of our acquisitions being leased to investment grade tenants. So it\u2019s a great time for us to acquire very attractive spreads while enhancing the credit profile of our tenant base. Tom.","Tom A. Lewis","Thanks, John. Obviously, we\u2019re pleased with the acquisitions we\u2019ve closed year-to-date and that are expected to close in the fourth quarter and certainly where spreads are as John mentioned.","And we also think that we\u2019ll start the year off in 2013 faster than we did this year given the transaction flow. If you recall a year ago, the first quarter was fairly slow relative to closings. And this is all on really the property by property or portfolios we\u2019re seeing here on a granular basis, individual properties and really not part of any volume that comes from M&A.","And if you look at the ARCT transaction upon that close, that would get us to about $4 billion in additional assets for the year. And while that\u2019s been the news as of late, the $1 billion plus in normal acquisitions for this year as John mentioned would be a record for the company.","I mentioned last quarter and it still holds true and we think it will going forward that acquisitions will continue to play a big role in continuing to grow our revenue and AFFO, which is what will drive dividend increases.","And then secondly and equally important to us in adjusting the makeup of our portfolio as time goes on where we\u2019re moving up the credit curve and we\u2019ve made good progress on that front again, this quarter.","Paul talked about the balance sheet in excess to capital. Obviously, we\u2019re in very good shape there with plenty of dry powder to execute on acquisitions as they present themselves. Obviously, the $1 billion credit facility is very helpful for that and that is fully available. And as Paul mentioned, we also have $160 million in cash on the balance sheet. So a lot of capital to do we need to do.","Obviously, relative to permanent capital out there, the markets remained open and quite attractive. Looking at the execution on the recent debt offering obviously, pricing is just absolutely outstanding and historic in the REIT industry and certainly for us on that transaction. Equity is attractively priced. And as is preferred and given cap rates may be 7.25% level for the year spreads very attractive.","Relative to the guidance that we put out a month or so ago, there was no changes on that. In 2012 guidance excluding the one-time costs of the ACRT transaction, we\u2019re looking at $2 to $2.4 per share for the year. Included in that, as Paul mentioned, is the $0.03 per share non-cash charge from the redemption of our preferred earlier in the year, and the AFFO of $2.06 to $2.11 per share, which would be about 2.5% to 5% AFFO growth. And as always, that\u2019s our primary focus as it best represents the recurring cash flow from which we pay our dividends.","On 2013 guidance, again, assuming a 12.31 closing of the ARCT transaction, we\u2019re looking for $2.30 to $2.36 per share and AFFO of $2.31 and to $2.37 that\u2019d be 9.5% to 15% AFFO growth for the year. And again, really is the focus given we pay dividends out of that.","Speaking to dividends, we remain optimistic that our activities will support the ability to continue increase the dividend. As Paul mentioned, we increased it $0.06 in August and ended the regular quarterly increase in September. And as most of you know, we\u2019ve also mentioned that we closed the ARCT transaction. We probably raised the dividend about $0.13 a share.","And historically, what we\u2019ve done for those that haven\u2019t been with the company a long time, we raised the dividend in fairly equal amounts each quarter and then really looked in our August Board meeting to see if a fifth larger increase in the dividend is warranted, in order to keep our payout ratio at about 85% to 87% or so of FFO, which is our target.","Our AFFO payout ratio is in that range now, and obviously, the AFFO growth for next year looks pretty attractive. And in the mid-range of the guidance that would likely get our AFFO payout ratio down around 83% or so by the end of next year, which is below where we target. So at this point, we\u2019d anticipate 2013 to be another pretty good year for dividend growth also.","I think that\u2019s it relative to walking over the different pieces of the business. And, operator, if we can, we\u2019ll go ahead and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Emanuel Porchman with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Emanuel Porchman \u2013 Citigroup","","Hey, guys, how are you?","Tom A. Lewis","","Good.","Emanuel Porchman \u2013 Citigroup","","Looking at the distribution facilities that you acquired, I know, Tom in the past, you\u2019ve spoken about looking at distribution sort of in parallel with retail. Was that the case here? Was there an overlap with your existing retail tenants I guess before buying those distribution facilities?","Tom A. Lewis","Actually no, the majority of the retail tenants as you know before three years ago were all less investment grade. And our comfort level historically on retail is obviously having cash flow \u2013 EBIDTA cash flow coverage numbers and knowing the P&Ls of the stores we own. And when we move into the distribution facilities, you really don\u2019t have that. So you\u2019re relying more on the real estate itself. And what you\u2019re buying and how important it is to the tenant and their need to really use that particular facility. And so for us also then what we want to do is, we want to be going up the credit curve when we\u2019re working on those type of properties. And that\u2019s the majority of what we\u2019re doing. So it\u2019s really going to the Fortune 500 or Fortune 1,000 and approaching them, relative to those distribution facilities and trying to buy ones that are either well priced and in very good areas for them to support their long-term activities or perhaps they\u2019re right next door to a manufacturing plant for one of their main product lines.","So if you kind of look through the distribution facilities that we bought and in kind of in the last quarter, the tenants on those were, as an example, Whirlpool Corporation was one, another tenant was Procter & Gamble, another one was PepsiCo, another one was, obviously FedEx and another Toro. So all very large investment grade names and that\u2019s generally where we\u2019re focusing. And I don\u2019t think we own more than one or two distribution facilities and those we bought some time ago with tenants are non-investment grade","Emanuel Porchman \u2013 Citigroup","","Okay. And then looking at the ARCT transaction sort of, say that\u2019s closest, does that change the way you approach acquisitions to you than expand your net on what you\u2019re out there looking at?","John P. Case","","I don\u2019t think it will materially change where we are right now. As we\u2019ve said, in retail, there are areas that we\u2019ve bought in the past that we just want to hold on, those we want to sell, and then a number that we still find attractive. And then outside of that, it\u2019s really distribution a little manufacturing, a little bit of office, but not much, and perhaps agriculture, but all investment grade tenants is what we want to do there. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused. So that\u2019s pretty much what we get in the ARCT transaction. And so I would imagine that we\u2019ll stay right on that.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","","","Hey, Tom, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman speaking. Good afternoon to you.","Tom A. Lewis","","Hey, Mike.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","","A quick question just going to the ARCT transaction, in a little bit more depth. You\u2019re clearly aware that there\u2019s probably little bit more investor frustration at least on the ARCT side of the transaction and some pretty vocal shareholders who effectively are going to vote no, as the current deal stands. And I\u2019m just curious as how you\u2019re sort of dealings towards that clearly the proxy is out, and everyone can read it, but you were the only bidder. And that was the negotiated transaction that occurred. But do you have, a lot of accretion built into the deals for next year, you\u2019ve communicated a sizable list in the dividend. I guess do you sort of walk away if they vote no?","Tom A. Lewis","Well, obviously if there is a no vote in the transaction, yes we would walk away. We think and if you look at the proxy and I also want to say that again, since it\u2019s in the SEC and there\u2019s likely to be some comments. We want to make sure we don\u2019t go into too much detail until have a final and effective proxy. But if you read the background section, you can see that the negotiations were discussed over time and both parties kind of drew a line, well it\u2019s valuation is to where they wanted to go, and we weren\u2019t able to get there. And then after \u2013 they started trading that both of the equities moved in a fashion, so we could put together a transaction. But our feeling is that at the time that was announced, it was around a 5\\9 cap rate, today on price, it\u2019s around six. And it\u2019s a very good portfolio, 75% investment grade, it fits what we\u2019re trying to do strategically very carefully. But we think we paid a bit of a premium to capture this large portfolio and did so with an attractive issuance of equity. But for us, the price that we\u2019re paying here is we think a full price in and yes, we would walk away.","As we mentioned, we have $1 billion plus in acquisition. So that\u2019s granular and we also have a great feeling about how next year is going to work out and so we would do that. However, we do believe that the majority of the shareholders once we have the final perspective, their proxy out, we\u2019ll be able to engage in conversations and think we will get a yes vote on the transaction from both groups of shareholders for whom we think there are very good benefits.","Emanuel Porchman \u2013 Citigroup","","Is there any cost, if there is a no vote? Do you have to incur or any sort of cost? Obviously, there were some cost to the transaction that, but what would that sort of, is there any penalties or anything that would; we\u2019d have to be mindful of?","Tom A. Lewis","Yeah, I think it\u2019d be minor if there was a no vote by either party and I think in our case, I think we would have about $4 million that would be due as to pay for the fees of the transaction. And then we\u2019re figuring out exactly what those would be if there was a no vote. But it\u2019s relatively closer to that that would pay for the majority of it. And that really wouldn\u2019t see a significant impact. I think it\u2019s the same on the other way with that for us in a no vote. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much if any chance of that whatsoever.","Emanuel Porchman \u2013 Citigroup","","And then I just guessed you had raised a lot of unsecured debt capital. So effectively, you\u2019d be a little bit, I guess over capitalized from that standpoint relative to the transaction?","Tom A. Lewis","Yeah, we would not be, actually Michael, we had obviously a very big quarter in acquisitions and we look for a substantial quarter in the fourth quarter and running the number backwards to get to a little over $1 billion in acquisition. So really with $160 million sitting in cash, we\u2019ll easily use that for closing properties in the fourth quarter. And then it just means the full line would be fully available if we did not do the transaction. And if we do the transaction which we fully anticipate, we can do it on the line.","Emanuel Porchman \u2013 Citigroup","","Okay, great. Well it\u2019s good to hear that you are going to stick firm on your exchange ratio and not try to engage in a self bidding.","Tom A. Lewis","","Right. Thank you.","Emanuel Porchman \u2013 Citigroup","","Thank you very much.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good afternoon.","Tom A. Lewis","Hi, Josh.","","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","You guys have covered most of my questions already. Just one quick one, I guess getting to the enterprise value that you will be post ARCT. At least assuming that there will be a post ARCT, what would you say your minimum deal size is when you\u2019re looking in the acquisition market today and how that has changed over the last couple of years?","Tom A. Lewis","","Yeah, it\u2019s really grown over the years. We\u2019ve always been more than willing to do a one-off transaction of a small nature and add it and happy to do that today. But over the years, we\u2019ve gone where $50 million back when we were $500 million in assets would be a 10% allocation to a tenant. And that was kind of our threshold. And sitting at $11.4 billion, you can go out and do a $0.5 billion transaction with a tenant and still retain under 5% with an individual tenant and then relative to a portfolio or additional M&A, with a multiple tenant portfolio. It really gives us a lot of flexibility. So the ability to do larger transaction is certainly enhanced by completing this merger.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","","Okay, and one last thing. You had mentioned some comments about CapEx and why straight-line rents were a bit higher this quarter. Would you expect some more of that, I guess in the next couple of quarters with Buffet\u2019s and Friendly\u2019s releasing, we think process is mostly done at this point?","Tom A. Lewis","","Yes, we\u2019re pretty well along the way of getting the majority of anything from Friendly\u2019s or Buffet\u2019s done. So there shouldn\u2019t be a lot there relative to CapEx on that.","Paul M. Meurer","","Yeah, CapEx overall Josh, has gone up a little bit. Historically, we had virtually none. Our current projected run rate for this year and next year is about $6 million to $7 million total which of course is on a $500 million plus revenue portfolio. So still a relatively small number, but a little higher than it has been in the past. Some of that is investing in existing properties to assist in the re-leasing of those as you\u2019ve guessed. But overall, still the large portion of the portfolio or most and all of it is more so triple-net and we\u2019re not responsible for those sorts of expenses.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks very much guys and good luck.","Operator","","Thank you. And then next question comes from the line of RJ Milligan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Richard J. Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","Hey, good afternoon guys.","Tom A. Lewis","","Good afternoon Rich.","Richard J. Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","Couple of questions. Going forward for 2013, do you think the mix of retail versus non-retail at 75:25, do you expect that to continue?","Tom A. Lewis","","It\u2019s going to be transaction-driven, RJ, that we think that\u2019s a very nice mix, but if that was 60:40, that wouldn\u2019t really bothered us either way. We\u2019re really out after those areas of retail that we can buy quite aggressively, and if there was 100% quarter where it was all on the retail, that\u2019d be fine with us too. And looking quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019re really not focused on trying to balance that, but overall, if I had to guess 75:25 is not a bad number, 60:40 is not a bad number.","Richard J. Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","Now, in terms of the opportunity set, is there a larger opportunity set of acquisitions in the non-retail bucket and you\u2019re just choosing to pursue that 75:25 mix or what do the opportunities look like?","Tom A. Lewis","","I\u2019ll let John comment, but it\u2019s changing as time goes on, as it\u2019s been interesting over the years. In the mid \u201890s, we entered the convenience store business and it really took us two, three years where everybody that was in that business knew we were out acquisitive and we were really able to accelerate thing, and in movie theaters, it was the same thing. And so, now for really last year and this year, and in particular mostly this year because most of what we bought in that area last year came from the ECM transaction. We\u2019re now getting traction with people knowing that we are out there and we are buying this type of property. So our flow is increasing.","John P. Case","","Yeah. So let me give you an idea for the distribution of property types within that transaction flow. So what we\u2019ve sourced a $14.9 billion year-to-date that I referred to earlier, about 60% of that is retail properties. And the next largest chunk of that is distribution and industrial at about 25%. So that\u2019s how it shapes out. But it does have inflow depending on what the opportunities are at any specific point during the year. But that will give you a feel for what it looked like year-to-date herein 2012.","Richard J. Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","Okay. Thanks. And, Tom, as part of that strategic review that you guys did a couple years ago, where you decided that you wanted to move up the credit curve part of that if I recall was, wanting to hedge yourselves against inflation and trying to put in contractual rent bumps or CPI bumps into the leases and increase the percentage of leases that you had with those bumps.","Now with ARCT, I\u2019m assuming most of those don\u2019t have any bumps or CPI protection. And I\u2019m just wondering, how you thought about the trade-off there for going up the credit curve yet sort of taking a step back in terms of inflation protecting the portfolio.","Paul M. Meurer","","Yeah. A lot of the leases do have bumps, but that\u2019s one of the most difficult things over the last few years has really been trying to building full CPI into the leases and we\u2019ve gotten up and I can\u2019t remember the exact number, but it\u2019s over 20%.","Tom A. Lewis","","Yeah, it over 20%, Paul says now that we\u2019ve been able to do that, but it is really a slog. We\u2019ve had 30 years here of declining interest rates and relatively tame inflation and across industries in the U.S., the sellers and particularly in retail have gotten very used to not having big CPI components. So that continues to be a battle on that situation.","Relative to going up the credit curve, the decision to go up the credit curve really was two-fold. One was thinking that retail maybe a little tougher in the future particularly in some segments. But mostly, we\u2019re just \u2013 I think September 30 was the 31 anniversary of the 10-year getting up over 14% and starting its decline, that\u2019s gone on ever since then where we\u2019re now down to 1.88. I think I looked this morning. And if you look at the average rate on a 10-year over the last 31 years, it\u2019s been about 6%.","So it was really going back completely underwriting our whole portfolio and acknowledging that we are all kind of running downhill with less than investment grade tenants during that period. And that as we look to going forward and the possibility of interest rates being higher, wanting to disengage from a few tenants that we think would be vulnerable in a raising interest rate environment and move up the curve to protect against that. And everybody\u2019s got their opinion of what the chances are of having much higher interest rates, but we also think even if there was prolonged lower interest rates due to economic weakness, it\u2019s likely to be tough on the more levered people\u2019s business and likely that we would eventually see some credit spreads gapping out. So either way, we think it\u2019s really a good idea to move up the curve. And that was the primary reason behind that one.","And going forward, again, we\u2019re at 20% now closing ARCT, we\u2019d be at about 34%, 35% and be very happy to wake up in four, five years and have that number 60%, 70%, 80% of the portfolio.","Richard J. Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","Okay. So the acquisition is actually going to increase the percentage of the portfolio that has sort of the CPI bumps?","Paul M. Meurer","It now, it\u2019s about the same.","Tom A. Lewis","","Well, his comment going 20 to 35, he was referring to the investment grade portion.","Paul M. Meurer","","Yeah. Sorry. Investment grade not the part with bumps. I think it\u2019ll keep us right about 20, maybe a little less little more.","Richard J. Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","Okay. And then, a quick question for you, Paul. As we\u2019re just looking at our models and thinking about the proceeds to pay for acquisitions in the ARCT transaction, would you expect, say a year from now, leverage to be pretty similar to where it was a quarter ago, or how are you thinking about leverage and what\u2019s your target over the next year?","Paul M. Meurer","","Yeah. As you know, our philosophy is still, go up first, if you will, two-third is common, the remainder really the debt and preferred side in the capital structure. With this recent bond offering, as we speak and sit here today, our leverage, I\u2019d say is a little higher than what we\u2019d like is kind of a longer term run rate, 30% debt, 7% preferred. We prefer that to be 5% to 10% lower in terms of that portion. So we will look to the common equity markets first as a form of financing over the next 12 to 15 months in terms of the balance sheet.","Tom A. Lewis","The other thing is, I think it was 1994 right, when we went public that we said that we wouldn\u2019t want to be over 35% debt on the balance sheet and we\u2019ve never gotten there. And we had a discussion at our board meeting in August just saying that, remains even though we\u2019re \u2013 gosh, 20 time the size than we were then. But that, we think is in an appropriate balance sheet strategy. And in the \u201820s, we don\u2019t mind at all either.","Richard J. Milligan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch Please go ahead.","Craig R. Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Thanks. I was wondering is there also a push for more investment grade tenants within the retail space?","Tom A. Lewis","There is. As a matter of fact within retail, we also have a higher percentage going up. If you look in the top 15 in the press release, I think it\u2019s Family Dollar crept in there and we have had some transaction recently with several other investment grade tenants in that space. So we\u2019d like to go up the curve where ever we can both inside and outside. And so that\u2019s definitely the case. And John, if we have any other numbers there, do you for the year within?","John P. Case","","I don\u2019t think we parsed it within retail, Craig. But a good part of the retail this year has been investment grade.","Craig R. Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Okay. Do you have to pay a lower cap rate for those investment grades or is that like a agnostic view?","Tom A. Lewis","You generally do have to pay a lower cap rate. And almost like in the bond markets today, credit spreads are fairly flat. And they do continue to be fairly flat in the net lease business, but it is lower.","As John mentioned for investment grade, you\u2019re kind of in the 6% to 7% cap rate, for less investment grade 7% to 8%. But given cost to capital, when you look today that over 60% of what we bought this year so far and what we\u2019re targeting, is investment grade. But we\u2019re getting an average cap rate of about 7.25%. It\u2019s really one of those funny times when you can go up the curve and still have great spreads.","Recall about 16, 17 years ago, Bank of New York very nicely gave me two \u2013 couple of days with their head of credit for Bank of New York, just to talk to him about credit and underwriting and all the rest of it. And I remember sitting down and he said, what are you trying to do? And I said, well I want to increase our volume of acquisitions substantially, I\u2019d like to go up the credit curve and I\u2019d like to have higher spreads between our cost to capital and our interest rate. And he laughed, he said so does every banker in the world who\u2019s lending, but it\u2019s almost impossible to do. And I look at this year and last year given Fed monetary policy and that\u2019s exactly what happened at $1 billion plus an acquisition in each year.","And going up the curve, substantially and the spreads between cost of capital and cap rate, as John went through, being some of the highest we\u2019ve had, maybe 70 basis points over the average for 17, 18 years we\u2019ve been public.","John P. Case","Craig, slightly over 50% of the retail we purchased this year to date has been with retail tenants that have investments grade credit ratings.","Craig R. Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Okay. I guess we\u2019re living in an impossible time, but it sounds good. Thanks a lot.","Tom A. Lewis","","Yeah, I\u2019m not sure what it does for the economy in the world long-term, but in the short-term in the net lease business it\u2019s been fairly attractive for us.","Craig R. Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar. Please go head.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Tom A. Lewis","","Hey, Todd.","John P. Case","","Hey, Todd.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Just a question on the capital structure, and I know the preference has always been for the corporate unsecured. And I think you stated that the mortgages that are coming on the balance sheet with some of these acquisitions are you hope to pay those down as soon as possible. But I\u2019m wondering with the move into non-retail and investment grade and with some of the property values maybe being higher now that you\u2019re acquiring than maybe the average has been in the past and also with the investment grade tenants paying the rents if your views changed at all and whether or not there is a place for mortgages in the capital structure going forward or whether you\u2019d like to stick with 100% corporate unsecured?","Tom A. Lewis","","Sure. Good question. Now we continue to absolutely pursue the flexibility of dealing in the unsecured markets with the debt and keeping the balance sheet in line. And the only mortgages that we have had to date are those where we bought a portfolio and it was really uneconomic in the short term to payoff the mortgage that anything we could payoff, we will. We\u2019ve never put a mortgage on a property and we don\u2019t intend to going forward, it\u2019ll strictly be when we buy a portfolio. And then we\u2019ll soon as \u2013 it\u2019s economic to do so, we would pay it off and we\u2019re very, very much committed now as have been to the unsecured market and that being how we finance the company along with perpetual preferred and common equity.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Thanks you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Richard C. Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Equity Research","","Yeah. Hi, good afternoon, guys. You\u2019ve mentioned before, Tom, that you expect about $50 million of acquisitions per quarter, which of course is what I had modeled for the next four quarters going forward. But given that, it seems to me that there is something fundamentally changing out there that is bringing more products to market. And I\u2019m curious if you have thoughts, I mean, is that more retailers, let\u2019s say, looking to monetize real estate, is that debt coming due, or what is bringing all this stuff to market? This seems to be bigger than usual. Is that correct?","Paul M. Meurer","","It is. And I think as things usually are we\u2019re just looking for one reason, but it\u2019s a confluence of forces. I think the downturn in the economy a few years ago and the credit squeeze scares the heck out of a lot of CFOs. And they started looking at their companies on looking for more non-traditional access to capital and identified real estate as being one source for that. And so I think that\u2019s part of it.","Second, as you see more sale leaseback out there, other people observe it, and act towards it. And then I think there is also feeling that, right now, with interest rates low, that this is a way to obviously lock in permanent, permanent capital over very long period of time. And using the real estate while still maintaining the ownership and the flexibility, and that\u2019s \u2013 those are all coming together. And then the last part from me and you can add on if you want to John, is our size really and the size of the net lease business is growing and it\u2019s becoming more visible. And it\u2019s allowed us to go into places we haven\u2019t before, particularly going up the credit curve, into the Fortune 500 and that and in by itself through our efforts has caused us to see more product.","Richard C. Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Equity Research","","Okay, good. Thank you, yeah that makes sense. Then on the dollar stores, on the addition of the dollar stores category this quarter, is there a story behind that first of all? And I noticed that Family Dollars, I think, 2.5% in the total size of the space is about 3%. So I\u2019m guessing there is obviously more beyond Family Dollar in there, but anyway on the dollar stores?","Tom A. Lewis","","Right. As part of the strategic review, one of the things we did is, obviously take a look at the consumer and really divided up to upper income, middle income, lower income. And then divided further between their discretionary and non-discretionary spending to try and pick. What retailers we wanted to be with and we think in kind of the middle income, the lower income, it\u2019s a good idea if you could be with non-discretionary spending. And even within that, that\u2019s really a stressed consumer, which I think, leads retailers in that space today, they need to have a really significant value proposition for the consumer. And I think, our movement into dollar stores is a reflection of exactly that, we did target the industry. We think we will have more and you\u2019ll see that grow over the next few quarters.","By the way, it\u2019s the same thing with the Warehouse, club stores that you also see has come in there. And both have that value proposition and that\u2019s why we upped our investment there. If you look at the wholesale clubs, I think in this quarter it was around 2.8%. That\u2019s BJ\u2019s and there\u2019s going to be another one coming in there. And then on the dollar stores worth three and that\u2019s Family Dollar and Dollar General, both has been added to the portfolio, both of those investment grade tenants. And we expect \u2013 we\u2019d like our allocations to grow up if we can find additional opportunities.","Richard C. Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Equity Research","","Okay. So you\u2019re looking beyond Family Dollar and Dollar General as possibilities are really those two are the targets?","Tom A. Lewis","Well, once again we want to go up to credit curves in both our investment grades. So they\u2019re very attractive to us.","Richard C. Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Equity Research","","Yeah. I got you. Very good. Thank you, guys.","","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","","Hi guys, good afternoon.","Tom A. Lewis","","Yeah.","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Just a quick question. You mentioned that G&A expense would be about $36 million this year. How should we be thinking about G&A expense going forward presuming the ARCT deal goes through?","Tom A. Lewis","Our estimate for next year, I can give you a number. It\u2019s about $42.5 million, kind of what we see in our model right now. That\u2019s some preliminary work on the budget for next year and that sort of thing. That does assume our ARCT closes end of this years. And that would represent about 6% of our total revenues for next year, kind of again on a preliminary budget basis. So from overall ratio, we see G&A going down significantly as a percentage of total revenues, because as we\u2019ve mentioned, we don\u2019t see any material increase in G&A at all relative to the ARCT acquisition.","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","","Alright, great. Thank you very much.","","Operator","","Thank you.

Please note today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Janeen Bedard, Associate Vice President. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you, Joshua, and thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Operating Results Conference Call.","Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.","During this call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.","John Case","Thanks, Janeen, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call. We had another solid quarter of operating results with AFFO per share increasing 8.5% to $0.64, and we are pleased with the continued consistency of our business. I will start with Paul providing you an overview of our financial results.","Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks John. So, as usual, I will comment on the financial statements to provide a few highlights of our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 22.6% for the quarter, and this increase obviously reflects our growth from new acquisitions over the past year as well as some healthy same-store rental growth in the portfolio.","Our annualized rental revenue now as of and at June 30 annualized was approximately $897 million.","On expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased to almost $93 million in the quarter as depreciation expense has obviously increased with our portfolio growth.","Interest expense increased in the quarter to $52.7 million. This increase was primarily due to the $750 million issuance of 10-year bonds last July, as well as higher mortgage interest and credit facility borrowings during this past current quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios did both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.7 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.1 times.","General and administrative or G&A expenses in the quarter were approximately $11.6 million. Our G&A as a percentage total rental and other revenues has decreased to only 5.2% of revenues and our projection for G&A for 2014 remains at approximately $50 million.","Property expenses were $10.1 million in the quarter. However, just a reminder this amount includes $6.2 million of property expenses reimbursed by tenants that you can see up in the revenue line. The property expenses that we are responsible for were approximately $3.9 million in the quarter. And our projection for 2014 of property expenses that we are responsible for remains approximately $16.5 million.","Income taxes consists of income taxes paid to various states by the company and they were $570,000 for the quarter. Provisions for impairment includes just under $500,000 of impairments we recorded on two properties held for sale at June 30th. Gain on sales of approximately $2 million includes the gains from the sale of six properties during the quarter for gross proceeds of $7 million. ","Discontinued operations only refers to properties that were already held for sale as of year-end 2013. So reminder that last quarter we elected early adoption of the new accounting regulations for property sales.","So all of our property sales, gains, impairments and other related revenues and expenses associated with properties that are for sale or held of sale, now appears through the income statement as opposed to being aggregated in the discontinued operations line. And again, the exception to that is one property was already held for sale as of yearend 2013.","Deferred stock cash dividend totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter. Net income available to common stockholders was approximately $51.4 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.64, a 6.7% increase versus a year ago.","Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution and dividends was $0.64 per share for the quarter or 8.5% increase versus a year ago. We again, increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter and our monthly divided now equates to current annualized amount of approximately $2.194 per share. ","Briefly, turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain a very conservative and safe capital structure. As you know in early April we raised $529 million of new capital with a common equity offering.","We also raised $52 million of additional common equity through our direct stock purchase plan during the quarter. And in late June we've raised %350 million with a 10-year bond offering priced at 3.88% yield.","Proceeds from all of these offerings were used to repay borrowings on our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility, which had a balance at June 30th of $70.8 million. We did assume approximately $114 million of in place mortgages during the second quarter. So, our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end increased to approximately $892 million.","Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rate and continue to be rated Baa1, BBB+ have a weighted average maturity of 7.4 years. Our overall debt maturities schedule is in good shape, with only $57 million of mortgage principle payments during the second half of 2014 and $125 million in 2015. And our next bond maturity is only $150 million due in November of 2015.","Our debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was only 5.5 times. Currently, our total debt to total market cap is approximately 30% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 4% of our capital structure.","So, in summary, our earnings growth is very positive, while our balance sheet remained very healthy and safe.","Now, let me turn the call back over to John who will continue to give you background on these results.","John Case","Thanks Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to be quite healthy. Our tenants are continuing to doing well based on what we're seeing today. Occupancy remains consistent with the previous quarter at 98.3% based on the number of properties with 74 properties available for lease out of 4,263 properties.","Occupancy is up 10 basis points from one year ago. Occupancy based on square footage is 99%, economic occupancy is 99.1%. During the quarter, we had leases expire on 40 properties.","Of these assets, we released 33 to existing tenants, 4 to new tenants, and sold two with one remaining vacant at the end of the quarter. We increased the rental revenue on these released properties by 3% with the second quarter leasing activity. We expect our occupancy to remain fairly stable for the remainder of the year.","Our portfolio remains diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the second quarter, our properties were leased to 228 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico, 78% of our rental revenues from our traditional retail properties, while 22% is from non-retail properties. The largest component being industrial and distribution.","We believe our diversification leads to more predictable and dependable cash flow streams to our shareholders. Moving on to the tenant base, at the end of the second quarter, our 15 largest tenants accounted for 45.8% of rental revenue and our largest 20 tenants accounted for 52.3% of rental revenue. Beginning this quarter, we will start disclosing our top 20 tenants. The next 5 tenants being our 15 largest, account for 6.5% of rental revenue.","We believe the additional disclosure will provide investors more insight on our material tenants without jeopardizing our competitive position in the sector. The tenants in our top 20 capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue.","The new disclosure is part of a broader effort we are starting this quarter to provide additional disclosure beyond what we have previously provide to give our analysts and investors even better insight into our business.","We\u2019ve listened to our market constituents and designed a supplemental investor package to provide more information on our company\u2019s operations and put previously disclosed information in the K and in our Qs in a more easily accessible format by also incorporating it into the supplement.","So with the following our 10-Q this afternoon we will be furnishing an 8-K with a supplemental investor package that will also be available on our website.","We want to lead the way in the net lease sector to providing greater transparency for our investors. We hope that this will enable our shareholders and perspective shareholders to more efficiently evaluate our operations and we look forward to discussing our new supplement with you in the ensuing months.","There have been no material changes to our top 15 or top 20 tenants since the first quarter. We\u2019ve made significant strides over the last five years and diversifying our tenant base and our rental revenues. Today our top 20 accounts were 52% of our rental revenue versus 62% and the beginning of 2010. The percentages moved down while the composition of tenants from a performance and credit perspective has markedly improved. Today, eight of our top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings and at the beginning of 2010 none of our top 20 tenants had investment grade ratings.","The non-investment grade tenants in our top 20, which are all retail, are were also higher quality more substantive businesses than the non-investment grade tenants we had in our top 20 in 2010. Today the non- investment grade retail tenants in top 20 have averaged annual revenues of about $5.5 billion versus just over $3 billion in 2010.","Our top 20 tenants today include the top three drug store chains, the top two dollar store chains, the top two movie theatre chains, two of the top three wholesale clubs, the second largest independent tire dealer, the largest quick service restaurant franchise, the number one fitness club operator in the U.S., FedEx and [DRGO] (ph) two global Fortune 300 companies that are clear leaders in their industries and our convenient store tenants that are dominant operators in their respective regions.","And as we've improved the quality of our top 20 tenants, we've also improved the quality of our real estate locations. Within our portfolio no single tenant accounts for more than 5.2% of rental revenues, so diversification by tenant remains favorable.","Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.2% of rental revenue which is down slightly from last quarter. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5% which is also down slightly from last quarter.","Dollar General is our third largest tenant today at just under 5%, LA Fitness and Family Dollar were at 4.6% and 4.5% respectively. All other tenants throughout of the world were 2.9% of rental revenues.","When you go to the 15th largest tenant which remains Walmart\/Sam's Club, it represents 1.5% of rental revenue. If you move in other five spots and go to our 20th largest tenant which is Camping World, it represents only 1.2% of rental revenue.","Moving to our 35th largest tenant, it accounts for just 0.5% of rental revenue, and the percentages trail off from there. We also increased the number of tenants on our portfolio this quarter by 17, further diversifying our tenant base.","Moving on to industry, convenient stores remain our largest industry but continue to decline as a percentage of our rental revenue. Convenient stores now represent 10.2% of rental revenue. Dollar stores are now at 9.8%, up from 9.1% last quarter.","With lower and middle consumers remaining under pressure, we continue to like the discount orientation of the dollar store industry. And Dollar General and Family Dollar remain the dominant players in this industry. Drugstores are at 9.5%. Health and fitness is at 7%, and all other industry categories are at or below 5.2% of rental revenue.","Looking at property type, retail continues to represent our primary source of rental revenue, currently at 78%, with industrial and distribution at 11%, office at 7% and the remainder evenly divided between light manufacturing and agriculture.","We continue to focus on retail tenants that meet our investment parameters. More than 90% of our retail portfolio continues to have a service, non-discretionary or low price point component to their business.","These characteristics better position our tenants to successfully operate in all economic environments and make them less vulnerable to internet competition. Our weighted average remaining lease term continues to be a little less than 11 years, at 10.6 years.","Our same-store rents increased 1.4% during the quarter and year-to-date generally consistent with our long-term average. The industry is contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth for convenient stores, automotive tire service and health and fitness. We expect our growth rate to continue to be in the 1.4% to 1.5% range.","The tenant credit quality of the portfolio continues to be strong with 44% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade tenants. Again, we define an investment grade rated company that\u2019s having an investment grade rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies. This revenue percentage is also up from 38% one year ago","We continued to generate solid rental growth from these investment grade tenants. 70% of our investment grade leases have rental rate increases in them. Overall, annual rental growth from investment grade tenants is 1%.","In addition to tenant credit, the store level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our rent coverage ratio or EBITDA to rent ratio on our retail properties is approximately 2.6 times.","Moving on to property acquisitions. As you know, we had an active second quarter, continuing our momentum from the beginning of the year. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationship developed over our 45-year operating history to generate quality acquisition opportunities.","We completed 405 million in acquisitions during the quarter at an initial yield of 7.3%. Today's investment spreads are well above our historical average. As a reminder our initial yields are cash yields and not GAAP cap rates which tend to be higher due to straight-lining the rent.","We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition the date, divided by the total cost of the property including all expenses borne by reality income including third-party reports, transfer taxes and brokerage fees.","Included in these acquisitions is the remaining $229 million of the $503 million transaction within when diversified. That is now fully closed. Year-to-date this brings us to $1.06 billion in completed acquisition. This is a record amount of property level acquisitions for the first half of any year in the company\u2019s history.","Given our very active first six months of the year, we are raising our acquisitions guidance for 2014 from $1.2 billion to approximately $1.4 billion. We will continue to remain selective and disciplined in our acquisition activity.","Now, I would like to hand it over to Sumit to provide additional details on our acquisitions.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. During the second quarter of 2014, we invested $405.1 million in 73 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.6 years.","Out of the total amount approximately 40% or $157 million was invested in non-investment grade retail properties. On a revenue basis, 55% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 76% of the revenues are generated from retail, 9% are from industrial, distribution and manufacturing, and 15% are from office.","All of the office assets are part of the previously announced inland transaction. These assets are leased to 33 different tenants in 22 industries. Some of the more significant industries represented are home improvement and diversified industrial.","Year-to-date 2014, we've invested $1.06 billion in 402 properties located in 39 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with the warhead average lease term of 12.8 years. Out of the total amount, approximately a quarter or 243 million was invested in non-investment grade retail properties.","Since 2010, we have invested over 2 billion in non-investment grade retail properties, which is the most active period in the company's history for acquisitions of this property segment.","On a revenue basis, 73% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenant. 83% of the revenues are generated from retail, 9% are from industry distribution, and manufacturing, and 8% are from offices. These assets are leased to 45 different tenants in 24 industries. Some of the more significant industries represented are dollar stores, drug stores, and home improvement.","Transaction flow remains healthy. We sourced more than 6 billion in the second quarter of 2014. Year-to-date we have sourced more than 14 billion in potential transaction opportunity, which put us in pace to make 2014, the year with the second largest volume sourced in our company's history.","Of these opportunities, 79% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 21% or $3 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities typically represent 30% to 45% of the volume source.","We came in at 37% for the second quarter in line with our long-term average. Off the $405.1 million acquisitions closed in the second quarter, approximately 20% were one-off transactions, 88% of the transactions closed in the second quarter were relationship driven.","We continue to utilize our relationships and look for the best real estate opportunities, regardless of tenants credit ratings in a one-off or a portfolio transaction to help us achieve the optimal risk adjusted returns. We do this by remaining very selective and disciplined in our investment approach.","As to pricing, cap rates tightened 15 to 20 basis points in the second quarter, with investment grade properties trading from high 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 6% to low 8% cap rate range.","Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy averaging 215 basis points in the second quarter and a 185 basis points year-to-date, which was significantly above our historical average spreads.","We defined investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. We are continuing to make investments above our historic spreads, whilst improving our real estate portfolio, tenant quality, credit quality and overall diversification.","In conclusion, the second quarter investments remained healthy at 405 million. Year-to-date we have invested 1.06 billion while sourcing over 14 billion in transactions. Although cap rate compression was evident in the second quarter our cost of capital continue to improve and as a result, our spreads remained comfortably above historical level.","Also, even though our sourcing volumes remained robust for both, retail and non-retail assets, the investment grade and non-investment grade tenants and single asset and portfolio deals, we continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are inline with our strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We remained confident of reaching our updated investment goal of approximately 1.4 billion for 2014.","With that I would like to hand it back to John. Thank you.","John Case","Thanks, Sumit. Moving on to property dispositions, we continue selling select properties and redeploying the capital into investments that better fit our investment strategy.","During the quarter we sold six properties for $7 million at an unlevered internal rate of return of approximately 9%. This brings us to 17 properties sold during the year for 20 million at an unlevered IRR of approximately 10% and a cap rate of 8.4% on the least property sold. Disposition activity should ramp up during the second half of the years, so we continue to anticipate dispositions for 2014 to be approximately 75 million.","Moving on to our capital raising activities, as Paul mentioned, we were quite active during the quarter raising just under 1 billion in permanent and long-term capital. Approximately two-thirds of this capital was equity and one-third was 10 year unsecured debt.","The capital was used to find acquisitions and to reduce the outstanding balance on the credit facility. We now have over $1.4 billion available on our law and to support future acquisitions activity and our balance sheet continues to be in great shape.","We continue to enjoy excellent access to attractively priced permanent and long-term capital.","We continue to see healthy per share earnings growth, while maintaining a leveraged neutral balance sheet. Our FFO and AFFO per share of $0.64 in the second quarter represented increases of 6.7% and 8.5% respectively from a year ago. Given our robust level of acquisitions during the first half of the year and increased visibility on our operations, we are adjusting our FFO and AFFO for share guidance from our initial estimates of $2.53 to $2.58 per share.","We are raising our 2014 FFO per share guidance to $2.59 to $2.62 which represents an 8.1% increase at the mid-point of the range over our 2013 FFO. And we are tightening and raising the mid-point of our AFFO per share guidance to $2.55 to $2.57, which represents a 6.2% increase at the mid-point of the range over our 2013 AFFO.","Our earnings growth continues to support reliable and growing monthly dividend. We reached the company milestone in June surpassing $3 billion in dividends paid to our shareholders over the company\u2019s 45 year history.","We\u2019ve increased the dividend every since the company\u2019s listing in 1994 and our dividend has grown at a compounded average annual growth rate of approximately 5% during that time. We are proud of our long history of consistent dividend growth.","Our payout ratio during the second quarter was 85.5% of our AFFO which is at a level we continue to be comfortable with.","Again, we are pleased with our company's operating performance for the first half of the year. And looking forward, we continue to see an active, but competitive acquisitions market. We are confident we will continue to execute attractive acquisitions that are consistent with our investment strategy.","While cap rates remain under pressure, we continue to see investments spread and its well above our historical average given a favorable cost of capital.","With that, I would like to open it up for questions. Joshua?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you so much, sir. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird.","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird","Hi, good afternoon guys. John, just a quick question on the EBITDA rent coverage ratio you mentioned, is that a four wall number or does that includes some kind of corporate allocation?","John Case","That\u2019s a four wall number and pre G&A.","Paul Meurer","Most recent quarter annualized.","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird","Got it. And do you guys have number with [DA] (ph) that include sort of allocation?","John Case","No.","Paul Meurer","Wait, which number you are asking about, you are taking about debt to EBITDA or you are talking about the cash flow coverage?","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird","The EBITDA rent coverage, [2.6] (ph) I believe?","Paul Meurer","Sorry, that is a four wall for the retail properties in the portfolio. And that does include some allocation for corporate G&A expense in that calculation as part of our underwriting.","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Great. And then going back to the assets sales it does seems to be a little slower phase so far this year. Is that really a function of your watch list doing the link down? And then if so, have you guys considered refreshing of the criteria for those assets like [Minnesota] (ph) to take advantage to supply appetite out there right now.","Paul Meurer","Yeah. So really it's a function of the assets sales being a bit unpredictable. We knew a number of them we're going to be backend loaded this year. So we still anticipate, $75 million and when we look at our watch list right at properties combined with tenant credit.","It represents about 1.5% of our overall rental revenue. And those are \u2013 those are properties we're considering selling, but not all of which we will sell. There are just once we are watching closely either based on credit issue or perhaps property location issue Jonathan.","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird","Okay. So that 75 million, do you see that trending down significantly as we head into 2015?","Paul Meurer","It could it's all going to be function what goes on or off of the watch list and as that evolves, that's blew it and something we look at constantly. So we if it were to decline we would see less property sales activity and if it were to increase we would probably see more property sales activity.","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird","Great. And then, lastly question just sort of on your cost of capital as I think about that. Given how low it is right now where your spreads are. At the margin, does that compel you guys to pursue more of the investment grade maybe sub 7 cap rate deals while still preserving that spread, or does that make you think about just maximizing that spread and continuing to acquire more of a blend?","John Case","Yes, what we are doing from an acquisition standpoint is pursuing both non-investment grade and investment grade properties that\u2019s meet our investment parameters and offers the best returns on a risk-adjusted basis.","So that\u2019s the factored our cost of capital is low right now. It\u2019s not driving us to try to do more higher yielding assets or lower yielding assets. We are just looking at the best opportunity based on our investment strategy and the risk adjusted return offered by both non-investment grade and investment grade opportunities.","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird","All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.","John Case","Thanks, Jonathan. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Hi, guys. Thanks for providing the additional information and the release and then look forward to going through the supplements. Just wanted to clarify the 5 million or the $5.2 million increase on the leases or lease is signed \u2013 be signed were most of that \u2013 was most of that retail, or was there decent some office or industrial component to it?","Paul Meurer","Yes, it was virtually all retail. I think it was 99%, maybe even 99.9% retail. ","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Okay, just wanted to clarify. And then Sumit just on the acquisition I noticed the remaining lease term kind of was a little lower than what you typically done in 2012, 2013 and probably the first quarter of this year, was there kind of any bunch of assets that kind of drove that remaining lease termed down towards 2010 from 2014?","Sumit Roy","When we are buying assets across the spectrum where its portfolio deals, etcetera, you\u2019ll find assets that tend to be in the low double-digit area in 2010 and in some cases even high single-digit area. So when you blend it out it came out to be 10.6, but this is not to be viewed as this is what we are doing in order to get higher spreads.","If you look at what we did in 2011 in fact in the third quarter average lease term there was in the high single-digits and if you look at year-to-date what our average is been, it\u2019s been about 12.8 a year. And so and that's where we expected to end up by the end of the year. So I won't read anything into it more so than that's where it ended up for the second quarter.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just last one, I mean, you talked about declining cap rates, again 2Q given where your cost of capital less than and you obviously updated the acquisition guidance, but what would make you say I want to be even more selective in that sense would not really going forward kind of take that $1.4 billion even higher. So what would make you get even more selective?","Sumit Roy","If you see what we\u2019ve done, I mean, we\u2019ve done a $1 billion, a 1.06 billion and we\u2019ve increased it by 350 million, despite seeing very healthy sourcing volumes. That in itself should be an indication to you as to are selectiveness.","Look, I mean, given our cost of capital advantages today, we could be pursuing a much higher volume if we chose to do so and making very reasonable spreads. But what we are starting to see is a mispricing of assets where we don't feel compelled despite the fact that we could create value for our shareholders in pursuing those opportunities.","So I think we are going to remain very, very selective and that's indicated by John in terms of what our guidance is for the year.","Paul Meurer","Yeah. So we actually executed 7% of what we executed and close 7% of what we've sourced. If we were to relax our investment parameters and standards we could crank our volume up of closed transactions quite a bit, but the intent is not to do that soon.","So we will remain selective. And as we sit here today it looks like that approximately $1.4 billion in total for the year looks like a pretty good number for us.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","And just lastly on just to clarify on the competition that you mentioned, are you seeing a different composition in terms of the competition? And you kind of alluded to the fact that there's probably a lot of aggressive bidding which is why you're being a little selective, but is that type of competition changing in any way?","John Case","No. It really hasn't -- it's a mix of the other public net lease REITs, the non listed net lease REITs. We do bump into some of the mortgage REITs; we do bump into some institutional investment managers that are running income-oriented money in the net lease sector that was probably once year-marked for the bond sector. So it's generally the same cast of characters, but they are well capitalized and there is a contingent to be a bit more capital out there.","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks. Thanks guy and thanks again for the additional info.","John Case","Okay. Thanks Vikram.","Operator","And we'll move next to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Hi, guys. Just a echo of the previous comment, that you are really seeing discloser was really helpful. Are these about the right percentages to assume for the remainder of the year, just when you think about releasing and you know ultimately with your success in doing this, does this give you any appetite for short or medium-term leases, may with tenants you already have a deep relationship with, just kind of seeing, what the opportunities are for some higher yielding opportunities if you have expertise in this?","John Case","Yeah. Let me first had -- in terms of, you know where are our roll, you know roll up was in rents this past quarter. You know we were able to increase some 3% on our releasing activity. Over the life of the company we have been able to preserve about 95%, 96% of the expiring rents.","So as we look forward you know over recent years we've been doing better than our long-term average. So we would expect to be north of our long-term average and we would hope we would be able to continue you know at around a 100% or north of that.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","And then just part two to that is that create any opportunities for you guys to look at opportunities outside of you know 10, 12, 15 year leases and look at stuff maybe with five to seven years left, that may become a little higher risk but also higher yield, but that you probably can renew?","John Case","You know we emphasize longer term leases, there are situations Todd where when we go out with a lease term like we did average lease term of 10.6 years like we did this quarter, we are buying some assets that have shorter lease terms south of that.","Those are assets that we are very comfortable with and we think their excellent releasing opportunities whether they be with the same tenant or with new tenants given the strength of the market and the quality of the real estate. So, we are still going to focus on longer term leases and lease averages, but we will look at those types of opportunities.","And we always \u2013 and we have \u2013 this is not the first year or quarter we\u2019ve done that. We\u2019ve done that, but we have four 40 people on our property management division, we have executed over approximately 1,700 lease rollovers in our company\u2019s history.","We think we are really good at this. We have a great team executing this, so, it\u2019s something that we will certainly consider and have considered because there are some pretty good opportunities there.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","That\u2019s helpful John. Thank you. And just going back just to touch on the rent coverage, I think portfolio wide, you said it was 2.6 times. How much can you breakout, can you breakout any coverage whether the \u2013 your mandated coverage on an investment grade opportunity, non-investment grade and if you look at it that way on retail, office and industrial?","John Case","Well it\u2019s all on retail because what it is, it\u2019s a four wall coverage. So, we don\u2019t get it on industrial properties or manufacturing. It's almost all non-investment grade. So represents primarily the non-investment grade retail portfolio.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then just going back and looking at the Inland portfolio acquisition it certainly closed over few quarters. What was your initial cash yield on that portfolio indeed your investment spread change it all because it was spread out over few quarters and the long term capital that you source was also split out a little bit?","John Case","Yeah as you know I think we\u2019ve mentioned before Todd we are underwriting confidentiality agreement so we can\u2019t disclose specific items about the Inland transaction. But in terms of the yield assume the initial yield was in the range of what we\u2019ve been closing on average the first and second quarter of this year.","And as far as the actual spread that was an accretive transaction for us and we were closing that in stages but the spread remain fairly consistent but as the stock price appreciated in the last quarter it picked up. So I think it was in the 185 basis points area overall.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Okay. And does that confidentiality agreement have an exploration date or that\u2019s kind of ongoing?","John Case","Its one year and to about six months from now we can provide you more detail on that.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Great, thank you.","John Case","Okay, thanks Todd.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Just want to go back to the acquisition volume and the pace at which you are buying. It\u2019s interesting to hear of course how selective you are despite you have very low cost of capital. How do you underwrite big portfolios right now and how do you think about the big portfolios that could be available to you versus the more right size acquisitions that are out there?","Sumit Roy","Yeah, looking at both one-off small opportunities, smaller portfolios, we\u2019re looking at large portfolios and we look at any delevel transactions, private and public entity level transactions that maybe out there.","First of all, a transaction has to meet our investment parameters and be strategic for us. And when we look at the one-off in smaller portfolios those are generally trading at higher yields than the larger portfolios, maybe 10 to 20 basis points and then when you look at large entity level transactions, those are priced at 50 plus basis point premiums or lower yields and where those properties in that portfolio will trade on a one-off basis.","So we really look at it from a bottoms-up approach and it doesn\u2019t make sense for the company. And if it does, we\u2019ll move on the larger portfolios, but as we know we have a fairly disciplined and rigorous underwriting strategy.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","And have you seen \u2013 outside of entity level possibilities? Have you seen large portfolios becoming available lately?","Paul Meurer","Yes. As Sumit said, our source transaction volume continues to be very high. We are on target to have our second best year ever in terms of source transactions, 80% of what we're sourcing are midsize to larger portfolio transactions.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Great. Just going back to the EBITDA question are you able to give us the sense of the range a little bit and perhaps what percentage of your portfolio is with retail tenants that have EBITDA levels and your properties that are at a point where you would considered selling the properties?","Paul Meurer","Yeah. I mean, the EBITDA the rent ranges from less than one on some properties to more than five. So the range is quite board. Certainly when we get to coverage's that are tight or less than one, we look at those assets quite closely and the real estate locations and they potentially go under the watch list. So the range is \u2013 the range is broad, but around one to five times.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","And what percentage would be below one for instance or around one to below one?","Paul Meurer","Very few I don't have the exact percentage but very few, I mean, it is pretty much of a bell curve.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Okay. And then just one final question like everyone, I appreciate the additional discloser on the vacancies, so the properties were vacant. Do you have a sense of the average amount of time these properties have been vacant.","So I guess what I am asking is are there some quasi-permanent vacancies, properties that probably are impossible to release or do you have really assets that you think over a short period of time you should be able to release?","Paul Meurer","Yes. I mean of the vacant properties that we have or have sold the average vacancy has been between six and 12 months. So that should give you an idea of what the vacant period has been.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Great. Thank you.","Paul Meurer","Thank you.","Operator","And we will move on to Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Dan Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann","Thank you and good afternoon. Just one kind of quick question from me John or for Sumit. How many deals have you done this year that have carried a cap rate north of 8%? And is that something that you guys are looking at or is most everything kind of inline with the averages that you brought for the quarter?","John Case","Yes. I mean we have done north of eight, south of seven, down into the mid sixes at all the 10s. The exact percentage that we have done north of eight. Sumit, do you have that.","Sumit Roy","I don\u2019t. But I would say it\u2019s less than 5% of what we have closed its north of 8% cap rate.","John Case","And when you get to that level Dan, you don\u2019t find much that falls within our investment parameters that we want to execute. So it\u2019s certainly price to that level given some of the risk characteristics that the investments caring. There can be exceptions, but not many. And of course, we are talking about cash cap rates versus GAAP cap rates.","Sumit Roy","The only other thing I would John is where we see the higher yielding stuff, it\u2019s been in our expansions and developments where we are seeing, and you will see that in the supplemental.","We are seeing about an 8% yield. But one-off transactions, acquisition transactions add about eight, I would say, it\u2019s a very small percentage of what we\u2019ve closed down and it\u2019s primarily based on what John said. There are assets we see that trade up those levels, but for many different reasons we chose not to pursue those.","Dan Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay. Thank you very much.","Sumit Roy","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Hey, guys good afternoon.","Paul Meurer","Hey, Ross.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","I joined late, so apologies if you discussed this, but you turned down the DRIP program in the second quarter and what about over $50 million got tapped there, is it your intention going forward, to leave the DRIP open?","Paul Meurer","Yeah, we will opportunistically access that. In the month June, we\u2019ve raised about 53 million at a price just north of $44 a share, I think its 44.35, and as we continue to have acquisition activity that's pretty healthy and that's need to be funded. We\u2019ll opportunistically access that. So we\u2019ll look at it, but it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t have a set plan and place to do a certain amount each quarter.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","I\u2019m just curious how you think about DRIP versus an ATM programs so basically sort of dribbling it retail versus dribbling it institutionally?","Paul Meurer","Well, our direct stock purchase program goes to both institution and retail. ","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Sure. But I imagine most of the buyers were retail than institution on that?","Paul Meurer","We actually control that and actually the majority of the buyers were institutions.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Really, that\u2019s interesting. ","Paul Meurer","Yeah. ","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","I wouldn\u2019t expect that, okay. The other question I have is your friend store over capital on the security there been any comments on their plans to go public, is that a surprise to you or did you think that was going to be on some of these acquisition radar?","Paul Meurer","So, we are focused on running our own business. We know those guys well and have a tremendous amount of respect for Chris and [Mark] (ph). And wish them luck in their endeavors. But we don\u2019t comment on any specific IPOs or any other questions regarding the business of our competitors.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","I appreciate it. Thanks a lot. ","Paul Meurer","All right. Thanks. ","Operator","And we will move on to Todd Lukasik with Morningstar.","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar","Hi, good afternoon, guys. ","John Case","Hey, Todd.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar","Most of my questions have been answered I just had one point of clarification I guess on the initial average lease deal but you guys report in. I know generally not an issue where you guys are paying for maintenance CapEx at all, but sometimes I think that\u2019s kept into the leases. The lease deal you report is that include or exclude any outlets that you guys may have for maintenance CapEx in those deals?","John Case","Yes, it\u2019s NOI yield, so if they are recurring CapEx numbers, they are going to be below that line, but we have very little of that in our net lease portfolio.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar","Got you. Okay, thank you.","John Case","Thank you.","Operator","And this will conclude the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the conference back over to John Case for concluding remarks.","John Case","All right. Thanks, Joshua, and thanks to everyone for joining us today.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard Vice President. Please go ahead.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income Second Quarter 2015 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.","John Case","Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We had a very active second quarter and we are pleased to report excellent results from an acquisitions, capital markets and occupancy standpoint. Additionally we were gratified to be added to the S&P 500 Index in the second quarter. Our AFFO per share growth was 6.3% and a record quarterly amount of $0.68 as announced in yesterday's press release we are increasing our FFO and AFFO per share guidance for 2015 given the Company's positive year-to-date performance and the continued scalability of our business. We believe we are the most efficiently run net lease company with the highest EBITDA margin in the sector today. We are raising our 2015 FFO per share guidance to $2.72 to $2.77 from $2.67 to $2.72. We are raising and tightening the range of our AFFO per share guidance to 2.69 to 2.73 from $2.66 to $2.71. As we continue to anticipate another solid year of earnings growth.","Now I will hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Paul Meurer","Thanks John. As usual, I will provide some brief highlights of our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.1% for the quarter; this increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as healthy same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at June 30th was approximately $983 million. On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.7 million. This increase was primarily due to our two bond offerings last year the $350 million 10 year notes issued in June and $250 million 12 year notes issued in September. We also recognized a non-cash loss of approximately $900,000 on interest rate swaps during the quarter. On a related note our coverage ratios, both remained strong with interest coverage at 4.0 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.6 times.","General and administrative or G&A expenses were approximately $12.6 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expenses is approximately $192,000 in acquisition cost. And note that we do include these acquisition costs in our calculation to both FFO and AFFO. Year to date our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.3%. Our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is now approximately $52 million down from our prior estimate of $55 million as we realized lower than expected expense growth given the efficiencies of our business. Property expenses which were not reimbursed by tenants totaled $3.3 million for the quarter. And our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remains unchanged at approximately $20 million. Provisions for impairment of approximately $3.2 million during the quarter includes impairments we recorded on three properties classified as held for sale and two properties classified as held for investment.","Gain on sales were approximately $3.7 million in the quarter and just a reminder we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.69 for the quarter, a 7.8% increase versus a year ago. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.68 per share for the quarter, a 6.3% increase versus the year ago. Dividend paid increased 4% in the second quarter and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.28 per share.","Now let me briefly turned to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. As you know in early April we raised approximately $276 million of new equity capital in conjunction with our addition to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at a very low cost by offering shares to the index funds needing to buy our stock on that day. We raised an additional $106 million of equity capital during the quarter through our direct stock purchase plan. Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rates and continued to be rated BAA1, BBB+ at a weighted average maturity of 6.7 years.","At the end of the quarter we recapped and expanded our unsecured acquisition credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion comprised of a $2 billion revolving credit facility and a $250 million term loan which is due in 2020 when we have no scheduled unsecured debt maturities. At our current BBB+ BAA1 credit rating the borrowing rate on the revolver is LIBOR plus 90 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 15 basis points which overall represents a 20 basis point reduction for the all in drawn borrowing rate of the previous facility. We very much appreciate the capital commitments from the 21 banks that participated in the syndication of this larger facility for us. Our new $2 billion credit facility had a $430 million balance at June 30th. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $757 million.","Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $40 million in mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015 and our maturity schedule is well lathered thereafter. Currently our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 32% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.9 times.","Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on the quarter.","John Case","Thanks Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.2%, a 20 basis points improvement from last quarter. At the end of the quarter we had 81 properties available for lease out of 4,452 properties on our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.2%, and occupancy based on square footage was 98.8%, both up 10 basis points from last quarter. We continue to see good leasing activity and expect our occupancy to remain around current levels for the end of the year.","We have leases expire on 80 properties during the quarter and we re-leased 81 properties. 73 of those properties were re-leased to existing tenants and 8 for re-leased to new tenants recapturing 106% of expiring rents. This compares favourably to our historical recapture rate of approximately 98% of expiring rents. Additionally four vacant properties were sold during the quarter.","Our same-store rent increased 1.5% during the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. The industry is contributing the most to our quarterly same-store rent growth for health and fitness and motor vehicle dealerships. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. So, we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties leased to both our investment grade and non-investment grade tenants. Approximately 75% of our investments grade leases had rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%.","Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the second quarter, our properties were leased to 235 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at 13%. This quarter we reclassified 14 assets previously classified as manufacturing properties representing approximately 2% of rent for our investor category which better reflects these properties\u2019 uses and better clarify our portfolio composition.","We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants without service, non-discretionary and\/or low price point component to their business. Today more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristics which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete with ecommerce. At the end of the second quarter, our top 20 tenants continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue.","Our largest channel is Walgreens which now accounts for 7.1% of rental revenue, the increase from 5.5% at the end of the last quarter. We continue to like Walgreens\u2019 business their high quality real estate locations and the rent growth we received. We also were confident in the strength of these properties given the visibility we have into their unit level performance. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 4.9% of rental revenue. This quarter we added a new name to our top 20 tenants. Life Time Fitness is now our 13th largest tenant representing 2% of that. During the second quarter, we executed a sale lease back transaction with Life Time Fitness. Life Time Fitness is the tenant we had been meeting with and pursuing for about 10 year now. We followed them through challenging and favourable economic conditions and have been impressed with the performance of their business. We also believe their well located real estate and excellent surrounding demographics and the service orientation of their business make them a great addition to our portfolio.","Drug stores remain our largest industry at 10.7% of rental revenue and increased from 9.6% at the end of the first quarter. The drug store industry continues to be an area we favour given the ageing of our population and today's healthcare trends. The convenient store industry is our second largest at 9.4% of rental revenue. Dollar stores are at 9.1% down 20 basis points from last quarter as many of you may know Dollar Tree completed its acquisition of Family Dollar this month subsequent for our second quarter end.","As part of the transaction in FTC identifying 330 of the combined 14,000 stores for the divestiture, there was no financial impact on our rental revenue as a result of these divestitures. Pro forma Dollar Tree will represent 4.3% of rental revenue health and fitness is our fourth largest industry at 7.2% of rental revenue a 40 basis points increase from last quarter. Health and fitness is the sector we have been invested in since 1998 and it has performed very well for us we continue to like health and fitness given the favourable demographics supporting this industry.","We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants remain sound, our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties is 2.6 times on a four wall basis and importantly the median is also 2.6 times.","Moving on to acquisitions we had a very active second quarter investing 721 million at an initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and initial average lease term of over 18 years. This is the second highest quarterly volume and property level acquisitions in the Company's history. Our straight line cap rate during the quarter was 7% which reflects the attractive rent growth of the acquisition. For the first half of the year we completed 931 million in acquisitions at an initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and an initial average lease term of nearly 18 years. Cap rates remain aggressive but stable. However our investment spreads continue to be favorable and remain above their historical norms. We continue to see a high volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter we sourced about 10.5 billion in acquisition opportunities which brings us to 20 billion in sourced opportunities for the year.","Given our acquisitions activity to-date and the high volume of opportunities we continue to see we are increasing our acquisitions guidance for 2015 to approximately 1.25 billion from our previous estimate of 1 billion. We continue to selectively sell non-strategic assets and redeploy that capital into properties that better fit our investment strategies. During the first half of the year we sold 14 properties for $30.5 million. We sold our least non-strategic assets at a cap rate of 7.8%. We continue to expect a minimum of 50 million in dispositions for 2015 and that figure could go up a bit. Now I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. During the second quarter of 2015, we invested 721 million in 100 properties located in 33 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 18.2 years. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 49% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 98% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 2% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants and 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, drug stores and home improvement. Of the 16 independent transactions closed in the second quarter two transactions were about 50 million.","Year to date second quarter 2015 we invested 931 million in 166 properties located in 35 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 17.5 years. On the revenue basis 52% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 92% of the revenues are generated from retail and 8% are from industrial these assets are leased to 27 different tenants in 16 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our health and fitness, drug stores and quick service restaurants. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year to date three transactions were about 50 million.","Transaction flow continues to remain healthy, we resources more than 10 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date we have sourced approximately 20 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 66% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 34% or approximately 7 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 21% for the year-to-date. Of the $721 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, approximately 5% were one-off transactions. We remained selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing on less than 7% of deals sourced and continued to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships.","As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain tight in the second quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. As John highlighted, our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold five properties for 8 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of over 11.6%. This brings us to 14 properties sold year-to-date for 30.1 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized an unlevered IRR of 12.3%.","Our investments spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 140 basis points in the second quarter, which were around our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less the nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Year-to-date based on the weighted average cost of the long-term capital raised our estimated investment spreads were approximately 200 basis points, notably above our historical average.","In conclusion the second quarter investments remain solid at 7.21 million while sourcing more than 10 billion in transactions. Our year-to-date spreads remained about historical levels. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We are also taking advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to dispose assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2015 to approximately 1.25 billion.","With that I'd like to hand it back to John.","John Case","Thanks, Sumit. We are pleased to have taken advantage of the capital market conditions during the first half of the year, that satisfied the majority of our capital needs for acquisitions year-to-date, raising 484 million in equity capital at an average per share price of approximately $50 and issuing a $250 million unsecured term loan at 2.7%. Additionally our new $2 billion revolving credit facility was recapped at a lower rate than our previous revolver and provides for additional financial flexibility as we continue to grow our company.","Our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive earnings growth while investing in high quality assets. We increased the dividends pay this quarter by 4% on a year-over-year basis. We have increased our dividend every year since the Company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of almost 5%. Our payout ratio in the second quarter was 83.7% which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. Finally to wrap it up, we continue to maintain excellent momentum in our business. We continue to have very active dialogues regarding potential acquisition opportunities with existing and perspective tenets. We remain well positioned to execute on acquisitions with approximately 1.6 billion available on our new $2 billion revolving line of credit.","At this time, I would like to open it up for questions, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Josh Dennerlein","This is actually Josh Dennerlein with Juan Sanabria. Two questions for you guys. First, can you talk about the specific cap rates, rent coverages and annual rent bumps for the Walgreens in Life Time Fitness portfolios?","John Case","No, we're not allowed to talk about the specifics of the Walgreens transaction based on non-disclosure agreement, we've executed with them.","Josh Dennerlein","Okay. How about Life Time Fitness, any -- could you maybe talk about how you thought about alternative values and residual values for the assets?","John Case","Yes I can walk you through Life Time Fitness, obviously it is an industry we like we've been in that industry since 1998. There continues to be a secular shift to healthy lifestyles and we're seeing that in the health and fitness facilities. We see that, with both baby boomers and millennials. And health club usage continues to rise. We saw attractive risk-adjusted returns in this investment. It's well structured with a strong cash flow coverage of 3.2 times and a drop in sales to breakeven on our property to 45%. If you look at the last recession the great recession Life Time same-store revenues fell by just under 3% in 2008 and about 7% in 2009 and then turned positive in subsequent years. So, they performed quite well during some very challenging times. The properties that we own are located in the affluent dense markets with high on average household incomes of 74,000 within a 5 mile radius and in densely populated areas with 217,000 people within a 5 mile radius of our properties.","We were able to execute this transaction at about a 20% discount to replacement cost and have a portfolio of properties that are well above the average sales. And EBITDAR levels of the overall cause so we were quite pleased with it.","The going in cap rate was 6.5% the straight line cap rate which would reflect the growth and the cash growth in the lease over the lease term was about 8%. So, we were pleased with the growth. As we look at the transaction, we really viewed it more as something and when you ask 10 years of financial and operating history and our credit and research team analogue that quite subtly. And we were convinced that these would continue to be operated as health and fitness clubs. If there had to be a residual use the most likely residual use would be office if they could not be used as health clubs but there are other companies that have operated large health clubs of this size including Club Core, Equinox and Bay Club. So they could be potential tenants as well. So, if we were to convert these to office, they are probably looking at something from $50 to $75 a foot to make these office properties but that's not really having looked at it.","Operator","We will go next to Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","I'm curious, what the impact is of interest rate volatility in terms of your conversations with potential sellers?","John Case","Well it comes up some there's been a fair amount of it and it comes up in discussions where we're talking about pricing and it is something certainly that witnessed a down swing, sellers are trying to put pressure on us and when there's an upswing in the 10 year treasury rate we are certainly are pushing for more yield with regard to our initial cap rates and our overall cap rates.","Nick Joseph","You've historically seen a correlation between increased volatility and less acquisition volume or do you think it's more just on the pricing?","John Case","No, I mean we've been in an environment that has been volatile with regard to interest rates as you've seen and we've sourced year-to-date $20 billion in acquisition opportunities which puts us on a pace that would break our all time high in terms of sourced acquisition opportunities.","Nick Joseph","And then tell us about the decision to issue the five year debt versus doing a longer dated maturity?","John Case","Yes, sure we did issue the $250 million of five year unsecured note with our bank growth and it was really done for several reasons. One is we did have a window in our maturity schedule at five years and one of the issues with the banks has been that we typically not kept a lot of outstandings on our revolver. And they were looking for more funded balances, so when we had 21 banks step up and connect to a recast new expanded facility of $2 billion and we wanted to make sure we were meeting some of their demands and some of their desires as well and something they had asked for was a concurrent term loan with a revolver and they were much more comfortable and desirable on a five year term than a 10 year term where we also have a window on our maturities. So, that drove it and very attractive pricing, pricing well inside of where we could have gotten a five-year unsecured note issued in the unsecured debt market.","Nick Joseph","Thanks, and then I guess with over 400 on the credit facility and then 150 million coming due later in this year. Should we expect a 10 year offering later?","John Case","We're going to look at our capital options as the markets evolve over the remainder of the year and determine how we want to fund the business based on what the market share was. So it could range from all types of capital now from 10 year longer to equity as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Just to clarify on Life Time. Can you may be I guess you looked at some of the other tranches or portfolios or with tranches within Life Time that were being marketed. What were maybe some of the differences it sounds like maybe the term of the rent pumps were different from something that one of your peers took about?","John Case","The portfolios were all very similar. And we were obviously pleased with the portfolio we received and were able to work with Life Time in structuring that portfolio and it met our demands and it also met the desires of the Life Time team.","Vikram Malhotra","But your rent bumps were higher or your term was different from the other portfolios?","John Case","Our lease term was 25 years which I think is different than the lease term on some of the other portfolios I believe.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay and then as you look at these couple of portfolio you've done. Is there -- are they under a master lease and can you -- do you have the ability to if you choose to maybe sell a few of the assets?","John Case","Yes they're under a master lease but we have no intention of selling the assets that are in that portfolio.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay and then just maybe last one if you look forward if you look at your guidance obviously it bakes in about 150 million a quarter which is a bit lower but I'm assuming that\u2019s just kind of the baseline acquisitions the relationship driven ones. And so over and above that there could be other portfolios that you may close?","John Case","Yes the acquisitions status we have provided for the year assumes our one-off transactions as well as our smaller portfolio transactions and we did not factor in any large sale lease back or very large portfolio transactions?","Vikram Malhotra","And just what cap rate are you assuming for the back half of the year?","John Case","As we look forward we think cap rates will be in the mid to high 6s for the type of properties we buy.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Tyler Grant with Green Street Advisors.","Tyler Grant","You guys have done a good job raising the bar for the net lease sector on real estate related disclosure. With that said it seems that a good next progression should be to improve disclosure related to the quality of the lease contracts. So for example the percentage of tenants that report unit level financials investment amounts relative to replacement costs or the proportion of assets that are not operating but are paying rents. Can you provide some numbers for lease data points now and maybe for similar data points that you believe are worth mentioning. And then also going forward what's the feasibility of providing this type of data systematically within your quarterly financials?","John Case","Yes I mean we will continue as we have done this quarter to add data to our supplemental investor package which we agree with you is the most robust in the industry. A lot of our competitors are not providing anywhere near the level of information we are. And we certainly have issues with some of the information that present competitive issues for us to consider. So we're going to see where the industry involves to our and continue to add and tweak our supplemental package. But in terms of just a full dump of everything we're not anticipating doing that for competitive reasons at this point.","Tyler Grant","And I guess if I look at it even if we got aggregate numbers. So for example the converge ratio of 2.6 that you guys disclosed. What percentage of your retailers are actually providing you with financials so that you can arrive at that figure?","John Case","Yes so just under 70% of our retail tenants providers\u2019 sales and profit and loss information. So that should give you an idea of what that number is.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Dan Donlan","John or Sumit we're just curious the releasing spread of 107 was up nicely versus the first quarter and seems to be quite higher than I would have expected given kind of the nature of your business. Can you maybe talk about why the leasing spread was so positive was it any one tenant or any detail would be helpful?","John Case","Yes I mean the primary reason why as we were able to retain 90% of our existing tenants this quarter. And those tenants typically have options to renew those options have a fairly significant cost to them. So they exercise the options to renew and that resulted in the high rent relative to the expiring rent.","Dan Donlan","Okay. And then just...","John Case","Go ahead.","Dan Donlan","Yes, and I was asking another question, the -- as far as your tenants that are not rated, could you maybe give us a percentage of those tenants that are not rated because they don't have any debt in other words they would be investment grades but they just don't have any debt or do you have any metrics on that?","John Case","Well, we do and I don't have them off the top of my head there are a number of tenants you're talking about the 52% non-investment grade rated tenants?","Dan Donlan","Right.","John Case","I would say that you can get that figure but we don't have that right now. I mean some are rated and are below investment grade and some are simply not rated and have excellent balance sheets but are just not rated.","Dan Donlan","Okay. And then I guess a question for Paul. The $20 million of un-reimbursed property expenses seems fairly high, given that you've only recognized, I think 7.3 million year-to-date. So just kind of curious, is there some type of seasonality in this number or are you just being conservative or is there some type of onetime items you're expecting?","Paul Meurer","And that's good observation. So, the property expenses have come in a little bit lower maintenance utilities, bad debt expense is lower kind of across the board. There is a little bit of seasonality, typically the second half of the year, un-reimbursed property expenses are higher. But to be candid that 20 million is a number we're monitoring and we suspect that, that could be a high estimate we shall see as the year progresses but the second half for the year typically is a little bit higher.","Dan Donlan","Okay. I appreciate that. And then just on the G&A, coming down 3 million, you briefly touched on it but, we are just kind of curious, if you could give us a little bit more detail, I mean, did you just not need to hire as many people or kind of what was more detail would be helpful?","John Case","I can provide that, we did realize some specific cost savings that we had not anticipated in October, when we originally constructed the G&A budget for this year and those were really in our legal area with insurance. And with our annual report and when you handle that this year and those on a combined basis were seven figure number with regard to savings. We also saw that we are more appropriately staffed for our activity than we had expected to be last October. Over the last four years, we have increased our headcounts here by 50% and we have added a lot of skilled excellent staff members, team members who have done a great job. So, we're really beginning to realize the efficiencies and the scalability of our business and this was a conscious decision we made several years ago, that build the team, anticipating the growth in the sector and certainly our continued growth. So, that's what you're seeing in that G&A line. And we're certainly pleased to see it. And I would expect our G&A margins to continue to be at this level or even continue to decline.","Dan Donlan","And then just last one for Paul more or John. Just kind of curious on the decision to swap out that the term note you really don't have a lot of floating rate debt and I can understand being conservative but why not just have a little bit more floating rate debt at this point in time, what's the thought process there?","Paul Meurer","We looked at that, in fact when we were making that decision, we took a look at our peer group inclusive of not only the net-lease sector but our S&P 500 peers and what our floating rate debt exposure looks like in our balance sheet, we compared very favourably, even if we had not swapped out that term loan, we would still be very much in the low-end of that spectrum in terms of exposure to variable rate and floating rate debt in our balance sheet. But ultimately we came to the decision that we wanted to continue to handle the balance sheet as we have historically, which is to lock in longer term generally unsecured fixed rate alternatives there that much fund, our acquisitions and not to be exposed to any rising interest rates going forward and the volatility that that's associated with. But right now other than our credit facility the only exposure we have to variable rate debt is the $15.5 million of mortgage debt exposure.","Operator","We'll go next to Todd Lukasik with Morningstar Capital.","Todd Lukasik","Just one on the same-store rents, I noticed motor vehicle dealerships were a large contributor up 17% in the quarter, can you just explain how you got such a big jump? Is that just bigger re-leasing spreads upon expiration and renewal or it is something else going on there?","John Case","Really it was a function of percentage rents that drove that. Trading with those which is our largest motor vehicle dealership kind of had a particularly strong first half of the year and as we see economy recover, we've seen RV sales grow quite a bit and as a result they took in some percentage rents which derive that number.","Todd Lukasik","Is that something that resets the base rents higher then or is that potentially a headwind at some time in future quarters?","John Case","No, it doesn't reset the base rent.","Todd Lukasik","And then I think historically you guys have had a bit more preserved equity in the capital structure. I'm just wondering if you could go through your thought process on that is it likely to increase again on a go-forward basis there is preferred too expensive at this point relative to other funding sources?","John Case","Right now, it is not priced appropriately, it's something we always looked at and we do have about 2% out there in preferred right now. But it's been more efficient and effective for us to use alternative forms and capital given where that market is right now. There's certainly windows in that market where it's attractive and we will consider reassuring but currently that opportunity does not exist.","Todd Lukasik","Okay and then just one last one from me. Can you comment on what percentage of the transactions that you evaluate and maybe also the percentage of transactions that you close if the number is different? That are off market as opposed to being marketed to a number of potential buyers or is there everything just so competitive that it is all on market stuff?","John Case","Well I mean most of what we did this year has been relationship oriented. It's over 90%, but that doesn't mean we were the only firm to look at the acquisition. That could be a strictly negotiated transaction with the tenant or seller which some have been but it also could mean they accepted our price at a lower price in order to do business with us given the strength of our relationship or they gave us a last look at the pricing on the transaction and an opportunity to top the competitor based on the relationship. The two large sales lease backs that we did this quarter were really during primarily on relationship basis although as we have already discussed, the Life Time was shown doing select few players in this sector.","Operator","We're going next to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Just to beat a dead horse on the Life Time deal, I recall you get to pick and choose somewhat when the BJ's wholesale portfolio went to a few buyers, was that the case with this deal, I mean how much more real estate could you have acquired and did you get first look?","John Case","There were just a select few firms in this business that got the first look, so we were not the exclusive one. And we did have an opportunity to help construct the portfolio that we ended up with.","Todd Stender","And then just as part of the underwriting with the tenant now that's owned by private equity firm, is there an extra margin of safety that you factor in versus say doing a sale-leaseback with an owner that may have a longer term ownership time horizon?","John Case","No, we certainly approached the private equity driven transactions with caution for a good reason. Generally there time horizon is shorter in terms of their investment in the business than a corporate tenant driven transaction. However in this case the senior and executive management team are likely be to remain major owners of the company and continue to own it. So, that was a bit unique, but even given that you heard me earlier, Todd, walk through the metrics. We structured this transaction very conservatively so we feel very comfortable with that. But we certainly have the added comfort of knowing that the CEO and the management team are heavily invested in the equity of this company going forward.","Todd Stender","Okay, thanks John. And Paul, your line is credit, obviously expanded. It now has a $430 million balance. How do you evaluate how big a balance remains comfortable I guess in your eyes, is it relative to how much availability you have? Is it a percentage of total debt? What kind of measurement steps do you use?","Paul Meurer","Overall, we are always going to look at the overall leverage in the organization. And that would be a piece of that leverage, right? So, you can\u2019t just look at it by itself. The nice thing about having a larger facility, as it just generally gives us more flexibility. It allows us to I don\u2019t want to say time to permanent capital markets but at least be available when something is attractive either in equity or in bonds or whatever it might be and having a larger line carrying a little bit more balance still doesn\u2019t jeopardize the liquidity that we like to have available there for our acquisition efforts. So it is just is a net positive for us in terms of our acquisition approach going forward having that liquidity and then having the flexibility to do something when the timing is right relative to the market. But we don\u2019t look at it by itself we look at it as a piece of the raw capital structure and that our primary exposure if you will to variable rate debt.","Todd Stender","Okay and then looks like you used the five year term loan at a pretty low coupon to fund some of the Q2 acquisitions. That would done at a cap rate closer to six than say your traditional 7% is it fair to say that we won't be seeing those low cap rates in your acquisitions going forward just because you'll be probably tapping longer term capital?","John Case","Yes I think from a cap rate standpoint what we'll be looking at are cap rates for the remainder of the year and the mid to upper 6s. And we really didn\u2019t find that finding acquisition sort of luring the year at more aggressive cap rates at shorter term debt because the cap rates were lower it was really more a function of what I explained earlier and that once that we had the five year window in our maturity schedule and the banks were very supportive about having a balance outstanding through them since our historical utilization of the line of credit had been minimal.","Operator","We'll go next to Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore","And Paul I have a question for you too on the expenses and the tenant reimbursements. We calculate an expense recovery ratio and so we look at the percentage that you get back and that jumped in the quarter because you got a bunch of tenant reimbursements and a lot of extra operating expenses. Is that the right way to think about it because as you do more acquisitions right you're going to assume some of sort of tenant recovery rate that isn\u2019t 100%. And then why do you think that would have jumped in the second quarter?","Paul Meurer","Yes I saw that dialogue in your piece and any look at as we have mentioned EBITDA margins for the business I think is a very good way to look at it. Because we think we\u2019re very efficient not only in our G&A but in our property expense side. There is no trend there Rich each lease has its own element of negotiation or if it is an existing lease that we assume relative to the nature of what might be reimbursed or what we may or may not be responsible for. So there is no real trend to look to there in terms of expenses being reimbursed any more or less now or going forward. Other than to say that we expect that to be continue to be a very efficient line item less than 2% of our overall revenues in the portfolio in the property expense area.","Rich Moore","And then as you get acquisitions I assume going forward you're not going to get 100% recovery. So we got to think about as we grow your portfolio with acquisitions we got to put some of that as non-recovered expenses as well?","John Case","It depends on the type of acquisitions we're doing. The majority of them are all recoverable, so we would not anticipate that percentage 2% moving very much in fact it may come down a bit especially given some of the recent acquisitions we've made.","Rich Moore","Then I'm curious when you guys when you did your 200 basis points spread calculation to the cost of assets with the cost of capital. What stock price did you initially said it was a long-term sort of view. But I mean like what roughly was the stock price used to get something like that?","John Case","Yes so it was just a shade under $50 it was 49.70. If you look at the V-Lock of our capital for the first six months of year and look at our spreads on our acquisitions year to date based on that number. The spreads are 170 basis points, so 80% we funded 80% of the acquisitions we've done year to date and based on the cost of the actual funding we viewed our spreads to our weighted average cost of capital were 200 basis points which was the number you heard too as I said earlier. Does that answer your question?","Rich Moore","Yes it does, yes thank you John. So as I think about yes it does very much thank you as i think going forward then at the current share price they are not substantially below then I mean a little bit below that. But I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt your spreads significantly even the issue equity here?","John Case","Our cost of capital overall right now is running just below 5% so it's still attractively priced. So, if we can continue to buy assets at initial spreads 150 to 175 basis points based on our anticipated cap rates for the reminder of the year, those cap rates are still -- those spreads are still comfortably above our historical averages so we\u2019d be pleased with that. Our cost of equity is reasonable at this level. And certainly our debt costs while they have come up a little bit we can still issue 10 year debt right around 4%.","Rich Moore","Okay. Good, thanks. And then the last thing I had was on your build to suite or your development pipeline it seems like just I'm assuming it is moving in and out of there because you had fewer projects, I think with higher cost. I mean do you have any sort of summary of what happened in the quarter, I mean, deliveries that kind of thing?","John Case","Sure, Sumit can handle that that fluctuates, it's a little higher and we have just under 92 million under development right now. And we have funded it at this point about 25 million of that.","Sumit Roy","Yes that's exactly right, John. You have got 65 million of unfunded obligations. Most of the developments that you're seeing Rich is with our FedEx expansions. That continues to be a higher yielding investment for us and those are investments that, it allows us to continue to push out the leases beyond the original exploration when we do an investment for them. Along with FedEx we're also ding investments in AMCs that continues to be a good investment and we do have some build to suit on the retail side that I do not wish to disclose the name at this point but those continue to be a higher yielding form of our investment opportunity set.","Rich Moore","Okay and so each quarter, Sumit, what do you think you\u2019d add roughly to the pipeline?","Sumit Roy","Each quarter, our run rate has been right around this 90 million unit it has fluctuated from anywhere between 70 units it's been as high as 110. So, about 90 million seems to be rightly would like to be a bit more, given the size of the company, I think you've heard John mention that we would like to see it go as high as 250 but we've not been able to achieve that so the run rate historically has been right around what you see it today.","Operator","We will go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James.","Collin Mings","I guess my first question just as far as the mix of industrial going forward, I know obviously few large deals impacted the mix here in the second quarter but can you just talk about in the deal pipeline as you are looking at the more industrial deals and has there been any shift to how you think about the investment great mix historically pretty high on the industrial front so just put just more color on that if you could?","John Case","Yes, we're really reacting Collin to the opportunities we see in the marketplace. So, we have very high retail numbers year-to-date and for the quarter and we continue to see attractive industrial opportunities but some of those opportunities are very aggressively priced today and we've elected to pass on them. So it's hard to predict the future but we will continue to be active on the industrial front and look at the opportunities that our investment parameters and are priced appropriately for us. And we will certainly continue to look at those investment grade and non-investment grade retail investments as we've done.","Collin Mings","Okay and then I guess, kind of switching gears, just as far as I'm casual dining I am just curious here about I mean you guys have brought exposure down I think it was north of 10% a few years ago now down to about 4%, can you just remind us how you are thinking about that sector particularly just in context of going out there looking to sell assets at a 55 cap?","John Case","Yes, I mean we continue to look at the QSR and casual dining sector they each separately represent 4% of our revenues and we've always been cautious on casual dining as you know, as you alluded to. For our casual dining investment for us, we want to see an operating concept that has positive trends, we want to see really healthy coverage, coverage beyond what we seen in our overall portfolio, probably three times or greater. We want to see rents that are approximately at market and we want to be add approximately replacement cost on our investments. So, we have a high hurdle there, we have looked at some casual dining investment opportunities and we continue to do that. We haven't seen any on a large scale portfolio basis that meet our parameters for I'd say quality and pricing but we would certainly consider the right type of casual dining transaction.","Collin Mings","Okay. Now that's helpful color. Then just real quickly, can you give us any what the watch list is as a percent of revenue, I don't know, if I missed that, and has there been any shift on that front?","John Case","Yes it's still at 1.2% which represents about 150 million in properties and what I have said earlier was on the dispositions front, if anything, I mean we had budgeted for 50 million in dispositions, if anything that could check up a bit, and we may sell a little more and that is obviously coming from that watch list, so we prepare it down just a shade, but it's been kind of steady right around 1.2% for the last several quarters.","Operator","We'll go next to Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross Nussbaum","Hi guys it's been a long call, but I've got two questions for you, the first is on your re-leasing spreads, or I guess more specifically, the spreads when you re-leased to a new tenant. If I think back 10-15 years ago, to the Realty Income I grew up with, there was a lot of talk about making sure that the rents on acquired properties on the portfolio were around market and that was one of the considerations for acquisitions. So, I guess it's a little disappointing to see these properties getting re-leased at down 30% to 35%, what exactly is going on with -- it's not a completely insignificant number of properties that it's such a dramatic roll down in rent?","John Case","So, if you are looking at the year-to-date, I guess that's in our supplement as where you're getting that information on Page 24, for everyone re-leasing to new tenants, with and without vacancy you're seeing a 30% low down in rents. The issue there is simply, those are -- that's the market, I mean we're also disappointed that it's not higher overall our re-leasing spreads are positive at a -- just under 103%. We've executed more than 1,900 lease rollovers in the Company's history and have a lot of experience at this the majority of the assets that we do re-lease are re-leased at a positive spread and year-to-date 105% of expiring rents to the same tenant.","Ross Nussbaum","Where -- maybe the follow-up is if I looked at the entire portfolio today, do you have a sense of what the market-to-market is on the entire portfolio?","John Case","With regards with rents?","Ross Nussbaum","Yes.","John Case","Yes I mean there you can see it that we're roughly at market rents, it's slightly on the entire portfolio just slightly above. So, there's not a very big differencial between our contractual rents and market rents.","Ross Nussbaum","Second question I had is on the Walgreens acquisition, I know there's not too much you can say, but if I extrapolate based on the cap rate of the Life Time Fitness deal and the average cap rate which you bought properties, it would suggest that the Walgreens pricing was close to 6 or could it have been below, I guess my question would be why does it makes sense at this point in the cycle when the private market -- the 1031 market is going bananas. Why pay up for the creme de la creme corner Walgreens location -- why is that the transaction that makes sense versus perhaps stepping a little further down the credit curve, or just passing on that opportunity completely?","John Case","Yes well, that was a well structured transaction for us and I can't go into details on it, but it looks certainly more favourable than what you see in the 1031 market. And that's an industry and a tenant that we like a lot, you've heard us discuss quite a bit given what's happening in the healthcare industry and with our ageing population and the performance of that company. So, it was an attractive investment and I would say this, we don't do large institutional sale lease back transactions without rental rate growth. [Multiple speakers] In the private market, 1031market it's back as you alluded to and we're seeing quite pricing there at the 5% area. We've even seen some four handles there, so, there is a certainly premium for the one offs that don't necessarily exist for the larger portfolios and then certainly a relationship element to our business with them as well.","Operator","We will go next to Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.","Chris Lucas","John, just a follow-up question on the comments you just about sort of the intensity or the competitiveness of the 1031 market just wondering does it make sense to sort of start ramping up your disposition program to take advantage of some of that arbitrage?","John Case","What we are seeing now is we have been in a period for a while where there has been a portfolio premium where people were teaming to get more capital out the door. That pricing has not become less expensive what's happened is the banks have returned to the market for the one off and the smaller portfolios and are lending quite aggressively. So you\u2019ve seen that 1031 market pricing surge and they are fairly equivalent across the board there is very few opportunities as the one that I just described where the arb there is more significant. But we don\u2019t want to sell properties and we don\u2019t want to own long-term and so we're not seeing enough of an arb yet to crank crest back up. But it's something we look at every quarter so that\u2019s a good question.","Chris Lucas","And then just for you or for Paul just sitting where we are today with the capital market conditions as they are. If you had to make a decision about raising equity a bit more long-term unsecured debt which -- would you have a preference for either under the current conditions?","John Case","We'd be comfortable with either given the strength of the balance sheet and the pricing of both yes we\u2019d be comfortable with either right now.","Chris Lucas","And then maybe a little more detailed question on the term facility, Paul is there flexibility or ease that the capital markets present every opportunity to easily prepay that and replace it with some more permanent capital?","Paul Meurer","Yes it is fully pre payable without penalty at any time.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.","John Case","Thanks Ricky and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you this fall at the various conferences and we hope everyone has a great end to their summer. Thanks again.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation."],"18158":["Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call July 28, 2016  2:30 PM ET","Executives","Janeen Bedard - VP, Administration","John Case - CEO","Paul Meurer - CFO and Treasurer","Sumit Roy - President and COO","Analysts","Joshua Dennerlein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Robert Stevenson - Janney","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Daniel Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann","Tyler Grant - Green Street Advisors","Nicholas Joseph - Citi","Chris Lucas - Capital One Securities.","Todd Stender - Wells Fargo","Collin Mings - Raymond James","Landon Park - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Please stand by, we\u2019re about to begin. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s Second Quarter 2016 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be: John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company\u2019s Form 10-Q.","We will be observing a two-question limit the during the Q&A portion of the call; in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have an additional question please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.","John Case","Thanks, Janeen, and welcome to our call today. We\u2019re pleased to report another active quarter for acquisitions and healthy AFFO per share growth of 4.4% to $0.71. As announced in yesterday\u2019s Press Release we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance from $900 million to approximately $1.25 billion and reiterating our AFFO per share guidance for 2016 of $2.85 to $2.90.","Given the attractive capital available in the equity markets we accelerated our equity raising activities by raising nearly a 0.5 billion of equity year-to-date at very attractive 0:01:57.4 cost. This activity was not in our original plan, but we believe it was the prudent decision and it positions our company well for the future.","Our balance sheet is now in the best shape in our company\u2019s history. Based on the ongoing confidence we have in our business and our financial strength, we\u2019ve elected to provide our shareholders with an additional 1% increase in the monthly dividend payable in September which represents a 6.1% increase over September of 2015.","Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks, John. I will provide a few highlights for some items in our financial statements for the quarter.","Starting with the income statement; other revenue in this quarter was a negative amount negative 129,000. This was a result of a reclassification of some revenue from other revenue that was book in Q1 to rental revenue that it is reflected here in Q2.","Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.4% this quarter, due to higher stock compensation cost for our Board of Directors in the quarter. The stock grant occurred in May and our higher stock prices in spring caused this expense to be a little higher.","Year-to-date SG&A is only 5.1% of revenues and we\u2019re still projecting approximately 5% for the year. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.4% and we\u2019re still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we\u2019ve continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We\u2019ve raised $487 million of common equity capital thus far this year our $2 billion credit facility which has a $1 billion expansion option has a balance of approximately $530 million.","Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $22.6 million of our mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remained in very good shape, with only $5 million in mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due during the second half of 2016. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter.","Finally, our overall leverage remains low with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.1 times. So in summary we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and good excess to both equity and debt capital, both which are well priced financial alternatives for us right now.","Let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background.","John Case","Thanks, Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98%, a 20 basis points increase from last quarter. Economic occupancy was 98.9% also up from last quarter.","We continue to make good progress with our re-leasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. From the 37 properties we re-leased during the quarter we recaptured 92% of the expiring rent. As it\u2019s typical for us we had no spending on tenant improvements in connection with our re-leasing.","Year-to-date we have recaptured a 103% of expiring rent on 75 lease rollovers which remains well above our long term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with expiring leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to our net-lease, our peer companies who also report this metric.","Our same store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. We continue to expect annual same store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. Approximately 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. We remain pleased with the growth we were able to achieve from our properties, without having to incur any significant recurring maintenance capital expenditures to generate this growth. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we have never had a year with negative same store rent growth.","Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 246 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.","79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the second quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenues and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue.","We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in the second half of this year by Walgreens pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue.","The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.7 times on a four wall basis and the median remained 2.6 times.","Moving on to acquisitions, we completed $310 million in acquisitions during the quarter and for the first half of the year, we completed $663 million in acquisitions, at record high investment spreads related to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters.","For the first half of the year, we sourced approximately $15 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy acquiring under 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date, which is consistent with our average since 2010.","As I mentioned, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.25 billion and continue to acquire the highest quality net leased properties as we grow our portfolio.","I\u2019ll hand it over to Sumit Roy, to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions activities.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. During the second quarter of 2016, we invested $310 million in 57 properties, located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.5 years.","On a revenue basis, 58% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 68% of the revenues are generated from retail and 32% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 14 industries.","Some of the most significant industries represented our transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and discount grocery stores. We closed 22 independent transactions in the second quarter and the average investment per property was approximately $5.4 million.","Year-to-date 2016 we invested $663 million in a 154 properties located in 34 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years.","On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 78% of the revenues are generated from retail and 22% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 23 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our casual dining restaurants, transportation services and motor vehicle dealerships. Of the 41 independent transactions closed year-to-date one transactions was about $50 million.","Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $8 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date we have sourced approximately $15 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 60% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $6 billion were one-off assets.","Investment grade opportunities represented 64% for the second quarter. Of the $300 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 65% were one-off transactions. After pricing, cap rates remained flat in the second quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active.","During the quarter, we sold 15 properties for net proceeds of $24 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.5%. This brings us to 26 properties sold year-to-date for $35 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.4%, unrealized an unlevered IRR of 9.3%.","Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 252 basis points in the second quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.","So in conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisitions guidance for 2016 to approximately $1.25 billion and we remain confident in reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million.","With that, I\u2019d like to hand it back to John.","John Case","Thank you, Sumit. As I mentioned, we have successfully issued approximately $0.5 billion in common equity year-to-date. Approximately $55 million of the equity raised was executed opportunistically through our ATM program during the final week of June and reflect at the lowest cost of equity raised in our company\u2019s history.","Today, our investment spreads related to our nominal cost of equity are well in excess of our historical investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital, which allows us to drive earnings growth as well as further strengthen our balance sheet. Our leverage continues to be at historical lows with debt to total market cap of approximately 21% and debt-to-EBITDA of 5.1 times.","Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion revolving line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. We are pleased that our sector leading credit strength was recognized in the second quarter by Moody\u2019s and S&P, both of which upgraded us giving positive outlook while reaffirming our BAA1 and BBB+ credit ratings.","Yesterday we announced our 87th dividend increase payable in September which represents a 6.1% increase over the dividend in September of 2015. We\u2019ve increased our dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%.","Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with.","To wrap it up, we had another good quarter and remain optimistic about our future. As demonstrated by our sector leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%. We continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in our net lease business.","Our portfolio is performing well and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest quality opportunities given our sector leading cost-to-capital and balance sheet flexibility.","At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll first hear from Josh Dennerlein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joshua Dennerlein","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m curious know why the initial yields and this cap rates on Q2 investments came in at 6.3% looks it goes down from 6.6% in 1Q. Did that have to do with just asset mix that you purchased or was that a broader move in cap rates across the board?","John Case","That was really a function of the assets repurchase. In first quarter, our average cap rates was 6.5% and we round it down to 6.3% for the second quarter. So it\u2019s really a reflection of the high quality properties which would include great real estate locations good investment structures as well as the quality of the tenant and the industry; and we also had a fairly high percentage for the quarter of investment grade tenants during just under 60%, which is higher than we typically see and that also help to drive the pricing in that. But for the year, we\u2019re still guiding to somewhere right around 6.5%, Josh.","Joshua Dennerlein","Thanks, I appreciate that. So it sounds like you really haven\u2019t seen any moving cap rates from my perspective we\u2019ve just - we\u2019ve seen the 10 year drop pretty substantially post breaks it both. So we weren\u2019t sure if it was translating into any moves across asset types.","John Case","We\u2019ve not seen any movements in cap rates in our sector. We kind a look at it is investment grade and non-investment grade. And on the investment grade side we\u2019re still seen a cap rate range by anywhere from the low-fives up into the high sixes on the initial yield. And on the non-investment grade product we\u2019re seeing anything from an initial yield high-five\u2019s up to around just north of 8% and that\u2019s exactly where it was a quarter ago. So we haven\u2019t seen and react to due to the change in capital cost that\u2019s resulted in all time high on spreads that we\u2019re experiencing right now.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Rob Stevenson of Janney.","Robert Stevenson","Good afternoon, guys. John, can you talk a little bit about the magnitude of the sale leaseback transactions that are in the market. I assume in your billions of dollars of deals that you\u2019ve look at, if you look at a few of those. I mean how robust is that today? Are some of the tenants pulling back on that or you seeing an acceleration of those type of deals whether or not you guys are doing them or just to even looking at them?","John Case","Yeah, I mean, we are seeing a nice glow of sale leaseback opportunities. When you look at what we have done to date and seen, it is running near 40%. So, there is a great deal of activity out there. Overall, in terms of sourced opportunities year-to-date, we are in the proximally $15 billion, that is a good number. We can continue to see good transaction flow. And some of that flow is sale leaseback opportunities, large ones with single tenants which are well positioned to do. We we\u2019ll see whether they happen or not. So, we are still seeing good investment opportunities.","Robert Stevenson","And given your tenants concentration, I mean, what is your tolerance these days size wise for any of these transactions? I mean, anything that would wind-up elevating somebody in your top five or seven tenants?","John Case","Well, I\u2019ll say this, in terms of tenants, we like to see them in the mid to high single-digits. You want to maintain our diversification and we want it to be the right tenant in terms of industry. We want to see industries in the low double-digits. Now, we may have period of time where we go above those levels for tenants and industries, but we will manage back down to be diversified. So, 5% of ramp represents a transaction of about $750 million. So, that will kind of give you an idea, I think that covers it.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thank you. I guess, I\u2019m just trying to think, just take a picture of you guys in some of your peers I know it\u2019s a fairly unique situation from cost to capital standpoint. Just tactically and strategically, can you walk us through how you\u2019re thinking about using this cost to capital, whether you referenced quality assets a couple of times, but are there other sectors you can look at, sorry, sub sectors, the type of property size, and then maybe you just overlay how you think about near term accretion versus long-term?","John Case","Yeah, we only get to your first one on our cost-to-capital advantage. Real estate discipline and investment wide what\u2019s within our investment parameters? We\u2019ve been asked this question fairly frequently and we are not going to go out and do transactions that we are not comfortable with, just to drive accretion of earnings growth where we think the long-term returns are not going to meet our hurdle rate due to the quality of the investment. So, we are fortunate and that we are seeing plenty of opportunities that need our investment criteria and with our spreads in our distinct cost to capital advantage we are able to drive growth.","So when we underwrite properties, we are really we are focusing the IRR and it doesn\u2019t mean a hurdle rate over the long term and we are also looking at what sort of accretion does it produce today, and usually that\u2019s the easiest hurdle. And then the challenging aspect to the underwriting process is getting something that you know and you feel confident about this going to perform over 20 year or 15 year lease term and the percentage I believe, you are going to be have good recapture on that. So that\u2019s how we look at it.","Vikram Malhotra","But just in terms of balance sheet, I mean, you could potentially take level down even further there are new asset classes you could think about. I\u2019m just wondering, or is it just it sound like the spread is this an all-time high or have you seen the spreads at other points as well?","John Case","Well, as we sit here today this is an all-time high. We\u2019ve reached the levels close to this, I\u2019ll saying since 2011 we\u2019ve been at spreads and we\u2019re substantially higher than our long term average investment spread over our nominal first year weighted average cost to capital. Over the history of a company that they averaged about 145 basis points over the last five years we\u2019ve been more or like 180 basis points to 255 basis points and today they are close to 300 basis points based on our share price. So, the spreads are substantial but we are going to remain disciplined.","We could acquire virtually everything we see given our constant capital advantage. But lot of what we see is property, not within our investment perimeter, they\u2019re not let me want to own. As far as the balance sheet goes we\u2019ve remained conservative, we only have we believed in a conservative balance sheet and it has enabled us to write out some difficult recessions over the last 20 years. Most recently the great recession where we were one of the few companies that continue to raise the dividend and that we have to reacquire. So, we are going to committed to maintaining a conservative balance sheet.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll here from Dan Donlan of Ladenburg Thalmann.","Daniel Donlan","Thank you and good afternoon. I actually have three questions I hope I can get through them very quick. The first question was on the overall recapture rate it was slightly under 92%, I think that\u2019s when it\u2019s comp lowered versus where it has been historically I mean it was kind of all driven by the asset that had a period of vacancy. I know, we are talking our very diminish amount of rent. But we are just of curious if you could kind of give us a little detail and what happened with those five assets is this kind of and if there is anything we can read into that?","John Case","Dan, it really comes down to three assets. The 92% releasing spread this quarter as you said it was minimum, was about 3 basis points and lost rent are driven by just these three assets. One was a key seasonable assets it was really leased as a ground leased a best in class QSR quick service restaurant, who then improve the building and ended up dramatically enhancing the real estate value. But we went from leasing land and a building to just leasing land."," So, we had a big you would have to [indiscernible] that will down now there. There were two other assets [indiscernible] concept that accounting for the remaining negative impact on releasing spread action on these three assets the 34 remaining assets would have had a rent recapture rate of 106%. And then of course year-to-date our rent recapture rate is 103%. So until that this is a really a non-issue and certainly not to be any some sort of trend. ","Daniel Donlan","Okay. And then just had a curiosity, looking at page #25, do you have any way to quality kind of what the recapture rate is or what the retention rate is or your subsequent explorations versus your initial explorations. Is one better than the other and I wanted to follow-up on that too as well.","Paul Meurer","Yeah, Dan, it\u2019s Paul I can speak to that a little bit. You may recall some years ago we split out initial explorations versus subsequent to indicate that the subsequent explorations do a lot better because that really is a tenant who\u2019s already made the choice at the end of an initial 15 or 20 year term to clearly stay in that state at that property with us. And as such, there is a slightly higher likelihood that five years later they\u2019re going to make the same decision in stay at that site. So, that was a reason we have broken this out initially.","We don\u2019t have any projections that we put on that other than to share with you that when you look into these years and you see that portion of subsequent explorations growing, that should give you some level of comfort relative to the fact that we think we\u2019re going to do quite well with those tenants and probably going to stay at the site have a rental bumps associated with that, et cetera. But that\u2019s why we broke it out a few years back.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tyler Grant of Green Street Advisors.","Tyler Grant","Hello guys. Just two questions from me today to start it off, if you could only invest in one property type which one would it be? So retail, office or industrial, and then on that same note why is 80% of revenue is the right allocation to retail for you guys?","John Case","Yeah, well we don\u2019t invest actively in office, in the office that we do has come through portfolio transactions and a couple of relationships we have with major retail tenants who\u2019ve asked us to look at on the leaseback on that headquarters. So we\u2019re not out there actively pursuing that. As far as the difference between retail and industrial if they fit on investment parameters, we don\u2019t have a bias and we\u2019re not trying to target 80% retail. It\u2019s more a function on the opportunities we see in the marketplace.","So we\u2019re seeing more retail opportunities within our investment parameters then we are industrial opportunities. But this past quarter industrial picked up a little bit, but given the market and the opportunities available, we\u2019re going to be a predominantly retail net-lease company and whether that number is 80%, 79%, 75% 82%. We can\u2019t tell you because that\u2019s going to be driven by the opportunities we see in the marketplace, beyond [ph] what we are looking for.","Tyler Grant","Okay, and then just moving onto the next question. You guys currently have about 2.5% of your revenues that come from AMC the Movie theater operator. Do you think that or how do you think that consolidation within the movie theater category could potentially impact your portfolio and the related cap rates on those assets.","John Case","Yeah, I think we\u2019ve been following this closely both their current live discussions as well as their earlier discussions over in Europe. we think consolidation by enlarge is a good thing, IMCE theaters have been performing very well for us, it\u2019s been a very good two years in the theater industry. And we\u2019re seeing good growth there, but we think the efficiencies the size the liquidity didn\u2019t come with this if properly structured and profitably financed certainly would be a positive.","Operator","Our next question will come from Nick Joseph of Citi.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. What percentage of tenants give you regular updates on their financial performance?","John Case","Our retail tenants, it's about 70%.","Nicholas Joseph","And those [ph] who are on annual basis?","John Case","Yeah, I mean in some are quarterly, some are semi-annually, some are annually.","Nicholas Joseph","Okay. And so how much of your tenant sales grown over the last year?","John Case","Our --from the tenant sales growth, I don't think I have got the aggregate number of what their sales growth has been. But our EBIT - our rent coverage ratio, our EBITDAR, not sales, but our EBITDAR ratio is as I mentioned in my remarks 2.7 times on an average. And then the median is 2.6 times, and that's [ph] pre-G&A.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Next we'll hear from Todd Stender of Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Paul, just to get into the balance sheet, you've got a bond maturing in September. Just want to get a sense of timing when you\u2019re going to meet that debt maturity. I guess, when can you pay that off, and is it fair to assume maybe a way to tuck in the line of credit balance at that time?","Paul Meurer","It matures in mid-September. And Todd, when we get there we'll look at the alternatives we have for refinancing it, whether it be any of the markets we finance in or temporarily putting that on the line. We just have to look at the markets at the time. So it's hard to answer that several months in advance.","Todd Stender","Okay. And then when I just look at some of the other coupons and size of the bonds coming due in the next couple of years, when you look at a large balance and a relatively high coupon like 2019. When can you economically make the numbers work to pull something like that forward, make a tender offer or try to retire that.","John Case","We\u2019ve looked a lot at this. And Paul, I think, is the right person to address that.","Paul Meurer","Yes. And you can imagine Todd, we look at that on a regular basis and kind of have models that we update frequently. That's pretty far out. So you can imagine these make whole provisions that are typically 25 basis point, sometimes 20 basis points built in to most of the bonds that are in the REIT market are there for a reason, they protect the bond investor relative to that yield, and they are pretty owners to overcome.","So when you talk about multiple years out it becomes a little bit more challenging in terms of when that will make sense. I think that it will be closer become a little easier, and that's something we do a lot of work on to look at things when they are within more or less 18 to 24 month timeframe and shorter. But out to [ph] 2019, it becomes very difficult.","Operator","Our next question comes from Collin Mings of Raymond James.","Collin Mings","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","John Case","Hey Collin.","Collin Mings","Just continuing with the balance sheet, just can you touch on how you\u2019re thinking about preferred equity as part of the capital structure. I think you have about $400 million that\u2019s callable in 2017?","John Case","Yes. We have $410 million callable in February of '17. Again, we look at the market and we will consider what the most appropriate refinancing it would be, what type of capital would be, whether it's more preferred debt, equity, something else. We\u2019ll look at all of opportunities. So we\u2019re certainly aware of that and aware that the pricing on that is well above where we could do preferred today.","Collin Mings","Right. Just as you sit here today, any bias one way or the other just as we think about modeling that. If you think it's safe to think that you would want to keep preferreds as part of the capital structure, although be it at a lower rate, or just given where your debt costs are, that would be maybe the either way you go.","John Case","No. I don\u2019t think we really have a bias today","Paul Meurer","No. I think it would be reasonable to model something that is a lower rate if you will, relatively to where that coupon on that preferred currently is. But what type of security is difficult to say. And the one thing, I would point out is relative to FFO projection to the extent that the preferred is called which we haven\u2019t decided that we\u2019re even going to do that, that would obviously impact FFO for next year as well.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take a follow up from Dan Donlan of Ladenburg Thalmann.","Daniel Donlan","Thank you for taking the follow up. Just going back to my question on the subsequent versus initial. I was looking back at your prior expirations and it looks like the subsequent were typically about half of what expired in a given year. And as I look out to 18, 19, 2021, 2022, the bulk of your initial expirations are initial expirations. And I realize that some of these subsequent expirations will re-lease that every five years, but it still looks like the lion's share is going to be close to initial. So the question is, do you think that impacts your recapture rate on a going forward basis, or how are you looking at that? I realize that it's three, four, five years down the line, but it's just","John Case","Sumit, you want to take that?","Sumit Roy","Yes. Sure, John. So we\u2019ve been talking about this for quite a few quarters now Dan, with every year that goes by our maturity schedules going to come down. And what we haven\u2019t seen is a distinct differential that we can point to as a trend that says on second generation re-leasing we get substantially better re-leasing spread positive re-leasing versus [ph] first generation re-leasing.","I think Paul sort of addressed some of it that, yes, what we\u2019ve seen is, if people have exercised an option they will tend to stay there. and most of these options have built in gains or renewal bumps in rent, which could range anywhere between 3% to 5%, and sometimes it\u2019s higher 10%. So it\u2019s a very difficult for us to tell you that hey, the second, third generation assets that are going to be coming due, what is going to be the trend on the renewals on that front.","So that\u2019s, that\u2019s - and it\u2019s a fact that with every year, our average renewal rates are going to come down, our re-leasing rates going to come down.","Daniel Donlan","Okay. And as far as the weighted average lease term does, it\u2019s at 9.8 years. I mean, is that something given the large numbers in the math, that\u2019s it\u2019s going to be hard to get that back above 10 again unless there's some serious M&A, or is that something you guys think about or is it just as long as you're getting good re-leasing spreads, you're fine with a shorter wall?","John Case","Well, we\u2019re certainly pleased with the re-leasing spreads. And it\u2019s just a math, we\u2019ve got a $20 billion plus portfolio of properties, where each year the lease term get shorter by a year, and you're requiring $1.25 billion in 15 years, 16 years. A mature net lease company like ourselves, will have an average lease term that was down unless there is something exceptional that occurs. So we thought about this. This has been happening for a long time now. And we had built out our portfolio management group, which is the largest group within the company, and they've executed more than 2,100 lease rollovers, and we're quite experienced at that.","So as the frequency will pick up in future years, we've got a great team in place, and we'll continue to grow that team with the proper talent. Many peers out there with longer lease terms don't even have that department. So here, I'd say one of our most important departments and certainly our largest department. So we've been focused on this for a while, but it's just, as we all say, it's simple math.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities.","Chris Lucas","Hi, good afternoon. Like I see guys, it\u2019s still in the morning. But Just 2 sort of general big picture questions. John, on the acquisitions front, have you seen any change to the competitive landscape that you guys are in as it relates to sources of capital for financing these kinds of transactions?","John Case","No, we really haven't. It's the same group of people that we always see. Some other public REITs every now and then, some non-listed REITs, you see the mortgage REITs. There are some private equity funds out there that invest in this sector. And then, there's the institutional capital, that\u2019s run by experienced net lease investment managers. That could be [ph] endowment of pension fund and even sovereign wealth fund money. And they kind of change the higher-quality, higher-rated opportunities. And that hasn't changed. There hasn't been a new group of entrants in terms of competition.","Chris Lucas","Okay, great. And then just listening to you talk about some of the capital market situations that you are facing, whether it's the bond or the preferreds, I guess, I'm just wondering, what's sort of your view on interest rates over the sort of next 6 to 12 months?","John Case","Wow. One thing I've learned is I'm not very good at predicting interest rates in the future. And I haven't really met many people who are. But as we look at our own business, we want to position it for any interest rate environment. So whether they tick up, whether they continue to stay down or whether they go back down a bit, we want to have a strong balance sheet and a business model that performs well in all of those situations. Personally, there is just so much thirst for yield globally. It's hard for me to see the 10 year moving significantly, even if the Fed does raise Fed funds later this year. I'm not so sure that the influence in the 10 year is not far greater based on what's happening globally and the fund flows that are coming into the U.S. treasury market.","Operator","Next, we'll have a follow-up from Tyler Grant of Green Street Advisors.","Tyler Grant","Hi again, guys. So earlier in the call, it was mentioned that you've never had a year of negative same-store revenue growth. However, if I look at your definition, I believe that it does not include assets that became vacant during the measurement period. So if I were to look at it historically, on average, if you did include assets that went vacant during the period, how much lower would the metric be?","Paul Meurer","Tyler, it's Paul. We've done our homework on this topic, because it has come up a few times from you. The answer on average will be about 20 basis points. So when there's a year, where we say 1.3%. If you calculated the way that you calculated relative to vacant properties, it would be about 1.1%. That's our average.","Tyler Grant","Okay. That makes sense. And then just to follow up on Dan Donlan's questions regarding just leasing stats. As your portfolio gets older and your lease terms start to shrink, I would imagine in any given year that it's naturally going to mean that you have more lease expires. Is this fair to assume that as your portfolio continues to mature as a result of the more lease expiries that your same-store growth is also going to slow as well?","John Case","No it all - Not necessarily. It all - I mean, it all depends on where we're able to draw those re-leasing opportunities and what's happening with market rents and where are the rents on the properties rolling relative to those market rents and our retention rate. So I wouldn\u2019t say it's safe to assume that, that's going to decrease.","Operator","And we'll take a follow-up from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley.","Landon Park","This is Landon on for Vikram. Just had a question about the deals that you have sourced so far this year. Can you give us a split between Self-sourced and ones that you've sourced through marketed deals?","John Case","Yes. I mean, we're - that's not something that we typically track. I'd say we're getting to sort of the relationship side of the business of what we close. We typically close 80% transactions based on direct relationships we have that we do. That's sort of our long-term average. So I don't know if that answers your question.","Landon Park","Has there been a shift one way or the other in that trend? Or it's been very consistent?","John Case","It's been pretty consistent. If anything, it's grown a little bit more towards relationship-oriented transactions and sale-leaseback opportunities.","Operator","And this concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I would now like to turn the conference back over to John Case for any additional and closing comments.","John Case","Thanks, April, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. I'm sure we'll be speaking with you in the near-term future, and enjoy the rest of your summer.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"17987":["Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) Q4 2011 Earnings Conference Call February  9, 2012  4:30 PM ET","","Executives","Tom Lewis \u2013 Vice Chairman and CEO","Paul Meurer \u2013 CFO, EVP and Treasurer","John Case \u2013 EVP and Chief Investment Officer","Analysts","Lindsay Schroll \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JP Morgan","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Market","Presentation","","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today February 9, 2012. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host for today Mr. Tom Lewis, CEO or Realty. Please go ahead.","Tom Lewis","Thank you, Joe. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our conference call. We will go throw the operations and results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. In the room with me as usually is Gary Malino, our President Chief Operating Officer, Paul Meurer, our EVP and CFO, John Case, our EVP and Chief Investment Office and Mike Pfeiffer, our EVP and General Counsel and Terry Miller, our Vice President Corporate Communications.","And as always during this call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. Company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in the forward-looking statements and we will disclose in greater detail in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q, the factors that could cause those differences.","And we will start as we always do with the numbers Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks, Tom. So as usual, I will provide some brief comments on our financial statements and provide some highlights of the financial results for both the quarter and the year starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 23.6% for the quarter and 22.6% for the year. Our revenue for the quarter was $114 million or approximately $456 million on an annualized basis. This obviously reflects the significant amount of new acquisitions over the past year and positive same store rent in our portfolio increases per year of 1.3%.","On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by about $9.5 million in the comparative quarterly period as depreciation expense increased obviously as our property portfolio continue to grow. Interest expense increased by just under $3.9 million and this increase was due primarily to the June issuance of $150 million of notes in the reopening of our 2035 bond, as well as the $237 million of credit facility borrowings, which we had at year end. On a related note, our coverage ratios do remain strong with interest coverage at 3.5 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.9 times.","General and administrative or G&A expenses in the fourth quarter were $7.95 million or 7% of total revenues. Our G&A expense has increased as our acquisition activity has increased. And we invested in some new personnel for future growth. G&A was also impacted by the expensing of acquisition to diligent cost $357,000 during the quarter and a total of $1.5 million in expense during the year.","Our current projection for G&A for 2012 is approximately $33 million, which will continue to present only 7% of total revenue. Property expenses were $2.3 million for the quarter and $7.4 million for the year. These in course of the expenses primarily associated with the tax of maintenance and insurance one properties where we are responsible for those expenses and properties available for lease. Our current estimate for 2012 is similar at about $7.5 million. Income tax consistent income tax paid to various dates by the company there were $367,000 during the quarter.","Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $1 million and this income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We did sell five properties resulted in a gain on sales of $1.2 million during the quarter and a reminder that we do not include these property sales gains in our AFFO or in our FFO.","Preferred stock cash dividend remained at $6.1 million for the quarter and net income available to common stock holders increased to approximately $34.9 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO per share increased 8.5% to $0.51 for the quarter and 8.2% to $1.98 for a year. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO are also bad but the extra cash we had available for distribution and dividend was higher, higher than FFO and it increased 8.3% to $0.52 for the quarter and 8.1% to $2.01 per share for the year.","Our AFFO will continue to be higher than our FFO and its differential between our AFFO and FFO will continue to increase. Our capital expenditures are fairly low, we have minimum straight line rent in our portfolio and we believe we will continue to have some FAS141 non-cash reductions to FFO due to in place leases that we acquire in large portfolio transactions that we do. In addition, in 2012 we will have a $3.7 million non-cash charge to FFO for the redemption of our preferred D stock representing approximately $0.027 per share in FFO.","Our 2012 AFFO earnings projection is $2.07 and $2.12 per share or an increase of 3% to 5.5% over our 2011 AFFO per share of $2.01. We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter we have increased dividend 57 consecutive quarters and 64 times overall since we went public over 17 years ago. And of course as we announced this week we have not declared 500 consecutive monthly dividends over the past 42 years. Our dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 85% of our funds from operations and about 84% of our AFFO.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet we have continued to maintain a conservative and very safe capital structure. This week we closed on our recent preferred stock offering, which raised over $373 million in gross proceeds at a coupon rate of 6 5\/8%. We were very pleased with the strong investor demand in the offering and we very much appreciate the underwriters who supported us and did a terrific job on this offering.","User proceeds will be to repay our outstanding 7 3\/8% class D preferred stock, which will save us $1 million cash expense annually and also to pay off all of our acquisition credit facility borrowing. Our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to support our acquisition growth. Our current debt to total market capitalization now is only 25% and our preferred stock outstanding still represents only 8% of our capital structure.","Our $425 million credit facility did have $237 million of borrowings at year end. But as I mentioned we used the preferred proceeds this week to pay off all of those borrowings on the facility. We had no debt maturities until 2013.","So in summary, we currently have excellent liquidity and our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and stable.","Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom who will give you a little bit more background on these results.","Tom Lewis","Great, I will start with the portfolio. During the fourth quarter the portfolio continue to generate very consistent cash flow. At the end of the quarter our largest 15 tenants accounted for about 49.8% of our revenue that\u2019s down 480 basis points from the same period a year ago and 220 basis points from the third quarter. So our acquisition efforts continue to help us reduce our concentrations in the portfolio getting that down to 49.8.","The average cash flow coverage at the store level for those top 15 tenants, which we mentioned each time was right at 242 times so very healthy. We ended the fourth quarter with 96.7% occupancy and 87 properties available for lease out of the 2634 in the portfolio that is down about 100 basis points from the third quarter and up about 10 basis points for the same period a year ago.","During the quarter, we had 43 new vacancies 25 of those came from expirations at the end of the lease and that is a little higher number than usual but occasionally with the expirations it gets a little bit lumpy and that was the case in the quarter. We also had 18, which were defaults primarily related to Friendly\u2019s we also leased or sold 15 properties during the quarter and also added properties portfolio, which is how you get to the 96.7% number. If we look forward into the first quarter I think it was about phase filing and as we begin leasing the properties up that they are on the vacancy list we could see another 20 or 30 basis points decline in occupancy down to around 96.5 or 96.4% is the best estimate right now. And then we would anticipate that we would see occupancy increasing from there over the next few quarters as we really generate more leasing activity on these.","Let me take a moment and kind of walk through how we calculate occupancy and then give you some color on it. For the last 18 years or so we calculated occupancy by taking the number of vacant properties we had, which was 87 and dividing that by the number of buildings that we have in the portfolio, which was 2634 and that\u2019s pretty simple methodology that gives us 3.3% vacancy and 96.7% occupancy.","For a number of years now internally we would run occupancy a couple of other ways. Just eyeballed the numbers, other ways to take it just on a square footage basis instead of property, where we take the vacant square footage and divide it by the total square footage in the portfolio. Another way to do it is on a dollar basis, which was to take what was the previous ramp on any properties that are vacant and divide that by the sum of that number and the ramps on all of the occupied properties and that gives us to you on a dollar basis and we\u2019ve run all three methods for quite a while and generally they would be around the same numbers as historically our building sizes and kind of rents for property overall were pretty consistent. However, in the last few years as we bought some larger properties that is skewed the numbers and we also have about 4.5% of the portfolio now in agricultural land that have no buildings on it, yet are under long-term leases. And so we are getting some variance in the three different methods of it.","Somebody recently asked me when I said occupancy they said it\u2019s physical or economic and well I don\u2019t wasn\u2019t quite sure what their version of economic occupancy was, we thought we would go ahead and provide all three numbers. Then again the traditional way is 87 properties vacant 2634 total and that\u2019s a 3.3 vacancy rate and a 96.7% occupancy rate. If you do buy square footage the total vacant square footage is 746,000 square feet you divide that by the 27,369,000 square feet in the portfolio that gives us a 2.7% vacancy and 97.3% occupancy rate.","And then the last way if you take the former contractual rent in the fourth quarter for the vacant property it was about 2.48 million and if you combine that and the rent on the occupied property of $113 you will get $115.78 million and then if you divided that back into the $2.48 million that will give you a vacancy of 2.1% at an occupancy of 97 9 on a dollar basis. So you can pick your own number, we will for historical continuity continue to report it on the fiscal occupancy number, but make those other numbers available and I will figure out how to get them into our reporting and then mention him on the calls if anybody wants to know what they are. Obviously all three are fairly close and represent fairly high occupancy.","Same store rents on the portfolio increased 1.1% during the fourth quarter, which was in the kind of average range in our mind for the year since rents increased 3.3% taken a look at where those came from during the year, we had three of the industries declining same store rents in the portfolio book stores was one automotive services and quick service restaurant, which was fast food but it was relatively modest decline of only about 492,000 so fairly small.","Two industries have flat same store rents that was drug stores and transportation services, which was fairly new to the portfolio. And then 24 industries saw some same store rent increases the majority of that kind of going from highest to lowest was increases was movie theaters, motor vehicle dealerships, casual dining restaurants, convenient stores, sporting goods, automotive tire and health and fitness. In the balance we are fairly small increase in those numbers casual dining restaurants and motor vehicle dealerships making surprising relative to a contribution for the same store rent increases. But I would note we gave a few temporary rent reductions to a few of those tenants in those industries during the recession those expired and that\u2019 what caused the increases in those industries and it\u2019s not a trend we would think it\u2019s going to continue. And again the balance of the increase is fairly small increase.","The 24 increase industries together had a total increase of about $4.7 million and that gets to a net gain of $4.25 million in same store rent. Diversification in the portfolio continues to widen we are in 38 industries that\u2019s up 6 from a year ago. Concentrations in the industries continue to climb convenient stores is our largest at 17.2% that\u2019s down 110 basis points from last quarter and we think we will continue to bring that one down. Restaurants if you combine both casual dining and the quick service are little less than last quarter now at 16.4% that\u2019s down 90 basis points from last quarter casual dining is now under 10% at 9\/8 it\u2019s down about 110 basis points from the last quarter.","Quick service, fast food was up about 20 basis points to 6.6%. The next one is Peters, which rose 9.8% as we made some acquisitions this year. Also, health and fitness was up 80 basis points to about 6.9%, both areas we continue to like and will likely add to. The only other category that\u2019s over 5% now is beverages at 5.3%. So I think we are in very good shape relative to industry concentrations. We\u2019ll keep them reasonable and try and continue to lower them.","On a tenant basis, the largest individual tenant at 5.3% of rent is AM Peters, that\u2019s down 10 BPs, Diageo is 5% and then everything else in the portfolio is under 5% and again when you put the 15 largest together they are just under 50%, 49.8% and then when you get back into the 15% it\u2019s about 2.2% of rent and if you even went further to 20% it gets down to about 1.5% of rent and then goes down pretty quickly after that, so fairly well-diversified from a tenant standpoint.","Geographically, we also remain well-diversified. The average lease term remaining is 11.3 years, that\u2019s up a little bit over the quarter with recent acquisitions.","We announced a couple of weeks ago that Friendly\u2019s is back out and operating, having completed their reorganization fairly quickly and also announced Buffets is in the process and we work with their management, who we know well, very quickly to structure an agreement with them. As we said in our press release a couple of weeks ago, it is subject to court\u2019s approval and the reorganization process which is underway.","Like in the Friendly\u2019s situation with Buffets, Mike Pfeiffer, our General Counsel co-chairs the creditor\u2019s committee and we\u2019re hopeful that a process can be completed expeditiously, which I think could benefit all parties involved and we can move through that one fairly quickly.","Relative to a theme with those two, I think it continues to be a difficult environment for retailers that sell discretionary goods to generally lower income consumers. I think tenants, like these two in the casual dining area will generally fit into that category in our mind. And as we\u2019ve mentioned we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a little more softness with another tenant in that area and as the year goes on. Fortunately, our exposure to that area is modest and continues to climb, although we would prefer if more of that decline was generated from asset sales and investments in other areas as a way that it declines. The majority of the portfolio continues to do quite well and occupancy as I\u2019ve mentioned is very high.","We\u2019ll move on to acquisitions now. It\u2019s obviously a very strong year in that area and I\u2019ll let John Case, our Chief Investment Officer to comment on activities there.","John Case","All right, Tom. We remain quite active on the acquisitions front in the fourth quarter. We acquired 39 properties for approximately $190 million. The average in this release yield on these investments was 7.5%. The average least term is just under 20 years. Properties are diversified by geography, tenant, industry and property type. They are located in seven states, 100% leased to four tenants in four different industries and represent three property types with our traditional retail investments accounting for 86% of our funds invested during the fourth quarter. 80% of the acquisitions are leased to new tenants, which further diversifies our portfolio.","In the fourth quarter we closed to file $19 million of the $544 million diversified net lease portfolio or ECM transaction we announced in the first quarter of 2011.","Our fourth quarter activity brought us to $1 billion\u2026","Tom Lewis","Is that a billion?","John Case","That\u2019s a billion, Tom.","Tom Lewis","With B?","John Case","With a B, $1 billion in property investments for 2011, the most we\u2019ve ever completed in a single year in dollar terms. The billion for the year was comprised of 164 properties having initial average initial yield of 7.8% and an average lease term of 13.4 years. The properties are leased to 22 separate tenants and 17 different industries. We continue to be pleased with our level of acquisition activity, which really helped us drive our FFO growth in 2011.","Most of you have heard Tom describe our acquisition activities lumpy before. Well, it continues to be that way. $852 million of our 2011 acquisitions came from three large portfolio transactions. The remaining $148 million of acquisitions came from single property and smaller portfolio opportunities. We generally this from quarter to quarter by just being in the marketplace and this should lead to about $100 million to $150 million of acquisitions annually. So our success on the three large portfolio has really drove our volume in 2011.","On this yearend call, we usually give you an overview of the previous year\u2019s acquisition transaction flow and provide some additional perspective. I\u2019m going to go slowly here because there are a lot of numbers I want to share with you.","In 2011, we sourced $13 billion in total acquisitions opportunities. This is everything that comes in the door, not all of it makes sense for us. So of the $13 billion sourced, our acquisitions team analyzed about $8 billion in opportunities in 2011, an increase of about 70% versus 2010. Of this amount, just under $3 billion was taken through our investment committee. The $3 billion represented 1,300 properties with 45 different tenants. Over the last 10 years our investment committee has averaged working on about $3 billion in opportunities per year, ranging from a low of $1 billion to a high of $5 billion. So 2011 was right in line with our long-term average.","The $1 billion we acquired represented 33% of what our investment committee worked on and of course was a record year for acquisitions. Over the last 10 years, on average, we have acquired 15% of what our investment committee worked on. This year\u2019s 33% figure reflects our success in closing those three large portfolio transactions.","Our initial yields or cap rates have averaged 8.9% during the last 10 years, with a high of 10.4% and a low this year of 7.8%. Cap rates declined over this period as interest rates have declined and as net lease properties have become more main stream and more investors have entered the market. We have historically tracked our cap rates relative to 10-year treasury yields. Since we went public in 1994 our cap rates have averaged about 475 basis points over the corresponding 10-year treasury yields. The 2011 average 10-year treasury yield was 2.8%, so our initial yield of 7.8% was 5% over the average 10-year this past year, a bit better than our long-term average. Obviously, now with the 10-year treasury yield at 2% our cap rates are closer to 5.75% over the 10-year.","Another factor impacting our cap rates is our move up the tenant credit curve the last two years. In 2011 41% of our acquisitions are with investment grade tenants. Our completion of these high credit tenant acquisitions reduced our overall initial yields by about 30 basis points to 40 basis points in 2011. However, our investment spreads remain very attractive to our long-term average and we improved our tenant credit profile. Over the last 17 years our acquisition cap rate spread over our nominal cost of equity has averaged about 110 basis points. We calculate our nominal cost of equity by taking our forward FFO yield and grossing it up for issuance costs. Last year that spread was approximately 170 basis points.","As we have moved into 2012 our acquisitions transaction flow has continued to be quite active consistent with the volume of opportunities we were seeing in 2011. Sellers were motivated by the significant liquidity in the net lease market. Continued private equity and M&A activity are also leading to sale lease back opportunities. The flow is fairly evenly divided between investment grade and non-investment grade opportunities and the majority of it is in our traditional retail properties but we are seeing possibilities in all of our property types. There continues to be significant competition for property portfolios but we should continue to be competitive in the marketplace.","Cap rates are turning down slightly from where they were in the second half of 2011 as interest rates have declined a bit. Cap rates generally range from the low 7% area to the high 7% area for investment grade tenants and from the high 7% area to the high 8% area for non-investment grade tenants. We currently anticipate our initial yields on acquisitions for 2012 to average around 7.75%.","Tom?","Tom Lewis","John\u2019s promise still average 7.75%.","John Case","Yeah.","Tom Lewis","Thanks. Obviously we\u2019re pleased with the results for 2011 in acquisitions and I think is much from by the pace of transactions just coming in the door right now that will drive what we are able to do this year and we think that will continue to play a role in obviously growing the revenue and AFFO, which is what drives dividend increases.","I think secondly and equally important for us is it will also help us in adjusting the makeup of our portfolio where we\u2019re trying to do a couple of things, which is move up the credit curve with the tenant base and then also into areas both inside and outside of retail that we think want to make up a larger piece of the portfolio and going forward.","If you look at the last 24 months or so, we bought about $1.7 billion of property, $1 billion of it was in retail and I think much in the sector is that we think will do well if we continue with a tougher retail environment where lower income consumers continue to struggle. $720 million of the properties we bought are into areas outside of retail that we think will do well for us and of the $1.7 billion total about $770 million was done with investment grade tenants and a good measure of the rest of the acquisitions are also up the credit curve close to investment grade and we\u2019re pleased with that.","The other thing about it is how we\u2019ve funded the acquisitions. Living in a very low interest rate environment that\u2019s largely generated by monetary policy at the federal level, I think it\u2019s easy to get lulled in to the assumption that rates will stay low, which they might. However, we want to be mindful of where they could go in the future particularly if they were to go up substantially and I think that is true not only for our tenants as they would refinance their balance sheet down the road but I think also for our own balance sheet.","And one of the things we want to make sure we do is we are fairly active here in acquiring is we don\u2019t materially add to our levels or to our near-term maturities. So if you look at the permanent financing that we\u2019ve done or our funding of these acquisitions over the last 24 months or so, we did four equity offerings that generated gross proceeds of just over $1 billion. We did $150 of debts that had a maturity of 20, 35 and then last week we did the perpetual preferred offering, which is \u2013 was $373 million. And that is about $1.5 billion in capital and with either no maturity or a small piece of maturity there the far end of the future. And as we think about capital we\u2019ll continue to keep in mind that the cost to capital could be materially higher in the future and the cost of refinancing that could be an issue. So we\u2019ll try and take care of that in terms of how we are funding the acquisitions.","Relative to the balance sheet and access to capital, we\u2019re in very good shape. As Paul mentioned there\u2019s plenty of drive powder to continue to acquire. On earning and guidance, obviously the acquisitions, occupancy and same-store rent increases the portfolio had in 2011, really drove the revenue, FFO and AFFO and that will benefit us with the acquisitions here in 2012.","In the release a couple of weeks ago, we adjusted our guidance for the preferred issuance to 201 to 205 on FFO and that included that non-cash charge that Paul talked about and then AFFO 207 to 212 and that\u2019s 3% to 5.5% AFFO growth and that number will be our primary focus as Paul mentioned into the best we have for recurring cash flow right now.","Kind of finally before we take questions, I\u2019d be remiss if like Paul, I didn\u2019t mention the press release yesterday announcing the 500th consecutive monthly dividend. That\u2019s over 41 years of monthly dividends, it\u2019s a long time. I think the company was about at 108th consecutive dividends when I came in to do due diligence in the company and met the founders Bill and John Clark. It\u2019s probably over 200 when I came to work here 25 years ago and I called the Clarks who are actively retired to talk to them about getting to 500 and I liked their comment which is very typical for them which was \u201cThat\u2019s great and I hope you guys are focused on the next 500,\u201d which we are. Anyway a nice milestone for the company that they founded a long time ago.","Operator, we will now open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) And we have a question from the line of Lindsay Schroll from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lindsay Schroll \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Good afternoon. Can you guys please discuss the health of the casual dining (inaudible) overall and whether the filings by Friendly\u2019s and Buffets are more retailer specific issues or indicative of broader industry trends?","Tom Lewis","Yeah. It\u2019s a good question, happy to do that. We\u2019re not overly positive on the industry to say the least. I think a theme in almost everything we\u2019ve looked at today is whether it\u2019s in casual dining or somewhere else is to try and look at the consumer at that individual retailer or here restaurant is targeting because if you look at kind of the upper income consumer, they are spending both discretionary and non-discretionary. The middle market consumer which seems to be a little smaller group today is spending on non-discretionary but is really looking for value when they\u2019re our doing discretionary spending and that includes casual dining. And then when you get to the lower end consumer, not only are they extraordinarily value-conscious on discretionary or non-discretionary they are almost aren\u2019t spending on discretionary. So pick your casual dining and pick who their customer is but I think for a lot of people most of those changed or appealing to the middle and lower market and it\u2019s a tough operating environment and we think it will continue to be so.","The other thing that\u2019s going in there over the last couple of year is also minimum wage has gone from I think $5.85 an hour up to over $7 in the quarter, so they\u2019ve seen some labor pressures and then at the same time had some commodity costs move. But we have the industry rather \u2013 relative to further investment kind of we\u2019re not going to do it and then we\u2019d like to continue to reduce it as part of the portfolio because it\u2019s an area that even though for short periods it can snap back. We are not overly positive with it. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t note there were chains doing very well in that industry and there are but casual dining for us as we watch is an industry that we\u2019re not going to be doing additional acquisitions in.","Lindsay Schroll \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I think you\u2019ve talked about wanting to dispose of your office assets and I\u2019m just wondering what demand is those versus retail, if the cap rates are similar, the buyer is the same. If you can just talk about that?","Tom Lewis","Yeah. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking to dispose of it. We don\u2019t have much in that area and they\u2019re with very high quality tenants. I think it\u2019s more of comments that that\u2019s not something we\u2019re looking to aggressively add to the portfolio. In the ECM transaction we had a couple of few office buildings that came with that but it\u2019s still a relative small part of the portfolio, it\u2019s only about 2.6% of rent. So I wouldn\u2019t see it increasing but currently we don\u2019t have plans to sell the assets.","Lindsay Schroll \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, good afternoon. I certainly hope there\u2019s not going to be a quiz on all those numbers that you guys threw out.","Tom Lewis","Sorry about that.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","That\u2019s okay. Just a couple of quick questions, when you guys were talking about the eventual rents from releasing the Buffets and the Friendly\u2019s deal what\u2019s the time horizon that you\u2019re using for releasing those assets?","Tom Lewis","It varies a little. In the Friendly\u2019s, I believe we assumed in our -- that we didn\u2019t lease anything until late in the year or early in the next year. We think we\u2019ll do better with the Buffets. We had a little more aggressive move on it because we\u2019ve had a little better luck as we\u2019ve gone through this recently.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Has any of them actually been released so far?","Paul Meurer","There are LOIs in place in a handful and so I think of that estimate is kind of 6 to 18 months and what that means is you\u2019ll have some outliers that happen sooner and you\u2019ll have some outliers that happen later than that.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And regarding casual dining, obviously we\u2019ve talked a lot about that. Can you talk about these sponsors of the casual diners especially the ones that you have exposure to and what their wiliness to restructure or to keep those entities going rather that bankrupt them right now? What those owner posture tends to be of today?","Tom Lewis","They tend not to be 7s, they tend to be 11s. Certainly that was the case in Friendly\u2019s and that\u2019s the case in Buffets. And when you think to sponsor you kind of wanted \u2013 there\u2019s a couple of things obviously, these are levered entities and one of the strategies in the toolbox of these people has been to \u2013 if the chain starts to struggle in the debt trades to a discount, go into the market, buy the debt and they become both the debt and equity owner and that gives us some optionality to go through an 11, continue it on the chains and do some work on the contracts, other contracts of it. But I think as long as they can see in the properties profitability and the chain overall they\u2019re obviously going to look for an 11 and that will either be through the debtor is becoming the owner or in the case as I mentioned were both \u2013 both have the same. But if you look Friendly\u2019s and Buffets both the rents are pretty low, which gives them the opportunity to do that and the what we\u2019ve tried to do in all of these of course is get some optionality for if the business recovers that we can get a piece of that. But in most cases, they do want to operate but it\u2019s a chain by chain basis.","There has been a fair amount of bankruptcy in that industry over the last four or five years, 34 or 35 of them and the vast majority have been 11.","Joshua Barber \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar","Hi good afternoon guys.","Tom Lewis","Hey, Todd.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar","Just a quick question on the acquisitions. Do you guys have a preference right now for doing deals with the credit tenants in 7s versus the non-credit tenants in the 8s or still happy to do either category?","Tom Lewis","We are happy to do either and it really is investment grade and we would like to take it up the credit curve when we can find them. It\u2019s a competitive world today, but like to do that. And then, when they are not investment grade, we\u2019d rather be moving kind of up the cusp with it. And when you get to non-investment grade, it again is kind of a tenant with a low income consumer and discretionary we really don\u2019t want to be investing there even though yields can be very attractive and we are willing to do both today.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. And then, just the acquisition assumption that\u2019s currently embedded in your guidance?","Tom Lewis","I think right now about $0.5 billion is what I have got in there.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. And in thinking about same store rent growth, is 1% to 2% still a good long-term assumption for that?","Tom Lewis","Yeah, I would think I would hang around the 1% level or closer to that through the first half of the year as we deal with some of these properties and that was a case a few years ago. And then, I think it probably \u2013 long-term probably 1% to 1.5% is to consider average, when we get above 1.5% that\u2019s high just given the way lease structures work.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. And you mentioned that I guess a couple of other categories that contributed to the increase in the last quarter, the motor vehicles and the casual dining that was from the expiration of rent reductions. And this quarter, I guess is that something that lasts than for 12 months in the same store numbers, but that this time next year that impact would drop off?","Tom Lewis","Yes, I think that\u2019s the case and then I would also think we will get some boost from leasing.","Todd Lukasik \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Tom Lewis","Okay, you bet.","Operator","Thank you. And you next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi guys, thanks. Tom, you were indicating a vacancy that\u2019s higher than expected in the fourth quarter. Other than the friendly stuff, who was the tenant on the bulk of those?","Tom Lewis","I would have to go look. It was an automotive, it was service, but what it was is, we have vacant properties and then we have a list and there is generally 20 to 30 properties on it that are closed properties, but they are still under a long-term lease and the tenant is healthy.","And what happened at the end of the third quarter, there was a bunch of properties that a tenant has closed about two years that was still under lease and still paying. And those all came off at once and so, we've gone back and we've looked at that list, which O exists at this very little of that this year, very little next year, but it was one little lump and I forgot, but it is an automotive service tenant I believe that was a bunch of them and then there were just a couple of others.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Will they likely be teed up for sale?","Tom Lewis","We will tee them up for re-lease or sale both.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And just along those same lines, could you be \u2013 say any disposition volumes increase maybe ahead of schedule, maybe where you thought you would be this time last year, just to get out in front of some of these credit issues?","Tom Lewis","That\u2019s exactly what our plan is in terms of property sales. We have typically sold $25 million, $30 million of properties a year, but that\u2019s mostly just working through lease roll over and occasionally tenant issue and that\u2019s just been kind of the average, but we really do want to accelerate that kind of bid and if it\u2019s okay, I will spend a second on it.","Over the last year, we want back and undertook a very lengthy project that took about 7 to 8 months where we re-underwrote basically the majority of the portfolio. I think we picked the largest 67 tenants and they combined at about 83% of our rents. And we went through a rating of each industry, we then went through our exposures relative to how many of their units we own, how many units we own, percent of rent and then, went back to their credit ratings around their balance sheets, debt maturity schedule, usage of line of credit cash, debt after cash liquidity revenue.","And then, went after their trends and looked at the margin trends and revenue trends and fixed charge coverages. And then literally remodeled each one of them once again and started running some stress tests where we move their revenues and margins and then kind of refinance their whole balance sheet over the next 5 to 7 years. And we added on 300 basis points, a higher financing cost of 600 basis points and then did some mixing of that to get a perfect storm.","And we took all of that and that kind of guided us along with some themes we had, their interest rates too, how is retail going to be different that the low end consumer may have trouble coming back, the non-discretionary is going to be difficult. And in doing that then really we kind of laid out our top to bottom in the portfolio.","At the same time, we did the same with properties and when we got through, we merged that and basically came up with a group of the portfolio that over time that we would like to move out of and in combinations with acquisitions and sales, kind of re-orient the portfolio.","And initially, we targeted a little over a 100 properties about $110 million or so we bought those out, about $100 million of carrying value. And we have started a process to market them and we have done some staffing, done some systems and we have just literally launched that over the last month or so. So, for this year, if we can move that up to $50 million from the normal $25 million to $35 million that would be just great.","My sense is to do the whole $110 million will be moving in through this year and early in the next year, but the plan right after that will then be to take the next on the list and we would like to over the next three, four, five years be fairly active in recycling capital and moving into some new areas that we\u2019d rather have in the portfolio.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful, thanks Tom. And just lastly, it looks like, did you have one agricultural property? Did I see that right?","Tom Lewis","We did. We had one additional property, Diageo, it\u2019s in the Napa Valley. It\u2019s kind of wedged in between the other vineyards that we owned and it is one that we had looked at doing a ways back, but there were a couple of complications operationally for them on it, but we were able to do that. So, it\u2019s a little addition to the Diageo portfolio.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Any pricing on that, any indication what the cap rate was?","Tom Lewis","It\u2019s relatively similar to what we did two years ago.","Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks, good afternoon. Just following up on that Tom and thanks for laying out your thoughts on dispositions. Can you give us any sense of what that magnitude might look like against the $500 million of acquisitions you are thinking about for 2012?","Tom Lewis","Yeah. There is about \u2013 well acquisitions for 2012. Again, our best guess this year is we would like to do 50 and that probably adds in 25 to 30 of this new grouping of investment properties we\u2019d like to sell. So that\u2019s the number there, but there is $110 million probably over the next 18 to 24 months.","And then behind that as we went through and did the whole portfolio it wasn\u2019t we need to sell these now, but these are areas we want to move out of. It is about 20% of the portfolio where you looked at, instead over the next four or five years that\u2019s what we would want to recycle.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","When you say 20% of the portfolio, is that 20% of value or 20% of the buildings?","Tom Lewis","Revenue.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Revenue?","Tom Lewis","Yeah.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","So, I mean, does that suggest there\u2019s a lot, like a much bigger ramp in sales beyond 2012 and 2015 with that?","Tom Lewis","No, if you think of about 20% that\u2019s 400 or 500 properties, so I think over three to five years that\u2019s about 80 properties a year or something.","Paul Meurer","And to some extent more art than science Tony. So, for example if we \u2013 buy $1 billion worth of real estate again this year, then maybe we can do more than $50 million in sales this year, who knows. So, we will kind of manage that from an earnings run rate perspective as well.","Tom Lewis","Yeah, it\u2019s a balancing act with acquisitions and all the other things going on in the portfolio and still hitting good numbers and raising the dividend, but we think we can move a good part of the portfolio over the next two years.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then, you talked a bit about same store revenue. I was wondering if you would give a sense of same store NOI maybe net of things like the $7.5 million of property expenses that you bear. The effect of the phase and in Friendly\u2019s this year, just some the vacancy ticked up in the fourth quarter from some of those leases that burned off and just how that roles into a same store NOI number for 2012?","Paul Meurer","Okay, let me.","Tom Lewis","Let us work on that.","Paul Meurer","And the one thing we do, I think we do a pretty good job of giving you the specifics of how we approach same store calculation in the 10-Qs and 10-Ks, but we will have that laid out to give you exactly what we have put in it versus what\u2019s not it, because everyone does it a little bit differently.","I think what you are generally going to find and that\u2019s why Tom tried to give you some guidance on where we get some bumps in which industries and which ones were down is that obviously, the ones that we got bumps in, it was probably a number of slightly healthier than 1% to 1.5%. But the ones, the vacancy is what really drives it down to that kind of overall run rate. So, when you are modeling for the overall portfolio that\u2019s why we are guiding you to that 1% to 1.5% area.","Tom Lewis","Yeah, and I don\u2019t have that number off the top of my head Tony, but if you want to e-mail what the piece of puzzle is, let us take a look at it.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Sure, and I guess, what struck me and where I was coming from was even between the 1% to 2% ban being towards the lower end of that, it still seemed like not a whole lot of impact given what's happened with Buffet\u2019s and Friendly\u2019s and stuff. Is that like all those things?","Tom Lewis","Yeah, that\u2019s very fair, it definitely impacts. When we talk about an 80% recovery rate that is when we get those leased up, so if you have a event happen for the 12 months after that the impact is certainly greater than the 20% that you don't recover, because that's during the period where they are vacant and aside from not gaining rent, there is also the triple net expenses and so, in a year like this and it really bans the year between Friendly\u2019s and Buffet\u2019s. That does have a pretty good impact, it may exceed the same-store rent for a period of time until you get those leased.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","But even with the impact on a top line of Friendly\u2019s and Buffet\u2019s, you still think you will come in that low 1s?","Tom Lewis","I am only hesitating, because I'm trying to make sure I understand what the numbers are.","Paul Meurer","Obviously, you understand why 2011 wasn\u2019t as affected because Friendly\u2019s occurred late in the year and Buffet\u2019s have not occurred yet.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Right.","Paul Meurer","Fair enough. Your question is on the projection for 2012 and I think what we are seeing is, we were expecting same-store rent to be more like 1.5% plus next year, reasonably healthy from an overall historical perspective for us. And the Buffet\u2019s and Friendly\u2019s vacancy is what's dragging that down closer to a 1% number, certainly for the first nine months of the year or so.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Yeah, no I just wanted to make sure that was in that low 1s, because I would have actually guessed it to have had a greater negative impact in that. Great, and then, just the last thing, just curious as you thought about your strategy in the push towards a little bit more higher credit quality, a desire to go up the credit quality spectrum.","Like how do you think about going higher credit quality versus perhaps maybe any other options like staying where you are on the credit spectrum and focusing more on certain MSAs or just a different product category or something like that?","Paul Meurer","Yeah, that's a very good question. I think rather than what we are doing talking about why we are doing, it's really important. And starting about four or five years ago as we were doing strategic planning, one of the things we did is, let\u2019s look back at the last 20 years and say, it obviously went really well.","And then say, okay, why did it go really well and to try and differentiate between being in the right place at the right time and then secondarily, what we did and there are kind of three themes in there that are driving it. One is looking at retail, in our business if you look at the last 20 years, you had great domestic economic growth, personal income growth, the baby boomers were peak earnings and spending years, the next one is very important, the consumer levered up.","Retail spending growth rates were really high, retailers added a lot of new stores and it was the right place to be at the right time and we were. And then we said, okay, let's look forward, there is a bid of the new normal the term goes around, debt to GDP is approaching 90%, which takes something out of GDP growth and personal income growth, the baby boomers are ageing, you got the baby bus behind them. And the consumers unlikely to lever up at the same rate, because they can't and may even de-lever a bit.","And so, maybe retail isn\u2019t as \u2013 the growth rate isn\u2019t as high as it was in the past. And then, you throw in kind of the impact of Internet on retailing and you say, it\u2019s the difference between running downhill and the difference between running on flat ground or flat land and the first step was to say, okay, industry and tenant selection will be more important in the future than in the past, because it\u2019s just not as a environment.","And then, really going to one step further and saying, let\u2019s take a look at the consumer. The low-end consumer did pretty well over the last 15 to 20 years with all of the growth in construction and real estate and the building trades. Home improvement, there was a fair part of what normally would be kind of the lower income market that we think crept into the kind of middle income market and we are not sure that will be the case in the future. So, let's look at each business we have and which consumer it serves and assume it's not going to be as good as it could.","The second thing which is also really, really important and I alluded to that, take a minute [ph] is with interest rates and I get the tenure year over the last 30 years ago from 14% to 16% to 2% and that's very much running downhill. And that obviously made asset prices rise, but kind of more importantly made leverage always work and refinance always work and there were a lot of what might have been marginal business models that worked, because interest rates were falling so fast.","And there was a fair amount of our tenants that used a fair amount of leverage in environment when interest rates were going down. And so, with the tenure 2%, the chance of having a material declining interest rate environment is almost zero, because if you go from 2% to 1%, it\u2019s only 1% and so that benefit won't be as robust. And then you say okay, what if rates stay low, well, that\u2019s generally because the economy is probably limping along and very timid [ph] relative to economic growth and in that environment over time, the possibility you could see credit spreads gap, which means refinance rates for those tenants would be higher.","And then moving out 5 to 7 years, you take a look at those tenants and you say, if they had to refinance their entire balance sheet, what it would do? And that's what started that project which we did where we really know what it would do. And then, you throw in obviously, anybody that has impact by Internet.","And when we got done with all of that, we said okay, look, we want to go up the credit curve, so 5 to 7 years from now interest rates are higher and the tenants have to refinance their balance sheet and that sucks cash flows really out of their income statements, it can have an impact and default rates will be greater in the next 20 than the last 20.","So you put those two together and then kind of the last one that\u2019s the net lease retail spaces become more competitive and more mainstream and so, that launched us in a couple of directions. One, just generically up the credit curve and not just into investment grade, but in the portfolio for those less investment grade higher up the curve. Second, in terms of the type of consumer they really serve, again, we want to stay away from more of the consumer discretionary.","And then third, where can we go outside of retail that should benefit, good examples are FedEx, and the impacted as for them with Internet taking more and more of retail sales and other areas where we can also get investment grade credit and then maybe even have some very large Fortune 1000 tenants that are benefiting from having a presence overseas where we are not, but as they are our tenant of ours, we would benefit.","So, it was all of those kind of put together that we said, okay, in retail, up the curve, out of certain areas and into others and then outside of retail up the credit curve, so we wake up 5, 7, 8 years down the road and we have kind of remade the portfolio. And if it is that\u2019s going to slow our retail environment and\/or interest rates were materially higher, it won't have near the impact that might have because the last 20, 30 years and track record, it was put together because that is a function of the operating conditions to some extent and it\u2019s unlikely that that will persist into the future, so that was kind of the thought process.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, yeah, thank you. I appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Market. Please go ahead.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Market","Yeah, hi, good afternoon guys. I was looking at the or thinking about the impact of Friendly\u2019s. And I went back to the press release you guys had, is that what you pretty much are seeing what you put in the press release on January 18, is that still what you expect from the Friendly\u2019s closures and then how much you recover of what's left?","Paul Meurer","Yes.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Market","Okay, and at what point in the year did they stop, did all of this take place. I mean you said it was late in the year, but was it \u2013 how much of that fourth quarter rent I guess we see?","Paul Meurer","We received October rent and then the impact say 15 of the 19 rejections, we did not receive November or December rent. And then, the other four rejections we haven\u2019t received January\u2019s rent, just to kind to give you a feel.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Market","Okay, that does. And then as far as what you will recover from the others, when did that start, the reduction?","Paul Meurer","All of that started November 1 basically, on the concessions and that sort of thing on any properties where we agreed to a lower rent level. But October was a full rent.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Market","October was a full rent. I got you. And then for the phase, you are thinking, obviously nothing is happening. Are you thinking the same that you have in the press release, the same sort of same sort of parameters that you mentioned in here?","Paul Meurer","That all come back to January 1 basically. And that\u2019s all again loaded in our projection both Buffets and Friendly\u2019s, those recovery numbers and with the expectation as mentioned call it a six-month to 18-month general window, some earlier, some later than that in terms of re-leases on the rejected one.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Market","Okay. And those parameters Paul as far as how much base rent you will lose and what the concessions will be on there mainly. Do you still feel comfortable about that?","Paul Meurer","Yes, we are at the same place where we were with the press release a couple weeks ago.","Tom Lewis","Yeah, absolutely.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Market","Okay. And that all comes back to January 1?","Tom Lewis","Correct.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Market","Okay. I got you. And then, I wanted to ask you guys, when you re-leased some of these, when you redo Friendly\u2019s overall [ph], do you have to put capital in, in any way for the new tenant?","Tom Lewis","Sometimes a little.","Paul Meurer","A little, but generally not huge amounts. Historically, the revenue tenant was that\u2019s part of the work he does on it and we agree to a long-term rental agreement, it's generally not, it's also you don't get two years free rent and you do it, it\u2019s generally renegotiated rent and that\u2019s his responsibility. So, it's a marginal amount of CapEx that it adds in.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Market","Okay. And users for these would probably be restaurants again? Is that the typical use for a restaurant?","Paul Meurer","Yeah, a lot of the buildings are set up for that, so it generally is and I could give you other things they would become, but it\u2019s really anecdotal, they are restaurants.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Market","Okay. All right, very good. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session for the Realty Income operating results conference call.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andrew Crum, Associate Director, Realty Income. Please go ahead.","Andrew Crum","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter and year end 2019 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer.","During this conference, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K.","We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions you may reenter the queue.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.","Sumit Roy","Thanks, Andrew. Welcome everyone. We completed another year of strong operating performance delivering favorable risk adjusted returns for our shareholders. We are pleased to have provided our shareholders with more than 21.2% total shareholder return in 2019. During the year, we invested over $3.7 billion in real estate properties, an increase to AFFO per share by 4.1% to $3.32 per share. 2019 was a record year for property level acquisitions, and included approximately $798 million in international investments, including our first ever international sale leaseback of 12 properties located in the United Kingdom leased to Sainsbury's, a leading grocer.","In 2019, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of our Company's founding and the 25th year since our public listing, and we were proud to be added to the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index earlier this month. But being an S&P 500 constituent that has raised its dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. We entered 2020 very well positioned across all areas of the business and are introducing 2020 AFFO per share guidance of $3.50 to $3.56, which represents annual growth rate of approximately 5.4% to 7.2%.","Earlier this month, we announced that Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer is leaving the company. To ensure a smooth transition, Paul will serve as a Senior Advisor to the company through the end of the first quarter and the company has begun a search for a new Chief Financial Officer. I want to thank Paul for his valued partnership and tremendous contributions to the company over the many years.","Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to 301 commercial tenants in 50 different industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the UK. 83% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at nearly 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.1% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 11.6% of rental revenue.","Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 96% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and\/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of the recent US retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio, with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants.","The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties, it's 2.8 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list at 1.9% of rent is relatively consistent with our levels of the last few years. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the prior quarter. We expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2020.","During the quarter we released 28 properties recapturing 106% of the expiring rent. During 2019 we released 214 properties recapturing 103% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 3,100 properties with leases expiring recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. Our same-store rental revenue increased 2% during the quarter and 1.6% during 2019, which is above our full year projection of approximately 1%, primarily due to the recognition of percentage rent. We expect same-store rent growth to normalize in 2020 and our projected run rate for 2020 is approximately 1%. Approximately 86% of our leases have contractual rent increases.","Moving on, I will provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter and year, starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 4.3% for the quarter and 4.7% for the year, which was consistent with our full year projection of below 5%. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and expect our G&A margin to be approximately 5% in 2020. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of revenue was 1.4% for both the quarter and for the year, which was lower than our full year expectation in the 1.5% to 1.75% range.","Briefly, turning to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least AA ratings. During the fourth quarter, we raised $582 million of common equity primarily through our ATM program at approximately $75.52 per share. For the full year, we raised $2.2 billion of equity at approximately $72.40 per share, finishing the year with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 5 times, which is the highest coverage ratio we have reported for any quarter in our company's history.","In January, we completed the early repayment of our $250 million 5.75%, 2021 bond through a full par call. Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape as the weighted average maturity of our bonds is 8.3 years, and we have only $334 million of debt coming due in 2020, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics, ample liquidity and excellent access to well priced capital.","In the fourth quarter of 2019, we invested approximately $1.7 billion in 556 properties located in 42 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.2 years. Approximately $1.2 billion of this quarters acquisitions were related to the CIM portfolio acquisition we announced in September.","On a total revenue basis approximately 47% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment grade rated tenants. 100% of the revenues were generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 78 different tenants in 26 industries last year. Some of the more significant industries represented are convenience stores, dollar stores and drug stores. We closed 12 discrete transactions in the fourth quarter and approximately 10% of fourth quarter investment volume was sale-leaseback transactions. Off the $1.7 billion invested during the quarter, $1.5 billion was invested domestically in 551 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.6 years.","During the quarter, $221 million was invested internationally in five properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 17.1 years. During 2019, we invested over $3.7 billion in 789 properties located in 45 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.5 years.","On a revenue basis, 36% of total acquisitions are from investment grade rated tenants, 95% of the revenues are generated from retail and 5% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 112 different tenants in 31 industries. Of the 72 independent transactions closed in 2019, 11 transactions were above $50 million. Approximately 38% of 2019 investment volume was sale-leaseback transactions. Of the $3.7 billion invested in 2019, nearly $2.9 billion was invested domestically in 771 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 13 years. During 2019, approximately $798 million were invested internationally in 18 properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.6 years.","Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $11.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Of the $11.7 billion sourced during the quarter, $9.8 billion were domestic opportunities and $1.9 billion were international opportunities. Investment grade opportunities represented 17% of the volume sourced for the fourth quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the fourth quarter, 58% were portfolios and 42% or approximately $5 billion were one-off assets. In 2019 we sourced approximately $57 billion in potential transaction opportunities which marks the highest annual volume sourced in our company's history. Of this $57 billion sourced in 2019, 42% were portfolios and 58% or approximately $33 billion were one-off assets. Of these opportunities, $45 billion were domestic opportunities and $12 billion were international opportunities. Of the $1.7 billion in total acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter 15% were one-off transactions.","As to pricing, US investment grade properties are trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties are trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Regarding cap rates in the United Kingdom for the type of assets we are targeting, investment grade or implied investment grade properties are trading from the low 4% to high 5% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties are trading from the 5% to the low 7% cap rate range.","Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 325 basis points for domestic investments and 228 basis points for international investments, both of which were well above our historical average spreads. Our investment spreads for 2019 averaged 271 basis points for all of our investment activity, representing the widest annual spreads in our company's history. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less a nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.","Our investment pipeline, both domestic and international remains robust, and we believe we are the only publicly traded net lease company that has the size, scale, and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Based on the continued strength in our investment pipeline, as well as our excellent access to well priced capital, we are introducing 2020 acquisition guidance of $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion.","Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter we sold 29 properties for net proceeds of $36.3 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.8% and we realized an unlevered IRR of 10.4%. This brings us to 92 properties sold in 2019 for $108 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1%, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 8.3%.","We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of non-strategic assets, recycling the sale proceeds into properties that benefit our investment parameters. We are expecting between $200 million and $225 million of dispositions in 2020, a large portion of which already closed earlier this month.","In January, we increased the dividend for the 105th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents an approximately 3% increase over the year ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 79% based on the midpoint of 2020 AFFO guidance. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.6%. And we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index.","To wrap it up, it was a successful and active year for us in 2019, and we look to continue the momentum in 2020. Our portfolio is performing well. Our global investment pipeline is robust and our cost of capital and ample liquidity positions us to capitalize on our growth initiatives.","At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Greg McGinniss","Hey, this is Greg McGinniss on with Nick. Digging into the acquisition guidance a bit. We're curious if you could give us estimated split between the US and UK, whether the EU's an option for 2020 and what cap rate are investment spread is assumed in the underwriting? Thanks.","Sumit Roy","The make up is going to be approximately 20% international, 80% domestic. And the spreads are going to be -- our hope is well north of our average spreads of 150 basis points, 160 basis points.","Greg McGinniss","Okay. So coming in a bit from what you guys accomplished and I'm assuming that's just more conservatism than anything else?","Sumit Roy","That's what we feel very comfortable sharing with the market. Obviously what happened last year is something that we expect to continue, but we feel very confident in being able to say that our range in the acquisition is going to be in the $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion. And we hope to do far better than our average spreads, which as I said was right around 150 basis points to 160 basis points. So yes, a certain level of conservatism.","Greg McGinniss","Okay. And then, so we know the acquisition guidance does not include potential portfolio acquisitions, but could you give us maybe some sense for what you're seeing out in the market today on that front. Are there portfolios currently being marketed to you, when you looking at any right now one that size. I'm just trying to get a sense what are reasonable upside as to acquisition guidance?","Sumit Roy","Yes. So let's be a little bit clear on what we are defining as portfolios. The large portfolio transaction that we did last year was at $1.1 billion CIM transaction, $1.2 billion CIM transaction. That's the kind of transaction that hasn't been sort of built into our $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion number. Clearly we are in the market and are constantly doing portfolio sizes in the range of $100 million to $200 million, and those are very much part and parcel of what's included in our guidance.","Look, we've shared with you what the sourcing numbers were for 2019. We haven't seen any let up in terms of what we are seeing. So far and so early in the year, we are very optimistic about the pipeline and we are very optimistic of meeting the guidelines that we have shared with the market. And at this point, there is nothing that we are seeing in the horizon that would lead us to believe that this is going to be a much slower year than what we saw last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.","Christy McElroy","Hey, good morning Sumit. Thank you. Just with a pickup in some of the open-air retailers filing for bankruptcy and announcing closures in recent months, and also reports of others hiring restructuring advisors. Can you talk about any specific tenants that you have exposure to that fall into this category or any pocket of your exposure where you're concerned about fallout, if you look into the next year.","Sumit Roy","There are some tenants that we are obviously looking at very closely. The good news here is we are so well diversified Christy that these are tenants that have very minimal, well below 1% exposure to. For instance, PO1 is one of our tenants that we are looking at, it's been on our credit watch list for a while. We have 12 assets with them, it's right around 10 basis points of rent. We did a sale leaseback with them in 1998 and it's actually been a great transaction for us. So we are almost indifferent as to what happens with them on 9 of the 12 properties we already getting inbound calls from large national tenants, that gives us very high level of confidence that we would be able to reposition this asset.","A couple of other names that we are keeping a close eye on Crystal's is another one that we acquired through a large portfolio again basis points of rent and based on the four-wall coverage we feel our portfolio is very well positioned. And once again, but that's a corporate level credit that is in the news and one that we are looking at very closely. But in aggregate, we have obviously taken all of this into account in forecasting out our AFFO per share guidance. And so you can tell from the guidance that we have laid out Christy that fingers crossed this year will again be a very, very good year for us.","Christy McElroy","And you talked about in your opening remarks, the spreads in market cap rates between investment grade and non-investment grade. Do you think those spreads are wide enough just given sort of that tenant followed environment where you're seeing, and I think I heard you say that about -- said that about 70% of the deals that you're sourcing are investment grade versus, I think it's 50% in place. So will there be a continued effort to sort of raise investment grade exposure?","Sumit Roy","Actually what we are seeing is something very interesting Christy. I would argue that some of the higher yielding assets have compressed with regards to cap rates, and are moving closer to investment grade cap rates are in the market. So it hasn't been a movement in the investment grade market that is as pronounced as it is in the higher yielding markets. So, one must take into consideration, on a risk adjusted basis, where are you better off investing. And I think we've shared this with you in the past, Christy, credit is very much part of the analysis that we undertake. But we are not pursuing a particular credit profile. We are looking at it in totality and trying to come up with for the risk that one is assuming are the returns appropriate. That's how we look at all of our investments.","And -- but the point I want to make is high yielding assets that used to have a high 7%, even an 8% cap rate now trading at a 6% cap rate and investment grade assets that were potentially in the high 5s are in the low 5s. So it's a far more pronounced compression that we are seeing in the higher yielding side of the equation, and it does give us pause, when we look at it from a risk adjusted basis as to whether we should continue to pursue all of those transactions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shivani Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Shivani Sood","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. As following up on these earlier question about portfolios, curious if you're seeing increased competition for larger portfolio acquisitions or sale leasebacks from private players in recent months. And how has that changed, how you're sourcing and approaching the process to remain ahead of that?","Sumit Roy","Shivani for us it's business as usual. We are not changing any of our methods of sourcing or pursuing potential transactions that have a risk profile that is not justified by the cap rates, that's being ascribed or that's being asked. I mean, we have, we did 89% of our transactions in 2019 were relationship driven transactions. We are continuing to pursue those. We continue to reach out to clients of ours that have credit that we feel very comfortable with. These are assets that don't even get marketed, and we continue to build on the sale leaseback side of the equation. And absent CIM, 61% of what we did last year was sale leaseback. So I wouldn't say that in any way we have altered the way that we are pursuing acquisitions. What we have done on the international side of the equation is, obviously, we have continued to establish new relationships with again having done the homework around clients that we would like to pursue over the long-term. And that has to been a major push for Neil and for myself to continue to grow our international platform. And thankfully, we've made a fair amount of progress on that front.","Shivani Sood","Thanks for that color. Just switching topics, the recap rate for occupied boxes is really good in the quarter. Can you share some more color on what drove that?","Sumit Roy","Yes, sure. So there were basically two things that drove that. And then as you can see our 2020 guidance is right around 1% which is traditionally being what we have said. Not every lease that we have has an annual rent growth. Some have rent growth every three years, some have rent growth every five years, and it just so happened that a disproportionate number of leases had growth coming in 2019. For instance, if you look at the Dollar stores, 46% of all the assets that we own within that bucket had an increase in 2019, and most of those were either a three or a five year rental increase, and that accounted for about 34% of the disproportionate increase in the rent, the 1.6% that we were able to achieve.","On the second note a smaller contribution to the increase was the timing of the percentage rent accruals and that too helped. But if you were to take those two out of the equation, we would be right around what we have guided the market to for 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.","Rob Stevenson ","Good afternoon. How are you feeling these days about the office segment. I mean you've added one asset in the last year. Is that a source of dispositions going forward? Is that a source of acquisitions going forward? I mean what's the -- how do you think about that over the next three years?","Sumit Roy","Rob, so as far as I know, our exposure to office has continued to dwindle over the last few years. It used to be north of 6% at one stage, today it's in the 3% zip code. And it's a product type that we have accumulated largely through large portfolio transactions. We haven't proactively gone out and bought some single-tenant net leased office asset. Having said that, the commentary I'm sharing with you is very much a US based commentary, but I suspect that it is going to be very similar even in the international market. So our view regarding office has not changed. It's asset type that we are very cautious about and we tend to be very, very selective when we even take a particular opportunity and do a deep dive into underwriting the opportunities.","Rob Stevenson ","Okay. And then I guess the other question for me winds up being when you take a look at the balance sheet over the next couple of years, a lot of sort of heavy lifting has been done. I mean, where -- is there any sort of opportunities out there for you guys to pick up anything over the next couple of years with rates bottoming yet again?","Sumit Roy","To me that is such a tertiary mechanism or tool to utilize to help grow our earnings. And I'm glad that you observe that by and large, our efficiency around our balance sheet financing has largely been realized. There is another unsecured that has a high 4% coupon, I believe in 2023, but that's one that we -- depending on where the interest rate environment is, we might take a look at taking out, but that is such a tertiary consideration when I think about what are the drivers of AFFO per share growth. But yes, I'm very happy. Jonathan, are there any other points you would like to make?","Jonathan Pong","Yes, Rob, I think when you look out over the next few years through 2023, we obviously ticked down the 2021 in January, but in '23 and '24, we do have $1.7 million of debt that's maturing, but 2022 early in the quarter, but 2023 our [indiscernible] and so knock on wood rates stay low. It's interesting that a 3.25% coupon today is fairly high. So what we are looking at liability management ideas we're always thinking about how the make whole math kind of translates into a breakeven rate, if we were to refinance certain piece of the capital stack and you can expect us to continue doing that on a go-forward basis.","Rob Stevenson ","And just preferred have any place in the capital stack going forward?","Sumit Roy","We could issue in the mid to high 4s today on the preferred side. It's always something that we'll look at. But when you look at the indicative cost for us of 30-year unsecured paper, that's in the low 3% range today. That gap doesn't make a lot of sense for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Brian Hawthorne","Hi. How comfortable are you with your C-store exposure and how high would you be OK with it going?","Sumit Roy","We are very comfortable with the kind of tenants that we have exposure to that largely constitute our industry exposure. 7-Eleven, Couche-Tard, under the Circle K banner, those are names that we are very comfortable with. They are the best-in-class convenience store operators and we monitor their business. We have a very close relationship with them. And we are very comfortable there. What we are not comfortable with are, the smaller format kiosk type C-stores that heavily rely on fuel sale to drive profitability. And thankfully those are largely out of our portfolio. We do have some, but by and large, most of that 11% exposure is being driven by 7-Eleven and Circle K.","Brian Hawthorne","Okay. And then have your tenants talked about rising wages impacting their coverages at all? The coverage ratios?","Sumit Roy","We went through how many, it was like north of 200 leases, and the fact that I'm sure those conversations in every -- not there in every tenant conversations, but I'm sure in some cases, those conversations had to have alluded to higher labor costs. But by and large, we are happy to report that our tenants are doing fairly well, and the fact that we were able to recapture 103% net of expiring rents leads one to believe that at least the kinds of tenants that we have exposure to are not insulated but are able to absorb the higher labor costs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisor. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Spenser Allaway ","Thank you. In terms of the $12 billion of deals you guys sourced international this year, can you provide a little color on what particular property types or industries you are seeing most heavily marketed abroad?","Sumit Roy","It's largely grocers, it's C-stores, it's movie theaters, it's discount retail, those are the buckets that they would fall in, as well as some industrial.","Spenser Allaway ","Okay and then just going back to the previous question on the recent wave of bankruptcies and ongoing headwinds in the retail segment. Do you suspect that we could see capex eventually creep higher in the net lease segment just in terms of TIs or potential deferred caped on any vacant assets?","Sumit Roy","We saw the exact opposite. Our capex has largely been consistent over the last three years. And what has actually reduced was our property expenses. If you notice, we were forecasting to the market that it would be anywhere between 1.5% to 1.75%, and we ended up being at 1.4%. And the reason -- there were two reasons for that. One was that the property taxes that we were forecasting on our vacant assets was far more than what we actually realized, given that we were able to sell our vacant assets at very attractive or total returns.","And obviously the top line grew well in advance of what we had forecasted. So those two factors resulted in the property expense margins coming in below 1.5%. We are not seeing our capex numbers changing based on the current climate. And I think it's largely due to the type of retail that we invest in. Its net lease, if it's working for the tenant, they are happy to invest the capex themselves, reposition the assets to continue to remain relevant and drive profitability out of the store. And that's why the net lease industry tends to be a very, very efficient industry. But again, it is absolutely a function of the clients that one chooses to create an exposure to. And if it's the wrong set of clients, I'd say Spencer that that could have a different effect, but on our portfolio we are not seeing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Todd Stender","Thanks. Looking at the average lease term, it's now just over nine years. It's been hedging lower and you guys have certainly acknowledged that. Can you talk about the recent releasing activity. Maybe in the term that they're renewed for. Your acquisitions have on average been higher than that average, but the portfolio average keeps drifting lower. Maybe just talk about releasing if you don't mind?","Sumit Roy","Yes, sure. And this is something we've talked about in the past as well Todd. If you think about it, at least -- lease the original lease tends to have a 15 year, 20 year or even 25 year sale leaseback. And then you have options built into these leases and those options tend to be five-year options. And this is all disclosed in our supplemental. If you look at our history of releasing and we've done north of 3,000 leases. 88% and it's been higher more recently. 80% to 90% of the existing tenants exercise these options. And so when you reset the lease term, it's right around the five year timeframe. It's only when we are going out and retenanting it with a new tenant or finding a new tenant even with zero vacancies that we have the opportunity to go beyond the five to something like a 10, and those have average in the six to seven years zip code.","And so if we were to do no acquisitions, I think the normalized run rate for a net lease company, a very, very mature net lease company which is doing zero acquisitions or very little as a percentage of their overall portfolio. The normalized weighted average lease term is going to be right around six to seven years. And that's where the asset management and real estate operations team comes into play. And we have anticipated this and set the team up accordingly. And I think the results speak for themselves.","On a quarterly basis, we share with you what the releasing spread is, and we share with you what's the capital invested was -- with regards to tenant incentives etc, and more often than not they tend to be zero. And we've been capturing north of 100% of the expiring rents. 103% this year. It was similar number last year and in this last quarter was 106%. So I believe that we have a team that in fact could be viewed as somebody that could create value, when these leases start to roll and we are able to maintain the kind of releasing activity that we have, being able to achieve over the last three to four years, that could become a growth driver for us.","But clearly, new acquisitions, one should expect if it's a sale leaseback, it should be in that 15 to 20 years zip code and if it's acquired lease, it's going to have double-digit numbers. But as we become a bigger company and unless our acquisition numbers don't keep up on a pro rata basis, the weighted average lease term is going to continue to sort of get lower and should normalize right around seven years.","Todd Stender","To that extension option number. Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you, Sumit.","Sumit Roy","Sure. Of course.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.","John Massocca","Good afternoon. So you mentioned -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks there was significant -- if I heard you correctly, that significant portion of expected 2020 disposition activity closed earlier this month. Can you provide some color on what drove that?","Sumit Roy","Sure. We are under an NDA, so I have to be very careful. But it was one of our clients who did a strategic review of their real estate operations and approached us to buy back some of the assets that they had leased to us or vice versa that we had leased to them. And it was a very attractive return. We had five years left on the portfolio. And we were able to transact with them and that closed, I believe, early part of last week, and it was to the tune of about $116 million. So if you subtract out the $116 million in dispositions, you're back up to a right around $108 million and that's around the levels of what we achieved in 2019.","John Massocca","Okay that makes sense. Then as we kind of think about dispositions outside of that transaction. How much I guess is potentially being driven by the CIM portfolio and maybe kind of fine-tuning that portfolio more to kind of what you guys want to hold long-term?","Sumit Roy","Yes. This is the question that we've answered before, when we had announced the CIM transaction. This was a $1.2 billion transaction. We had said that $1 billion worth of the assets that we purchased were ones that we would buy in the open market, if they were available one-off. There's about $200 million worth of assets that we are going to asset manage more aggressively, and by that we had also bucketed that $200 million into some of them are going to be made available for immediate marketing and that's about 25% call it plus, minus. And the rest we would collect the rent for as long as the tenants continues to pay rent. And because of the location, because of the rent per square feet, we feel very good about being able to reposition those assets with potentially new tenants. And so that was the way that we underwrote the $200 million worth that would require more attention, if you will. And that hasn't changed. That's precisely the way we are thinking about the CIM portfolio.","John Massocca","Okay. But then when you think about dispositions on kind of a net basis with that, let's say $50 million that maybe a little more immediately ready for repositioning within the CIM portfolio. It would seem to imply then I guess maybe less disposition activity versus what you guys accomplished this year or is that the wrong way of thinking about it and all this will be kind of blended together?","Sumit Roy","Yes. Because, are you guaranteeing me that you are going to be able to -- we'll be able to sell those $50 million this year in 2020? We don't -- we didn't underwrite, thinking that we were going to be able to sell 25% of that portfolio that $200 million portfolio in 2020. So it is certainly a blend John. We would love to be able to achieve that. And if we are, we might come back and say to you later on in the year that our disposition numbers may be north of what we have gone out with. But there is certainly a level of flexibility that we've built into those disposition numbers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for taking the question. Just on, going back to sort of the tenant health issues referenced being really small, several on the restaurant side. There were several names that have cropped up. NBC, Crystal etc. I'm just wondering maybe taking a step back restaurants remain kind of part and parcel of the net lease business. But are you thinking about restaurant slightly differently going forward, maybe on a three, five year basis between public, private, franchisee, direct, corporate-owned, any specific segments. I think any color there would be useful. Just because we've seen a couple of tenant crop up.","Sumit Roy","Sure, Vikram. Thanks for your question. We have -- and I am not sharing anything new here. We have been very cautious about the casual dining concept. And more importantly, even if the concept is a good one, we have been very careful about exposing ourselves to small scale franchisees. And so, those factors continue to remain front and center any time we are looking at transactions. And largely what you see playing out in the restaurant space today is not unexpected, and so we are very well -- thankfully, we are very well positioned for the worst outcome in some of what you have just shared in terms of the names and others that we are monitoring. And in fact, our expected outcome on this very small exposure that we have is still going to be north of what we have underwritten in terms of our guidance is my belief.","But our thinking has always been very cautious on the casual dining side. It has been more positive on the quick service restaurant side and even within the quick service restaurants there are other drivers such as [indiscernible] need to have a certain number of units, they need to have a certain number of scale that would give us comfort, even if the corporate concept is one that that we find very interesting. So those hurdles have not changed.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. And sorry if I missed this. I dialed in late. But on the international side, I heard you reference a couple of categories you were exploring, but just curious kind of how the pipeline looks between the UK and then broadly Continental Europe?","Sumit Roy","Look, our focus is still very much the UK, that's the geography that we decided to go into first for obvious reasons. We feel very comfortable with that. But we are starting to see some very interesting concepts coming out of Western Europe as well. And we are doing our diligence. Niel's making several trips across the pond to explore those opportunities. So I'm not going to keep those off the table, but in terms of the make up, I think you should expect 20% of the volume plus, minus to come from the international market. And I'd love to be surprised and that's a challenge for Neil. But the vast bulk of our acquisitions will still be US domiciled.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Collin Mings from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin Mings","First one for me, again this is something that's been discussed on a few prior calls. Obviously a lot of competition out there for industrial assets. Nothing closed during the quarter. Can you maybe just update us on what you're seeing on that front and maybe just talk a little bit about the pipeline on that front going forward?","Sumit Roy","Yes. Collin, the way you started asking the question is precise. There is a lot of competition. There are many people chasing single-tenant industrial assets. And yes, we haven't been able to get any over the finish line in the last quarter. We've been close on a few occasions, but did not -- chose not to continue to pursue the aggressiveness on the cap rate side, but it is something, it's a product that we like. It is an exposure to a certain certain types of tenants that we would find as being very complementary to what we already have. It's just that we haven't been able to actively get a lot of transactions over the finish line yet.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then, I did want to follow-up, actually now in a couple of questions on the deal flow on the international front. You've referenced a couple of times again targeting plus or minus 20% of your activity in 2020 will fall to your international bucket. So as you think about targeting call it rough numbers $500 million or so of opportunities. Just curious if you can maybe drill down a little bit more. You mentioned a few things in response to Spenser's question in terms of the different sectors or property types you're seeing a lot of the deal flow. Can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more on where you think you are going to be able to reach the closing table this year on some of those opportunities. And then just, again, as you think about the relationships you've built in the regions to elaborate a little bit more on that as well.","Sumit Roy","Yes. It's very difficult to tell precisely where within those different buckets are we going to end up. Let's just look at historically what we have been able to achieve. The large part of the 18 transactions that we -- 18 properties that we acquired, 17 were in the grocer -- were grocery stores and they were the big four grocers in the UK and one happen to be a theater. And so the bulk of the transactions that we are seeing is with the big four. But there are some other transactions that we are starting to see that are very interesting. And I'm not in a position to share with you names of tenants, etc with whom we've -- we are making a lot of progress. That is something, as you can understand for competitive reasons. We'd like to get it over the finish line and then be in a position to talk about it more freely. But our conversations is broader than the grocery industry is what I can share with you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, good afternoon. I don't know if I missed it, I don't think I did, but did you mention any update on the search for a new CFO. And if you haven't, could you comment on where that search stand. And what's embedded in the 2020 guidance from both the separation cost and a potential hiring of a new CFO?","Sumit Roy","Yes. So look, we have hired a search firm. We have created a profile and we are out in the market looking for the right individual to join the team, that's where we are with regards to the CFO search. The good news is Paul is very much here with us, acting as a Senior Advisor, and will continue to be with us through the end of March. The fact that we have a very strong team with Jonathan Pong and Sean driving our Capital Markets and Finance Departments and Sean driving our Accounting, we feel very comfortable that we don't have to be in a hurry to replace that particular role. We have a very strong team. Our focus is going to be in terms of finding the right person with the right cultural fit and can help be a partner to us in helping drive the next evolution of this company. And we are not going to take an expeditious route to get there. I mean we want to get this right.","With regards to your second question or part of your question is around severance, it's just south of $2 million that is going to impact both the G&A as well as our FFO numbers. And yes, I think those were your questions.","Haendel St. Juste","Thank you for that. And as a follow-up of sorts, what level of international build-out cost is reflected in the current G&A guide? Remind us again how many people you've committed currently already to your international platform and where you envision that by year-end?","Sumit Roy","Yes. So look, we already have a small office in London. We have one person who is driving the business there. We have outsourced a fair amount of the administrative work that is required, i.e., accounting, tax as well as legal, it is quite possible based on the analysis that we have done that in-sourcing some of these functions may make sense. If the growth in our portfolio continues or accelerates the in-sourcing is going to accelerate. So we are very comfortable with the controls that we have in place and the process that we have implemented and it's a structure that allows us to be incredibly flexible.","What we have committed to is to higher one other person in the UK, but the number of people who eventually become part of Realty Income Limited will remain to be seen. And it's going to be partially driven by the size of the portfolio that we are able to create. And so having that flexibility, allows us to be much more nimble when it comes to the G&A load that is associated with the platform.","Haendel St. Juste","Got it, got it. Thank you for that. And then maybe one more if you entertain me for a second. Curious on -- I guess what your view is on if you feel credit, tenant credits being fairly valued in today's market and whether size is an advantage or maybe a disadvantage for maybe some of your smaller peers have been able to grow faster in an environment where growth seems to have been prioritized over the past year or so. Does that make you any more or less inclined to perhaps consider splitting the company may be into a higher credit and maybe lower credit bucket or perhaps some transaction to in effect make the company a bit smaller or any other strategic change on that front.","Sumit Roy","Look that's a whole lot of questions that you have sort of built into this one question. What I can tell you Haendel is, we went through a very deep dive, I'd say now about 16 months ago, 15 months ago, and we feel very comfortable that our size, scale, and cost of capital, first and foremost is very portable and is a massive advantage to us as we have started to show. We can do, very large scale sale leaseback and it does not create immediate tenant concentration issues for us.","We can be the one-stop shop for existing tenants and have transactions come to us without it -- without then feeling the need to have to go and test the markets, and that's value to them, it's value to us. It allows us to pursue proprietary software that we are developing in-house, that is going to help us drive the lifecycle of Real Estate within our business. Those are things that comes because we have size and scale.","And we believe that we have created enough adjacent verticals and\/or are exploring enough verticals, where we will be able to provide a growth rate that is very comparable to all of our net lease peers. And the fact that we have the lower cost of capital, and the fact that we have scale, and the fact that we have size, those are all benefits that should ultimately accrue to us. So until that equation changes, I don't see us having to explore. You know what was it that you said spin-offs or high yielding or lower yielding asset base. I mean this is part of our underwriting and it's in fact, a strength of our underwriting, that allows us to pursue the full spectrum of credit tenants and opportunities and it's what helps us drive growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Sumit forget about a spin, but just thinking about disposition volumes, right, because on one hand, it would be highly dilutive relative to buying something with your cost of capital, being able to sell obviously on asset at much higher cap rate than where you're effectively funding your costs. So recognizing that there is some dilutive aspect to selling assets.","I would have thought just given your comments about how the markets pricing non-investment grade, given your size and scale of your portfolio that you would be able to look for either industry tenant or geographical potential concerns where you may want to take a more aggressive approach at shrinking the base, so that the ad of things that you're doing all these verticals that you're in, and having international and having your cost of capital from the debt and equity perspective, provides that much more bottom line growth over time and so that you're not going to be faced with something that comes down the road 12 to 24 months. I would just imagine out of your portfolio there has got to be more than $50 million or $75 million of dispositions, I think you'd want to do, if you really took a hard look at the portfolio?","Sumit Roy","And we are constantly doing that, Michael. We are constantly looking at the portfolio. We are trying to figure out what is the best economic outcome. Despite the fact that the cap rates seem very aggressive, what do we feel we can sell a given asset at versus holding on to that asset, collecting the lease and selling it vacant at the end. That's an analysis that we are constantly doing. The advantage that we have is so many of our assets and I talked about the PO1 example, we did a sale leaseback on those 12 assets that we own in 1998. We can sell those assets for ground and come out with higher single digit unlevered IRRs. But the fact is their rent is current. We are going to collect the rent and when they -- if they decide that they want to hand over some of the assets back to us at that point, we could do the exact same thing that we can do it today, but we have a few more months of rent collected.","So it really comes down to an economic argument. And I think what differentiates us is we are constantly doing that on the assets that we have identified as not long-term holds. And in some situations, we have decided the selling it today is absolutely the right economic outcome because the rent we're collecting perhaps is not enough to justify holding it till the rent starts coming in. And that's where that $100 million and in this year $200 million of disposition number comes in. I think if you add up everything we've done over the last six years, it's north of a $1 billion of assets that we have sold. And it's not to avoid the dilution. You're absolutely right. That is a third level, fourth level consideration, but it's not the driver of the decision making process. It is really the economic analysis that we undertake Michael.","Michael Bilerman","Your company is two times just over the last five years and you go last 10 years it's 4 times, right. Just in terms of size of the asset base. I guess, and I know the benefits of size and scale in terms of your cost of capital helping driving additional growth and allows you to do things as you said without getting a tenant concentration issue. For others, they may not want to take off as much of a portfolio been certain vertical because of that. I just, I guess I'm surprised that there isn't -- and look maybe all the investments you've made have been great, and you don't have a lot of issues, I guess I'm just surprised that there isn't that more aggressiveness of recycling of portfolio, especially in this environment where credit is being I think mispriced?","Sumit Roy","Yes. Look, we continue to keep looking at it Michael. And who knows, maybe in a few years we'll come out and or not even a few years, maybe in 12 months will come out and say we may need to do more. But right now we feel fairly comfortable that I think we've -- based on the analysis that we've done. We are comfortable with the $200 million of dispositions.","Michael Bilerman","Have your views changed on public to public M&A within the net lease space, and sort of where is your mindset today, especially given your comments about size and scale and being bigger and being able to inherit other problems and dispose or they're not as big of a problem for you as they are of the target?","Sumit Roy","We've always been open to M&A, Michael. It's -- the question that we have wrestled with and the reason why we haven't been able to move forward has always been, do we have a seller out there that's willing to essentially sell their -- sell themselves. And if that situation were to occur, we would absolutely engage in a conversation. The question is, you look around the net lease space today and you see all of the net lease companies are trading at very high multiples. All of them seem to have a process identified to continue to grow their business. Within that environment, do you see someone raising their hand and saying, look, we would like to engage. If that happens, we are not going to shy away from engaging in that conversation and pursuing M&A.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.","Sumit Roy","Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing everyone at the upcoming conference.

We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit the during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.","John Case","Thanks, Janeen, and welcome to our call today. And we\u2019re pleased to begin the year with an active quarter for acquisitions and healthy AFFO per share growth of 4.5% to $0.70. As announced in yesterday\u2019s press release we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance from $750 million to approximately $900 million and reiterating our AFFO per share guidance for 2016 of $2.85 to $2.90 as we anticipate another solid year of earnings and dividend growth.","Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks, John. I\u2019m going to provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Interest expense increased in the quarter by $2.2 million to $60.7 million. This increase was due to the recognition of a non-cash loss of approximately $5.8 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter.","As a reminder, theses mark-to-market adjustments on our floating to fixed interest rate swaps will tend to cause volatility in our reported interest expense and FFO on a quarterly basis, particularly when there is significant movement in short-term forward curve rates as we saw in the first quarter.","Naturally, this evaluation will fluctuate based on the outlook for interest rates. Last quarter, it resulted in a $4.1 million non-cash gain. We do adjust for these non-cash gains or losses when computing our cash AFFO earnings.","The increase in interest expense was partially offset by less overall debt in our balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of bonds and over $300 million in mortgages over the last 12 months. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong and continue to tick higher with interest coverage of 4.6 times and fixed charge coverage of 4.1 times.","Our fixed charge coverage is the highest it has been in well over 10 years. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was less than 4.8%, which continues to be the lowest percentage in the net-lease sector. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 2.3%.","As a percentage of revenues, these expenses came in slightly higher than normal due to temporarily higher carry costs on some vacant properties and some timing issues on tenant reimbursements which will be received in the second quarter. We continue to estimate our run-rate for property expenses in 2016 to be approximately 1.5% of revenues.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative capital structure. Last year, we established an ATM or At-the-Market equity distribution program. In the first quarter we utilized this program to issue 500,000 shares, generating net proceeds of approximately $31 million.","Our $2 billion credit facility has a balance of approximately $650 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $22.8 million in mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $22 million in mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due in 2016. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter.","And finally, our debt to EBITDA ratio stands at approximately 5.3 times, and is only 5.8 times inclusive of preferred equity.","Now, let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on these results.","John Case","Thanks, Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 97.8%. Occupancy declined a bit due to a number of leases expiring during the quarter, including leases rejected through the Buffets Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in March.","We are working through this additional vacancy with our re-leasing and sales efforts and continue to expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. Economic occupancy was 98.8%.","On the 38 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured a 112% of the expiring rents, which represents our strongest quarterly recapture rate since we began recording this metric in 2014. As is typical for us, we achieved this without any spending on tenant improvement.","Our re-leasing results reflect the high quality of our real estate portfolio, testament to our disciplined investment underwriting and proactive portfolio management efforts. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to our net-lease peers who also report this metric.","Our same store rent increased 1.3% during the quarter. And we expect annual same store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we were able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we never had a year with negative same store rent growth.","Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 243 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.","79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the first quarter.","Walgreens remains our largest tenant accounting for 6.8% of rental revenues, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenues. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in the second-half of this year by Walgreens pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents about 2% of our annualized rental revenue.","The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased to 2.7 times on a four-wall basis and the median remained at 2.6 times for the first quarter.","Moving on to acquisitions, during the quarter we completed $353 million in acquisitions, at record spreads through our weighted average cost of capital. And we continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters.","During the quarter, we sourced $6.2 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisition. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy acquiring just 6% of the amount we sourced, which is consistent with our average since 2010.","As a remainder, our revised acquisitions guidance of approximately $900 million principally reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transaction.","I\u2019ll hand it over to Sumit, to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions.","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. During the first quarter of 2016, we invested $353 million in 103 properties, located in 31 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.8 years. On a revenue basis, 23% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail and 14% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 26 different tenants in 18 industries.","Some of the most significant industries represented our restaurants and motor vehicle dealerships. We closed 19 independent transactions in the first quarter and the average investment per property was approximately $3.4 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $6 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 48% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 52% or more than $3 billion were one-off assets.","Investment-grade opportunities represented 30% for the first quarter. Of the $353 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter 37% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 47 year operating history.","As to pricing cap rates remained flat in the first quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.","Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 11 properties for net proceeds of $11 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 6.6%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 255 basis points in the first quarter which were well above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year WACC.","In conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2016 to approximately $900 million. We remain confident in reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million. With that, I\u2019d like to hand it back to John.","John Case","Thanks, Sumit. Following the very active year we had in the capital markets in 2015 we raised $35 million in common equity during the first quarter. Approximately $31 million of the equity raise during the quarter was through our ATM program. Our leverage continues to be at historical lows with debt to market cap of approximately 24%, debt to EBITDA of 5.3 times and a debt service coverage ratio of 4.6 times.","We currently have more than $1.3 billion of capacity on our $2 billion revolving line of credit providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. Our sector-leading cost to capital and balance sheet flexibility allows us to drive earnings per share and dividend growth while remaining disciplined with our investment and underwriting strategy.","Last month, we announced our 85th dividend increase, representing a 5% increase from this time last year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance is 83%, a level we are quite comfortable with.","To wrap it up, we had a solid quarter and remain optimistic for 2016. As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in our net lease business.","Our portfolio is performing well and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace and we believe we were best-positioned to capitalize on the highest quality opportunities given our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and distinct cost of capital advantage.","At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, good morning on the West Coast. Just hoping you could speak a little bit to the watch-list you may have, and in particular, any potential vacancies if some of the tenants like Sports Authority or Friendly\u2019s, if all their stores went dark, what would be the delta in occupancy under that sort of bear case scenario?","John Case","Sure, I can address the watch-list then touch on vacancies. The watch-list is now at 0.8%. Juan, as you remember, we have a credit watch-list that\u2019s 5.8%. And then, we have an overall watch-list and that overall watch-list incorporates everything, including the quality of the real estate location, industry trends, concentrations we may have, not just credit. So those are the size of the two watch-lists at this point.","With regard to - when we look at the material exposures that we have, we feel like we are in very good shape. With regard to Sports Authority, which we typically do not talk about tenants outside of our top-20, they been in our top-20 before and obviously they\u2019re in the news, so we didn\u2019t want to address that today. Sports Authority, we have minimal exposure to, well under 1% of grant.","The stores that we have are receiving significant interest from a number of national retailers, some sporting goods stores, but also retailers outside of that sector. Our cash flows on those stores, our capital coverages are quite strong. And I think this morning, as you probably saw they announced that they were going to pursue liquidation. Our guidance has incorporated our expectations with regard to Sports Authority and any other credit issues into it. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re sticking with - on the AFFO per share $2.85 to $2.90.","So we think we\u2019re going to end up the year at occupancy of approximately 98%. We\u2019re at 97.8% today. And obviously we started the year off at 98.4%. The biggest hit was in the first quarter, late in the first quarter when we received the Ovation Brands\u2019 or Buffets\u2019 properties back. And that was the sole reason or principally the sole reason for the downtick in occupancy. And they came in late in the quarter, so we didn\u2019t have a lot of opportunity to work those properties in terms of re-leasing and sales.","Juan Sanabria","Great. And just one follow-up question, separate topic, could you give us a sense of what percentage of restaurants where you kind of call them out in terms of the first quarter deal volume. And I know you guys had previously been a little bit bearish in your discourse about casual dining. What in particular around the brands you may have acquired was appealing to you? And if you could, maybe talk to some of the valuation numbers around that.","John Case","Yes, I mean, I\u2019ll address casual dining. We invested in QSR restaurants as well as casual dining restaurants in the first quarter. We are consistent with what we said regarding casual dining. We\u2019ve not made many investments in casual dining restaurants here over the last five years, just a few and none that have been material. But when we do look at casual dining restaurants, we have a very high underwriting hurdle rate. So we want coverages well north of 3 times, 4 times we can get it.","We want footprints that are smaller, 6,000 square feet in that area that is fungible and we want rents that approximate market and we want to be invested at replacement cost or near-replacement cost. And we want to be invested in a concept that\u2019s stable or improving. And most of what we\u2019ve seen over the last five years has not met that hurdle. But when it does we meet those hurdles. We are comfortable buying casual dining restaurants.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Robert Stevenson","Good afternoon, guys. Can you talk a little bit about in terms of the acquisitions you made during the quarter? Was it a certain asset, certain group of asset, certain type of tenant or whatever, that sort of pushed the cap rate down into the 6% range?","John Case","Yes, the - no, it wasn\u2019t really anything other than having to do with the quality of the assets. As you know, last year our average cap rate was 6.6% for the quarter. It was 6.6% here for the first quarter in 2016. And the cap rate is reflective of the quality of the assets. And it\u2019s as simple as that. It wasn\u2019t one type of asset that really drove it.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then, in terms of the way we should be thinking about the sort of hundred or so leases you have expiring throughout the year, I mean, what\u2019s your expectations at this point for a conversion ratio in terms of renewing those leases versus ones that are likely to go vacant at least temporarily?","John Case","Yes. I mean, again, we think we are going to - the easiest way to answer this question is we think we\u2019re going to end up at approximately 98% of occupancy. So this is relatively for us a light year from here on out with regard to lease rollover. So we would expect to - our historical rate has been to re-let about 70% for the same tenant, 20% to new tenants and sell about 10%. Whether we match that or not this year, I am not sure.","But, again, we feel good about the prospects on those properties that we have that expire during the remaining three quarters of the year.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thank you. Just on the acquisitions trajectory, you guys had a very nice quarter, the first quarter. But just looking at the guidance, most of the raise is a just flow-through from sort of what you\u2019ve done in the first quarter. And you typically don\u2019t see a sort of slowdown in the trajectory. Generally, second or third quarter seems to be - you seemed to have a quarter in the past.","I\u2019m just kind of wondering what - is there something different, is there something got a push-back and is this more kind of maybe the first quarter strong and then the fourth quarter strong as well.","John Case","Well, our quarterly acquisitions in the recent years have been anywhere from $125 million to $750 million. So they are very difficult to predict. And you\u2019ve heard us use this word, Vikram, a thousand times, but their lumpy. And you can\u2019t take one quarter and extrapolate from that quarter what acquisitions are going to be for the year.","So we were really pleased with the first quarter. We think we are going to have a good year. Hence, we raised our acquisitions guidance for the year, $900 million, but there\u2019s no smoothness to being able to project it by quarter upfront.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, fair enough. And then, can you just update us on how you\u2019re viewing the office - your office and industrial holdings. There has been some more mixed commentary on both sectors. I\u2019m just kind of wondering how you view them as part of the portfolio. And if you can just update us, I believe there is a change in personnel on the industrial side. If you could update us on who is managing that now.","John Case","So let me start with office and then we\u2019ll get into the personnel side of it. First of all, we do not actively seek office on a standalone basis. Office represents 6% of our rental revenue. Office has come into the company really in one of two ways, either through portfolio acquisitions, where 85%, 90% are more of the assets where assets that met our investment strategy or through relationships with major tenants where we had - for instance, a major retail tenant come to us and ask us to do a, say, leaseback on their office headquarters.","So if we\u2019re comfortable with the structure and the investment, we would do that for relationship purposes. So we don\u2019t intend to grow the office exposure. Industrial right now is about 13%. And we have a high, again, hurdle rate for industrial. We\u2019re looking for Fortune 1000 tenants, fungible buildings and significant or mission-critical building markets leased to investment-grade tenants.","So on the industrial-front, this change happened quite a while ago. But Ben Fox and Greg Libby now are the two people who head up our industrial effort. And they\u2019ve been doing that now for probably close to a year now.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about the strength of the 1031 market and what you\u2019re seeing there, and then just pricing overall with larger portfolios versus individual assets.","John Case","Sure. The 1031 market has come back and is strong. So we\u2019re seeing good bids in that market or aggressive pricing. I think if you took, for instance, a QSR property and put it in a $200 million portfolio. It probably trades at a cap rate that\u2019s may be 50 to 75 basis points higher than where it would if it were trading on its own, so there is an arb between where one-off assets trade and where larger portfolios trade. The pricing on the portfolios has remained consistent as Sumit really laid out in his opening remarks.","Nicholas Joseph","And how many larger portfolios, I guess, relative to historical averages are out there today to be acquired?","John Case","We\u2019re seeing - there\u2019s really been no drop off in our transaction opportunity flow. We had a very good quarter at $6.2 billion. And we were optimistic about the pipeline and continue to work a number of opportunities on our larger portfolios, some are one-off assets. But no change from our previous trend.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to RJ Milligan with Baird.","R.J. Milligan","Hey, guys. John, just on your comments on the casual dining sector, curious if you looked at the Bloomin [ph] portfolio, I think given your comments, maybe you looked at it, but didn\u2019t spend much time looking at it.","John Case","Yeah. We don\u2019t comment on specific transactions. I\u2019ve laid out the conditions under which we would invest in a casual dining portfolio. So I think I\u2019ve answered that.","R.J. Milligan","Okay. And, Sumit, you mentioned that you were seeing some non-investment grades going at the high 5s. I was just curious what kind of properties or industries those assets were trading at pretty low cap rates?","Sumit Roy","Yes. If you look at the QSR sector, if you look at even small franchisees, they are trading in that ZIP code and they are certainly non-investment grade. The other group that we see quite often are C-stores. They are very aggressively priced, some even in the mid-five ZIP code.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Vineet Khanna with Capital One Securities.","Vineet Khanna","Yeah. Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Can you provide some color on the makeup of that $352 million of first quarter activity? Specifically were there any single large deals in there?","John Case","Sumit?","Sumit Roy","No, if you look at our average per property, we bought about 109 properties. It\u2019s about $3.4 million. So it wasn\u2019t dictated by any one very large asset transactions. We had 19 independent transactions. There were certainly some portfolios we did. 52% of what we did was a leaseback. And I think in my opening remarks I\u2019ve mentioned that 67% of what we did were portfolio deals. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the volume.","Vineet Khanna","Okay, sure. And then just looking at a broader sporting goods retailer sector, can you talk about your general sporting goods retailer exposure, and then specifically your Gander Mountain exposure and just the health of that tenant.","Sumit Roy","So we look at the sporting goods industry, if you will, as the story of two worlds really. You got the very good operators in Academy and Dick\u2019s and to some extent Modell\u2019s and then you have the situation that we are seeing playing out in the public press with the Sports Authority.","With regards to - and those are the ones that we believe to be very good operators, they continue to do reasonably well despite the fact that they happen to be in a discretionary industry and are competing. But they do have the omni-channel strategy. So they do have their brick and mortars. They do have their Internet strategy as well. And they continue to produce very solid results.","With regards to Gander Mountain and what is our exposure there, it is - if I remember correctly, it isn\u2019t very high. And it certainly doesn\u2019t even come close to being in our top 20. So we do have a couple, but it\u2019s insignificant.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Tyler Grant with Green Street Advisors.","Tyler Grant","Guys, how are you doing?","John Case","Good. How are you doing, Tyler?","Tyler Grant","Good, good. Just want to pick your brain today regarding the definition of AFFO. So to start it off, most REITs in the net lease space, when they define AFFO they add back non-cash compensation. I understand the rationale given that AFFO itself is supposed to be a non-cash measure. However, given that the equity compensation represents a significant portion of management\u2019s compensation, do you think that it makes sense to add this back into the AFFO metric?","John Case","Paul?","Paul Meurer","Yes, I mean, Tyler we\u2019re not going to debate how we calculate this metric kind of in this forum. What I will tell you is, what we tried to do is provide great disclosure. And specific to that would be not only that how FFO is calculated in accordance with NAREIT, but then the adjustments that we think are appropriate to arrive at what we think is kind of a cash earnings per share number AFFO-wise.","And by laying out that disclosure very clearly we allow analysts to pick and choose in different manners. And certainly through the years many analysts out there have calculated CAD or FAD or AFFO or whatever they want to call it, in their own manner. And so we certainly understand if someone chooses to not include a particular category there, we just laid out what we think is the appropriate measurement of kind of a run rate for us of a cash operating earnings AFFO quarter-to-quarter.","Tyler Grant","All right. Sure. I appreciate the color. Moving on to the next question, regarding cap rates, all else equal, what would you say is the cap rate spread between AA rated assets relative to, let\u2019s say, BBB minus rated assets or tenants?","John Case","The cap rates are really driven more by the quality of the real estate and less by the credit. So it\u2019s very hard to answer that question and isolate it. But you can certainly have high-quality real estate leased to non-investment grade tenants that trade at cap rates that are inside of where real estate leased investment-grade tenants trade.","So we don\u2019t really get hang up on whether it\u2019s investment-grade or not. We start with an underwriting of the real estate and does it fall within our investment parameters which we\u2019ve laid out to the market.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Hi, guys, thanks. Just to hone in on some of the specific transactions that occurred, just three of them, if we could look at the carrying cap rates and lease terms, maybe get a sense of what the FedEx was acquired for CVSs. And then it looks like you sold some of the NPC assets, which I think are Pizza Huts. Just seeing if you can provide some color on that stuff?","John Case","Sumit?","Sumit Roy","Yes, so the FedEx was a forward that we entered into. And if you look at - obviously you\u2019ve got the blended cap rate of 6.6%. But I\u2019ll tell you, we are looking at FedEx 15-year deals in the market that trading in the mid-5s. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why if you look at what our development cap rate or yield was, it was in that 6.8 ZIP code. It is because a couple of our forwards came into very high quality forward transactions closed.","And John has mentioned this in some of the questions that he\u2019s answered that. That is a significant delta between some of these forwards that we had entered into as well as portfolio deals that we had entered into and the one-off market that we\u2019ve seen in today\u2019s environment.","So that\u2019s the response in the FedEx. You mentioned that we did sell a couple of NPCs. And you are absolutely right; those are Pizza Hut branded assets. That is something that we are consciously been going through and calling our assets on. I mean, assets that we believe no longer fit our strategic objectives we are trying to call them. And it wasn\u2019t a very big disposition quarter for us, but we expect to get rid of anywhere between $50 million to $75 million of assets through the year.","Todd Stender","And just for pricing for CVSs, looks like you picked up a few.","Sumit Roy","Yes. On some of the CVSs, we actually got them through a small portfolio deal, where we handpicked the assets that we wanted to close on. And we got them at very good cap rates, just given the fact that it was a portfolio deal. Again, if we were to simply go out there and flip out of those. I think there is certainly a fairly healthy spread that we would be able to achieve and those are very well located CVSs.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Karin Ford with MUFG.","Karin Ford","Hi, good afternoon. Just a clarification, you raised investment guidance, but you left AFFO guidance unchanged. And the reason why it was just increasing conservatism on credit issues in the portfolio?","John Case","No, it\u2019s really, Karin, driven by when we anticipate those additional acquisitions coming online. I think they\u2019ll be back-end weighted. So they\u2019ll have more of an impact on 2017\u2019s AFFO per share than they will this year. So given the fact that they\u2019re back-end weighted, the increase did not have a significant increase on what our annualized projected numbers were for this year. It\u2019s just a timing issue.","Karin Ford","Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then second question, do you have any update on potential store closures in your portfolio in the Walgreens-Rite Aid merger?","John Case","No, we don\u2019t. We really had very little overlap with regard to properties. We\u2019ve got 15 properties of Rite-Aid properties that are within a 2-mile radius of the Walgreens store. So we expect minimal fallout and overall excited about this merger. The average lease term on these properties is just under 13 years, so even if one were to be closed, obviously, Walgreens would stay on the hook for lease payments that period of time.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James.","Collin Mings","Hey, good afternoon. First question for Paul, maybe can you just update us, remind us on how you\u2019re thinking about handling the 2016 debt maturities, just maybe in terms of term and size and just maybe update us on the debt market pricing right now?","Paul Meurer","Sure. So you know the schedule, but basically we have a $275 million bond coming due in mid-September and only about $22 million of mortgages remaining this year in terms of maturities. So $300 million total, call it, on the liability side. Certainly, we\u2019re positioned liquidity-wise to deal with that, even if we did temporarily on the credit line or something of that nature.","But so it\u2019s not a big tall order if you will for balance of the year. So we are monitoring the market, we\u2019ve been generally pleased with our equity pricing as well as debt pricing, and debt pricing in particular, I\u2019d say it has improved over the past couple of weeks as that market settled in.","Today, we could do a 10-year somewhere around 375 all-in coupon, so that\u2019s very favorable 10-year debt pricing and something we would strongly be considering. But we\u2019ll continue to monitor the market how the stock price does and what the bond market look and feel like over the next handful of months.","Collin Mings","Okay. And I think, Paul, you\u2019ve indicated in previous call that maybe minimum size will be 250 for a debt offering. I mean just how comfortable would you get as far as magnitude as far as size of an offering?","Paul Meurer","I think, we would lean towards something larger to the extent that we could do something larger and provide more liquidity for bond investors today, we think on balance, you may get more favorable pricing in that manner. And by that I mean probably something $500 million area or more. But we\u2019ll think about the appropriate size at that time.","250, I would say historically was more of a minimum to provide that sort of liquidity, but I think the market is asking for more these days. So we would consider something more in the $500-million-plus range.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore","Hi, good morning, guys, or good morning out there. Paul, I want to follow-up if I could on that last question. And if you think more broadly about what you guys have, you have $650 million on the line of credit, the 275 bond, another $600 million, let\u2019s say of acquisitions.","So you have really more like $1.5 billion to $2 billion of capital needs for the rest of the year and I wish you would stay this way, but I don\u2019t think interest rates always stay low and I don\u2019t think stock prices always stay high. And I\u2019m wondering if there is more of a sense of urgency, even if you have to sort of frontload the balance sheet a little bit with a little bit of cash to do more transactions to clear some of this?","John Case","Hey, Rich, I\u2019ll start and then hand it over to Paul. If you look at the size of the company today, $650 million on the revolver represents about 3% of our capitalization. If you go back to the end of 2012, 30% of our capitalization was $250 million on the line. So given the growth and the size of the company, our relative exposure is no different than really what we\u2019ve done in the past.","And the balance sheet, as you know, is in excellent shape and by many measures it\u2019s in the best shape it\u2019s been in 10 years. So we have substantial equity. We did nibble away at the way at the equity through the ATM program in the first quarter that we didn\u2019t want to do anything substantive and dilute our current shareholders and over-equitize the balance sheet. So we\u2019re watching the markets quite closely for permanent funding and debt funding. But we\u2019re quite comfortable here and with our obligations for the remainder of the year. Paul, anything you\u2019d like to add to that?","Paul Meurer","No, the only thing I would add is that we\u2019re very pleased to have a larger line in place. And that provides great liquidity, not only the $2 billion size, but the $1 billion accordion expansion feature on it gives us great comfort relative to our acquisition efforts and needs, and allowing us to be patient and pick our spots on the permanent capital front.","Rich Moore","Okay. All right. Good. Thank you. And then the other question I had for you is you guys had mentioned a while back that you were using obviously this opportunity with your stock price having moved up and if you take a look at bigger transactions like a non-traded REIT or maybe another public company something like that. And I\u2019m wondering if you guys just maybe use a partner to do something little broader even and is that still something you guys are considering or pondering or is that kind of not really on the table?","John Case","Yes, Rich, this is John. You cut out for a second, but I think we got the gist of what you said. Our statement on these sort of questions is that we\u2019re looking at all opportunities in the marketplace, so private and public that make sense for our shareholders. And we\u2019ll continue to do so. So that kind of sums it up. I think I said that on the last call and don\u2019t really think to add anything to that.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, just one follow-up question for me. There\u2019s been some press articles about potential reforms to the 1031 law that allows the tax deferral of gains, maybe limiting that deferral amount or some outright repeals. Any thoughts on kind of what\u2019s going on in Congress, your sense of what may or may not happen there and any potential implications if there is a change to the market?","John Case","We\u2019re not anticipating any changes with regard to the 1031 taxation policies. So at this point, we\u2019re not concerned, Juan. Washington is unpredictable, but getting change through is often pretty difficult and takes a long time.","Juan Sanabria","Thank you.","Paul Meurer","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.","John Case","Thanks, Tracey. And we appreciate everyone for joining us today.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Janeen Bedard","Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s first quarter 2018 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer.","During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Forms 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.","John Case","Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We're pleased to begin the year with another successful quarter. During the first quarter, we invested $510 million in high quality property acquisitions and now over 50% of our rental revenue was generated from investment grade rated tenants. Our focus on quality is also reflected in our portfolio occupancy, which is 98.6%, our highest quarter en occupancy in more than 10 years. We reached this occupancy level, while achieving our seventh consecutive quarter of positive recapture spreads on properties released. We remain confident in the outlook for our business and are reiterating our 2018 AFFO per share guidance of $3.14 to $3.20, which represents annual growth of about 3% to 5%.","Let me hand it over to Paul now to provide some additional detail on our financial results. Paul?","Paul Meurer","Thanks, John. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Interest expense in the quarter was flat despite a higher outstanding debt balance. This was largely due to the $2.3 million preferred dividend expense we recognized in the comparative quarter a year ago when we announced the redemption of our Series F preferred stock. Additionally, we recognized the larger interest rate swap gain this quarter, which has the effect of decreasing interest expense.","Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.1% for the quarter. We continued to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and we project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2018. Our non-reimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 1.7% for the quarter and we expect non-reimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.","Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.79 for the quarter, representing 11.3% increase over the first quarter of 2017. Note that in the first quarter of last year, we recognized a $13.4 million non-cash charge related to the early redemption of our Series F preferred stock. As a reminder, our reported FFO does follow the NAREIT redefined FFO definitions. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was also $0.79 per share for the quarter, representing a 3.9% increase.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In early April, we issued $500 million in seven-year fixed rate unsecured bonds at a yield of 3.96%. The offering allowed us to term out our borrowings on our revolving credit facility and they fit nicely in our debt maturity schedule as we had no other maturities in 2025. Pro forma for the bond offering, the weighted average maturity of our bond is approximately 9.5 years, which is nearly three years longer than it was at the start of 2017.","Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with less than $80 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year and only $21 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver and our maturity schedule is very well latter thereafter. Our overall leverage remains modest. Our pro forma debt to EBITDA, assuming the annualized impact of our first quarter acquisitions, is currently 5.6 times and our fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.6 times.","So, in summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics. Now, let me turn the call back over to John.","John Case","Thanks, Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. As I mentioned earlier, occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the year ago period. We expect occupancy to be just north of 98% for 2018. During the quarter, we re-leased 55 properties, recapturing just over 100% of the expiring rent, which is consistent with our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2700 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.","Going to dispositions, we continue to selectively sell properties that no longer meet our investment criteria. During the quarter, we sold $14 million of non-strategic assets, achieving an unlevered IRR of 7.3% and a cap rate or leased property sales of 6.6%. We\u2019re increasing in our estimate for dispositions from $75 million to $100 million to approximately $200 million for 2018.","Our same store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2018. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant and history, geography and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties re-leased to 254 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.","81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.7% of rental revenue and in the first quarter, drugstores was our largest industry at 10.5% of rental revenue. We're pleased with the strength of our portfolio, which continues to perform well, especially relative to other types of retail portfolios, which had faced more significant challenges due to e-commerce pressures.","Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and\/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate successfully in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent US retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.","We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. This represents the highest investment grade exposure in our portfolio\u2019s history. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for retail properties is 2.8 times on a four wall basis, while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is also consistent with our levels of the last few years.","Moving on to acquisitions, we completed $510 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.2% cap rate. Virtually, all in the QSR and C-store industries. As a reminder, we disclose cash cap rates as opposed to GAAP cap rates. We estimate our GAAP acquisition cap rates would be about 0.5% higher. We were pleased with the quality of our first quarter acquisitions as 85% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade rated tenants.","During the quarter, we completed a significant sale leaseback transaction with 7-Eleven who is now our fifth largest tenant, representing approximately 3.5% of rent. 7-Eleven is the top global convenience store operator and provides very strong credit with an S&P rating of AA-. We previously partnered with 7-Eleven for their first sale leaseback transaction in 2016 and are pleased to continue the relationship. This transaction was done on a off-market basis and reflects the benefits afforded to us due to our size, as we are the only net lease REIT able to execute on an investment of this scale without creating tenant and history concentration issues. These properties are newer vintage and located in highly trafficked markets with significant population density. The average size of these properties is in excess of 4000 square feet and about two-thirds of the properties operate a quick service restaurant concept within the convenience store.","In addition to the quality of the real estate, we are pleased with the structure of this transaction, which carries an average lease term of 16 years and rent growth well in excess of our portfolio average with rents in lined with market rents. Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced 9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring 5% of the amount sourced. Our investment spreads in the first quarter move closer to our historical average as a result of the high quality of the properties and the strong credit profile of the tenants as well as higher capital costs. Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline in the current market environment, we continue to estimate 2018 acquisition volume to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion.","I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions in a bit more detail now. Sumit?","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. During the first quarter of 2018, we invested 510 million in 174 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 14 years. On revenue basis, approximately 85% of the total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 16 different tenants in 12 industries.","Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores and quick service restaurants. We closed 10 discrete transactions in the first quarter. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy of the opportunity source during the first quarter, 54% for portfolios and 46% or approximately 4.4 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 23% for the first quarter. Of the 510 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 5% were one-off transactions.","As to pricing cap rates, we\u2019re essentially unchanged in the first quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging approximately 130 basis points in the first quarter, which were just under our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield, less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.","As John mentioned, during the quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of 13.8 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.3%. In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target and revise disposition volume of approximately 200 million. John?","John Case","We continue to monitor the capital markets to fund our business. The pricing of our April bond offering, which Paul referenced reflects the benefits of having the highest credit rating in the net lease sector. We're well positioned to fund our growth for the remainder of the year as a result of our conservative balance sheet management over recent years. We have no bond maturities until 2021 and our senior unsecured notes and bonds have a weighted average remaining term of approximately 9.5 years. We currently have about $1.3 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit.","In March, we increased the dividend for the 96th time in our company\u2019s history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%. We\u2019re proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. ","To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company's performance to start the year and remain optimistic for the remainder of 2018. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders.","At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question now from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","I guess first off, just a question on the disposition guidance going up. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're looking to sell?","John Case","Sure. Just like last year, when initially we guided the dispositions for the year, 75 million to 100 million, we did the same thing this year, but as the year goes along, we uncover opportunities to sell non-strategic assets and we've had a couple of conversations that have led us to believe we think we're going to be closer to 200 million in dispositions. The types of assets are non-strategic. There's a casual dining portfolio included in that and some additional Piazzi stores and a few other types, but they're largely non-strategic and they're factored in to our guidance, even though they're a bit dilutive.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then second question is on industrial. You've previously talked about looking to grow that exposure. I'm wondering how much of the pipeline build as you looked at in the first quarter was industrial and with the M&A that's happened in that sector of late, how is the pricing there for us that's been affected, affecting your ability to still be able to buy industrial? Can you make deals work versus where you see your cost of capital?","John Case","Yeah. That's a good question, Nick. About 20% of the transactions we sourced in the first quarter were industrial properties and even though the 10-year treasury has risen by 50 basis points this year more or less, we've seen industrial cap rates continue to tick down by roughly 25 basis points. So it's been quite challenging for us to grow that part of the business and that's why none of our acquisitions in the first quarter were industrial properties.","That being said, given the activity in that sector, it does reinforce the views we have regarding the strength of that portfolio, just under $3 billion on our balance sheet. So we're pleased to have it, but at these pricing levels, it would be challenging to grow significantly, given our current cost of capital.","Operator","We\u2019ll move and take our next question from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.","Karin Ford","You\u2019ve talked about how you could fund your investment guidance with cash flow, leverage capacity and dispositions. You\u2019re off to a fast start here, it sounds like the pipeline is good. How are you thinking about expanding that guidance and using the ATM and\/or equity issuance now you\u2019re once again trading above NAV?","John Case","Well, Karin, the acquisitions are lumpy. So that's the word we've used to describe them. We've quarters at 700 to 800 million and quarters at 200 million to 300 million. We can't really extrapolate of one quarter and that's what we did change our guidance for acquisitions. We\u2019re still guiding to 1 billion to 1.5 billion for the year at this point.","As far as capital raising, yes, we could fund our growth this year. Our estimated growth without coming to the equity markets through disposition proceeds, routine cash flow and debt, the balance sheet is in great shape right now. However, we will look at all capital opportunities, including equity and when we need to raise capital, we will use the appropriate form in the form that makes the most sense for the company.","Karin Ford","My second question is going back to the M&A question earlier. Do you think that the Gramercy deal earlier this week was driven by the unique aspects of GPT\u2019s industrial real estate or do you take anything away with respect to the privatization prospects for triple net real estate generally.","John Case","Well, I think industrial was the flavor of the day. We've seen a lot of competition for those types of properties. I think Gramercy did a good job, I know, Gordon, we know Gordon well, solid company. We competed frequently with them, winning our fair share and losing some on property acquisitions. They put together a nice portfolio just as we have. I think that the Blackstone transaction is driven more by the fact that Gramercy is industrial rather than you it's a net least company. I think that addresses your question.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll move on to Nick Joseph with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. So just, if I think about G&A load, the last call it four years or so, you\u2019ve consistently run at this sort of 5% of revenue line in terms of G&A relative to revenues and your asset base has grown almost $5 billion over that time. How should investors think about, at what point you may or maybe you won't ever see further G&A leverage within the organization, as you continue to put out capital every year.","John Case","Yeah. So, we have held at 5%, which we've been pleased with in terms of G&A as a percent of revenues. I think we'll be able to hold that level for the foreseeable future and perhaps bring it down a bit more. Paul, you want to elaborate on that?","Paul Meurer","Yeah. Some of the additions of personnel over the past couple of years as we enter new property types and expanded the portfolio were necessary and we've invested in, I think, personnel and systems, which put us in good position to kind of support continued growth of the company without significant additions on the G&A side. So we're feeling kind of that curve coming, where I think a little bit more leverage will occur and we could see that number ticked down. Yes, for this year though and the near term is still around 5%.","Michael Bilerman","How do you think about the right organizational structure for a net lease company? I think with Mark's announcement, have a CEO, President, and COO, CIO, a Chief Strategy Officer, I guess it\u2019s going to be a CSO, CFO, and then a number of Executive Vice Presidents that feed into that. Just from the -- I recognize you\u2019re a big company. It just seems like a lot of heads for a net lease company in their senior suite where you haven't been able to get that G&A leverage as you've grown pretty meaningfully.","Paul Meurer","Well, we've got the lowest in the sector and over time, it has come down and we probably hear more comments as to why don't you continue to broaden your skill set and deepen your skillset, given the efficiency of the company. We don't have any positions right now that are not critical positions to the management of the company. So with Mark\u2019s addition, I think we'll be in a place where we've got our full complement of skillsets and it will be, I think, we'll be taking care of at the executive and any level following that.","I\u2019d cite that most of our peers I think are closer to 10% in terms of G&A load as a percent of revenues.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll move on to Jason Belcher with Wells Fargo.","Jason Belcher","Hi. Just wanted to ask about this headline I saw this morning about Sears partnering with Amazon to sell and install car tires, it\u2019s another retail sector that I think most people yesterday would have felt was fairly well insulated from pressures of online retail. Just wondering is this something that you've heard anything about from your auto parts and service tenants, something they\u2019ve sort of seen coming down the line or would this be more in the unexpected disruption bucket? And then if you could just remind us what your exposure is to the auto parts and service sectors please?","John Case","Yeah. So to the tire services sector, 2.4% of our rental revenues are represented by tires, the tire service. And then on top of that, we have about another 4% in automotive parts and automotive service and that's an area we've been fine with. We haven't received any immediate feedback from our clients on the Sears transaction as of yet, but that's a business that we like and that certainly is benefits from the trend of automobile miles driven continuing to increase in this country. So all vehicles will need tires, regardless of whether they're gas or EDV. Sumitomo is the parent of TBC and is a very strong company with an A- rating and stands behind those leases for TBC.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move on to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","I just wanted to dig in a bit more on the new position announced in the terms of the Chief Strategy Officer. I believe this is the first time you've sort of created this role. So I\u2019m wondering if you can give us a sense of what his role would be and does this signal perhaps you looking at this sector viewer exposed to maybe in a different matter to changing the strategy say for over the next ten years, does it signal you looking at potentially bigger portfolios or maybe even strategic M&A?","John Case","Well, it doesn't change our strategy. We believe that as the company has grown in size to be a $21 billion company with 5300 properties in 47 different industries, 49 states that it made sense to have a -- we've become more complex as well, but it made sense to have a executive level position dedicated to strategy. We'll continue to oversee our research and credit effort and continue to sit on the investment community and Neil\u2019s background is very well suited for this position. He'll work with the rest of the executive team, me and the board in formulating strategy going forward and I think it will be a more efficient process. So we're glad to have Neil in that role and he will do well, given the successes he had in the Chief Investment Officer role, but it does not signal any change in strategy for us. It's just a response to the growth we've had and that increasing diversification of our portfolio that we've had since 2010 when we were just a $4.5 billion company and today, we're $21 billion company.","Vikram Malhotra","And just in terms of sort of the portfolio itself, you do have the concentration now in two main sectors, convenience stores and drugstores, maybe just give us some thoughts of where you'd like that to be over the next few years.","John Case","Well, we're comfortable having strong sectors such as those be in that low double digit percentage of rent range. So, next quarter, we'll see C-stores, drugstores would be somewhere around 11% of rental revenues. We're comfortable with those levels. That being said, at times, we opportunistically sell some of the tenants within those categories, properties, when we have strong bids and that's a very liquid market for assets in those two industries and we often acquire a large sale leaseback transactions and did a 25 to 75 basis point cap rate, higher than what you see in the one-off market. So it's a good way for us to drive value, raise money and manage exposure, but we're comfortable with those levels, given the strength of those industries.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll move on to John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.","John Massocca","Given the increase in the disposition guidance and the fact that you expected to be maybe more strategic, generally speaking, what would you expect the mix on dispositions to be this year between vacant and occupied assets?","Sumit Roy","In the first quarter, it was \u2013 of the 13 assets, three were occupied, 10 were vacant. I do see a shift in that in order for us to get to the 200 million as John alluded. We are having discussions on the casual dining side and a vast majority of those are going to be occupied assets.","John Massocca","And then it\u2019s a little bit of a blast in the past, but can you give us a quick update on the former Gander assets, did you sell any of these properties in 1Q 18 or leasing of them?","John Case","Sure. So we owned initially -- I think it was nine Ganders and they represented less than 0.5% of our revenues. So it wasn't a significant tenant for us. At this point, we resolved six of the nine, three were re-leased at recapture rates just under 90%, the expiring rent. So we were pleased with those and then we are selling, have sold and have under contract to sell three more properties and then the remaining three we're in discussions on in terms of leasing with national and regional tenants. So that's where we stand on that and we're pleased with the outcome so far.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference. I will now turn the call back over to John Case for concluding remarks.","John Case","Okay. Well, thank you.

We are also introducing our 2016 AFFO per share guidance of $2.85 to $2.90 representing annual per share growth of 4.4% to 6.2%.","I will now hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.","Paul Meurer","Thanks John. As usual, I\u2019ll provide a few highlights of our financial statements for the quarter and began with the income statement. Total revenue increased 9.8% for the quarter; this increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth.","Our annualized rental revenue at September 30 was approximately $992 million. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $64 million. This increase was due to the $250 million 12-year notes we issued in September of last year and $250 million term loan issued at the end of last quarter.","As well as the lower amortization of mortgage premiums as our outstanding mortgage balance continues to decline. We also did recognize a non-cash loss of approximately $5.2 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter.","As a remainder, we enter into an interest rate swap on the new term loan we issued in June with led to the larger non-cash loss this quarter. On a related note our coverage ratios, both remained strong with interest coverage at 4.2 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.8 times. Both of these metrics are pro forma for the paydown of the credit facility balance with proceeds from our common stock offering earlier this month.","General and administrative or G&A expenses were approximately $10.9 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expense this quarter is approximately $70,000 in acquisition costs. And reminder that we include these acquisition costs in our calculation to both FFO and AFFO.","Year-to-date our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.3%. We estimate this 5% will remain our approximate one rate for G&A for the remainder of the year. As efficiencies in our business model continue to drive improving EBITDA margins. Property expenses which were not reimbursed by tenants totaled $3.4 million for the quarter.","Year-to-date our property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 1.5%. We estimate this 1.5% will remain our approximate one rate the property expenses for the remainder of the year. As these expenses have continue to come in lower this year with lower portfolio vacancy, faster releasing of vacant properties, lower property insurance premiums and fewer one-time maintenance expenses.","Provisions for impairment of approximately $3.9 million during the quarter including impairments on one property held for sale, one held for investment, and two sold properties.","Gain on sales were approximately $6.2 million in the quarter and just a reminder we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Adjusted Funds from Operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.70 per share for the quarter, a 9.4% increase versus a year ago. We again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter and now it equates to a current annualized amount of $2.286 per share.","Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we\u2019ve continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September, we established an ATM or at-the-market equity distribution program to offer and sell up to 12 million shares giving us the ability to issue equity capital on an opportunistic basis.","Through quarter-end, we had not yet issued any equity through this program. During the quarter, we did raise $152 million of equity capital through our direct stock purchase plan. And earlier this month we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering, we used the proceeds to pay down all outstanding borrowing on our $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility.","Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rates and continued to be rated BAA1, BBB+ at a weighted average maturity of 6.5 years. We again did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter and decreased to approximately to $695 million. ","Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $2 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due for the balance of this year and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter.","Currently, our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 28% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA ratio after the equity offering is approximately 5.1 times.","Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on these results.","John Case","Thanks Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, a 10 basis points improvement from last quarter. At the end of the quarter we had 74 properties available for lease out of 4,473 properties on our portfolio.","Economic occupancy was 99.3%, and occupancy based on square footage was 99%, increasing 10 basis points and 20 basis points respectively from last quarter. We continue to see an active leasing environment and expect our occupancy to remain around current levels for the end of the year.","We had leases expire on 95 properties during the quarter and we re-leased 97 properties. Additionally, five vacant properties were sold during the quarter, so our vacant property count decreased by seven properties relative to last quarter. 86 properties were re-leased to existing tenants and 11 were re-leased to new tenants, we recaptured 99% of expiring rents without any spending on tenant improvements as it\u2019s typical for us. ","We have a lot of experience in the theory of our business. Over the last 20 years we have re-leased or sold more than 2,000 properties with expired leases. Our same-store rent increased to 1.1% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date, we expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% this year and next year.","As many of you know the timing of our rent increases are irregular and will vary from quarter-to-quarter. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. So we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties, approximately 75% of our investment grade releases have been only growth that averages about 1.3%.","Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the third quarter our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants operating in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flow 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties.","The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at 13% of rental revenue. That was really not much movement in the composition of our top tenants in industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7% of rental revenue and drug stores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenues. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants.","This drops from 48% last quarter due to the completion of Dollar Trees acquisition or Family Dollar in July which is now rated BB. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and will be positively impacted by two pending acquisitions of our non-investment grade-rated tenants by investment grade-rated tenants. ","The store level performance of our retail tenants remain sound, our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties continues to be 2.6 times on a four wall basis and the median is also 2.6 times.","Moving on to acquisitions, during the quarter we completed $124 million in acquisitions and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. Year to date we had sourced $24 billion in acquisition opportunities and we are on track for our second most active year ever for sourced volume.","We remain disciplined in our investment strategy acquiring less than 5% or $1.1 billion of the amount sourced year-to-date. A large portion of the acquisitions completed so for this year occurred earlier than we had originally expected which had a positive impact on our 2015 earnings growth.","We continue to expect approximately $1.25 billion in acquisitions volume for 2015. Our initial guidance for 2016 acquisitions is approximately $750 million which possibly reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any large-scale transactions. ","I\u2019ll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?","Sumit Roy","Thank you, John. During the third quarter of 2015 we invested $124 million in 47 properties located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.9 years.","On a revenue basis 35% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 52% of the revenues are generated from retail and 48% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 18 different tenants in 13 industries; some of the most significant industry is represented transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and quick service restaurants.","We closed 10 independent transactions in the third quarter and the average investment for property was approximately $2.6 million. Year-to-date 2015 we invested $1.1 billion in 195 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with the weighted average lease term of 16.7 years. On a revenue basis 50% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial.","These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 18 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our health and fitness, drugstores and quick service restaurants. Also 35 independent transactions closed year-to-date, three transactions were about $50 million. The transactions will continues to remain healthy, we sourced more than $4 billion in the third quarter, year-to-date we\u2019ve sourced more than $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities.","Of these opportunities, 62% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 38% or approximately $9 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 36% for the third quarter. Of the $124 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 77% were one-off transactions. We continued to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over 46-year operating history.","As to pricing, cap rates remain flat in the third quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.","Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold eight properties for $21.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.2% and realized an unlevered IRR of 14.2%. This brings us to 22 properties sold year-to-date for approximately 52 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 13%.","Our investments spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 212 basis points in the third quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less the nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. In conclusion the remain confident of reaching our acquisition and disposition goals of approximately 1.25 billion and 65 million respectively for 2015.","With that I'd like to hand it back to John.","John Case","Thanks, Sumit. We\u2019ve been active on the capital markets during the year to need our capital needs. Year-to-date we have raised approximately 1.2 billion in equity capital at an average per share price of approximately $48.50. This includes the $517 million equity offering earlier this month at Paul mentioned.","Our balance sheet is an excellent shape with plenty of liquidity and financial flexibility. Our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive earnings growth while investing in high-quality assets. We increase the dividends paid this quarter by 4% on a year-over-year basis. We\u2019ve increased out dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%.","Our AFFO payout ratio in the third quarter was 81.4% which is a level we are quite comfortable with. The rapid our portfolios performing well and we are pleased with where we stand as we ahead into the end of the year and into 2016.","We continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size in the economies of scale of our net lease business. We believe our EBITDA margin is the highest in the sector at 93%. We continue to see high volume of acquisition opportunities and our balance sheet is an outstanding condition of exceptional financial flexibility to fund future growth opportunities.","At this time, we would like to open it up for question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, good afternoon guys. Just with your 2015 guidance, what factors are driving the still relatively large delta as we approach the end of the year and apply for the fourth quarter? I was wondering if you can give us a sense for what you expect dollar-wise for a percent in the fourth quarter?","John Case","So the large Delta with regard to FFO is a result of swap and the impact that has on FFO and we don\u2019t see that one in AFFO. So it is very difficult to predict forward curve. So you see that it did have a $4 million impact this year it could go down from there so you wanted to make sure we love to range bought out the handle, what we though would be reasonable in terms of movement there.","Juan Sanabria","And then any color on percent rent for the fourth quarter? Any expectations you're thinking about?","John Case","Over the trailing 12 months we\u2019ve received around 4 million in percentage rent, larger quarters are post quarter typically, fourth quarter won't have a large percentage rent we are not expecting the fourth quarter to have a large percentage rent figure in it. So but again those are irregular and we can give surprise as we were in the second quarter with regard of percentage rents. So go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","Just one more quick question on guidance. For 2016 the AFFO is actually higher than FFO. Is that related to swaps again? Because normally it's the inverse, at least if you look at 2015?","John Case","Yes, Juan it is related to that and Paul do you elaborate on that?","Paul Meurer","Yes, so one piece of that is the swaps and making some assumptions to account for potential non-cash gain or loss there. The other issue is less mortgage premium amortization because our mortgage balance has gone down significantly as you can see over time. And then the third piece would be a little bit less capital expenditures spend that we projected for next year ","Juan Sanabria","Great. A last more bigger picture question. With the Walgreens-Rite Aid merger, any thoughts on potential store closures, given overlaps that may be required as per the FTC and competition? And then do you expect the management team to maybe look at any real estate monetizations?","John Case","Let me take a crack at that one. Obviously we view the merger as a net positive for the company, we believe it's a credit and value enhancing event, Realty Income is likely to improve the credit quality, or definitely will improve the credit quality of the portfolio with an additional 1.8% at least of our rent becoming investment grade rated. S&P affirmed the BBB rating yesterday but did put Walgreens on negative outlook, which is normal in these M&A situations.","As you recall, when we bought ARCT we were put on negative outlook while S&P waits to see how you execute and finance the transaction. There will be no impact on our revenue as a result of the impossible divestitures, Walgreens will have the contractual obligation to pay the rent through the term. The pundits in the market over the last two days have estimated that anywhere from zero to 400 stores could be closed, so that's quite a range.","But on our Walgreens assets we have an average lease term of 13 years. On our Rite Aid assets we have an average lease term of nine years. And there\u2019s really little property overlap and the two portfolios of the 58 Rite Aid locations we own, 15 of those and within a two-mile radius of a Walgreens store and the average lease term is about eight years.","So we feel really good about that and we\u2019re pleased with both companies performance. We\u2019ll take our - depending on acquisitions between now and the end of next year, it will take our exposure - percentage of revenues from Walgreens up to somewhere in the high eights probably, right around 9%. But if we are going to have a tenant, that\u2019s a little higher that we typically like the concentrations to be. But if we\u2019re going to have a tenant there we like that it\u2019s Walgreens. And from a drugstore industry perspective there will be no change and our exposure will still be at around 11%.","Juan Sanabria","Okay, thank you very much John.","John Case","Okay, thanks, Juan. I appreciate it.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James & Associates.","Collin Mings","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","John Case","Hey, how are you doing Collin?","Collin Mings","First question for me, looks like that the industrial mix picked up a bit during the quarter, obviously relatively low acquisition volume compared to the last few quarters. Can you talk a little bit more about that? It looked like the FedEx exposure ticked up a little bit.","John Case","Yes, so as you know, the acquisitions compositions and amounts vary quite a bit quarter- to-quarter. This quarter we had 52% retail and 48% industrial and there was a FedEx in there. So we did check on some additional revenues from FedEx. It's going to fluctuate in the second quarter we had well in excess of 700 million in acquisition and we had quarters where they\u2019ve been close to zero and quarters where they\u2019ve exceeded billion dollars. It\u2019s certainly volatile.","But there's really nothing to read into that, when we look at what we\u2019ve done year-to-date 87% has been the retail and we continue to have 79% of our revenues come from retail property. So you are not going to see that number change much. So it's better than average and it\u2019s just relevant here in the third quarter. ","Collin Mings","Okay. And then I guess you touched on this in those remarks, but given the deceleration in the pipeline, again obviously some larger deals in the second quarter. You still feel pretty good about where your pipeline stands right now and not really any meaningful change in the composition of it? Is that fair?","John Case","Yes, that\u2019s very fair. We are going to have our third best year ever in terms of consolidated acquisitions. We are going to have our second best year ever in term of sourced acquisition opportunities. So there is a lot of momentum in the business and I wouldn't characterize this declining momentum might characterize the typical fluctuations quarter-to-quarter and acquisition volume. So again it's very difficult to predict, but we are certainly comfortable with where the business is and the momentum we have.","Collin Mings","Okay, and then as far as just on the ATM recognizing it is going to fluctuate depending upon where the stock price is, but what should we think about and how aggressive you might be looking to deal with that in any given quarter?","John Case","Yes, I mean we are probably be at 1% or less of our equity markets cap in a quarter, it's not something we're going to used to replace offerings with that it allows us to matching on their acquisitions, be more opportunistic with regard to raising equity and to fund that equity at a much, much lower cost than we do a typical offering, but we will continue to do offerings such as we did post third quarter end.","Collin Mings","Okay, that's helpful. And then one last one for me and I'll turn it over. Bigger picture, any changes to the watch list? Or anything else we should be aware of on that front? I know the last couple quarters you've referenced it being pretty stable. Just touch on that real quick.","John Case","Yes, it\u2019s pretty stable at 1.1% and not everything on there we\u2019ll end up selling so we are as you heard slipping inside, ramping up our dispositions a bit on what we had originally planned for this year from $50 million to $65 million.","We are achieving excellent results on our sales and these are \u2013 some of them have issues associated with them perhaps credit, real estate issues, coverage issues, industry issues and some we are just selling because we have maybe some concentration issues and you don\u2019t want to reduce our concentration levels, but the fact that we are able to sell these year-to-date at a 77 cap rate, 72 cap rate in the third quarter and achieved an IRR unlevered 14%.","I think kind of shows you the quality of our portfolio because we are calling off kind of the lower quality assets in general. So I hope that shows the market that we will get a strong portfolio if that's where those properties we want to dispose of the trading.","Collin Mings","Okay. On that point, as you referenced that cap rate, is it safe to say as you think about the 2016 guidance that you threw out there, that the dispositions that you look to complete in 2016 would likely be at a similar cap rate to what you've done here in 2015?","Paul Meurer","I would think so I mean we budget something little bit more conservative in the high seven and close to 8%, but again it\u2019s going to be a function of the macroeconomic environment and which is more than enough. We are able to \u2013 where interest rates in the macroeconomic environment will be next year.","John Case","But I think overall yes I think it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019ll continue to execute the levels we executed at this year.","Collin Mings","Great, appreciate the detail.","John Case","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","And we will go next to Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. The $750 million of acquisitions in 2016, what investment spread is assumed in guidance?","Paul Meurer","Yes, we are looking at cap rates that are probably right around what we are achieving now so they are consistent with \u2013 we are assuming there are no material changes in cap rates today. So assume those sort of high sixes area, in terms of spreads Paul you want to hit on that in terms of cost of capital. I think we will continued to be in the area north of our long-term average of 150 basis points or 140 basis points will be in the upper 100s maybe up to 175 basis points.","Nick Joseph","Thanks and then just going back the mix between retail and industrial in terms of the acquisitions. Do you expect a similar mix to this year.","John Case","Overall, I think that safe to say, again we see for more opportunities on the retail side and retail oriented 79% et cetera earlier about revenues are coming from our retail properties and do not expect that the change materially next year.","Nick Joseph","And then finally, can you touch on the initial cash cap rate difference between what you've seen for retail acquisitions and industrial acquisitions this year?","John Case","Sumit, do you want to handle that?","Sumit Roy","Yes, sure that\u2019s a very difficult question to answer because it definitely depends on the tenant, on the length of the leads on what kind of especially on the retail side on what kind of an asset it is, but if you what think in terms of an investment grade tenant with 15-year, 20-year lease with growth, they trade right around where in the same ZIP Code and it is very difficult to say that one asset class trade that higher price.","Now when you obviously translated on a price per square feet basis et cetera industrial we are looking at high quality industrial assets right around that $70, $75 per square feet ZIP Code and in retail once again depending on whether it\u2019s a Walgreen\u2019s or whether it\u2019s a similar investment grade rated lets called Dollar General they are going to have a different range, anywhere between 175 to 225 to 250.","Nick Joseph","Thanks that\u2019s helpful.","John Case","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.","Todd Stender","Thanks. For Sumit, for the properties acquired in the quarter, can you give us the range what the lease terms were? The average was 10 years, so that's in line with your existing portfolio, but to look at anything on the shorter side?","Sumit Roy","Yes, look I think we did have some in the high single-digits and a lot of them bunched around that area from the high single-digits around 13, 14 there were a couple of assets that had not 15-year lease that\u2019s part of the reason why we were able to get a slightly better yield.","John Case","You\u2019ll see sometimes in smaller portfolios you might have an average lease yield \u2013 an average lease term Todd 12-years but we are going to have some maybe seven, eight years and there certainly in larger portfolios as well. So we target 10-years and above its typically the natural lease terms range from 10 to 25 I think year-to-date but just under 17 years which is a good number for us. And that continue to focus on that in the long-term range in area to be in.","Todd Stender","That's helpful. Was it just the one FedEx you acquired in the quarter?","Paul Meurer","Yes, that\u2019s correct","Todd Stender","Okay. Can you help us with pricing? As a comp, what the cap rate was? Length of lease? And was this more of a FedEx ground facility?","Paul Meurer","It was the FedEx ground that we are not allow to give an specific details on that transaction were subject to confidential reality agreement with FedEx with regard to this specifics and pricing.","Todd Stender","Okay, no problem. For Paul, when you look at your cost of equity, certainly you have the overnight markets open to you. You have the ATM in place, although you haven't tapped it. But the direct purchase plan, you've raised a fair amount of equity this year through that. Is there a low-cost, like an ATM-equivalent cost, to raising that amount of equity?","Paul Meurer","Yes, its actually our cheapest form of raising equity, closer to 1% average cost there of issuance compare to an ATM with this going to be more like 1.5% to 2% and then your overnight offering there going to be more than that obviously. So it is a product that will remain and utilizing with largely with existing shareholders as well as part of that, their ability to reinvest. But not to any significant amount. As John mentioned we\u2019ll be doing a little bit of that activity in quarter going forward. But any larger equity raises would be dependent upon acquisition volume.","Todd Stender","Great, thanks. Lastly, when you look at the Rite Aid properties, if you were to assign a Walgreens cap rate to those going forward, do you guys look at it in terms of how much cap rate compression happened at one fell swoop?","John Case","Yes, I mean if you look at the market today, there's about a 50 to 75 basis points differential between where Rite Aid and where Walgreens would trade. So you\u2019ve got yield of anywhere depending on other factors 50 to 75 basis points higher on a Rite Aid and you got a Walgreens. So you expect that to condense based on Walgreens acquisition.","Todd Stender","Great, thanks John.","John Case","Thank you, Todd.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore","Hello, guys, good morning or good afternoon. Did you pull back at all on your acquisition activity due to the softness that we saw in both the debt and equity markets in the third quarter?","John Case","No, we didn\u2019t I mean this is just a function of the opportunities we saw that met our investment parameters. And there\u2019s a lot of volatility from quarter-to-quarter and the amount and quality of acquisition opportunities we see. So, we are very pleased with where our own balance sheet is. We got a lot of financial flexibility and significant liquidity. So we did not specifically pull back on the acquisitions activity as a result of some of the volatility we saw on the marketplace.","Rich Moore","Okay, great, thanks, John. I'm curious, Paul, on the bonds that you're doing or that you might do. Are these going to get bigger do you think? I think of you guys having $5 billion of debt roughly, that kind of thing, and 10-year laddered maturity. So I'm thinking of larger bond transactions when you do them. The last couple seemed smaller and I'm wondering are you going to carry more on your line of credit? Or are you going to do a bigger bond transaction going forward you think?","Paul Meurer","They may get bigger at times of course, as we get larger as a company, you could certainly see larger issuances certainly in the minimum of $250 million to be index eligible something we would always pursue. But at point in time when you go to issue the bond it really depends on what your needs are at that particular time. And if you don't have say $500 million cash needed at that moment, you are not going to issue $500 million bonds that\u2019s happened a few time.","And furthermore we haven't quite seen any pricing improvement having a slightly larger offering size. If we would start to understand that you get a little bit better pricing from the debt investors for a larger liquid offering, that something we made and pursue more.","John Case","Yes, it\u2019s been an interesting conversation we\u2019ve had and certainly something we\u2019ve studied Rich and that is do you get paid for larger more liquid offerings and certainly a lot of our fixed income investors would prefer those and say that you do. But when you look at the case studies available and we work with our bankers, you don't see a pricing advantage. But that being said larger company as Paul said, doing larger transactions. I think you\u2019ll see our average transactions certainly grow beyond $250 million. And you could see some $0.5 billion bond deals in our future.","Rich Moore","Okay, is there a negative to going to market too often? Like if you had to do $1 billion and you did four, one each quarter of $250 million, is that a negative?","Paul Meurer","If that was scenario, for example, I think the preference would be to do say, two $500 million rather than four $250 as your fixed income investors would prefer the larger liquidity in each particular issuance, but you can't always project what your needs are going to be in the state of the bond market, the acquisition deal flow timing and that sort of thing of course. ","Rich Moore","Okay, gotcha. And then I wanted to ask you guys, too, about development if I could. I'm trying to figure out exactly -- when I look at the supplemental -- exactly what's happening with development. If I was on page 13, you have investment in 18 development properties in the quarter. Then when you look on page 15, you have 11 properties currently underway. So I'm assuming seven were delivered in the quarter? Is that correct?","John Case","That\u2019s correct.","Rich Moore","Okay, and then as you look forward, that remaining investment on page 15, the $58 million, how should we think about the timeframe over which that's going to occur? On top of that, how many more we might add on a quarterly basis, new properties to the list?","Sumit Roy","Yes, so as of right now, as it says on page 15 we\u2019ve got $58 million of additional commitments to spend and based on the pipeline the next quarter we don't expect to add any new additional development so that number should remain pretty static of course we are going to stand off of that 50 and so you would expect that to go down. In the event, we do get back with some tenants et cetera with regards to redevelopment et cetera. That\u2019s the only reason why that $58 million will change.","Rich Moore","All right, so I should pro rata that $58 million over the next year? Or I guess it's through January, so I guess through the next quarter or so.","Sumit Roy","I have the run rate today, yes.","Rich Moore","Okay. All right, good and thanks guys.","John Case","Thanks Rich.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Dan Donlan","Thank you and good afternoon.","John Case","Hi Dan.","Dan Donlan","Hey. I was wondering if you guys could touch a little bit on the operating expenses and why that continues to come in below your expectations. Your recovery ratio seems to be fairly high relative to what it has been historically.","John Case","Yes, with regard to \u2013 are you telling that with regard to G&A or property or both.","Dan Donlan","Frankly both, but just on the property operating expenses, 1.5%, that's a lot lower than what it has been historically.","John Case","Yes, so really we realized probably $4 million to $5 million in savings due to fewer defaults this year and lower vacancy I think an improved stronger portfolio it\u2019s reducing our property expense obligations that the company is responsible for. We are also helping to drive that is much quicker resolution of lease rollovers improved our property insurance premiums as well to become a larger company with scale on.","On the G&A front, if you go back and kind of our headcount about three years ago we got some pretty significant additions and headcount and year after that they were fairly significant. And we are really positioning the company to handle the growth that we had anticipated and it would continue. Those hiring have fallen each year. We\u2019ve put really skilful people in place I think and having more efficient organizational structure and more efficient systems which allow us to have better G&A margin.","So there are some other items related to that, but that's what it's really about. So when we budgeted this year, we budgeted some headcount and did not end up having to add to the company which helped us come in at $2 million to $4 million below where we thought we were going to be on that item. So that's what really is driving the property expenses and G&A expense margins.","Dan Donlan","Okay, so you're not handing out jelly of the month club, end-of-year bonuses or anything like that, I guess?","John Case","That\u2019s right.","Dan Donlan","So just kind of curious, Paul, on the leverage. At 5.1 times on net debt to EBITDA, looking at my numbers, it seems to be the lowest you've been in quite some time. Is there any type of concerted effort on your part, or on the Company's part, to maintain a lower level leverage than you have over the last couple of years? Or is it simply a function of timing?","John Case","Its really a function of timing, I am not Paul obviously but I want to talk about this sort of philosophy. We are comfortable with the company two-third equity, one-thirds debt right now we are closer to 70%, 71% equity today little more conservatively capitalizing that saw an attractive opportunity to executed in overnight offering at pricing that would be attractive and highly accretive to our investments and we had a use for the proceeds and we want to precision the balance sheet and a very clean and look and ready to find our anticipated acquisitions going into 2016. So this is not a level, this is not a new level that really represents the change in leverage policy for us Dan just a average of the recent launch equity offering.","Dan Donlan","Okay, understood. Is there any type of -- is there any seasonality to 2016's acquisitions? Do you think they'll be more front-end loaded or more back-end loaded or ratably over the year?","John Case","Which we could answer the question this year we thought there going to be more back end loaded giving a couple of larger portfolios we will working on and when those tenants want into close and then two changed and all suddenly we went from expecting back end loaded acquisition here that switch to front end loaded acquisition here.","Its really difficult to predict, so in model right now we just add that 750 million based on a pro rate structure throughout the year. It wont happen that happen that way. There will be quarters where there\u2019s big numbers and there will be quarters where there small numbers. Unfortunately I'm not smart enough to tell you which quarters are going to be big and which quarter are going to be smaller.","Dan Donlan","Okay, fair enough. Then from a portfolio standpoint, has the private letter ruling that's gone away, the IRS or FCC or whoever it is, has said they're going to stay away from this stuff, this op-gov prop-co type of structure that people have done. Have you seen any increase in inbound calls to you guys because of this change in policy from the government?","John Case","Yes, we continue to be involved in a number of conversations on that front. We did interpret that as a net positive. Because if you are going to monetize real estate, the IRS has taken that stance, then you sale-leaseback, financing, transactions with companies like ours is the appropriate and best execution we believe. Has there been a sea wave of additional discussions? No, but there is been a slight uptick and we continue to be fairly optimistic that one or two of those will hit and be significant ","Dan Donlan","Okay, thank you very much, appreciate it.","John Case","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.","Chris Lucas","Good afternoon, guys. John, following up on a couple of the last questions, on the philosophy side, I guess I was wondering if you might be able to remind us what your thoughts are in terms of max category exposure that you would be willing to take and max single tenant exposure that you guys would take?","John Case","Sure, Chris. So what we\u2019ve said single tenant is that we\u2019re comfortable in the mid single-digit range, so call that count of up to 7%, under certain circumstances we would be comfortable going above that, but over the long run, we would like to manage that exposure back down because the diversification is highly important to us on our strategy. So you\u2019ll see that we kind of assuming that the Walgreens-Rite Aid transaction closes, we\u2019ll have a tenant that\u2019s in the upper eights in terms of percentage of revenues.","So that will be a tenant that we look very, very closely at it in terms of increasing our exposure in fact we would not want to increase that exposure unless there was just something exceptional in terms of an incredibly attractive investment opportunity and then we have discussions with our team here and with our board to see if we even wanted to do that.","On the industry side it's always been, kind of in the lower double digits, sort of 10% to 12% range and we want to remain in that area and right now we are in that area but the diversification is something that we think is important in our type of business.","Chris Lucas","Okay, and then you talked a little bit before about the spread differential between the Walgreens and the Rite Aid leases. Other than credit and obviously lease term length, but are there lease items that are also included in that price differential?","John Case","When you say lease items.","Chris Lucas","Go ahead, sorry.","John Case","Yes, there is more growth in the Rite Aid leases, and there is the Walgreens leases. So I don\u2019t know that's what you were asking about or not, but there are some minor differences in terms of the two types of leases but not major.","Chris Lucas","Okay. Then going back to Dan's question about the private letter ruling arena, have you guys looked at the infrastructure business at all as an opportunity that Realty Income might look at?","John Case","We are seeing so many opportunities and the investments that fall with our investment parameters today that's not something we are really looking at. We do have a group and team here that we're constantly looking at what other alternatives in terms of properties may makes sense for us to pursue, but we are really comfortable with where we are right now and we certainly don't have any plans to go into the infrastructure business.","Chris Lucas","Okay, and then last question, probably for Paul. On the EBITDA or coverage ratio, can you give us a sense of what percentage revenue is actually included in that calc?","Paul Meurer","What percentage of revenue is actually\u2026","Chris Lucas","Yes, I'm assuming it's not 100% of the revenue that you're collecting, right? It's some proportion of the tenants that report that information to you?","Paul Meurer","Well, I\u2019m sorry. Yes, I thought you are talking about debt to EBITDA ratio percentage.","John Case","Yes, so we get that information from kind of the majority of our retailers.","Paul Meurer","That\u2019s just under 70%.","John Case","70%. Yes, and so that\u2019s where that\u2019s coming from, so it\u2019s not 100% and it\u2019s around 70%.","Chris Lucas","Great, thank you, guys.","John Case","Thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen that does concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to John Case for concluding remarks.","John Case","Thanks, Aaron. We appreciate everyone joining today and look forward to seeing most of you in a few weeks at NAREIT. Have a good afternoon and thanks again. Take care.","Operator","And this does conclude today\u2019s conference everyone. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
