At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Aetna Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on a mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Krocheski. You may begin.","Joseph F. Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna's third quarter 2016 earnings call and webcast. This is Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna, and with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions. Karen Lynch, Aetna's President, will also join us for the Q&A session.","As a reminder, during this call we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC. We have also provided reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures in our press release and guidance summary. These reconciliations are available on the Investor Information section of aetna.com.","Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited, so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you, Joe; and thank you all for joining us today. This morning Aetna reported third quarter operating EPS of $2.07 driven by 10% year-over-year growth in operating earnings.","Underlying our solid third quarter performance, we grew membership sequentially by 143,000 members across Large Group Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. We grew operating revenue by 5% to $15.7 billion. Operating results in our Government business remain robust. We continue to drive operating efficiencies as evidenced by our 17.6% adjusted operating expense ratio and we achieved high single digit pre-tax operating margins consistent with our long-term target. We are pleased with our third quarter results which continue to reflect the solid performance of our core businesses. As we look to the final quarter of 2016, we continue to expect strong operating performance in our core businesses and have refined our operating EPS projection to $7.95 to $8.05 per share.","While performance in the quarter and year-to-date reflects many elements of our growth strategy. The main pillars of the strategy are: positioning Aetna to participate in key industry growth drivers, particularly in government-sponsored programs; leading the evolution of the provider model from volume to value-based care; and transforming Aetna into a consumer-centric company. While the Humana acquisition enhances these efforts, let me spend a few minutes discussing the progress we have made year-to-date delivering on these strategic pillars.","Beginning with growing our Government business, the performance of our Medicare business continues to be very strong. During the quarter we grew medical membership by nearly 50,000 members sequentially, drove year-over-year quarterly premium growth of more than 17% and produced solid operating margins consistent with our targeted range. We have also positioned the company to continue to grow in Medicare by expanding our geographic footprint, providing over 4 million additional eligible Medicare beneficiaries access to Aetna MA products beginning with this annual election period, improving our stars performance for the third consecutive year, achieving over 90% of membership in four-star or greater plans, best-in-class among our publicly traded peers, and introducing proprietary group MA exchange solutions that produced multiple group contract wins for January 2017.","Our strong membership growth in Medicare Advantage speaks to the execution of our growth strategy in Medicare. Looking forward, we believe we are well-positioned to carry this momentum throughout this current annual election period and beyond.","Shifting to our Medicaid business, from a financial performance perspective, our Medicaid business is having another good year. More specifically, in the third quarter we added nearly 50,000 members. We grew quarterly premiums by nearly 13% compared to the same period last year and we are on track to achieve our pre-tax operating margin target for the year. From a longer-term perspective, we continue to see opportunities for Aetna to grow in Medicaid. While disappointed by the results of our procurement efforts in a number of important Medicaid contracts this year, we have taken what we have learned from these experiences to develop a refreshed approach to our procurement process. Combined with our already strong capabilities in managing Medicaid members, particularly high-acuity populations, we are confident in our ability to grow our Medicaid business. Our recent selection to participate in Virginia's Managed LTSS and Nevada's Managed Medicaid programs, speaks to Aetna's underlying capabilities to effectively serve these populations.","We also continue to advance our efforts to help transform the Health Care System. Over 40% of Aetna's medical spend currently runs through some form of value-based care model today and we are making solid progress to achieving our 2020 goal of 75%. Our collaborations with health care providers span a wide spectrum of value-based care models, including joint-ventures. Our value-based care efforts are not limited to collaborations with physicians and hospital systems. Earlier this month, we announced that Merck will be among the first companies to participate in AetnaCare, an innovative approach which uses predictive analytics to identify target populations and proactively curate various health and wellness services that are available. In coordination with a patient's physicians and caregivers, the program will aim to support treatment adherence, ensure that critical support needs are met, and reinforce healthy lifestyle behaviors. We are also collaborating with Merck in a previously disclosed value-based contract for the treatment of diabetes. Through this value-based contract, Merck and Aetna will work to advance our common goal of helping patients with type 2 diabetes effectively manage their condition to enable them to maximize their number of healthy days.","Shifting to our consumer engagement efforts, we made meaningful progress in the quarter and year-to-date to transform Aetna into a consumer-centric company. Specifically, we continue to use our bswift platform to enhance the consumer shopping and enrollment experience. For 2017, members in many of our Group Medicare Advantage and Small Group plans will have access to bswift's decision support tools and intuitive user interface, creating a more user-friendly and analytically driven enrollment experience.","We also announced a collaboration with Apple combining the power of iOS apps and the unmatched consumer experience of Apple with Aetna's strong expertise in data-based wellness and care management programs. With support from Apple, we plan to develop several health initiatives starting with apps that engage consumers. We are excited by this opportunity as we continue to drive Aetna's consumer-centric transformation.","Before I turn the call over to Shawn to discuss our third quarter results in more detail, I would like to say a few words about the proposed Humana acquisition.","We began this journey over 18 months ago and despite Humana's Medicare star ratings performance, we remain convinced to the strategic and financial merits of the acquisition. The Humana acquisition will accelerate our three main strategic pillars, enabling the combined company to provide more competitive products with a more engaging consumer experience to help people we serve achieve their personal health goals. We remain committed to defending our acquisition in court and we are confident that we will close the transaction.","In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders, as well as those employees at both Aetna and Humana who continue to work tirelessly to plan a successful integration.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2016 outlook, and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2017. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Mark; and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2016 operating earnings of $734 million, a 10% increase over the prior-year quarter and operating earnings per share of $2.07. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by solid top-line growth, cash flow, and operating margins. I'll begin with some comments on overall performance.","From a top-line perspective, we grew medical membership sequentially by 143,000 to over 23.1 million and we grew operating revenue by 5% over the prior year to $15.7 billion driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership attrition in our Individual and Small Group Commercial products.","From an operating margin perspective, our portfolio of businesses is performing quite well. Our pre-tax operating margin was 8.5%, a very strong result and consistent with our target operating margin range. Our third quarter Total Health medical benefit ratio was 82%, a good result overall but one that continues to be impacted by the performance of our ACA compliant Small Group and Individual products. Our adjusted operating expense ratio was 17.6%, a 100 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2015. This year-over-year improvement speaks to our disciplined focus on managing our operating cost as we continue to grow our top-line. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second-quarter dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth and days claims payable were 57 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of about one day and a year-over-year increase of almost three days.","Turning to cash flow and capital. Year-to-date operating cash flows have been strong. Health care and group insurance operating cash flows were approximately 2.1 times operating earnings, driven by strong operating results and the timing of Medicare premium receipts as we received an advance payment in the quarter associated with October 2016. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter; however, we did return $88 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy.","I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our commercial fee-based business, which continues to perform well, we added 117,000 ASC members in the quarter driven by several new public and labor customers. This added membership, combined with fee yields, drove solid year-over-year fee revenue growth of 4%. Pre-tax operating margins also remained healthy continuing the trend from the first half of the year. In our Commercial Insured business, our membership declined by roughly 70,000 members in the quarter, primarily the result of attrition in our Individual and Small Group membership, directionally consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 83.8% for the quarter. This result reflects the continuation of medical cost pressure in our ACA compliant Individual and Small Group products.","Let me spend a few moments quantifying the impact of our ACA compliant products in more detail. Beginning with our Individual products, our third quarter Commercial MBR reflects ongoing challenges with these products, as well as an increase in the premium deficiency reserve to $85 million from $65 million at the end of the second quarter. Based on our third quarter results, our full-year pre-tax operating loss in our Individual Commercial products is now projected to be approximately $350 million, further validating our decision to reduce our 2017 exposure to these products.","Moving onto our ACA compliant Small Group insured products. Our underwriting results in the third quarter were pressured by the previously disclosed higher morbidity of this population combined with our updated estimate of 2016 risk adjustment payables which further pressured our Commercial MBR in the quarter.","While our ACA compliant products continue to weigh on 2016 results, we are confident that our strategic decision to reduce our footprint will reduce our financial exposure to these products in 2017. Based on year-to-date results, the majority of our Group Commercial products are performing largely consistent with our expectation for moderately increasing medical trend. As a result, we continue to project that our 2016 non-ACA core Commercial medical cost trends will be in the 6% to 7% range.","Shifting to our Government business; our strong first half momentum extended into the third quarter. We grew medical membership by nearly 100,000 members in the quarter including growth of 20,000 Medicare Advantage, 30,000 Medicare Supplement, and 47,000 Medicaid members. As a result of this strong medical membership growth, we grew our third quarter 2016 government premiums by nearly 16% compared to the prior-year period to $6.6 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total health care premiums. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, a very strong result driven by year-over-year improvement in both Medicare and Medicaid.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At September 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 53%, which reflects the debt financing that we completed in June to fund the pending Humana acquisition. Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $317 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $88 million, and excluding the funds raised from our debt financing in June, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash at the parent. Including the funds from the June debt financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $15.2 billion. Our basic share count was approximately 351 million at September 30.","Based on our year-to-date performance, we are refining our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.95 to $8.05 per share. This reflects continued strong performance in our Government business and continued focus on operating costs offset by our updated margin projections for our ACA compliant products. Our updated 2016 guidance also reflects our year-end membership projection of approximately 23 million members, with ACA compliant Small Group and Individual membership attrition projected to be the largest driver of membership movement in the fourth quarter. The balance of our 2016 guidance metrics remain unchanged and can be found on our guidance summary.","Looking beyond 2016, with the DOJ trial date set for December, we are now planning for a 2017 closing of the Humana acquisition. We believe the strategic underpinnings of the combination and the financial case remain strong. While development since we announced the transaction have altered some of the specific parts, the sum of these parts is still within our set of initial assumptions. We don't typically provide forward-year guidance on our third quarter call and will not do so today. However, with the potential for a 2017 closing of the Humana acquisition, I want to provide directional commentary on some of the notable moving pieces that are likely to influence our initial projections for Aetna's 2017 baseline earnings.","While we are still early in the forecasting process, we see a number of challenges in 2017. From an operating revenue perspective, these include the previously disclosed reduction in our individual public exchange footprint, the projected impact of the suspension of the health insurer fee, the projected impact of known Medicaid contract losses, and the projected impact of our continued strategy to improved margins in our Small Group ACA products. We project these top-line challenges will pressure our ability to grow operating revenue in 2017. However, we believe the Humana acquisition has the potential to mitigate these top-line challenges.","We also see opportunities in 2017, including the projection for continued above-industry growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage products driven by our industry-leading stars position, the projection that our reduced Individual public exchange footprint will improve the financial performance of these products in 2017 as compared to 2016 and the projection for year-over-year improvement in the financial performance of our Small Group ACA products.","In closing, as we begin the final quarter of 2016 and continue our planning for 2017 we remain encouraged by the strength of our third quarter and year-to-date results despite some meaningful challenges. We also remain confident that we can close the Humana transaction and are committed to realizing our long-term growth objectives. I will now turn the call back over to Joe. Joe?","Joseph F. Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","A.J. Rice - UBS","Thanks. Hello, everybody. Maybe just following up on Shawn's comments there towards the end of the prepared remarks. If you were to think about it from an operating income standpoint, it seems to me you've got some positive things happening like the elimination of your exchange losses and the potential for capital deployment either in buying Humana or restarting your share repurchase program. Alternatively, you've had some favorable PYD this year that you probably typically don't \u2013 at least don't guide for. Can you maybe \u2013 can we get you to comment a little bit about the tailwinds and headwinds as it relates to operating income? And your thoughts about that?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","I'm not going to, again, provide guidance on operating income on this call. I will just offer some comments though on what you said. You are correct. It's been our long-held convention that our initial guidance for any calendar year excludes the effect of prior-year development. That adjustment would be between $0.40 and $0.45 for this year, and at this point we have no intention to change that convention. In terms of the capital deployment, you are right. In the event that we will have some capital, whether that capital goes to the Humana deal or other uses is to be determined. The allocation of that capital is something that we still need to determine. As you recall, our first priority always with capital is to do something to sort of grow the business and add long-term value, and then we consider some of the other uses like share repurchase and the shareholder dividend. The final comment I'd make on the Individual business is I would not get so bullish to think that we are eliminating all the loss in that business next year. I think, we have taken steps to improve that outcome, but from where we've come on this, I do not think that that is something that one should assume at this point.","A.J. Rice - UBS","Okay. All right. Thanks, Shawn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Also I guess just to clarify the comment you made, Shawn, that you've got $0.40 to $0.45 of favorable development in the 2016 number. If we think about that $8 midpoint, is there any other adjustment to the run rate 2016 that we should think about?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","I don't think there's anything really material. Obviously we've had sort of a prior-year drag, but that's embedded in the individual loss that we've talked about. So I think that's a fairly clean adjustment.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","But that was a number, Josh, that we didn't have any capital deployment during the year.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. Right. So I mean \u2013 and that was sort of my next question is even if you \u2013 even if the deal doesn't close and you pay $1 billion breakup fee and you retire the debt with a 1% penalty, you're still going to end the year with, I don't know, $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion of cash, it sounds like, plus obviously any cash you generate next year. Is there any reason to think that at these levels share buybacks wouldn't be the first priority? Would you guys consider an accelerated buyback in a situation like that? Or how should we think about the timing of that deployment?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. Again, I don't want to lock in prematurely sort of to an answer on this. As I mentioned, our first priority actually with that capital at the parent is always to grow the business. Now having said that, I don't think it's unreasonable that there would be some degree of share repurchase next year with the use of that capital, but whether the magnitude of that, whether we do an ASR, a lot of that is still to be determined.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then did you quantify the actual revenue reduction on the health insurance exchange? Just sizing, I know, you're saying that you're not going to eliminate all of the losses, but is there even like a revenue parameter that we could say in terms of where you were this year versus next year?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. So the total individual block is projected to be about $4 billion of revenue this year. The on-exchange portion of that for 2016 that we're exiting is about $2.7 billion. There will likely be some additional attrition in the off-exchange business, but that is still to be determined. We're going to need to see how that plays out in enrollment, but I would think about the $2.7 billion as being the biggest chunk of what's going to happen year-over-year. It'll likely turn out to be a bit more than that.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just to follow-up on this Individual number. The $2.7 billion is what you're exiting, that's the 80% of membership that you talked about on-exchange walking away from?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yes. That is the 2016 revenue estimate for the on-exchange markets that we're exiting.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. And then as you think about the other exits out there and the growth, I'm curious in terms of the fact that you expect attrition despite the fact that others are leaving and then your price increases in it. Can you give us a ballpark? Like do you think this thing will be down from $4 billion to $2 billion? Or do you think it'll be down even less than that?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","I really can't at this point which is some of why we're not sort of getting out too far on guidance because this is one element of that for sure. But let me be clear. When I was speaking to attrition, I was speaking specifically to the off-exchange markets, where I do think we will see some attrition. Whether we \u2013 the degree of growth in the markets we stay in, again that is still to be determined as we go through the enrollment process. And as you point out, there's a lot of variables there in terms of other carrier exits, rate increases, and things like that.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","I'd like to remind everybody that we are not yet done with our 2017 operating plan. So we have yet to present that to our board and therefore not ready to give any guidance.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood. I guess just a couple of other directional questions on 2017 that hopefully you can comment on. First, the timing on the health industry tax, I think you had said for this year, just the way in the Commercial the way the premiums work, it was a $0.10 headwind. I think it's supposed to be a $0.20 benefit next year, so effectively a $0.30 tailwind.","Just wanted to confirm that that will be the case for 2017 and then reverse itself in 2018. And then just any comments on SG&A from a high level given that the \u2013 how we should think about SG&A leverage in the next year given the revenue losses? And that will be it from me. Thanks.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. So on SG&A, obviously in a traditional sense, leverage will be more challenged than it certainly has been the last few years. We certainly made good progress over the last two years not only on leverage, but in overall productivity gains within our SG&A. Obviously losing some of the Medicaid contracts, exiting these exchange markets, the level of SG&A activity to sort of right-size our business in proportion to that is something that's a key part of next year. On the health insurer fee, in concept you're correct. It turned out a little \u2013 we're probably a little bit closer on 2016 than your $0.10, so I'm not sure that's as big a pickup. Obviously we are going to have to start recovering the 2018 in our 2017 pricing just like we had to do back in 2013 and 2014. And we will be following, as of right now, the same process that we used in 2013 to begin to recover the 2014 HIF.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. On the Small Group business, would you be able to do any similar sizing of that business as you've done on the Individual side? I don't know whether you can break that out between, if it matters, between ACA compliant and non-ACA compliant. And maybe give us some sense of how much attrition you might be expecting going into next year.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Just in terms of sizing, that business is about 55%, I think, ACA right now. And that's a little bit higher than I think we were a year ago but not a lot. On overall Small Group, this is another one that's difficult to project. On the non-ACA business, a lot of that is renewing in December, so we need to see how that plays out. There's a large concentration of business there, but it is a little bit difficult at this point to estimate what's going to happen with the Small Group ACA block. And as Mark mentioned, that's something we're kind of actively working through right now.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then just somewhat separate, as you look at what you've got for January 1, has this been a \u2013 building on some commentary I think you gave last quarter, how would you characterize the 1\/1 enrollment process for this year?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Matt, it's Karen. From a national perspective, as I said last quarter, we saw lighter RFP volume just generally across the industry. We feel we're pleased with sort of getting our fair share in those new sales. We're pleased with our retention, which is in the high 90%s, but as I said on the Commercial book, we will not be showing growth there. It's a little bit different story on the Group Medicare side as I had mentioned previously. We had a robust sales season, robust RFP activity. We had strong sales there to offset one of our large losses. So we're pleased with the strength of our value proposition in the Group Medicare space as well.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, Karen. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","This is recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at [technical difficulty] (31:06)","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I want to talk about the Government business a little bit. Because couple of revenue challenges you talked about, the HIF and the declining footprint, are both positive from an earnings point of view. So it's really the Medicaid business contraction that's sort of negative from an earnings point of view. So I'd like to talk about exactly why you lost the states you lost, how many states are still in protest at this point, and so talk about sort of the overall revenue loss in the Medicaid business and in the Group MA business and that conversion. That has a significant positive impact on revenue. Can you talk about that impact on revenue for 2017?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. Let me just comment on the Medicaid business. Although we are disappointed in our recent losses \u2013 and I would tell you we are very confident in our overall capabilities in that business, particularly our integrated care management model. And I think that's evidenced by some of our recent wins in our LTSS contracts in Virginia and our Nevada Medicaid contract. One of the things that we have done is we've done a big analysis and a robust analysis of the reasons why we lost some of those big contracts, and I am confident that we are changing our procurement process and we are repositioning the way we write our RFP. So, relative to the Medicaid business, as I would say, we expect reduction in overall revenue next year from our losses, but I think we're positioning ourselves for future wins in that business.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Specifically, what is that revenue loss that you're expecting for next year? And what's still under protest?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","The two contracts, if I put in Missouri and Nebraska, would be about $750 million of impact next year.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then Pennsylvania is still being rebid.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","And then under protest \u2013 Pennsylvania bid is under protest and that's almost $1 billion in revenue.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And how do you expect the outcome of the Pennsylvania rebid to go for you guys?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","It's hard to say, obviously we put our best foot forward relative to the rebid and we expect to know sometime between now and the end of the year.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of the Group MA conversion? What's the revenue impact of that? When you lose national account lives, it's usually ASO fees and then becoming Group MA, that's a premium, a very significant premium for those lives.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. We're not giving guidance for 2017 at this point.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, there. One for each of you. First of all, when you guys announced that you were exiting a lot of your ACA on-exchange business, you'd indicated that you were seeing off-exchange. Is that still the case for a lot of those counties? And what's to stop adverse selection with your and others exiting on-exchange on the off-exchange business? And that's probably for Shawn. And then \u2013 or Mark. And then, Mark, do you have any idea of how we could fix the ACA? What do you need to see to get back it?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Well, Christine, we will be staying in off-exchange, but in a much reduced footprint that allows us the capability should the regulations and the law get right in order to reenter exchanges. But that probably won't be much before \u2013 it won't be before 2019, more likely 2020. What needs to change is largely around the risk adjustment mechanism. Right now we have a risk adjustment mechanism that has a centering point on the average population in the pool. The population in the pool is largely people who are too young for Medicare, chronically ill and older. And until that changes, the center point is probably 10% to 15% below breakeven.","So if you look at industry losses based on the revenue associated with it, they pretty much track to that number. So what we have in a zero-sum risk adjustment mechanism is a mechanism that takes people who are losing less money and taking that money and giving it to people who are losing more money, so everybody loses the same money. And until that mechanism changes, or until the pool substantively changes, we're going to find ourselves in a premium spiral that's going to continue to drive rates up, good risk out, and ultimately create a very bad risk pool for the overall mechanism.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","So when you announced that you were exiting on-exchange, I thought your press release indicated, and I could be wrong, that you were staying in the majority of your off-exchange counties and areas. Did that change since the press release? Or am I misremembering?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Christine, what you have is a reduced number of, plus a pretty substantially reduced number of plan offerings in those geographies, as well as a much-reduced marketing presence in those geographies. So we expect that will serve to mitigate some of the pressure that we've had there this year. Conceptually in any given market, could there be more anti-selection to hit that book? Of course. I mean this book has proven difficult to predict over the last three years. The thing I would say is behind our decision-making here, this was really about risk management and we wanted to reduce the capital commitment behind this business, we wanted to reduce the losses and frankly we wanted to reduce the variability in outcome of those losses in terms of, sort of, establishing that footprint and what the plan offerings are.","So if you were to look at our off-exchange footprint, the reason we had to announce by August 15 was that the off-exchange markets we were withdrawing from, particularly the types of products, would presage our inability to maintain on-exchange presence. So that's sort of the way to look at it. Our off-exchange product offerings and markets sort of gave a heads up to everybody who is calling the insurance department every month that we were going to be pulling off of on-exchange markets by September 23.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. So we have a lot of markets that were in off-exchange, but we're not talking about it. That's reduced marketing presence \u2013 market presence \u2013 marketing. And then we're going to have fewer plans. Is that the right way to think about it?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Just wondered if you could maybe give us five enrollment numbers. And then I had a clarification too. But on the enrollment, if you could just run us through \u2013 I'm sorry, ACA compliant on- and off-exchange, Individual, non-compliant Individual, and then same for Small Group, compliant and non-compliant?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Okay. So virtually all of our Individual business is ACA compliant. In the third quarter, we have about 775,000 members on-exchange and about 270,000 off-exchange. In terms of Small Group, we have about 1 million risk members total in Small Group and about 550,000 of those are a Small Group ACA.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then my clarification was the $350 million loss. That's a net income figure or a pre-tax figure?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Pre-tax.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Pre-tax. And that's only for the compliant business both on and off which is essentially all your Individual?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","That's correct.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Just wanted to stick on Small Group for a second and can you also just sort of walk us through where you estimate the Small Group margins are now going to trend for 2016 and if you can break that out between off and\/or ACA compliant and not, that would be great. And then just the follow-up would just be around the pricing environment for Small Group for next year and how competitive you see it for next year or not, and sort of, the potential to push up the margins in the context of the pricing for next year?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","If you thought about our Small Group business, you should really think about it in three blocks, if you will. There is the 51 to 100 business that is not subject to ACA. Margin wise, that business is fine, at target margins, maybe even a hair better. We also have the 2 to 50 that is to keep what you have that is not in the ACA yet. That business is performing fine. So the only one that is off is the Small Group ACA business and that business is probably running a modest pre-tax loss for 2016. I would say low single-digits is the way that looks right now. The pricing question is a difficult one to answer in the sense that if you're dealing with selection issues as we saw this year, the traditional pricing lever that works in stable environments doesn't always have the desired effect. So I would say at a high level, the pricing environment has been fine. But I think the issues with the Small Group ACA block require things other than pricing in order to potentially improve the outcome there.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","So, I would just comment that we continue to see a deterioration in the risk pool for Small Group ACA and although that \u2013 there's been a lot of struggles in this segment, we are seeing sort of the better risk looking at alternatives. So we are offering alternative product funds. (41:51) We also are seeing that book move to PEOs and the good news is, we have products in both of those areas to offer those Small Group ACA clients.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Karen, any view on why the Small Group risk pool is getting worse here? Obviously we're not seeing the Individual pool getting any better so we know that it's not that you're having a favorable Small Group risk sort of swap into Individual. So any sense on why that pool is deteriorating as well?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","It is operating very similar to the Individual ACA book, and it is in certain geographies, as I've talked about before, so it's not widespread, so we're seeing it emerge, but I would say that we've got very good targeted strategies to really \u2013 you have to really understand all the risk dynamics and we've got very good target strategies to address that, including pricing.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to follow-up on the changes you mentioned in the way you approach Medicaid procurement. In your mind, is there anything about the capabilities of your Medicaid platform that need to be fixed or enhanced or is the issue more just about the way you actually write the contract and the submission in terms of getting a good score?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","We're really confident in our capabilities and our integrated care management model is stellar. We believe it is a very strong model. I think as I mentioned, as evidenced by some of our recent wins, and really I think, is a fundamental process of changing the way in which we go about procurement and we've got leadership very focused on working that activity.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. Michael, let me support that even more. When you think about \u2013 we have consistently been able, once we have these contracts, to sort of deliver improved quality, lower costs and for all of you, target margins. And I would just look at what we were able to do in Kentucky in terms of turning that around. Karen mentioned sort of some independent scoring of our care model by CMS. So when we have this business, I think, it is indisputable that we have the capabilities to create good outcomes. So going back to Karen's point, this is a front-end procurement issue that we need to focus on.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","And were you able to make any of these changes for your rebid in Pennsylvania?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Yes, we were.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. I just was hoping to get some additional clarification on the $350 million of losses in the Individual book. I'm assuming it's split between both the off- and the on-exchange but can you give us a sense for how it's split between the two? Is a majority \u2013 a vast majority of it in the on-exchange, which I think it is? But then more importantly when we look to next year in the residual off-exchange book, do you think the losses there will get worse or will they go down? Thanks.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Two things. One is, there is substantial loss in that $350 million on both on- and off-exchange. Proportionate to the membership, it is a bit more disproportional to the off-exchange on a per-member basis but both sides of that equation are making up large components of the $350 million loss. Obviously, it's our intent to decrease the loss on that off-exchange business. The variable in that, though, is still to be played out through the enrollment process in terms of what levels of volume we get or don't get on that business.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","We used four factors to try and size our participation for next year. One was the amount of capital at risk in any given market. We have seen in some states a fairly significant shift from 2015 to 2016 in the financial performance of those businesses. Secondly, we use the competitive frame, how many people are in the market. When you're the last one left in the market, you get all the risk and there isn't any risk to share. The third was whether or not we could continue to offer a broad enough product offering without putting that much capital at risk, including the sizable loss in any one given market. And the fourth was regulatory framework within the market itself.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the operating expense picture, can you comment perhaps on maybe the factor or factors that have been most contributory to your savings? Second part of that would be to what extent has the operating expense margin benefited from a shift in mix toward government business? And then, third, are there any perhaps major initiatives that are on hold per se pending the Humana deal?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","I'll take the first couple and then turn it to Mark, but you're right, Dave, and we can follow up with the specifics. As we've grown government that has a lower expense ratio, so that's helped but make no mistake, we have a pretty concerted effort to improve productivity throughout the company. That's been in place for a couple of years now. It's in some way still ramping up, but as I mentioned in our previous call, I think you're beginning to see the fruits of that initiative this year in terms of where we are on the maturity.","So the kinds of things we're doing through that effort are not temporary hold-backs of spending. They are things that both improve the quality of the end product to the customer, but also make us more efficient. So when we grow, this is a high fixed expense business, so we always get some form of leverage. That has helped. This productivity initiative has also contributed significantly to that as well.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","And I think it's that productivity initiative that feeds into the integration discussion we're having with Humana. The work we're doing is value stream Six Sigma-level work where we're taking each business process and the employees in that process to evaluate and develop a better customer experience, and we've seen a lot of that happen in Medicare already, which is yielding a high outcome on our stars ratings, and we continue to move that across the business. We are not fully embedded.","As it relates to the Humana transaction, there are a number of opportunities that we view as earlier wins for us in expanding to more markets. However, that is not putting our own expansion efforts on hold. We continue to do the work that we expected to do in anticipation of our plan as it was before we did the Humana transaction. We are looking at some systems investments as opportunities with Humana, but you have a tradeoff. We may get some benefits out of the Humana acquisition in the way of technology investments, in the way of program investments, but we're also going to have to make investments in the company, in Humana in fixing things like the large commercial business, et cetera. All of that tradeoff is really a deployment of capital discussion, and quite frankly in the end, we're continuing to move ahead with our plan as if the Humana acquisition didn't happen.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Got it. If I could just clarify on a membership question. So for Karen, if I understand your response to an earlier question, the national accounts is essentially a push in terms of high retention but also limited activity in new sales and then group MA is also a push, good sales activity offsetting a conversion. Do I understand that correctly?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","I would say that you should see modest growth in group Medicare and then we'll have less attrition in national accounts than we did last year.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lance Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Could you just give an update on for prior period development, how much of that was in the government space and Medicaid specifically? And then related to that, strategically, what's your appetite in the Medicaid space and what capabilities would you be looking at if you were to ultimately do some strategic capital deployment there?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Lance, we don't disclose specifically prior-period development and\/or even by product. What I would tell you is that all three of our major product lines, commercial Medicare and Medicaid, all experienced favorable development in the quarter with that mainly being attributable to second quarter. Again, the Medicaid discussion is one that goes back to our prior discussion, which is from a core capability standpoint, in terms of when we have these contracts, I think our track record is actually very good in terms of the results. So this continues to be about the procurement side of this, and we're certainly going to attack that organically because we think it's something that we can and should be able to fix.","Lance Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. And if you were looking at any of the capabilities on the LTC side or some of the PBM aspects of that, would any of those do you feel are lacking?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Certainly, our LTSS performance actually even in procurement to some extent but even the business we have has actually been very good. So I probably would say, at this level of discussion, I couldn't think of anything there.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah, I would just echo Shawn's comments there. I think our underlying performance of our capabilities is strong in our Medicaid business.","Lance Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Great. Thanks. Sorry about that earlier. I guess two questions; first, it sounds like the individual business has gotten worse, but you're exiting a lot of the markets. Would you say that the deterioration is more skewed towards either the business you're staying in or the business that you're leaving?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","It is worse, and I would say that it's difficult to say whether off of one quarter I wouldn't want to make a directional comment out of this. I think we still feel \u2013 Mark described a framework before that we use to assess this from a business perspective and that framework was really more of an enterprise risk management framework than it was a market-by-market seriatim buildup. So I think looking at it today, I think we still feel good about trying to stay in the box that we established for next year. Having said that, we really need to go through the enrollment process and see how each of these markets on- and off-exchange play out.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Remember we're still working off of weekly data, which is incomplete and has a lot of potential movement in it. So these are estimates still at this point in time.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then you mentioned before that, obviously, you're not going to be able to get rid of all the exchange losses, but if we said that you were going to exit, I guess, call it 70% of your revenue, and let's just assume it meant 70% of the losses on the exchanges, are you talking about the fact that you're going to keep 30% of the losses or that even on that 70% of the losses, those don't all go away because it's fixed cost? If it's the latter, how do we think about the retaining of the fixed cost infrastructure?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Until we see enrollment, we're not really going to get too far with assessing what the loss will be. We made estimates off of the current book of business, which by the way turned over almost 55% this last year. We had a certain frame of competitors in each market, which has already changed. More people have left the exchanges since we have. And so until we get a look at what the membership looks like, we're not going to really be able to nail the number with any degree of certainty. We certainly did it to reduce fairly dramatically the amount of capital we had at risk and the amount of losses we would sustain. Negative returns on invested capital are not sustainable over the long term and so we tried to reduce both.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then maybe just last question. Throughout the year, it sounds like the government businesses made up for the fact that there's been pressure on the ACA compliant businesses throughout the year. Are you still able to characterize both Medicaid and Medicare as kind of in your target margin ranges? Would it be fair to say that they're now at the higher end of that range? I guess trying to think about directionally could we expect maybe a reversion in the government book next year or are we right where you would expect?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Well, if you look at how we've deployed the health insurance fee change, we have a number of markets that are at the MLR limit, so we were able to give those more in benefits and to preserve margins in the business. But there are only so far you can go. So that should help our growth come January 1. There are other markets where we were not necessarily performing up to oil (56:00) and we had to correct those. But all-in-all what we tried to do was make sure that we weren't having to pay rebates that we made sure that we gave those back in benefits to seniors. We preserved margins and we kept as many zero premium plans as possible.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks.","Joseph F. Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin.

While space for in-person attendance is limited, a live webcast will be available. Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in nonpublic forums is limited. So we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you, Joe, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $2.71 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 17% and a strong start to the year. Underlying our first quarter performance, we exceeded our previous membership projections, ending the quarter with approximately 22.4 million medical members. We reported adjusted revenue of $15.5 billion, led by strong year-over-year growth in government premiums, which now represent over half of total health premiums.","Medical cost trends remain moderate, and we experienced favorable prior-year's reserve development across all of our core products in the quarter. We achieved an adjusted pre-tax margin above the high end of our target range. We delivered strong performance in our core businesses, allowing us to absorb continued pressure in our individual commercial products, which included establishing a $110 million PDR and we generated approximately $980 million in health care and group insurance cash flow during the quarter.","Based on our strong start to 2017, today we have updated our full-year 2017 guidance. We established a year-end medical membership projection of approximately 22.2 million members. We now project we will generate approximately $61 billion of adjusted revenue, compared to our previous projection of approximately $60 billion to $61 billion. And we increased our adjusted EPS projection to a range of $8.80 to $9 per share, up from our previous projection of at least $8.55.","In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our first quarter results and updated 2017 guidance. But first, I would like to reemphasize Aetna's mission and strategy as well as highlight some of our operational accomplishments in the quarter. A number of years ago, we defined Aetna's mission as building a healthier world. With that clear mission in mind, we set Aetna on a strategic course to position the company to be the health partner of choice for the people we serve.","While some aspects of how we achieved this strategic objective have evolved, the primary tenets have remained constant: help transform the health delivery model to one that is focused on value and improved outcomes, and delivering more consumer-oriented experience for our members to enable them to achieve their personal health ambitions. We made significant progress on these fronts in 2016 and have carried that momentum into 2017.","During the quarter, we continued to develop new value-based care collaborations across a wide spectrum of models as we continue to meet providers where they are. We also made additional strides in bringing our 2016 joint ventures online. Our more mature VBC models continue to demonstrate reductions in medical costs relative to the marketplace, while improving outcomes across a number of metrics including decreasing avoidable surgical admissions, increasing generic prescribing, and improving the monitoring of patients' medication therapies after a heart attack.","We also made new strides in our consumer efforts in the quarter, specifically, we rolled out our Bswift platform in a number of new geographies. We advanced our analytical capabilities and predictive modeling tools, and we continue to evolve our care models to help drive healthcare delivery deeper into local communities and closer to home.","The favorable impact of these efforts is evidenced across several objective measures including industry-leading Medicare Star Ratings, strong quality scores across a number of measures in Medicaid, including NCQA quality measures, and above industry average growth rate in individual Medicare Advantage, and strong adjusted pre-tax margins that have consistently been in our target range of high single digits. We are pleased with our continued progress toward achieving our strategic goals and company mission. I am confident that our recent progress and continued investment will position Aetna to be the health partner of choice for people to achieve their personal health ambitions.","Moving on to operational highlights. Let me begin with our Government business, which continues to be the predominant driver of our growth story. We had another strong quarter in our Medicare business, with membership growth driven by individual Medicare Advantage products. Our industry-leading Star Ratings and positive brand recognition continue to resonate with Medicare consumers, as evidenced by our nearly 13% sequential individual MA membership growth, which once again exceeded overall Medicare age (7:30) program growth.","In total, including Medicare Supplement, we have grown to serve 107,000 additional Medicare members in the first quarter, capping another strong annual election period for the company. While group Medicare Advantage membership was down modestly in the quarter, we are very confident in our ability to grow in group MA next year based on early 2018 pipeline conversions.","Continuing on with our Government business. Medicaid delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth and underwriting margin performance. Aetna served nearly 2.4 million Medicare members at the quarter end, an increase of approximately 62,000 from the same time a year ago. As a result of our focus on improved member outcomes, we are confident that Aetna's well positioned to take advantage of the strong growth dynamics in Medicaid, as states continue to look to the private sector to manage the health of their Medicaid beneficiaries.","Aetna's strong positioning and the demographic supporting Government revenue growth make it one of the most compelling opportunities for the foreseeable future. With that as backdrop, we have incorporated into our updated 2017 projections an increase in targeted investment spending to drive increased government-sponsored growth. A portion of these investments reflect known 2018 group MA wins to date, with additional investments to drive increased Medicare membership growth in 2018 and beyond, including the continued expansion of our geographic footprint.","In Medicaid, we see opportunities to continue to drive growth based on a strong RFP pipeline. Moving forward, we will continue to look for additional opportunities to make further investments that will prudently accelerate our growth in Medicare and Medicaid in order to serve more of these growing populations.","Shifting to our group Commercial business. Our large group Commercial products performed well in the first quarter, achieving top and bottom line results that exceeded our initial expectations. We maintained stable membership in our U.S. large group Commercial products during the quarter, and medical cost trends for insured products remain moderate and largely consistent with expectations. Our Commercial ASC and fee-based businesses also performed well, as the 2016 momentum observed in this business carried into 2017. As we look to the remainder of the year, we remain confident we will grow our large group Commercial ASC membership.","In summary, we are off to a good start to 2017. Our strong start to the year has enabled us to increase guidance and make investments that we believe will position Aetna to achieve our long-term growth objectives. I want to thank all of our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders. With the momentum from the first quarter, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in a changing healthcare marketplace, that the investments we are making will position Aetna to succeed as a health partner of choice for the people we serve, and we can achieve our updated 2017 adjusted EPS projection of $8.80 to $9 and drive long-term sustainable growth.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our first quarter results and our updated 2017 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $939 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.71. These results represent year-over-year growth of 14% and 17%, respectively, and continue to be supported by strong cash flow, balance sheet and adjusted margins. I'll begin with some comments on overall performance.","Our medical membership of 22.4 million is approximately 100,000 higher than the top end of our previously projected range for March 31, driven by better-than-anticipated Commercial ASC growth and lower-than-projected Medicaid membership declines.","Adjusted revenue was $15.5 billion, a modest year-over-year decrease, driven by lower membership in our ACA-compliant individual and small group products and the 2017 suspension of the health insurer fee. These dynamics were partially offset by higher Commercial premium yields and membership growth in our Government business.","From an adjusted pre-tax margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our adjusted pre-tax margin was 10%, a strong result and above the high end of our target adjusted margin range. Our first quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 82.6%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable prior years reserve development. We achieved this result despite the impact of a $110 million premium deficiency reserve associated with our individual Commercial products.","Our adjusted expense ratio was 16%, a 200 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2016, driven primarily by the suspension of the health insurer fee in 2017 and execution of our expense management initiatives. Relative to our previous projections, this metric benefited in the quarter from the timing of previously planned spending, which we now expect to occur during the remainder of the year.","From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-years reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products primarily attributable to fourth quarter 2016 dates of service. And our days claims payable were 53 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential decrease of approximately one day.","Turning to cash flow and capital, healthcare and group insurance cash flows were approximately $980 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we initiated a $3.3 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which retired 20.9 million shares. We returned approximately $88 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. We also announced the doubling of our quarterly shareholder dividend which took effect last month. In short, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the continued successful execution of our strategy to become a more consumer-focused company.","I will now discuss the key drivers of our first quarter results in greater detail. Beginning with our Government business, we delivered another solid quarter, continuing our momentum from 2016. We grew our first quarter 2017 Government premiums by over 9% compared to the prior-year period, achieving a quarterly record of $7.1 billion. This quarter marks the first time our Government premiums have exceeded our Commercial premiums. From a membership perspective, we grew by 107,000 Medicare members, led by growth of 99,000 in individual Medicare Advantage.","Medicaid membership declined by 90,000 members in the quarter related to our exit of the Nebraska Medicaid contract at the beginning of the year. This was a better result than previously projected due to the delay in changes related to our Pennsylvania Medicaid contract. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 85.3%, a continuation of the strong results we achieved in this business in 2016 and a very good start to the year.","Shifting to our Commercial business, the strong momentum of 2016 continued in the first quarter with our Commercial ASC membership increase of approximately 219,000 members, as large group Commercial membership gains outpaced our previous projection. Increased sales drove this improvement, a confirmation that our value proposition is resonating in the marketplace, particularly with public and labor customers.","In our Commercial Insured business, membership decreased in the quarter, largely the result of declining ACA-compliant individual and small group membership. As a result of actions taken to reduce our footprint in 2017, our individual business now represents less than 2% of total adjusted revenue. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 79.4% for the quarter, a very good result despite continued pressure from our individual Commercial products. Our group Commercial products performed very well in the quarter, benefiting from moderate medical cost trends and favorable prior year's reserve development.","Based on first quarter results, we continue to project that our 2017 non-ACA core Commercial medical cost trends will be in the range of 6% to 7%. With respect to our individual Commercial products, we continue to face headwinds related to profitability. From a membership perspective, we ended the quarter with 255,000 individual Commercial members, down from 964,000 at year-end 2016. This result is 15,000 members higher than our previous projection.","Based on our current view of membership in these products, we believe the risk pool that we have retained from last year and attracted during this year's annual enrollment has higher cost levels than we had previously projected. As a result of our higher membership, and an updated view of the health status of our current membership, we recognized a $110 million PDR reflecting our expectation for greater losses than previously anticipated for the 2017 policy year.","It is important to note that despite this headwind, we continue to project that 2017 losses on individual Commercial products will be significantly less than those reported in 2016. We expect that the first quarter will mark the high point for our individual Commercial membership, as we project attrition throughout the remainder of 2017. This is consistent with our experience in recent years.","Looking beyond 2017, we continue to evaluate our footprint with a view towards significantly reducing our exposure to individual Commercial products in 2018. We have already disclosed our planned 2018 exit from one of our 2017 state-based exchanges and intend to communicate other 2018 footprint decisions when appropriate.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At March 31, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 39.8%. Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with approximately $15.1 billion. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $785 million. We repaid $11.3 billion in debt in the quarter, including $10.2 billion related to the Humana deal financing.","We paid $1.2 billion in deal-related termination fees. We paid a shareholder dividend of $88 million. We used $3.3 billion in the quarter for our accelerated share repurchase program. And after other sources and uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $100 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was approximately 332 million at March 31.","As a result of our first quarter performance, we are increasing our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $8.80 to $9 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a $0.35 increase relative to our previous projection of at least $8.55 per share, a meaningful increase, especially when viewed in light of an approximate $0.20 headwind from our individual Commercial products.","Our increased adjusted EPS outlook reflects our favorable first quarter results, including the effect of favorable prior-year's reserve development as well as the impact of our accelerated share repurchase program. Partially offsetting these benefits are the updated outlook for our individual Commercial products and the increased targeted investment spending to drive future growth, primarily related to government-sponsored programs.","However, certain risks remain that temper our outlook at this point in the calendar, including the ever-present concern that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected, low visibility at this juncture of the year into our ability to achieve our updated outlook for individual Commercial products, and the potential for the health insurer fee to be permanently repealed during 2017.","Our updated 2017 guidance is influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our first quarter membership results, we project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 22.2 million members, as declines in Medicaid and small group Commercial during the balance of the year are partially offset by growth in Commercial ASC and Medicare membership over the remainder of the year. As we consider the stronger-than-projected start to the year and our current membership view, we are increasing our adjusted revenue projection for the year and now project that we will deliver approximately $61 billion in 2017 adjusted revenue.","Based on our strong first quarter results, we now project that our full-year total health care medical benefit ratio will be in the range of 84%, plus or minus 50 basis points. We now project that our adjusted expense ratio will be approximately 16.9% for the full year, up approximately 15 basis points compared to the top end of our previous guidance range. This increase is driven by the increase in targeted growth initiative investments now contemplated in 2017.","We continue to project adjusted pre-tax margin to be approximately 8%, consistent with our high single digit target. We now project adjusted earnings will be approximately $3 billion, and we continue to project full-year excess cash available at the parent to be approximately $4 billion.","Finally, as we consider the impact of the previously announced accelerated share repurchase program and our expected capital deployment for the remainder of the year, we now project our 2017 weighted average share count to be in the range of 334 million to 335 million shares.","In closing, we are encouraged by the strength of our first quarter results and our improved 2017 outlook, particularly at this early stage in the year. Additionally, we remain confident in Aetna's long-term growth prospects and look forward to sharing more details at our upcoming Investor Update Meeting in May.","I will now turn the call back over to Joe. Joe?","Joseph F. Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions.","Operator, the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question is coming from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mr. Fischbeck, please proceed with your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry about that. Okay. Yeah, question relates to the increase in investment spending that you're talking about for this year. I guess what was it that kind of changed your view about the opportunity for growth? And is the amount that we should think about purely just the amount of increase in the G&A percentage?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. So a couple things on that, Kevin. One I would say is we have some insights into the group MA pipeline, and we have some known sales already that we think are going to be significant enough that we have to ramp up for in advance.","As we talked about, we've thought about what are the kinds of things that we need to do to continue to enhance and accelerate our growth in Medicare. And so we always have sort of the concept of investment money gated, that when we look at our performance, we make a decision about how to deploy that money. And in this case, we've decided to accelerate some spending in the areas of Stars, for example, geographic expansion, advancing some things in Medicaid. Again \u2013 and so these are all designed to be investments that are either related to known growth or to drive future growth in 2018 and thereafter.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Then I guess just as far as the Stars investments that you're making, I guess you have a couple of large competitors who have fallen off on Stars recently. And as they look to regain their position that they had maybe two years ago, some of these metrics are, in fact, relative. So how do you think about your ability to kind of continue these elevated levels of Star performance if the peers are trying to catch up as well?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Well, I think part of falling back is not investing. And so I think we need to keep investing, number one. Number two, Kevin, I think more importantly, we're expanding new markets. So part of what we had hoped to get through the Humana acquisition was access to more geographies. That didn't happen. So we will accelerate our approach to that, and we'll need to get our Star ratings up in each of those markets. We know how to do that, and we intend on making those investments to continue growth in a broader geography. So more new store growth instead of same store growth.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Just first question, can you remind us the strategic benefits of running the group insurance segment with your healthcare business?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Well, the \u2013 I think certainly, the disability business is one that has had some linkage historically as we thought about the two, right? There are some somewhat arcane benefits in terms of how we position the investment portfolio and things like that. But operationally, they do largely run as two free-standing units for the most part today. There is cross-sell between \u2013 especially on the large accounts. We have a number of accounts where we would have the medical and also the group insurance.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","It gives us an opportunity for integration. A lot of times, a lot of companies will look at medical and disability, and we can link the disability business with the medical, and we have proof points to demonstrate that when we are selling in the large national account space.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Has that strategic benefit changed over time? Is it the same today as it was a few years ago?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. It hasn't changed dramatically over time; same benefit.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just real quick, just to follow up on the $0.19 PDR, I'm just trying to size the individual losses this year. Other than the $0.19, it sounded like there's more losses on individual exchanges also contemplated in 2017. Is there like a full-year total P&L impact of the individual ACA plans that you guys could give us?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","So what I would say is that we're tracking towards having about roughly half the loss that we reported last year this year, and that's on a quarter of the membership that we had, but that's a good sort of proxy. And just to be clear for everybody else, that PDR sort of goes all in and out within the 2017 year because it's all related to the 2017 policy year.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. I wondered, maybe just to follow up on some of the comments around MA, obviously next year you've got the benefit of Star ratings improvement while others are probably under pressure again. But there is now increasingly the likelihood that the HIF comes back and as you have to think about that or the market overall has to think about that, it probably has some potential to disrupt benefits. It sounds like you guys think you can grow similarly, especially with the geographic expansions to what you're seeing this year.","I just wanted to maybe flush (28:53) out any other views you have about what's happening in MA generally, the underlying growth there, especially as we look into next year and your confidence in that. And then since I'm asking you about 2018, I'm going to slip in, any update in your thinking about the long-term outlook of the $10 for 2018?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","A.J., I would comment on the Medicare Advantage. Well, we're not going to give guidance for next year. We view both same-store growth as continuing be strong, but also opening up new stores where we saw a fairly sizable portion of our new enrollment this year come from new markets that we opened up. So as we think about the growth profile of the business, it's adding more geographies, it's continuing to invest in Star ratings, particularly around service and CAPs in each local market.","And I think everybody has to consider that the fees are coming back and that they have to be priced into their product. But it's a market-by-market determination. Some markets we're up against the minimum MBR. Other markets we are not. So we'll look at it market by market and price based on what we think the competition's going to do. As it relates to the $10, I'll turn it over to Shawn, and he can tell you a little bit more about that.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah, as Mark mentioned, we'll provide 2018 guidance later this year as is our convention. The point of your question, A.J., obviously, is understanding bid positioning is a pretty big element to try to understand the year, so we'll do that at the appropriate time. What I would say, though, is that we're pleased with the 2017 earnings trajectory that we're on at this stage, especially in light of the continued drag that we've had with the individual business. And as was discussed on the call and a few of the questions, we're continuing to invest, and some of that investment is pointed at growth for 2018, and some of that is longer term growth.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with our question.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So questions focused on growth. I want to touch on Medicare Advantage and Commercial risk. So first on MA, there's been some chatter in the marketplace that you'd picked up a very large group win out there for 2018, and it certainly sounds like you're pretty bullish on the pipeline. Can you give us some color on that large win if it did indeed occur and how you see the outlook for group MA first for 2018?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","So on the large case size, (31:37) I'm not going to comment. It hasn't been publicly acknowledged yet. Relative to group Medicare, I would tell you that we have a very strong and robust pipeline for 2018 that we're quite excited about, and we do expect to have some solid growth coming into January of 2018.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. And would you expect your individual MA performance to be ballpark similar this year in terms of new markets and the contribution from new markets?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","We're not giving guidance yet for 2018, but we continue to believe that we can exceed industry growth.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","And then just on the Commercial risk side, you've outlined individual. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing in small group and where you think that the losses there could kind of stabilize, and what you're seeing in the large group risk market for 2017 would be helpful as well. Thanks.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","So relative to small group, I just want to remind you all the three pieces of small group. The 2 to 50 Keep What You Have. That has been a pretty stable segment for us and it is performing within our expectations. The 2 to 50 ACA-compliant book has been probably the most challenging and the most volatile, and that's where you have seen us reduce our overall exposure in that segment.","And as I've talked about before, we've offered self-funded Bswift capabilities to that segment which has a very strong market receptivity. And then our 51 to 100, the majority of that book remains medically underwritten and is performing in line with expectation relative to the overall Commercial book fully-insured, pricing stable in the market. We're seeing fair amount of activity for the 7\/1 selling season, and we continue to remain focused on national accounts for 2018 as well.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Justin, the thing I'd say, macro, on small group is that towards the end of last year, it felt like this started to turn a little bit for us in the favorable direction after having had some challenges. And for the most part, I would say that continued in the first quarter. I continue to be encouraged by the direction that the small group business is headed. So that all looks good. And as Karen mentioned, large group continues to be a stable performer. We continue to position ourselves carefully on the large group risk side of the business. But, again, those segments were generally at or better than expected in the first quarter.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Just wanted to follow up again on group MA for 2018, obviously sounds like a big opportunity for you. Can you maybe drill in a little bit in terms of as you look at your pipeline and as you're trying to mine that, sort of how that would break down in terms of the opportunity of converting existing Commercial ASO retiree accounts as compared to new prospects that you're looking to outside of your current customer base?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","I would say we're seeing a fair amount of outside prospects. We are continuing to mine our customer base, but we are seeing a pretty robust pipeline of external customers coming to market.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then just related follow-up. Just Karen, you had mentioned the 2018 national accounts for Commercial. Maybe just give us a sense in terms of where you stand right now and in terms of the size of the pipeline on just the core Commercial ASO side, in terms of cases out to bid relative to 2017, average case sizes, maybe some metrics like that.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","So the relative pipeline on national accounts is a lower number of cases from last year at this time. Obviously, the book is still maturing. I would say the average number of eligibles is down as well. So as you might imagine, we're not expecting an outsized growth for 2018. We are keenly focused on retention. And I might note that we had the best retention that we've had in a number of years for the 1\/1 selling season this year, and we expect to maintain that momentum going into 2018.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Newshel with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. Mark, could you share your latest thoughts about the CVS relationship and how you'd like to see that evolve and how might it be affected, if at all, by any shuffling of PBM alignments among your peers?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Well, I would say that, I mean, as we get closer to our 1\/1\/20 renewal date is the first opportunity to consider renewing it, we continue to look at what we can do in contract. And so we have some developments and conversations underway around our Medicare product as well as our Commercial product.","But I think going forward, the PBM relationship as a standalone model is a troubled relationship. As we look at all the noise around drug pricing and where are the discounts and where are not the discounts, it is still our view that drug pricing transparency's incredibly important for all consumers. Secondly, that it's all in cost for us by therapy because that fits within a risk-based model where there's a premium against which all costs are measured.","So the lowest cost of therapy may be higher drug costs, lower other costs; may be higher other costs, lower drug costs are very important. And so as we talk to CVS about our relationship going forward, we're trying to fundamentally rethink how we could work closer together, both on just the pharmacy side but also on the local care delivery that could go on in the community, given that CVS has 9,000 stores within 3 miles of 80% of the American public. It has been our view that we need to get closer to home and closer to community to help people with social determinants and other costs that are based near their home versus waiting for them to show up maybe once a year at the doctor to get information about how they're doing.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","And do you see building out those more retail provider capabilities in terms of CVS acquiring those capabilities, or are you guys doing it together, so there's some sort of JV or partnership, or are, sort of, all things on the table now?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Still too early to tell. We're in the midst of those conversations with multiple players.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Was hoping you could give us a little more color on the components of the medical cost trend. Obviously, the total number is tracking in line but just would love to get a better sense for how inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy are tracking at this point in terms of year-to-year changes. Thanks.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Chris, I mean unfortunately, this is a bit of a boring story in that not a lot has changed sort of on the pressure points or the new ones. I would say overall, again, we had a very well-behaved, moderate cost trend quarter. Certainly looking at prior-period development, that didn't lead to any surprises as those periods have matured. So we're probably looking \u2013 continue to look at inpatient in the mid singles, physician in the mid singles, outpatient in the high singles, and pharmacy in the low double digits. And the pharmacy story really continues to be one that's all about specialty pharma. I think that comprises something on the order of 40 % now of the costs and a very low percentage of the scripts. And so when you really dig into it, as I've said before, it continues to be issue one, two, and three when you look at the medical cost trend drivers.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify and understanding something first. Just going to the individual market, I think for 2015, you had suggested $450 million of pre-tax loss. And so it sounds like that's going to maybe $225 million this year. I think you said last year, you would've been break even or slightly profitable at the risk adjustment accruals, which looked like they would have been 10%, a little north of 10% of gross (40:33) premium. So first question is have you made a change to the risk adjustment accrual percentage for 2017? How does that compare year-over-year in terms of how you're thinking profitability plays out this year?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Well, before I have Shawn answer that specific question, let me remind you that last year when we made our decision in July to withdraw from exchanges, we had a view that we could be running near $800 million to $900 million loss in 2017. And based on our first quarter results and our projection for the year, it appears that we are running at that number. So our attempts to stem the impact of this product set on our overall earnings and capital structure was appropriate and very important at that time, but yet, we're still above what we thought we would project.","Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yes. So, Gary, this is one of the areas, when we talk about the areas of uncertainty that we have, understanding again the risk adjustment of this very different and changed population from what we had last year is one of those challenges, especially in the first quarter where we really don't have mature data. The short version of the story is we still are in a fairly \u2013 we estimate that we're going to be in a pay-in position. That will probably, in a relative sense, be a little bit less of a pay-in position than we were last year, just given what we've seen happen to our book.","But again, there's still a lot of uncertainty and blind spots that we have in terms of we know what happened to some degree to our population but we don't know what has happened in the overall market. So the takeaway is that we still have a risk-adjuster pay-in position but a little bit \u2013 maybe a little bit improved off of last year based on what we've seen so far.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And if I could do one other question. On PDR \u2013 or not PDR \u2013 prior-year development coming into the year, I think there was $0.46 of net prior-year development recognized in 2016. You hadn't guided for that for 2017. So at this point, is there still some conservatism related to PYD? As the net effect, do you expect to realize mostly in the year because of 1Q, and is that net realized amount down from 2016?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yes. So I want to just clarify, I don't think we guided for any PYD in our initial guidance.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","(43:17)","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","We certainly have talked about what the historical levels have been. So we had in the first quarter probably on the order of $0.30 to $0.35 of PYD. Again, if you look at past years, we've continued to get smaller amounts of PYD in the subsequent quarters going forward. So I certainly don't \u2013 that certainly wouldn't be a surprise if that happened and we got some more in the second quarter of the year, for example, as that's how most of the prior years have played out.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Okay. (43:55) Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. So in the past, you have discussed the potential to perhaps build out an Aetna services segment, if you will, that would house the various clinical IT and other non-benefit related businesses that Aetna currently operates. I guess where does that fit into your current growth strategy now that Humana is \u2013 we're done with that, and maybe you'll talk more about this at your Investor Day, but if you could chat about that a little bit. Thanks.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah, we will talk about it more at our Investor Day, Tom, but we are building that out. It is one of the foci of our investment portfolio for 2017 that we put in the plan. And as we looked at what we found very valuable in the Humana transaction, it was more geographies through which we could provide more Medicare Advantage products. And secondly, the whole model that Humana has built about being in the home and in the community, and a clinical model that approaches and supports that. And so that is what that services division will do. It's currently underway. Gary Loveman is building that out, and we'll have more to say about it in December.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Could you provide some timing perhaps on that? Or would there be a branding campaign that goes along with it?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","More to come on that. We'll talk a little bit about that in May, on May 12, but we'll have more detail when we get to December.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Christine Arnold of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Morning. Two things. Number one, you referenced group MA known wins, can you give us a sense for the membership in terms of what you've already gained? And with respect to Medicaid, can you talk about the pipeline? I know Pennsylvania's probably a bad guy, but what are you seeing in terms of potential good guys on the Medicaid enrollment? Thanks.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","So, Christine, I'll start with Medicaid. We have four implementations currently in process, so you'll see those coming through the remainder of the year. We're monitoring probably over a dozen RFPs that will come out within the next 12 to 18 months or so. So we feel there's a pretty solid pipeline relative to Medicaid. And relative to the group MA question, I can't give you that number at this point.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one additional question this morning from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Just wanted to quantify a couple numbers if I could. If the health insurance fee is repealed, it would create a headwind for you for this year \u2013 correct? \u2013 in terms of mid-year renewals. How much is that? And then can you quantify how much the alternative funding arrangements are producing in revenues right now for small groups and what it's growing by?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","On the headwind piece, that originally was going to be about a $0.10 benefit and, as you all recall, it's just really an anomaly of how the accounting works for that recovery. Obviously as the year goes on, some of that's built into pricing already. It could decline slightly. But I think it's best to think about that as about a $0.10 item on that. We're probably over, Karen, about 100,000 AFA...","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","...alternate funding small group members.

Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Well, it's huge because we just launched it last year, right, so there's no denominator there. So a lot of that growth happened in the back of last year and in the first quarter of this year, especially.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cowhey, please go ahead.","Thomas F. Cowhey","Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Call and Webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna. And with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC, including our 2012 Form 10-K, our 2013 Form 10-Qs and our 2013 Form 10-K when filed.","We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company's performance that are non-GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2013 financial supplement and our 2014 guidance summary. These reconciliations are available on the investor information section of aetna.com.","Please note that the inclusion of Coventry's business in 2013 results impacts the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comparisons. Additionally, for the purpose of today's discussion, unless otherwise noted, all references to 2013 operating earnings and operating EPS include amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. All references to 2014 operating earnings and operating EPS reflect Aetna's revised definitions, which exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets.","Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited, so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini","Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, we reported operating earnings per share of $1.34, a 43% increase over 2012. This fourth quarter result brings full year 2013 operating EPS to $5.85, representing a record result for the company and 14% growth over 2012, a 3-year operating EPS CAGR of 17%, well in excess of our managed care peers and another year where we exceeded our low double-digit operating EPS growth objective.","Looking back on 2013, Aetna executed well across most of our businesses; pricing with discipline and generating 120 basis points of improvement in our operating expense ratio; closed the acquisition of Coventry healthcare, the largest acquisition in Aetna's history; continued to advance our efforts to shift the network model toward patient-centric population health management; and developed a strong strategy and foundation to participate on exchanges.","Aetna's 2013 financial results are a testament to the strength of our diversified portfolio and its ability to deliver sustainable results. Underlying these full year results, we ended the year with nearly 22.2 million medical members, representing our seventh sequential quarter of medical membership growth. We reported record annual operating revenues of over $47 billion, driven by the Coventry acquisition and solid underlying growth.","Our full year 2013 Commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.1% at the low end of our projected range. Aetna's operating expense ratio improved again to 17.7% as we grew operating revenue and continued to focus on synergy realization while investing for the future.","Finally, 2013 was another strong year of cash generation, helping us to fund the Coventry acquisition, increase our shareholder dividend and still repurchase $1.4 billion of our shares.","Aetna's solid finish to 2013 gives us good momentum as we drive towards our 2014 operating earnings projection of at least $6.25 per share.","In a moment, Shawn will discuss our 2013 results and 2014 guidance in greater detail, but first, I would like to discuss Aetna's growth strategy and how we are executing on that strategy.","At our investor conference in December, we highlighted the following elements of our growth model built on the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses. Specifically, we project that Aetna's Large Group Commercial business can grow profitably, Aetna's Government franchise can be a growth engine, Small Group and Individual represent an opportunity for future growth, next-generation networks enhance the core business and Coventry enhances top line growth and strengthens our capital position. I will now provide a brief update on how we are executing against some of these growth levers.","Starting with our government business. We just completed a highly-successful Medicare annual open enrollment period where growth exceeded our initial expectations. We believe this strong performance speaks to the value we provide to our customers. We now expect to add at least 110,000 Medicare Advantage members in the first quarter of 2014 representing an excess of 11% sequential growth. This projected result comes primarily from strong sales in the Coventry Individual Medicare Advantage book and another year of growth in Aetna's Group Medicare Advantage business. Both of these businesses performed well in 2013 and are projected to be solid performers in 2014 as well.","Aetna is pleased to be a key participant in this important and growing program. While we remain concerned about further cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in 2015 and the potential for member disruption, we continue to believe that the Medicare business can be a valuable part of our earnings profile over the long term.","Moving on to exchanges. At our annual investor conference in December, we laid out our vision of the shift toward a retail marketplace. The driving force behind this shift is plan sponsor interest in defined contribution models for employee health benefits. We believe the most efficient way for plan sponsors to achieve their goal would be through private exchanges. Most private exchanges today are consultant or broker-sponsored multi-carrier exchanges that we view as a first step in the evolution of the private exchange marketplace. As we discussed previously, Aetna is participating in a number of private exchanges in 2014, and we believe we are winning our fair share in this emerging retail marketplace.","Based on available data in the first quarter of 2014, we project that 90,000 existing Aetna ASC members will convert to a private exchange model. More than offsetting these first quarter losses, we project that 130,000 new private exchange members will select an Aetna product, with over 2\/3 of those members enrolling in fully-insured products. Our early results have been encouraging and speak to the opportunity private exchanges offer Aetna.","We also continue to work to develop our own proprietary exchange called the Aetna marketplace, integrating the best that our brand has to offer. We believe that the Aetna marketplace will offer stable and affordably-priced products that plan sponsors require to make defined contribution models successful and empower consumers to take greater control of their health benefits decisions. This marketplace is available today for Small Group members and we will be expanding our capabilities in this area throughout 2014.","Shifting to the public exchanges. First, a reminder that individual health insurance was a small portion of Aetna's business in 2013, representing 3% of our membership and operating revenues, and less than 1% of EBITDA. Despite the well-publicized challenges during the initial exchange rollout, enrollment has increased in recent weeks. Through the end of January, Aetna's exchange enrollment totals approximately 135,000 paid members and should continue to grow over the remainder of the open enrollment period. We continue to believe our overall exposure to the individual insured business will not materially increase in 2014 and the financial risks to Aetna are manageable.","Let me now spend a few minutes discussing our provider transformation efforts. In 2013, we continued to advance our efforts to shift the provider business model from a fee-for-service model toward patient-centric population health management. Across the spectrum of value-based networks, we now have over 340 agreements encompassing over 1.5 million medical members, including 32 signed ACO collaborations covering over 550,000 members, 112 patient-centered medical homes covering 740,000 members, 112 Medicare collaborations covering 115,000 Medicare members and 88 high-performance networks acquired in the Coventry transaction covering 105,000 Commercial and Medicare members. Looking forward, we project that 20% to 25% of our medical costs will run through some form of value-based network contract in 2014 and are committed to increasing that participation percentage to 45% by 2017.","Moving on to the Coventry integration process. For 2013, we achieved the high end of our targets for both synergies and accretion, and for 2014, we currently project $200 million in synergies and $0.50 per share of operating EPS accretion. We are pleased with the execution of our integration plans and the excellent work that has been done by our integration teams. Our results to date speak to the financial and strategic attractiveness of the Coventry acquisition, and we continue to work diligently to mitigate potential integration and migration risks and deliver additional value for our customers and shareholders.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Shawn, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss our multi-year outlook. As I have said before, in 2014, we faced many unique challenges, including pricing or solving for the ACA fees and taxes and offsetting the rate pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. It will require a strong execution to overcome these meaningful headwinds, but we remain committed to growing operating earnings and operating EPS this year.","In 2015, ACA fees and taxes will be largely incorporated into our baseline rates and premiums. However, further ACA-mandated cuts to Medicare Advantage and the prospects for additional Medicare rate pressures could make 2015 another challenging year for this important business. Despite this challenge, 2015 could be a year of improved core business fundamentals, which should further benefit from capital actions and incremental accretion from Coventry. By 2016, we expect ACA-related pressures will largely abate and longer-term revenue growth opportunities will begin to mature. As we stand here today, we view 2016 as a year when we can return to our long-term growth dynamics.","As we think about longer-term prospects, one of the keys to Aetna's growth story is the power of our diversified portfolio. Historically, we have talked about our diversified portfolio in terms of mitigating risk. We also believe it provides us with multiple opportunities to capture future growth and achieve our goal of doubling operating revenue by the end of the decade. These opportunities include: private exchanges, the potential movement of commercial membership from self-insured to fully insured products; Medicare Advantage growth, as 11,000 baby boomers age into the Medicare program on a daily basis; dual eligibles growth, as up to $300 billion in annual spend migrates to managed care; public exchange growth, which could grow to 25 million members by 2020; and Medicaid expansion, as 15 million additional people become eligible for the program under the ACA.","The revenue growth opportunities in front of us may be unprecedented in the history of managed care and we believe our diversified portfolio positions us to capture our fair share and grow operating revenues at double-digit rates.","In summary, as we begin 2014, I am confident in our strategic direction and our ability to execute, our ability to achieve Coventry synergies and our accretion goals, the power of our diversified portfolio to drive growth and our 2014 operating EPS guidance of at least $6.25 per share.","I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our results and our 2014 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported full year 2013 operating earnings of $2.1 billion and operating earnings per share of $5.85, consistent with our most recent projections and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2013. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by solid revenue growth and operating margins. I'll begin with some comments on overall performance for the year.","We grew operating revenue by 33% to a record level of over $47 billion driven by the Coventry acquisition and underlying growth of nearly 7%. Our full year Commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, an excellent result reflecting our disciplined pricing posture and historically low and stable medical cost trends. We improved our full year operating expense ratio by 120 basis points to 17.7%, driven by higher operating revenues and continued disciplined in controlling costs. We closed the Coventry acquisition earlier than expected and began the integration process and delivered on our synergy and accretion targets. Finally, we generated approximately $2.7 billion in dividends from subsidiaries and returned nearly $1.7 billion to shareholders.","Looking more specifically at the quarterly results, during the fourth quarter, operating revenue increased by 47% from the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily from the addition of Coventry. We grew underlying operating revenue by over 7%, driven by Medicare membership increases and commercial insured premium yield growth. Medical membership increased by 38,000 in the quarter, driven by Commercial Insured and Medicare Supplement, partially offset by a modest decline in Medicaid membership.","From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our fourth quarter total medical benefit ratio was 83.9%, a 20-basis point improvement compared to the prior year quarter, driven by strong performance in our Commercial business and improved performance in our Medicaid business, mostly offset by the previously disclosed pressures in our Medicare business. As a result of our operating revenue growth, realization of synergies from the Coventry acquisition and our disciplined focus on costs, we drove 170 basis points of improvement in our operating expense ratio versus the prior year quarter, and our pretax operating margin was 6.7% for the quarter and 7.9% for the year, consistent with our high single-digit target.","From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Our reserve growth kept pace with our premium growth and our days claims payable were 45 days at the end of the quarter, stable both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. In addition, we experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to our 2013 performance.","Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows in the fourth quarter were strong at nearly 1.5x operating earnings and full year 2013 operating cash flows were equally strong at approximately 1.3x operating earnings. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing over 6.8 million shares in the quarter for $450 million and distributing another $74 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In 2013, Aetna returned nearly $1.7 billion of capital to our shareholders through these 2 programs, including approximately $1.4 billion deployed towards share repurchases.","In short, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, which we believe demonstrate the successful execution of Aetna's growth strategy and the value of a diversified portfolio. I will now discuss the key drivers of the fourth quarter performance in greater detail.","Consistent with our performance throughout 2013, the main driver of our strong operating performance this quarter is our Commercial insured business. This business, which represents over 50% of our 2013 operating revenue, continued to pose year-over-year revenue growth despite continued underlying membership pressures. As before, and especially as we look forward to 2014, we remain committed to fair and financially responsible pricing where we favor margin over membership and price to projected underlying medical cost trends.","Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.7% for the quarter, an excellent seasonal result and a decrease of 170 basis points from the same period last year. Drivers of this improvement included favorable prior period development and the favorable effect of early collection of ACA fees and taxes. Medical cost trends developed consistent with our previous projections, and based on our year-to-date experience, we continue to project that Aetna's stand-alone 2013 Commercial medical cost trends will be in the range of 5.5% to 6%.","Another important growth lever is our Government franchise. Our Medicare book of business continued to demonstrate growth in the fourth quarter, growing by 30,000 members. In total, our Medicare revenue more than doubled over the fourth quarter of 2012, a result of the Coventry acquisition as well as strong underlying membership growth. Our Medicare medical benefit ratio was 87.9% in the quarter, stable sequentially.","In our Medicaid business, medical membership declined by 49,000 in the quarter. These were primarily ASC members related to county losses in the previously-announced Arizona reprocurement. Despite the sequential decline in membership, premiums more than doubled on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the inclusion of Coventry. The performance of the business was very good in the quarter as our Medicaid medical benefit ratio was 84.7%, a 260-basis point improvement from last year's fourth quarter. Our total Government medical benefit ratio for the quarter was 87%.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At December 31, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of 37%. Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with $200 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $523 million. We repurchased over 6.8 million shares for $450 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $74 million. After other uses, we ended the quarter with $200 million of cash at the parent representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 362.2 million at December 31.","I would now like to spend a few moments discussing our 2014 outlook. Our solid finish to 2013 and our encouraging early membership results for 2014 give us good momentum as we drive towards our 2014 operating earnings projection of at least $6.25 per share. Note that this projection reflects our new convention of excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets from operating earnings and operating EPS.","Our 2014 guidance is influenced d by the following drivers. We project that our first quarter medical membership will be approximately 22.2 million members, an increase from year-end 2013 of approximately 50,000 members. There are numerous moving pieces inside this aggregate forecast. Commercial ASC membership is projected to increase by 120,000 to 160,000 members due to new business wins, primarily in our public and labor business. Commercial Insured membership is projected to decline by 120,000 to 160,000 members, influenced by declines in our individual insured business and the transition from limited benefit products, partially offset by private exchange membership gains. Medicare is projected to grow by at least 135,000 members, comprised of at least 110,000 Medicare Advantage members and 25,000 Medicare Supplement members. Finally, Medicaid membership is projected to decline by 80,000 to 100,000 members, primarily related to our exit from a low-revenue ASC contract in California accounting for 125,000 members.","Consistent with our operating revenue update in January, we continue to project full year operating revenue to be at least $54 billion. We project our full year Commercial medical benefit ratio to be 79% to 80%. As a reminder, the impact of including ACA fees and taxes in pricing is expected to reduce this ratio by approximately 250 basis points. Absent the adjustment to premium for fees and taxes, our full year Commercial medical benefit ratio is projected to be 81.5% to 82.5%. The year-over-year increase in this adjusted figure is primarily driven by the exclusion of prior year development in our 2014 guidance and the crediting of favorable 2013 experience back to customers through the renewal process.","Aetna's 2014 Commercial medical cost trend is projected to be in the range of a 6% to 7%, reflecting a projected increase in utilization of 75 to 100 basis points. We project our Government medical benefit ratio to be 85% to 87%, which, at the midpoint, represents an improvement of 150 basis points, driven primarily by actions designed to solve for or recover the impact of the health insurer fee. We project our operating expense ratio will be in the range of 18.5% to 19%. This figure is impacted by the expense related to the ACA fees and taxes, which runs through the SG&A line, increasing the reported SG&A ratio for 2014 by approximately 140 basis points. Our underlying operating expense ratio, excluding these fees and taxes, is projected to be in the range of 17.1% to 17.6%, an improvement over 2013. We project pretax operating margin to be at least 7.5%, consistent with our high single-digit target.","The lack of deductibility of the health insurer fee is projected to increase our reported tax rate by approximately 600 basis points. We project operating earnings to be over $2.2 billion. And finally, based on our previously disclosed increase in operating revenue guidance, we now project net dividends from subsidiaries to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion as additional capital to support this growth is held at the subsidiaries. Despite this change, we continue to project excess cash flow to the parent of approximately $1.2 billion.","In summary, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results and believe that these results demonstrate our ability to execute on the growth strategy we shared with you in December. I want to reiterate that we are committed to growing operating earnings and operating EPS in 2014, and consistent with that objective, we are focused on: Collecting or solving for the ACA-mandated fees and taxes; integrating Coventry and accelerating, or possibly exceeding, our synergy targets; delivering on our plans to offset the Medicare Advantage rate pressures; and executing on our exchange strategies.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas F. Cowhey","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Josh Raskin from Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to follow up on Mark's comments around private exchanges and some of the moving parts that you guys were talking about, and I think I got some of the numbers that you were saying in terms of the movement there that some of your ASO, I think it was about 90,000 lives into exchanges, but then it sounded like you got 130,000 out, of which 2\/3 are risk. So obviously, that's net-net, I would think, a positive for revenues and earnings. So I just want to make sure I got those numbers right. And then two, can you talk a little bit about how you're measuring share and success as you think about accounts that are converting in, accounts that were previously Aetna and those that were previously at competitors, how are you sort of assessing your level of success? What sort of market share numbers you're seeing, any sort of selection issues and things like that?","Mark T. Bertolini","Good. Thanks, Josh. Your numbers are right. So 90,000 ASC members went into the private exchange model. We got 130,000 new private exchange members, of which 2\/3 were risk, representing approximately $450 million of revenue increase on the net change, which has 4x to 5x -- the greater Commercial insured contribution has 4x, 5x greater contribution than ASC on a dollar basis. So we felt good about that. We continue to see our share as a net gain so far. But as the environment changes and more private exchanges evolve, including our own proprietary exchanges, which we now have in the marketplace, we'll see how those share dynamics change.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So Mark, are you at the point where you would recommend, say, some of your customers, even if you've got 100% share of an ASO account, for example, that they would convert into one of that consultant-based exchanges because you're getting more than your fair share of the enrollment and the contribution margin's 4x to 5x. Are you at that point?","Mark T. Bertolini","We are talking to our large ASC clients about moving into private exchanges. The first conversation is about our own.","Operator","We'll go next to Justin Lake from JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question's on the public exchange side. First, can you tell us what the early indicators look like on the risk profile, the membership you're getting here and what margins are embedded in guidance for this business for 2014? And then Mark, you've been fairly vocal on the issues facing exchanges post the rollout. I was hoping you could give us some color on what needs to happen between now and May for the company to be comfortable with the business going into 2015 bidding.","Mark T. Bertolini","Thanks, Justin. We have, right now, 135,000 paid members that's growing every day because open enrollment's still open until March 31. We have, from an interest standpoint, just under 200,000 lives enrolled. And I would be cautious. So we have maintained that ratio of somewhere around 70% paid to enroll, although I will say that the folks who've enrolled before January were at about a little over 80% on paid versus enrolled, I think almost 90% now. So that's rolling up quickly. So my view is, is that I think people are enrolling in multiple places. They're shopping. And what happens is that they never really sort of get back on healthcare.gov to disenroll from plans they prior enrolled in. The only reason that we know they didn't enroll is when we don't pay their premium. And that's pretty typical of the individual marketplace, which leads to probably the next set of things that we need to see happen in the public exchanges. The back-end operational accounting for the public exchanges is still not up and running. We are doing that largely manually. Now with Aetna, because we've been an alpha tester, we've been exchanging information back and forth and have figured out how to get as clear a set of data from healthcare.gov that we can to manage this, but the whole add, change, delete functionality still needs to be built on the back-end, and I think that's our next biggest concern as we move forward on managing the enrollment in the exchanges -- in the public exchanges. As it relates to our May renewal increase, we have a team already on it. I am, and Shawn, is personally involved in understanding. We know -- understanding what to do next. We know the information and the questions we need to answer before we can be comfortable with the rates that we will submit. We are quickly gathering that information, and quite frankly, it's way too early to tell because we have very little information. As it relates to the risk in the pool, the demographics are about where we thought they would be, a little skewed to higher cost individuals. We are using our underwriting databases that we use when we underwrite groups to access as much information about these individuals as we can. Some of these individuals are former Aetna individual market members moving into the public exchanges. Others, we can find information about through national databases. And so far nothing alarming. But I'd like to remind everybody, 3% of our revenue, less than 1% of our profit out of this business. We expect this book of business to actually have a negative impact on our earnings, and that's built into our guidance for 2014.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you have negative margins built in, Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini","We expect the business to lose money in the first year.","Operator","Moving next to Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wondering, anything to call out on the commercial cost trend in the fourth quarter? I think at least one of your peers discussed higher utilization given disruption and cancellation notices that went out. Did that impact you at all or anything else sort of along those lines to call out, first? And then you noted that the early collection of the industry tax helped in 4Q. I was just hoping that you can help quantify the benefit of that.","Shawn M. Guertin","Ralph, I would say that while we seasonally saw higher costs in the fourth quarter, which, as you know, we typically do, that was not anywhere markedly different than our expectations. So I would have to say that we did not observe that phenomena as the quarter played out largely consistent with our expectations. The health insurer fee, I believe, year-over-year, is in the neighborhood of 50 basis points, I think, plus or minus.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just I'm staying on the cost trend, we've obviously seen several years of lower cost trend. I guess, when we think about next year, how concerned are you on the uptick in underlying trend? Anything over the first month so far that you've seen that would suggest any type of pickup?","Mark T. Bertolini","Obviously, too early to tell. We're -- we just got a few weeks\u2019 worth of reliable claims in the first 6 weeks, and so I would be reluctant. I mean, we run our reserves everyday, and I'd be reluctant to give any color other than to say that we believe that trend is stable. We expect utilization to increase by 75 to 100 basis points, which is a big difference between last year and this year. We expect that to happen in the outpatient area going from mid to high-single digits to high-single digits, otherwise physician, hospital and others are at mid to high-single digits like they were last year. So it's really being driven by utilization is our expectation, and we price to that. 90% of our business, when you include Medicare and Commercial together is priced for 2014 and those are our expectations going into the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Rigg from Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to the Medicare Advantage membership growth. I guess, is there any incremental detail you can provide as to whether the growth of above and beyond what you were looking for in December is coming from a relatively small group of markets, or whether those individuals were previously enrolled with a competitor plan? Any color on the membership would be great.","Shawn M. Guertin","Chris, the increases are quite broad-based geographically. What I would start with is most of this growth is actually happening in the individual MA business that was on the Coventry platform, as well as the Group Medicare Advantage business. And as you know, both of those businesses performed quite well this year. About 1\/4 of our growth is a result of expansion counties, and I would also point out that the significant majority of our member growth has occurred in our 4-star or better plans. In terms of members from prior plans we're about 65% of the new members appear to have come from other plans, that's up a little bit from last year where that number was 57%.","Operator","A.J. Rice from UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe I'll ask you about the Medicaid plans and the ability to get the tax fully incorporated there. I know you guys have been somewhat cautious on that. Is there an update on what you're seeing on the states? And how have you factored in the guidance your thinking on that?","Shawn M. Guertin","I would say that, A.J., that we have done, actually -- that's continued to progress in a positive way. As of today, we actually have signed contracts on about 3\/4 of our exposure to the health insurer fee, and even within the other 25%, we have various written documentation and rate memos on some of them that would indicate that we're going to be reimbursed. So this one has definitely trended favorably. I would also say, not in general, but almost entirely, we are getting a tax gross-up as well in that reimbursement. So this one has continued to go in a positive direction.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And is that all factored into your guidance at this point, that you're going to get to gross up on the tax as well?","Shawn M. Guertin","I think, largely, that's true with where we are right now in the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Schenker from Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could guys give any updates on how your early renewal strategy played out for you on the end of December there, and how -- any impact that may have had on your enrollment trends or thoughts for next year.","Mark T. Bertolini","I think our renewal process, early renewal process worked really well; the result of what was happening with the public exchanges and the government's extension. I think what we don't know yet, and we're still watching settle out and we'll probably know in the next few weeks, is what membership left us. And we usually, again, in the individual market, nobody ever calls us to say, \"Jeez, I've left your plan. Thanks for all you've done for me.\" They just don't pay their bill and then we disenroll them. And so we're waiting for all of that to settle through. So the net-net of all of it, we're not quite sure. Out early enrollment worked the way we thought it was going to work. It was helped by the public exchanges. I think in the end analysis, the level of disenrollment is still to be determined.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, was there any indication on your exchange enrollment, numbers of people who were previously Aetna members?","Mark T. Bertolini","We do have some of that, and we are sorting through that. And as a matter of fact, we are reaching out to new enrollees, getting them engaged in any transition of care, which helps us move them into case management and disease management, where we find the opportunity. And so we're actively reaching out to each of these new members and, obviously, keeping the folks that were in our former Aetna IDL [ph] product very engaged in their current programs.","Operator","Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, just a question on the fourth quarter. Was the operating cost level higher than you anticipated? It may have been that we modeled lower operating expense. I'm just curious how that came in relative to your budget.","Shawn M. Guertin","Just to be clear, Matt, are you asking about SG&A?","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I am.","Shawn M. Guertin","No, the SG&A came out very consistent with our expectations. Actually, probably net-net on a ratio basis, we actually did better than we thought for the quarter.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And also in the fourth quarter, I think you said 50 basis points benefit from proactive pricing of the health insurer fee. Is that, to calculate, that's maybe worth $0.05 to $0.06 to fourth quarter EPS. Is that in the ballpark?","Shawn M. Guertin","Yes. Let me just be clear on my answer. The 50 is probably closer to the full year effect. The quarterly effect, specifically, is up probably more up like 75 to 80 basis points.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just last question on the 2014 outlook. Can you -- you gave us a number, and I think it's 243. It may be slightly different in your footnotes to your disclosures on how much amortization expense would have previously been booked for '14, and is going to be excluded. How much amortization -- unless I'm misunderstanding. Is there some amortization expense that you're going to report on cash EPS for '14? And can you give us what that number is?","Shawn M. Guertin","Certainly. There will be no amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2014. All of the other depreciating items will continue to sort of run through operating earnings.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So what does that look like then? I guess, is what I'm trying to get at.","Shawn M. Guertin","What the other depreciation is?","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. What you're projecting for '14.","Shawn M. Guertin","We can pull that. I'll get you -- we can get you the specific number, no matter what the depreciation element is.","Operator","Christine Arnold from Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Back to Medicare Advantage. At your investor day, you said you expect MA flat pretax margins off of kind of a depressed '13. Couple of questions here. Was the headwind this year that you kind of overcame with pricing and bidding for 2014, was that still in the 200-basis point range or does that move at all?","Shawn M. Guertin","Christie, sorry, you're breaking up a little bit, so can you repeat the specific question there at the end?","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Sure.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","And we'll move to the next question. It will come from Ana Gupte from the Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","The question is about some of the recent changes that are being proposed on narrow networks. I think there's a few of them. 2015, HHS has asked for an increase in the central providers running 20% to 30%. There's a lot of buzz around this. Any willing provider legislation by the states and one of your competitors saw pressure of -- or backlash, if you will, for making some providers exit their networks. So just wanted to get a sense for, is this just because the pendulum has swung too far and the regulators are trying to get it in the middle? Or do you see that impacting your ability to generate a positive contribution from exchanges in '15 and then withstand the additional pressure on Medicare in 2015 on margins?","Mark T. Bertolini","Yes. I think, Ana, what you're hearing now, seeing now, is largely political posturing around the Affordable Care Act and all of its various pieces. And so I think that is going to be, and I think we talked about it as the next big thing, will be the dock shock as people realize the kind of networks that are in place and the impact that making the more affordable product in the marketplace available would require different kind of network models, is now coming to fruition as people actually access the system. So I think we're going to hear a lot about this over the next 6 months. I think it's going to be part of the dialogue as we move forward in ways to improve the Affordable Care Act. I can tell you that we do pay a lot of attention to it because it does impact pricing, but our pricing that we will submit for May relative to the public exchanges, and in June, for Medicare, will be very specific about the networks that we will include in that pricing.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So just to close that out then, in 2015, would you say that you would change your negative assumption on margins for exchanges? And for Medicare, given your baseline was impacted by some very specific items in '13, in '15, do you have a better likelihood of keeping your margins flat over the whole year for Medicare?","Mark T. Bertolini","So let me take public exchanges first. There are a lot of moving parts in public exchanges. We don't know the risk pool we have today. We don't know keep -- what will happen with keep what you have. I mean, there's some talk out there to have keep what you have continue for 3 more years. So all of this has to come into play and get settled down before May 15. It's part of the data and the answers we need to have in order to feel confident in participating in public exchanges in 2015. So all of that's on the table and we're working through that. So I can't say with any confidence where margins for the public exchanges will be next year given all the moving parts and, particularly, since we don't know what we have for 2014 yet. As it relates to Medicare, we always view a cascading set of opportunities in addressing the funding gap on Medicare. First, it's what can we do to the provider network, and we haven't had any pushback in them in the changes we've made for 2014. Second, what do we do about care management and disease management and getting people better cared for inside the system and followed up when they're not in the hospital any longer? Third is what do we do about our own SG&A? How do we make our system more efficient, and we make strides there every year. And then fourth, what do we do to impact benefits and\/or premiums? The last is pulling out of markets, which we view as an option that's not very palatable, but is always on the table and will particularly be on the table in 2015. So given the funding cuts we saw in '14, for '14 we are expecting somewhere less than 600 basis points to solve for in 2015. We hope it's a lot less than that's because depending on how large that cut is, we'll pull all of those levers trying to solve the funding gap, and to the degree we are not successful in 2014, that will only put more pressure on those levers in 2015. So more to come on that. We're working very collaboratively with the administration, with CMS on the rate letter coming out in February -- February 20, 21. And we expect to be very involved and have been very involved in making sure that nothing bad happens to the beneficiaries of Medicare, but more importantly to the importance of the program as it moves forward.","Shawn M. Guertin","Ana, the one thing that I would add, too, just more logistically. I mean, literally, since the notice came out on '14, we have had a work plan that encompassed both '14 and '15 and we have been at that, as you would expect. So we are managing the business and looking at all the levers that Mark described, assuming that the 600 basis point plus or minus cut is coming.","Operator","At this time, we'll go back to Christine Arnold from Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Sorry. If I try and pick up the phone -- I'm in a hotel, it just dies. Medicare Advantage, you had about 200 basis points of headwind in '14 that you -- or '13 that you thought you've bid and corrected for in '14. Is that still about 200 basis points? Or did that move in terms of the headwind in '13 that goes away with the bidding?","Shawn M. Guertin","Certainly, the 200 plus or minus is the correct amount for the pressures. Again, whether that goes away, I think, is frankly wrapped up in the bigger question that we have about solving for the overall funding gap. Certainly, we feel like we put the changes through those products to get at that, but again, there's a lot of bigger swing items going on. The one thing I would say as it pertains to PDP is when you -- when we look at our membership, it's likely that, that membership will be down 500,000 to 600,000 members, and so clearly, we have had an impact based on the changes that we put into the problematic PDP products in terms of the membership.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So as we think about kind of earnings year-over-year in your Medicare book, you have said that you expected kind of MA to have flat pretax margin but after-tax could be down. Now you've got more membership than you expected in MA, less in PDP, but PDP is lower PMPM. Is it possible to think to a profit target, kind of after-tax for the Medicare book, or is that too granular?","Shawn M. Guertin","I think it's too granular at this point. I think we need to have more insight sort of into the new membership, as well, again, as all of the fixes that we have tried to put in place to solve for the funding gap.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So you're still targeting for an MA of flat pretax margin but down after-tax?","Shawn M. Guertin","Yes, that would still be our target.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about the cash flow to the parent. It sounds like the cash flow's down a little bit this year because of some of the revenue growth. But you specifically highlighted capital deployment as something in '15 that's going to help the growth improve off of what you're showing in 2014. Just wanted to see if there was a sense of what that kind of normalized cash flow to the parent might normally be. And if there was anything in particular around the commentary on 2015, whether it's just that your balance sheet and cash flow will be better and that's why you specifically highlighted that, or whether you feel like M&A is going to be a bigger theme in 2015? Any color there?","Shawn M. Guertin","Kevin, you're right. I mean, growth is one of the bigger drivers of sort of the cash flow to the parent, and the level of growth we see in 2015 will have an impact on what comes to the parent. I would point out, though, that even with the decreased subsidiary dividends, we are maintaining our existing guidance of $1.2 billion to the parent this year, and I think we would stand by our sort of run rate view that we can still do at least $1 billion going forward.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And as far as that 2015 number, is that -- would you think that would be dramatically different than the 2014 number indiscernible] to think about it.","Shawn M. Guertin","Again, the $1 billion isn't necessarily a 2015 number specifically. It's what we think this business can produce sort of in the near-term. And again, without understanding the volume of the business that we project for 2015, I wouldn't want to speculate on a precise number there.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just as far as the capital deployment commentary for 2015 earnings growth, is that just kind of commentary saying you will probably buy back $1 billion of stock every year, or was there something more specific about using that capital for growth in M&A?","Shawn M. Guertin","No. I'll let Mark talk about the M&A one, but yes, they did. The $1 billion, I think that is exactly what we're saying that, that we will likely have $1 billion to repurchase shares in 2015.","Mark T. Bertolini","And the competing opportunity for that, Kevin, is that whether or not we will have other opportunities to invest in. So as we move through 2014 and we get through this, what I would characterize as a difficult year, and we execute against our plan, our expectation is, is that others may not execute as well and that we would be prepared to step into potential opportunities, consolidate in 2015. We have the balance sheet and we have the cash flow to be able to make that happen should the opportunity arise. Until early 2015, we're probably going to be largely defensive in our approach to M&A other than for what I would consider to be smaller technology kind of deals that will help us on -- in other areas of our business like ACOs or exchanges.","Operator","Will hear next from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the Medicare loss ratio, with it being stable sequentially in the fourth quarter, did we not see the normal seasonal improvement in the PDP loss ratio? Or did the Medicare Advantage loss ratio deteriorate sequentially?","Shawn M. Guertin","No, Carl, you're exactly right. With the issues that we had on the specific PDP products this year, we did not see near the seasonal dip in the MBR that we've seen in prior years. And in fact, when you look at that PDP loss ratio where we had the problem, the aggregate loss ratio for that actually isn't all that different than the total loss ratio we booked from the quarter, so there really wasn't the effect this year of that getting pulled down.","Operator","Moving next to Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm going to try one more time on the Medicare loss ratio here, guys. You have a guidance range of 200 basis points on your Medicare on your Government loss ratio for 2014, which a month ago we could understand that because you weren't sure about the premium tax, you weren't so sure about what was going to happen with your fixes to the 2 groups. We now know -- the underperforming groups that you had last year, we now know that you're getting most of the premium tax carried forward into the next year or paid by the states, we now know that the answer to 1 of those 2 groups, at least, was that those memberships -- that membership is gone. Can you describe why there's still a 200 basis point range in your guidance and what are the things driving that?","Mark T. Bertolini","The major thing driving it, Peter, is an 800 basis point issue of solving for funding gap for 2014, and we want to see evidence of it. We want to see the risk scores on the new membership we have, which we feel optimistic about now. And until we get all of that in the hopper, I think by the end of the first quarter, we'll have a much tighter range around that number, but we have to see some real movement and execution against our 800 basis point solve for the funding gap, of which some of the fixes you just mentioned go a ways toward helping us have that happen.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you describe how much of the Part D membership going away is going to help you next year?","Mark T. Bertolini","It helps us from the standpoint of the loss ratio we had on the PDP, but we also have a lot fewer members. So it's not a complete solve for what we saw a negative in 2013 coming through in 2014 because we have less membership there. Medicare Advantage, we're still settling out. But I think we'll have much more in the next 6 weeks to 8 weeks.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then lastly, there's been some at the CMS and MedPAC about changing the way group MA bids work. You guys are really the biggest player in group MA. Can you talk about what those changes are in terms of using sort of an industry average bid and what your response has been? I know you've talked about using PPOs as opposed to HMO for the key criteria for group MA bids. But can you describe what that pressure is and whether you think that's going to happen in 2015 or not?","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, our group MA payment versus fee-for-service is 103% versus the industry average of 109 so we think the impact is less for us. In addition, a large part of the population we have covered under group MA are unions and municipalities and governments, and so I think their involvement in having an appropriate program for their enrollees is going to help us maintain that program. But in the end analysis, we'll have to work with our clients to solve any gaps that arise as a result of this, but our difference is not as large as the industry's.","Operator","We'll hear next from Sarah James from Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Aetna's footprint is among the highest overlap with states, allowing the non-ACA-compliant plans to continue, so I was wondering if you could speak to whether or not the proposed updates to the 3Rs related to this are enough to offset and put you back on a similar playing field as when you first priced exchange products?","Shawn M. Guertin","Again, Sarah it's hard. Certainly, some of the positive changes will be positive contributors to that. But again, without knowing more about the risk profile and the experience of this initial set of membership, I wouldn't want to go as far as that we could get all the way back to any particular number. We just need to know more about this population. We certainly think the 3Rs are an intrinsic part of the long-term, frankly, viability of this program and we certainly know that the administration is there as well.","Mark T. Bertolini","And again, 3% of our revenues and less than 1% of our profit.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I wanted to clarify an earlier comment. You mentioned an increase on outpatient to mid to high-single digits, to now, high-single digits. So is that an uptick driven by successfully managing people from using inpatient to outpatient? Or is that new demand coming into the system?","Shawn M. Guertin","That certainly is part of it. As you know, our assumption about the uptick is a bit of a preemptive one where we are not seeing that yet. So there certainly is an embedded assumption of increased utilization. But the ongoing shift from inpatient settings to outpatient settings is certainly a part of that overall trend.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Is that the majority driver of that shift?","Shawn M. Guertin","I wouldn't say it's the majority.","Operator","Moving onto Scott Fidel from Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just interested if you can update us on what percentage of your Small Group book is now on the ACA-compliant plans and how much of that you'll need to complete in 2015? And just on a separate topic, we'd just be interested if you can give us your thoughts on how maybe some of the extreme weather might be affecting utilization in the first quarter, particularly as we think about Aetna's pretty high exposure to the markets like the Northeast.","Shawn M. Guertin","Scott, I don't know the exact number. I would say those are phasing over. So given that Small Group, renewals are equally distributed generally throughout the year. I would certainly think it's the minority of our Small Group plans have converted at this particular stage. Again, it's too -- it's sort of tool real-time to make that call about this year. Clearly, in the past, when we've had various weather events that have impacted some of our markets, we have seen short-term favorability as a result of that event. But again, no real commentary at this stage on what we've seen early this year.","Operator","We'll will hear next from Tom Carroll from Stifel.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So just to clarify a couple of things, Mark, on your private exchange commentary. The 90,000 ASC lives that shifted, they shifted away from Aetna or from an ASC arrangement to an Aetna private exchange?","Mark T. Bertolini","They shifted away from Aetna into the private exchange. Now we got some of those members back and 2\/3 of them were -- on the whole population, 2\/3 of the 130,000 we got back were insured.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. Got that. And then Shawn, just would you mind repeating what you said about the Medicaid enrollment for 2014?","Shawn M. Guertin","I'm sorry, I'm not -- in enrollment, I don't recall making a comment about -- oh, are you talking about my prepared remarks?","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Shawn M. Guertin","Okay, sorry.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You referred to 125,000 ASC California customers. Was that related to Medicaid?","Shawn M. Guertin","Yes. So Medicaid membership will be down, and again, the biggest driving piece of that is the exit from a low-revenue ASC-type contract in California, which would account for 125,000 lives.","Operator","Your last question today will come from Dave Windley from Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Wanted to ask about your Small Group margin included in your 2014 guidance? As you pointed out several times on the call, the individual profitability had gotten quite small, I think in part because of some investment. I'm wondering if similar investment is being made in Small Group in advance of that exchange opportunity opening up in 2015. Just wanted to gauge how much Small Group is contributing in '14.","Shawn M. Guertin","As we've talked about, our Small Group business certainly isn't one that I would say has produced extraordinary levels of margin. It has generally been in sort of the low to mid-single digits in the past, and that's largely where we see it performing in 2014.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, would your -- I guess, how does that compare to your ongoing expectation for margin from that book to that client segment?","Shawn M. Guertin","Again, I don't think it's all that different from margins that, ultimately, what we would see in this business.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then quick last question on, I believe from your investor day and guidance, some of the membership opportunities, perhaps, like in duals, that you have coming in over the course of '14 were not in guidance. Do I remember that correctly? And what are your views on timing and rates on duals?","Shawn M. Guertin","There was an element of the dual contracts in our guiding -- guidance. It was only a couple of hundred million plus or minus of revenue, but really, we didn't really assume any meaningful profit contribution from that business at all. There's been a couple of delays on the programs. But again, from a bottom-line impact, that won't have much impact on us in 2014 as we weren't banking on a lot from that business anyway, initially.","Thomas F. Cowhey","A transcript to the prepared portion of this call will be posted shortly on the investor information section of aetna.com where you can also find a copy of our updated guidance summary containing details of our guidance metrics, including those that were unchanged and not discussed on this call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Aetna Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cowhey, please go ahead.","Thomas F. Cowhey","Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call and Webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna, and with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark Bertolini; and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Following their prepared remarks, we will respond to your questions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this mornings press release and the reports we file with the SEC, including our 2011 Form 10-K, our first quarter 2012 Form 10-Q and our second quarter 2012 Form 10-Q, when filed. We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company's performance that are non-GAAP measures in our second quarter 2012 financial supplement and our 2012 guidance summary. These reconciliations are also available on the Investor Information section of aetna.com. Also, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited, so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","One additional item to note. We would like to take this opportunity to invite you to our 2012 Investor Conference, which will be held at The Pierre in New York City on December 12.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini","Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $1.31, a strong performance based on sustained execution on the fundamentals of our business.","Aetna's second quarter results built upon our performance in the first quarter and support the confidence we have heading into the second half of the year. Underlying these results, medical membership and revenues are growing as our value proposition is resonating in the marketplace. We are pricing with discipline.","Medical cost trends are developing consistent with our guidance. SG&A expenses are in line with our guidance as we continue to produce productivity gains and fund increased investments in growth initiatives, and capital deployment continues to be a strength. In short, we are very pleased with our second quarter and first half results. They are representative of the rigor with which we run our operations and our commitment to delivering value for our customers and shareholders.","In a few moments, Joe will review our detailed results and our updated guidance. But first, I'm going to discuss our second quarter 2012 highlights, our 2012 outlook and execution of Aetna's strategy.","Aetna's second quarter financial results exemplify our operating discipline. Aetna grew Health Care premiums by over 6% this quarter, demonstrating growth across all our lines of business. Aetna's continued pricing discipline, medical cost management and unit cost controls allowed us to deliver strong Commercial underwriting margins. This performance is evidenced by a commercial medical benefit ratio of 81.7% and the Medicare medical benefit ratio of 82.9%.","We continue to focus on striking the right balance between margin and growth with an emphasis on maintaining our high single-digit operating margin target. We ended the quarter with 18 million medical members, representing sequential growth of over 100,000 and are pleased with our membership traction across multiple business lines.","As we look forward to the remainder of 2012, we continue to expect strong operating performance. We are maintaining year-end medical membership guidance of 18.2 million members. This projected growth is produced by each of our major business lines and is driven by mid-year wins in Commercial ASC, expansion of Medicaid and projected growth in Commercial Insured and Medicare.","Based on our second quarter results and an updated outlook, we are also increasing our full year 2012 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $5 to $5.10 per share. As we think longer term, we remain focused on our goal of making health care more accessible and affordable. The recent Supreme Court decision has not changed our strategy. We continue to believe that the private sector is the engine for innovation for our health care system as we focus on improving quality, lowering costs and improving access.","Our provider collaboration models reward quality and not just activity, eliminating unnecessary redundancy in the system and ensuring consumers get superior preventive and chronic health services. At the same time, we are lowering our operating expense ratio in part by reengineering our cost structure. Consumers want intuitive solutions that are affordable and easy to access, and we are committed to delivering on these expectations. At Aetna, we are not just preparing for change, we are leading through change.","Technically, Aetna's strategy to create shareholder value focuses on 3 primary initiatives: growing the core business, driving innovation in the changing health care marketplace and deploying capital effectively.","In our core business, we continue to add talent to our leadership team to accelerate growth. Specialty products, including our Pharmacy and Behavioral Health, dental and vision, Group Insurance and consumer financial solutions businesses are an important element of our growth strategy as we see opportunities to increase the cross-selling of these products to existing and new health-plan customers.","Karen Rohan, who recently joined Aetna as an Executive Vice President, will ultimately head all of the Aetna specialty product businesses. In our core government and commercial business, we are seeing positive momentum, and our focus on profitable and sustainable growth is gaining traction.","In government services, we are pleased with our momentum across both the Medicare and the Medicaid businesses. In our Medicare business, we recently announced that a longstanding customer, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, had awarded Aetna a new fully insured group Medicare contract, effective January 2013. This contract win is early evidence of the potential revenue opportunity we have in converting Aetna's 1.2 million Medicare-eligible commercial members into a Medicare Advantage product.","At this time, we conservatively project this contract will yield incremental premiums of at least $800 million in 2013, based on the conversion of approximately 65,000 to 70,000 members. This contract, secured after a highly competitive procurement process, speaks to the strength of our group Medicare value proposition. Aetna's single integrated benefit simplifies administration and enhances benefits, while lowering costs for both plan sponsors and beneficiaries.","Eligible retirees, who moved to Aetna's Group Medicare Advantage plan, will have lower premiums, a significantly lower deductible and added benefits. We are pleased to be able to demonstrate this value to TRS and its retirees. The unique feature of this contract is that Medicare Advantage provider collaboration agreements will comprise a substantial portion of the provider network. Aetna's unique capabilities in accountable care and provider collaboration were a key differentiator in the bidding and selection process.","Meanwhile, our Medicaid business is also demonstrating strong growth. The previously announced Missouri expansion added approximately 50,000 members on July 1. We now have approximately 100,000 full-risk Medicaid members in Missouri, as we continue to build on the value we have provided there over the past 14 years. We continue to be focused on the opportunity represented by moving high-acuity population to the managed care, despite a complicated regulatory and political environment. Care for high-acuity individuals is a complex task that requires a coordinated and holistic view of the patient, local community presence and most importantly, experience.","In this regard, our capabilities in serving these high-acuity populations are gaining recognition. A recent Avalere study of dual-eligible members of Mercy Care plan in Arizona, which has been managed by Aetna's Medicaid business for 10 years, highlighted our capabilities and expertise. The study showed that compared to Medicare fee-for-service to all [ph]eligibles, Mercy's dual-eligible beneficiaries had 43% fewer in-patient days, 21% fewer readmissions and 9% fewer emergency department visits.","We remain focused on Commercial membership growth and are encouraged by the recent market response to our products. Certain customers who left Aetna to pursue alternatives, primarily focused on discounts, are returning to our integrated solutions and strengthened discount position.","Based on known wins from a strong-selling season and projections of normal levels of attrition on out-to-bid accounts, we currently project that our National Accounts membership will demonstrate modest positive growth in the first quarter of 2013. As we gain further clarity on ongoing sales opportunities, we hope to update this projection. We are pleased with this baseline outlook, which speaks to the renewed strength of our total cost value proposition and the tireless efforts of our network team to enhance our discounts position.","Moving on to our emerging businesses. As we look across America today, it is clear to us that the health care system is not working well for members with respect to quality and cost. It is disconnected. The quality of care varies unacceptably, and it is expensive. To help address these growing issues, we are driving change in how we interact with providers and consumers through our Accountable Care Solutions business.","In June, we announced the joint venture with Inova Health system named Innovation Health Plans, which will begin offering a range of health plan products in Northern Virginia on January 1, 2013. We value our unique partnership with Inova, a pre-eminent health system serving over l million individuals and seeing mutually beneficial and substantial growth opportunity over the next several years. This accountable care implementation represents a fundamentally different and advanced model of provider-insurer collaboration. The collaboration leverages Inova's care delivery, clinical expertise and engagement with the local market, along with Aetna's medical management and health insurance infrastructure.","In May, we also announced an expanded relationship with Banner Health Network in Phoenix. In addition to our previously announced ACO relationship, Aetna is deploying technology in care management, providing tools that will enable Banner to better manage care for approximately 200,000 of its patients, irrespective of the health plan to which they belong. This fee-based, risk-sharing arrangement incorporates support for approximately 50,000 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, including those under Banner's Medicare shared savings program with CMS.","Additionally, we recently signed accountable care partnerships with Hunterdon HealthCare Partners in New Jersey and Aurora Health Care in Wisconsin. We continue to execute on a strong pipeline of opportunities as we work to transform the network model and enhance patient care and outcomes. The third major component of our strategy to create shareholder value is deploying capital effectively, and we continue to be pleased with our progress on this front. Joe will provide an update on our capital actions and outlook shortly.","In summary, I am pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date performance and expect continued strong performance and execution in the second half of 2012. We remain committed to our operating model premised on financial discipline. We are seeing good momentum in National Accounts, where our value proposition is resonating; in government services, where our Medicaid business is growing and where our group Medicare business has already secured a large new contract for 2013; in Commercial Insured, where we continue to see prospects for growth; and in Accountable Care Solutions, where we are driving innovative change and have a robust pipeline, reflecting the value that providers see in our differentiated offerings.","Further, I am confident in our strategic direction, our ability to manage through the legislative and regulatory changes associated with health care reform, our ability to grow membership over the second half of 2012, our 2012 medical-cost trend outlook and our increased 2012 operating EPS projection of $5 to $5.10 a share.","I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsky to provide insight into our second quarter results and our 2012 outlook. Joe?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported operating earnings per share of $1.31 for the second quarter and $2.64 for the first 6 months of 2012. We continue to price with discipline, actively manage medical costs for superior quality and cost outcomes and strive for administrative efficiencies to deliver profitable growth for our shareholders.","We have maintained a consistent outlook for medical-cost trend as actual results continue to validate our full year projections. Premium yields are in line, resulting in a trend-yield spread consistent with our full year medical benefit ratio guidance, and we delivered a pre-tax operating margin of 9.1% in the first half, evidence of the rigor with which we manage the business and our commitment to operating excellence.","Specifically, Aetna's results were driven by solid execution on business fundamentals. We continued our revenue growth momentum this quarter, posting a 6% year-over-year increase. Our commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.7% for the quarter and 80.8% in the first half of 2012, both excellent results demonstrating our disciplined approach to underwriting margin management.","Our reserve position, which increased despite flat premiums, generated approximately $40 million before tax of favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter, which demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet.","Pre-tax operating margins were 8.9% in the quarter towards the high-end of our targeted, high single-digit range, and net subsidiary dividends were nearly $1.2 billion in the first half, putting us on track to exceed our previous full year forecast.","At the end of the second quarter, we had 18 million medical members, an increase of 114,000 members sequentially. Commercial ASC membership increased by 58,000 in the quarter, due primarily to the addition of lower revenue network access membership.","Commercial Insured membership increased by 27,000 in the quarter, driven by growth in our large group commercial risk accounts and our international business. Medicare membership increased by 15,000 in the quarter, largely a result of adding approximately 12,000 new Medicare supplement members, and Medicaid membership increased by 14,000 in the quarter, reflecting additions in existing geographies, including Delaware and Texas.","Second quarter 2012 revenue generation was strong, increasing by 6% year-over-year to $8.8 billion, primarily due to higher health care premiums and higher fees and other revenues.","The increase in Health Care premium included a net increase in Commercial premium of 3.5%, due to a 5% increase in premium yields, partially offset by volume declining by about 1.5%. The 5% increase in yields results from a 6% increase in rates, partially offset by a 1% decrease due to mix. Health Care premium also reflected a 14% increase in Medicare premium, driven by membership growth in Medicare Advantage and the addition of Genworth's Medicare Supplement business.","We posted a 20% increase in Medicaid premium, as growth in our Illinois ABD program, as well as in Delaware and Pennsylvania, more than offset the impact of the 2011 year-end exit from Connecticut.","Fees and other revenue increased by 7.9% year-over-year, primarily as a result of our 2011 acquisitions. With respect to the core business, Commercial ASC fee yields substantially offset the 4% decline in core Commercial ASC volume. The impact of Prodigy will be incorporated into year-over-year comparisons starting in the third quarter of 2012 and will result in lower reported growth rates in the fees and other revenue line item.","Our second quarter total medical benefit ratio is 82.4%, including the impact of approximately $40 million before tax of favorable prior-period reserve development. The favorable reserve development largely reflects the current year's Medicare and Commercial performance and supports our outlook on emerging health care cost trends.","Our days claims payable were 44.4 days at the end of the quarter, up 0.4 days sequentially and up 0.8 days year-over-year. Our Health Care cost payable increased approximately 2% sequentially, while premiums were flat. We continue to invest in innovation to improve health care delivery for our customers, to capitalize on opportunities for profitable growth and to improve productivity.","Our second quarter 2012 business segment operating expense ratio was 18.7%, as expected, down 40 basis points year-over-year. This reflects the continued execution of our expense initiatives and favorable shifts in our membership mix, partially offset by the addition of fee-based businesses, which have operating expense ratios higher than the company average.","Our operating expense ratio for our insured Health Care business was 11.2% in the quarter, an improvement of 90 basis points year-over-year. The final area of financial performance I will comment on relates to our investment portfolio, management of capital and cash flow generation.","Second quarter net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $146 million, as declining yields continued to create downward pressure on earnings. At June 30, the continuing business portfolio had a net unrealized gain position of approximately $1.2 billion before tax and is well positioned from a risk perspective.","Our capital generation was very strong in the quarter. We started the quarter with $100 million in liquidity at the parent. Net dividends from subsidiaries were $535 million. We issued $750 million in new debt securities at highly attractive coupon rates. We repurchased 13.8 million shares for $581 million. We paid down $150 million in commercial paper and after $260 million in other net uses, including our shareholder dividend, interest expense and other settlements with subsidiaries, we ended the quarter with $400 million of liquidity at the parent. Our basic share count was 334.2 million at June 30.","Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity, all continued to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 31.5%. We continue to target a risk-based capital ratio of approximately 300% of company-action level.","Operating cash flow generation was strong for the first 6 months. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow was approximately 1.3x operating earnings for the first 6 months.","Moving to our 2012 outlook. We are now projecting operating earnings per share of $5 to $5.10. Our revised operating EPS guidance range reflects a lower projected share count, our solid performance in the first half and higher-projected investment spending in the back half of the year. Our guidance also implies that slightly greater than 50% of our operating earnings per share will have occurred in the first half of the year.","We continue to project year-end medical membership of 18.2 million members. This is driven by the 114,000 medical members we added in the second quarter, as well as projected third and fourth quarter additions to our Commercial ASC membership and a significant ramp in Medicaid membership.","In Commercial ASC, we project adding approximately 100,000 members. This includes the state of Maine account, which added over 30,000 members on July 1. In Medicaid, we expect to add approximately 75,000 members through the end of the year. This includes our new Missouri contract, which added approximately 50,000 members on July 1.","We also continue to project growth in our Commercial Insured and Medicare businesses by the end of the year. Our projected commercial medical benefit ratio and Medicare medical benefit ratio guidance remains unchanged. Aetna's 2012 Commercial MBR projections reflect underlying medical-cost trends that we expect to be 6.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, and is unchanged from the guidance we gave at our Investor Conference in December.","Higher utilization remains the primary driver of the projected 2012 trend increase. The projected components of our 2012 trend guidance also remains unchanged. In the outpatient category, we continue to see upward pressure year-over-year, and we currently project outpatient trends for 2012 will be at the upper end of our guidance range. However, this increase in outpatient trend has been largely offset by inpatient medical costs, which represent a higher percentage of medical spend and are trending at the low end of our projected range.","As we have previously noted, physician and pharmacy trends are both up year-over-year, driven primarily by higher physician visits and specialty pharmaceutical spending, respectively. Both the physician and pharmacy trend categories are well within our guidance ranges.","While guidance for our 2012 business segment operating expense ratio remains 18.5% to 19%, we believe we are likely to be at the higher end of the range on a full year basis, reflecting incremental investments and growth opportunities. These investments include: enhanced infrastructure spending to service newly won 2013 contracts, including TRS; expenditures to benefit our Medicare businesses, including investments to enhance our star ratings; and accelerated spending in our Accountable Care Solutions business, as we continue to focus on transforming the network model.","Despite this incremental spending, our 2011 voluntary early retirement program and other expense initiatives are projected to help reduce the impact of seasonal expense increases in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. We continue to expect our business segment operating expense ratio to be sequentially higher in each of the third and fourth quarters relative to our second quarter result.","For 2012, we are now projecting net dividends from subsidiaries of approximately $1.8 billion and deployable capital of approximately $1.45 billion. This increase of $100 million from our previous guidance is due to continued strong capital management.","Considering our repurchases in the first 6 months in capital guidance, we have updated our share count guidance to a range of approximately 344 million to 347 million weighted-average shares.","As we look to the remainder of the year, we would expect that sequential operating earnings per share will be higher in the third quarter. Further, we project that operating EPS in the fourth quarter of 2012 will be lower than our third quarter result. This is a function of the quarterly progression of our business, where medical costs tend to be the highest in the second and fourth quarters and where administrative spending will increase to support open enrollment toward the end of the year.","For the full year 2012, we are confident in our projection of a pre-tax operating margin of 8.5% to 9%, approximately $1.75 billion of operating earnings and operating earnings per share of $5 to $5.10.","The fundamentals of Aetna's business remain strong, and we are committed to maintaining our operational vigilance. Looking beyond 2012, we believe we have the winning strategy in the marketplace. We will continue to focus on adapting to the dynamic forces that are reshaping our industry, driving transformation of the network model to our Accountable Care Solutions business, enhancing and growing our government services businesses and striving for operational excellence and cost containment.","As we execute on our vision, we believe that growth in our core business, supplemented by our emerging businesses and effective capital deployment, will enable us to generate low, double-digit operating earnings per share growth on average over time.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas F. Cowhey","Thank you, Joe. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, just wanted to get an update on your views on the commercial pricing environment. Clearly, it's been a pretty volatile earnings season for MCOs. And maybe just talk about -- is your view that the commercial pricing environment remains relatively similar to what we've been seeing the last couple of quarters? Or have you seen more intensified price competition as we think about July renewals and then heading into 2013?","Mark T. Bertolini","Thanks, Scott. Mark here. A couple of points. I think the market remains rational and competitive. That's what we're seeing in the marketplace. But as we get to the bottom of the trend deceleration, start to see trend move up, I think the trends are so low and the pricing is so close that it's really hard to move clients. And so I would expect that you would see across the industry, except for people that our repricing the books of business, that their retention levels are going to be fairly high. So the ability to move business on the basis of pricing is very limited. So therefore, I would say from that standpoint, it's harder in the marketplace to move business.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I just wanted to ask a follow-up and ask a question on your views on strategic M&A relative to Medicare and Medicaid. Clearly, now we've seen CIGNA acquire HealthSpring and WellPoint acquire Amerigroup. And just want to get your sense on how you feel your Medicare and Medicaid platforms are positioned at this point. And clearly, I did notice that you repurchased shares pretty aggressively in the second quarter. So maybe how does that contemplate your thoughts on strategic M&A as well?","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, strategic M&A continues to be very important for us. As we look, going forward in the marketplace, we think it's appropriate to consider organic growth in membership in the 2% to 2.5% range. And as we look to other segments of the business that might be interesting to us, we always consider whether or not there are opportunities. I will be very clear on this call, again, as I am in most analyst meetings. We are not interested in bulking up the Medicaid, particularly at the current PEs and the current prices of those assets.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","And Scott, with respect to the share repurchases, I would just say that we really accelerated our annual allocation to share repurchases on the weakness in the stock price after the first quarter report. It was nothing more than that.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Question just relates to investment spending. I think, Joe, you had mentioned that your guidance includes a higher level of investment spending. So I'm just curious if there was a way to quantify that. And maybe within that bucket, how much is part of the ACS strategy?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Josh, we're going to give you a fuller accounting of our emerging business and ACS strategy at our Investor Day. But for now, I would say that the spending on implementing the TRS account and one other very large installation, enhancements to our star ratings program and accelerated spending in ACS, approximated $50 million of additional pre-tax spending in our forecast. But we'll give you a fuller accounting of the breakout of that, particularly with respect to ACS in December.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And the $50 million, you're saying that's incremental relative to your guidance from 3 months ago.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","That is correct.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- could you give us the PPRD by segment, that $40 million, how much was Commercial? And I think you said it was Commercial and Medicare, how much was in each bucket?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","We haven't broken that out, Josh. So we're just saying the $40 million was across both Medicare and  Commercial.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Was there one that was slightly more than the other?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Yes, Medicare was slightly more than Commercial.","Operator","We'll go next to Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So again following up on the Commercial loss ratio, you've gone from 77.9 to 81.7. But it's about a 380-bp deterioration year-over-year. Computing you have about 330 bps from reserve releases being lower, I think it was like $165 million or something like that last year. Is the rest of it just that your spread is now coming in negative? Or is there something around broker commissions being passed through net of MLR rebates. And then just to take that a step further, if it is negative, is there any intent to bring it back in line or even more positive going forward in your renewals for 2013?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Ana, a couple of points. If you go back to the bridge we provided at our Investor Day last December, you will note that we bridged you from the 77.9 Commercial MBR result for 2011 in the following way: 80 basis points was the significant positive development that occurred in 2011; 30 basis points changes to the commission structure, as we decoupled commissions from the premium structure; and a 250-basis-point increase was the reversion to the mean. As the experience-rated book of business renews and you've over performed, you can still hold to your target margins and credit some of that favorable experience back to customers. What you're seeing in our actual results is the manifestation of that strategy.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So it's all about the experience rated you're seeing. So to offset that, though, going forward is your intent to keep it negative so you'll see continuously deteriorating Commercial margins sequentially...","Mark T. Bertolini","Ana, our intention is to price to a medical cost -- is to price to a margin of high single digits across our book of business. And so we have maintained that. We have a high single-digit margin. Part of the pullback was the experience rated. But we will continue to price to that high single-digit margin.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And just to finalize then, I think when you talked to Scott, Mark, you said that it's hard to move business. So is -- I mean, I'm trying to understand, does that mean there is no point in softening pricing? So it's basically staying the same? Or not?","Mark T. Bertolini","I lost the end of your question there, Ana.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm trying to understand what the -- I don't think I got what you said when you said that the pricing story is it's very hard to move business in this weak trend environment. Does that mean there's no point in pricing down? Is that what you're saying?","Mark T. Bertolini","There's never any point in pricing down. From our perspective, we always are on the side of margin over membership. So as we said last quarter, when we were describing why we were so careful on reserves is that we are finding bottom. We wanted to have a soft landing on top of trend going through this year and into 2013, and we think we've accomplished that and demonstrated that with the return of prior-period development in the second quarter. So there is, in our opinion, never any opportunity to underprice in the market to gather membership for 2 reasons. One, it's very hard to get that back in trend. Over time, you have to price up to do that. It's almost impossible now with rate review and 10% limits on some of those rate reviews to get that through some of the insurance commissioners, if you're really catching up on trend. So I think it's -- it would not be wise to price down.","Operator","We'll go next to Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question. Just in terms of -- Joe, you've mentioned the high single-digit target margin. It looks likes your guidance embeds something in the neighborhood of 8.9%, 9% for this year. Any reason to think that number isn't kind of right in that sweet spot of high single-digits and therefore, should be sustainable -- what you're doing this year should be sustainable into 2013, given what we know?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","We believe so. And I'll point to the first half and the full year metrics. If you can settle at a Commercial MBR in the low 80s, produce high single-digit margins at current mix, grow again as we started to do in the second quarter, which takes pressure off the SG&A ratio, I think that high single-digit margins at current product mix is sustainable for the foreseeable future.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then just switching over, thinking about -- looking at 2013 and pricing. Given the cost trends have clearly appeared to uptick within what most people have priced for, not everybody, but most people, do you expect yourselves and the market, and more specifically yourselves, to price the cost trend again, likely being higher in 2013 than it was in 2012? And should we think about a similar order of magnitude as the 2012 was up from 2011?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Well, Justin, we have not given a medical trend forecast for 2013. We probably will start talking about that on our third quarter earnings call because then -- by then, we'll be into the renewal season when that information becomes more relevant.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Is there any view in terms of what you're seeing early on? I know you're very big in the large group space, for instance, where those renewals take place during the summer. Anything you're seeing in terms of '13 renewals that gives you any confidence that people or the market's pricing with any level of conservatism or at least not pricing more aggressively for '13 than what you saw in the same period last year?","Mark T. Bertolini","We still see the market is rational. But again, I'll make the comment. Because we're at the low point of trend across a number of products and trend is rising, it is tight to be able to get clients to move. So I think what I would describe the market as is still competitive and rational but harder to move business.","Operator","We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things. One, we had thought that acquisitions based on your return hurdles would be $0.20 to $0.25 accretive in 2013 relative to 2012. Are we still on track for that?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","I think -- Christine, this is Joe. The last time we updated you on our acquisitions and their impact on 2012, we said they would be 9 -- you're talking about '13, they'd be $0.09 accretive this year. And we also provided some guidance at that time that said that once the integration costs burn off and once the synergies begin to be realized, they will be significantly more accretive in the future. So we haven't given a specific number for 2013. But we will, as we get into that 2014 forecast period later this year. But you're thinking about it the right way. Integration costs will burn off. Synergies will be realized. But I will tell you this, every single one of those acquisitions we executed last year is performing according to plan.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I know you're not giving 2013 guidance. But you're saying you expect an increase of low double digit in operating earnings over time. Is there any reason that wouldn't be the case for 2013?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","They're low double-digit operating earnings per share over time.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Right. Is there any reason that wouldn't be the case in 2013?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","That's our long-term goal, on average per year, on average over time.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the crediting [ph] back to the customers, it looks like trend upticked in '12. So is it reasonable to think the credit back to the customers would be less than 250?","Mark T. Bertolini","There was an uptick in trend from 2012 because we said it was less than 5.5 last year, and we're now at 6.5, plus or minus 50 basis points. But when you're pricing into the market, you're pricing ahead of that trend change with that trend in mind. So we gave them back and what's reflected in our MBRs is what we put into pricing.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it's probably a wash.","Mark T. Bertolini","We're performing to that.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just -- in looking at some of the moving parts on guidance for this year, it looks like the additional share repurchase is worth about $0.09. Conversely, the $50 million in spend is also worth about $0.09. I wanted to get your agreement or disagreement on that. And then you had some favorable development in 2Q, which would seem to at least account for the change in your EPS guidance for the full year. Have I gotten those things right? And am I missing a major point that you would add?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No. You're pretty close. I would look at it this way. Our previous guidance is $5 per share. The lower share count is approximately $0.10 earnings per share for the year. Our first half performance, all in, under -- particularly underwriting margin, I would add $0.05 to $0.10, and the higher investment spending will cost us $0.10 to $0.15. And if you just all -- add up the bottom and high end of all of those ranges, you'll get to $5 to $5.10.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then on the investment spending, in particular, how should we think about the leverage that you can get from that over time? I know in -- to one of the earlier questions, Joe, you talked about returning to membership growth, getting leverage on the SG&A. But in the case of this year, as you get that membership growth you're now making investment spending to support that. And so I wanted to understand, at what point do you get membership growth that you don't have to invest to support?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","That's a great question. It really is about growing the core membership, more Commercial HMO, PPO, Medicare, Medicaid business that leverages our core infrastructure. And I'll point you to one statistic that's quite stark. Back in 2008, '09, when we were at close to 19 million members, our SG&A ratio was 17.6%. And you could pretty much map out the -- per-million members, how many basis points of improvement or degradation that results in. So we're pretty comfortable that if we can begin growing the core Commercial Medicare and Medicaid books once again, that we will return to the positive fixed-cost leverage that we enjoyed during that period of time.","Operator","We'll go to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If we assume your pricing has been maybe more stable relative to cost than others and others were perhaps pricing maybe too aggressively and that caused some of your membership declines over the past year and maybe is causing their earnings missteps this year, would you say that, that means that pricing is likely to firm next year, given what -- that others are experiencing problems and maybe you're sticking to sort of more relatively stable pricing?","Mark T. Bertolini","I think the way we would look at it, Peter, is that for 2010, specifically, and most of 2011, our pricing provided an umbrella for the industry because we were priced up. And that created some movement of membership and that is where some of the perceived organic growth -- and we would classify that as almost inorganic when people shed membership and it comes over to you. But that perceived organic growth came from in the industry. And so we believe that the baseline for the industry on organic growth is 2% to 2.5%. And so therefore, we would see, depending on how people react to the underperformance on their pricing in the next year and what they're able to get in price increases through the regulatory framework will determine how -- whether or not pricing firms up.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Have you started to see any signs of firming pricing in the small group area, which reprices [ph] more regularly throughout the year rather than the national accounts?","Mark T. Bertolini","We see it in some markets and not in others. And I think that is something that you'll have to see over time, as this performance works its way through people's pricing models. Remember, even in small group you're pricing well ahead of the quarter. In a lot of markets, you're almost 90 days in front of your pricing impact once you figure out you've got a problem. So even in small group it takes some time to put those prices in the market. Not always can you get all of the pricing that you need in the marketplace. So I think we have more time to see this mature and will -- it depends on how our competitors respond.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last question. You've done a number of acquisitions over the past few years, sort of filling gaps in sort of your product offering. Are we going to start to see some accretion more visible from these acquisitions over the next couple of years helping your earnings? And how do we go about looking at that?","Mark T. Bertolini","I think you'll start to see it as a result of some of the modeling we will give you at the Investor Conference in December around how we see the ACS opportunity influencing not only that business but more importantly, the core business. We're already seeing membership growth come out of those models. We'll give you better visibility on that membership and what we see for next year and how to model it and follow us as we go forward. So the December conference, you'll start to see a lot more visibility on that. We needed to see some of this strategy work its way through the market in reality so that we could model it more effectively, so that we could give you insights that you could rely on.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In December, will we actually see earnings accretion? Or will it be more about spending and sort of advancing these initiatives further?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","We will show you how these assets will generate earnings for us.","Operator","And we'll go next to Melissa McGinnis, MS.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Going back to an earlier question on the Commercial MLR bridge. If we kind of think about the adjustments last year for development reported in Q2 and then even Q2 development reported in Q3, it would seem like the underlying MLR Q2 '11 jumping off point was more like a 78.6%, meaning we saw about 310 basis points of year-over-year. The duration in the underlying MLR, what adjustment are you maybe not making? Or in fact, are we seeing that 280 deterioration that's coming in a little bit higher and more towards the 300 or 310 level?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Well, Melissa, I couldn't follow all your specific numbers quite frankly. But I think the bridge I gave before is absolutely emblematic of the result we've produced, that the development in any quarter of last year was significantly in excess of development this year. So when we gave you the development bridge, we gave it to you net. We have the changes to the commission structure. And the biggest piece, bears repeating, is literally the reversion to the mean and crediting favorable experience in 2011 back to experience-rated customers. That's what you're seeing in our reported MBRs. And with the result we just posted, the 81.7%, which is 80.8% for the first half, and we've guided to 81.5% for the full year, we think that's a very, very prudent forecast and a result that we fully anticipated.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So just to be clear, because you guys provided a slide at Investor Day Conferences that you're kind of at 290 versus at 280 in Q1. But now you feel like you're kind of falling out more around your 280, that you had expected. Looking at the 30 from commissions and the 250 from the experience rated.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Yes, I think that's accurate.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess more a strategic question that goes to maybe some of your peers pricing commentary as well. Aetna has actually been doing a lot of these provider partnerships and various markets allowing you to enter some markets with some new unique product offering, thinking about like the Carilion offering in Virginia. Can you provide us just any color or even quantification of how much some of those provider partnerships can help a cost structure and then how much that might pull through into a pricing advantage relative to like the average price point of products in a marketplace?","Mark T. Bertolini","So it's way early. We only have a few of these out in the marketplace, and we're working through the performance of those. But generally, it gives us a 10% to 15% premium advantage in the marketplace.","Operator","We'll go next to Carl McDonald with Citi.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It looks like an anomaly in your first half results relative to other companies in the sense that you guys have maintained stable pricing but been able to keep the risk enrollment relatively steady, whereas pretty much across the board, every other competitor, whether they've said they've priced stable or priced a little bit more aggressively, has lost several hundred thousand lives in the risk business. So I'd be interested in your perspective, is it really just the international segment where you're seeing some growth and that's offsetting risk losses? Or is there some other dynamic going on there?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Carl, there is some growth in our middle market segment. The middle market segment is one of the engines that drives the value of this business, and we had decent growth in the middle market segment in addition to international.","Mark T. Bertolini","In the middle market segment, Carl, is where you would find the experience-rated pricing impacts. So people are seeing some opportunity in that because the pricing, you have to get back some of that experience from the prior years. So that middle market segment would be a place for their pricing will be different than they what they would see otherwise in the market.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then a follow-on question. Just if you can reset us in terms of where cost trends were and what you're seeing. So if you were less than 5.5% for the full year last year, where did you end the year? And where have you run in the first half of the year versus that 6.5% guidance? Basically, we're just trying to get a sense of -- are you seeing cost trends accelerate as we go through the year? Did you see cost trends step up on January 1 and then they're stable? Any color there?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Well, Carl, we give in -- full year annual guidance on medical cost trend, which remains 6.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. We do not parse that by quarter because you get all kinds of artifacts and days intensity and leap years and all types of things. But I think it's fair to say, is all of the major medical cost categories are performing within guidance ranges. And we feel very good about our full year forecast.","Mark T. Bertolini","And the 2012 number came in where we expected it to be. Our baseline is where we expected it.","Operator","We'll go to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You guys talked about growing the National Accounts modestly next year, that's clearly a positive. I think the last quarter, the commentary seemed a little bit more bullish. I think you talked about the business opportunity twice what it was and only had minimal account losses. Are -- is this a little bit of a change in tone? Or am I reading into that? Or does it go back to your comment about how hard it is to move business in this environment?","Mark T. Bertolini","I don't think there's any change in tone. Remember, we lost over 500,000 members in the first quarter of last year. So modest positive growth is quite a change based on what we saw in the prior year related to attrition and growth. So, no I don't think there's any indication. It's still early. I think National Accounts are still clearing late like they did the prior year. So for the last couple of years, we're seeing decisions made much later in the year than we otherwise would have.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And could you just talk a little bit more about the investment spending in the second half. I think in the prepared comments you mentioned spending thick on your contracts, MSR [ph] and then accelerating Accountable Care Solutions but then later on it sounded like it was mostly Accountable Care Solutions is the biggest driver to the ride. Can you talk -- is that the right way to think about it? And if so, what really caused your move to accelerate those investments? And how should we think about returns on that investment into 2013?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Well, I think -- the first thing I would say is we did accelerate the spending on our Accountable Care Solutions business. And the reason is the early-stage pipeline is a lot deeper than we ever anticipated. The level of excitement and enthusiasm on our fully integrated technology stack is quite extraordinary. So we did accelerate that. But no, I would say that with respect to compliant spending, ICD-10, exchanges, Health Care Reform, et cetera, I'll remind you that we previously guided that from a GAAP expense point of view, that will cost us over $100 million this year and $200 million in cash, which is the -- includes the capitalized value of some of those investments. So we continue to spend on reform, ICD-10 and a lot of these compliance initiatives. But the headline increase from a growth investment point of view is clearly Accountable Care Solutions. And it's the size of the pipeline that we're responding to that drove it.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, Mark, your comments earlier made it sound like you don't think there's a significant amount of risk to margin contraction in 2013 based upon what you're seeing in the pricing environment. I mean, clearly, the markets -- has been concerned about that risk the last couple of weeks. So can you just give a little bit more color around what gives you confidence to talk about that the way you did?","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, I think, it -- again, as I said, it depends on how our competitors respond and the underpricing that they've seen in the market, whether or not that creates firming in the marketplace around pricing. And so I -- we will continue to be disciplined with our pricing. We'll price to our high single-digit target margins as we go into 2013. I think another thing sitting out there that I think a lot of people need to think about is 2014. And the big impacts that we'll see around rating changes, around the taxes that go into the system and the rate check that, that's going to create in the marketplace. Get too far behind, you're going to have a hard time catching up in 2014 as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just a question on the Medicare Advantage. Can you remind us of the split there in terms of group versus retail? And then, when you look out to next year and how you just bid [ph], is the focus really to stay on the group side? Or are you looking to more meaningfully grow on the retail side of the business?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Well, 70% of our Medicare Advantage book of business is group. We like that business because it leverages our distribution capability, both the National Accounts and government and labor. We tend to have good visibility into the medical-cost trends because we've managed those populations on an ASC basis for a number of years, and we like sort of the group underwriting aspects of that business. It's a very stable, well-performing business. We continue to be bullish on the individual Medicare Advantage business that represents 30% of the book of business, and we're doing well there this year as well.","Mark T. Bertolini","I would also note that our individual Medicare business is built off of an HMO platform. So that's why we don't -- we grow it where we believe we have good network controls and cost controls.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, just to follow up on a number of earlier questions. But Mark, you said you definitely believe trend is rising. And I guess, I know you don't want to give any guidance on 2013. But if you look at the 6% to 7% trend for this year, is there any reason to believe why that wouldn't be higher next year?","Mark T. Bertolini","I think it's too early to tell, although we have some pricing into the marketplace and we put trend  into pricing going forward. But there are a lot of things that can happen with the fiscal cliff and a number of things around the economy come next year that we're watching very carefully. Because major economic disruptions can create major inflection points in trend, depending on employment and a whole host of other things. So I think we're watching all of that carefully, and we are being careful with our pricing as we go into 2013.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Let me just continue on the theme that others have asked on pricing and a high-level question, if I could, which is, if trend has bottomed and we're now in a somewhat rising trend environment, and as you say 2013 it isn't clear where things will go. But how do you think about the risk at this point, given the precedent that, correct me if I'm wrong, but every other instance of trend bottoming and rising has resulted in some pretty severe margin compression across the industry, if I think back, going back 30 years, I guess?","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, Matt, I think it depends. This environment is much different than it has been in the past, again, with the specter of Health Care Reform in front of us. And so I think people have generally been careful because if you don't get your rate increases, pricing up the way we used to in the past is almost impossible. And there are certain states, for example, like California, where getting a rate increase through is a battle almost every quarter, and with a lot of publicity. So I think people understand that and they're being very careful about their pricing. And it would be prudent not to get aggressive on pricing, particularly going into 2014.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, no. That all makes sense. I guess, a different but maybe related question. On your experience-rated books, do you think that competitors see your -- or somehow see your rate adjustments there and perceive that you're pricing aggressively in some cases, when in fact, what you're doing is reflecting your annual adjustment with those experience-rated accounts?","Mark T. Bertolini","I don't think they'd see it because it's on renewal, Matt. So it's not in our new business pricing. It's on our renewal pricing. And that's a conversation between us and each client. Now they may be trying to figure out why they have to price so low to try to get the client to move, but that's more of hunting and pecking in the dark than anything else.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last on the M&A front. I heard what you said on some of the sort of bulk-up on Medicaid. What are you -- what's coming to the fore in -- or you think will come to the fore in terms of consolidation opportunities in managed care? Are you talking to a lot of small plans? Are they more or less interested -- or are people in -- are people paralyzed ahead of the elections in November?","Mark T. Bertolini","No, I don't people are paralyzed. I think everybody's dance card has been pretty full for dinners and lunches throughout the marketplace, and there's been a lot of conversation going on. I think we're running up against a very real temporal barrier with mid-year next year. Unless you can get something done by mid-year or third quarter next year, you start running into the jeopardy of trying to integrate something while you're pricing into a whole new environment. So I think you're going to see a lot of pencils down near the end of this year, because it's going to be too -- a little too crazy to be integrating way into that process. So you've got to get something closed and done in the second quarter or earlier.","Thomas F. Cowhey","Thanks, Matt.

And welcome to the Aetna Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. As a remainder, this conference is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cowhey, please go ahead.","Tom Cowhey","Good morning. And thank you for joining Aetna's fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings call and webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna and with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions. Karen Rohan, Aetna's President will join Mark and Shawn for the Q&A session.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statement. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K, our 2014 Form 10-Qs and our 2014 Form 10-K when filed.","We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company's performance that are non-GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2014 Financial Supplement and our updated 2014 Guidance Summary. Copies of which are available on the Investor Information section of aetna.com.","Finally, as you know, our ability to response to certain increase from investors and analyst in non-public forum is limited, so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark Bertolini","Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we\u2019ve reported full year 2014 operating EPS of $6.70, representing a record results for the company, the high-end of our previous annual projection, year-over-year growth in excess of 7% and an operating EPS CAGR of 15% since 2010.","Looking back on 2014, we solved the price for nearly $1 billion of new fees and taxes, achieved pretax margins in excess of our initial 2014 projections, accelerated Coventry synergies, achieving a run rate in 2014 that will deliver at least $0.90 of operating EPS accretion in 2015, closing out our commitments to shareholders, enrolled nearly 600,000 public exchange members, while exceeding our initial profitability projections in this new program, bolstered our consumer platform through the acquisition of bSwift and continued to advance our efforts to shift the network model for patient-centric population health management.","Our 2014 results are a testament to the strength of our leadership team and the execution of our growth strategy. Underlying these full year results, we ended the year with more than 23.5 million medical members, well in excess of our previous projections and representing full year growth of approximately 1.4 million members.","We reported record operating revenue of nearly $58 billion, including organic growth of approximately 13% across multiple lines of business. We reported a full year Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio that absent our conservative stance on our ACA compliant block of business and higher than projected flu would have been at the low-end of our previous 2014 projections.","Our full year Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio of 80.2% was a very good result, as aggregate commercial medical cost trend increases remain moderate and our 51 to 300 employee block performed consistent with our previous projection.","Our operating expense ratio, excluding the impact of Healthcare Reform fees and taxes improved by 100 basis points, as we grew operating revenue and continued to focus on synergy realization.","Finally, we generated strong cash flow in 2014, which enabled us to continue to invest in our growth strategy, closed two acquisitions, pay down debt, increase our shareholder dividend and still repurchase $1.2 billion of our shares.","Our strong finish to 2014 in combination with our strong start to 2015 gives us the confidence this morning to increase our 2015 operating EPS projection to at least $7 per share. As always, this projection does not include any projection of prior year development and represents approximately 13% growth over 2014 results, when prior year development is excluded.","In a moment, Shawn, will discuss our 2014 results and 2015 guidance in greater detail, but first, I would like to discuss Aetna's growth strategy and how we are executing on that strategy.","At our Investor Conference in December we highlighted the multiple avenues we have to drive top and bottomline growth. Specifically, we discussed a stability of our large group commercial businesses and the ability of these businesses to continue to produce attractive returns and generate capital.","The growth of our Government franchise and the potential for sustained growth in the future, and the opportunity for additional growth in our individual business as exchanges continued to evolve.","Additionally, we discussed our continued efforts to health agenda transform the network model from one of episodic care to population health management and our strategy to lead the industry toward a more consumer-oriented marketplace.","I will now provide a brief update on how we are executing against some of these growth levers. Starting with our large group commercial business, 2014 was another solid year, as most of our large group commercial businesses met or exceeded our initial projections.","In particular our fee-based businesses had an outstanding year. We grew Commercial ASC membership by over 700,000 members for the year and exceeded our initial operating projection.","These results demonstrate the ability of our large group commercial businesses to continue to generate solid returns and to provide capital to reinvest for the benefit of our customers and shareholders.","Moving onto Government business, our Medicare franchise continues to be a key component of our strategy to grow our Government business and our 2014 results speak to our successes in this business.","During 2014, we grew our Medicare Advantage membership by almost 18% and our Medicare Supplement membership by nearly 20%, results were well in excess of our industry growth.","Additionally, we just completed another highly successful Medicare annual enrollment period, where growth exceeded our initial projections. We now project to grow our Medicare Advantage membership by 90,000 members in the first quarter, including double-digit percentage growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership.","A key driver of Aetna's Medicare Advantage membership growth trajectory has been our star ratings. For the second year in a row, approximately 80% of our sales have come through plans rated four stars or greater.","Continuing with Government, our Medicaid business has had an excellent year in 2014. Underlying the strong performance, we grew medical membership by over 100,000 members in 2014, including over 11,000 members related to our participation in multiple dual eligible demonstration projects. We grew premium revenue by over 60% and operating earnings exceeded our initial projections, driven by better underwriting margins in several of our key geographies and a strong prior year development.","Looking forward despite the previously disclosed exit from our Delaware Medicaid contract, we project 2015 to be another strong year of topline growth for our Medicaid franchise, driven primarily by growth from serving dual eligible and other high acuity populations.","Shifting to public exchanges, we are pleased with our first year execution, particularly in light of the well-publicized challenges with the initial launch of the public exchanges. We ended the year with approximately 560,000 on exchange members, modestly ahead of our most recent projections.","Additionally, while the open enrollment period is still ongoing, we are on track to exceed our initial enrollment projections for 2015. Further, we have successfully transitioned the vast majority of our Off Exchange membership to ACA compliant plans consistent with our previous projections.","As we look at our total individual business, we now project that we will end the first quarter with approximately 1.1 million members, including up to 800,000 on exchange members. We believe these strong results validate our strategy of focusing on geographies where we have a competitive cost structure and could provide the greatest value to potential customers.","As we enter the second year of this emerging marketplace, we are cautiously optimistic on the potential for public exchanges to develop into an attractive growth opportunity, where we continue to offer value to our customers and generate a reasonable return for our shareholders.","Let me now spend a few moments discussing our provider transformation efforts. We continue to advance our strategy of collaborating with providers to build a simpler, more integrated healthcare system. And we continue to make great strides as we signed contracts with 28 new ACO partners since year-end 2013, launched multiple new products backed by ACO contracts, doubled our membership covered by value-based contracts to more than 3 million members, and increased the percent of our medical costs that run through value-based contracts to 28% of total spend.","As we continue to focus incentives around improving the health of our members and lowering overall costs, we are moving closer to our healthcare system that rewards providers for keeping people healthy and ultimately more productive. Finally, in 2014, we continue to advance our strategy to become a more consumer-oriented company. For example, in the fourth quarter, we closed the bSwift acquisition.","This transaction was an important step forward as it accelerates our efforts to create the leading front-end by sharpened enroll capabilities necessary to drive the change to a more consumer-oriented marketplace. Additionally, bSwift adds backend eligibility and benefits of administration, an important element for our employer customers as they look to make the transition to divine contribution in private exchange models.","Combined with the other investments, we have been making including our efforts to transform the provider network models for our health insurance business, our investments in building a new modular administration platform and consumer facing tools like iTriage, we are not only preparing for the shift to define contribution in consumer-oriented models, we are positioning to drive it.","In summary, as we reflect on the many challenges that we face as a company and an industry last year, our 2014 results demonstrate strong financial fundamentals and execution against our growth strategies. As we begin 2015, I am confident in our strategic direction and the ability to execute the multiple growth opportunities ahead that Aetna is well-positioned to capitalize on and our updated 2015 operating EPS projection of at least $7 per share.","I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our fourth quarter and full-year results and our updated 2015 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn Guertin","Thank you Mark and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported full year 2014 operating earnings of $2.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $6.70, results at the high-end of our most recent projections and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2014. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong operating fundamentals as evidenced by double-digit organic revenue growth, robust cash flow, healthy balance sheet metrics and achievement of target operating margins.","I\u2019ll begin with some comments on our overall full year 2014 performance. We grew medical membership by approximately 1.4 million members to more than 23.5 million members ending the year approximately 100,000 members higher than our previous projection as a result of stronger than projected December renewals, primarily in small group accounts.","We grew operating revenue by 23% to a record $58 billion driven by double-digit organic revenue growth across multiple lines of business and the full year impact of the Coventry acquisition. Our full-year Government medical benefit ratio was 84.9%, a very good result and a testament to the execution of our strategy to solve for the meaningful rate cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in 2014, combined with continued strong performance of our Medicaid business.","We improved our full year operating expense ratio by 100 basis points, excluding the impact of ACA related fees, driven by higher operating revenues and continued discipline in controlling costs. Finally, we generated over $1.5 billion in dividends from subsidiaries and returned an equal amount to shareholders in the form of shareholder dividends and share repurchases.","Looking more specifically at the fourth quarter results, we grew operating revenue by over 12% versus the same quarter last year to $14.8 billion driven primarily by membership growth in our Government and Commercial businesses. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses continue to perform quite well.","Our fourth quarter total medical benefit ratio was 83%, a good overall result and a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Our operating expense ratio increased from the same period last year to 19.7%. However, excluding ACA fees from our expenses, our operating expense ratio was essentially flat with the prior year quarter.","Our pretax operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter and 7.6% for the year consistent with our target operating margin range. This result represent Aetna's fifth consecutive year of achieving or exceeding this goal despite an increasing mix of Government and public exchange businesses and the many challenges that faced our industry in 2014.","From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across our commercial, Medicaid and Medicare products, primarily attributable to third quarter 2014 dates of service.","Our reserve growth kept pace with premium growth and days claims payable were 49.2 days at the end of the quarter, down marginally from the third quarter, primarily as a result of processing improvements but up over four days year-over-year.","Turning to cash flow and capital, operating cash flows remain strong. Our full year Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.5 times of operating earnings. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing approximately 3 million shares in the quarter for $243 million and distributing approximately $79 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend.","In summary, our fourth quarter results demonstrate the execution of Aetna's growth strategy, the success of the Coventry integration and the value of our diversified portfolio. I will now discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter performance in greater detail.","Beginning with our commercial business, our commercial membership declined by approximately 70,000 members during the quarter, driven by declines in our individual and small group insured books, partially offset by modest ASC membership growth. These results were consistent with our commitment to financially responsible pricing, where we favor margin over membership and price to projected underlying medical cost trends.","Our commercial medical benefit ratio was 82% for the quarter and 80.2% for the full year 2014, a good absolute result and consistent with our previous projections despite pressures from an early and more severe flu season. Importantly, the medical cost performance of our core commercial business and specifically, our 51 to 300 employee block, perform consistent with the projections we described on our third quarter 2014 earnings call.","Additionally, Aetna's commercial MBR was influenced by our continued prudent stance with regard to our ACA compliant blocks of business. Based on the most recent data available, we have adjusted our accruals related to the 3Rs during the fourth quarter. Specifically, we recorded $176 million of incremental reinsurance recoverable during the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $338 million.","We recorded additional net payables for the risk adjustors of $78 million, bringing the net full year total to $230 million. And we did not record any risk corridor receivables as of December 31, 2014. However in select geographies, we have recorded a modest risk quarter payable where our current projections indicate we will be required to contribute to this program.","Had we accrued a risk corridor receivable at December 31st, our full year 2014 commercial MBR would've been lower by approximately 20 basis points. Consistent with our commercial MBR performance, Aetna's stand-alone 2014 commercial medical cost trend was in the middle to upper end of our originally projected range of 6% to 7%, in line with our previous projection.","Moving on from commercial, our Government franchise is another important growth lever for our business. As Mark mentioned earlier, our Government business had an outstanding year, from both a growth and profitability standpoint and now represents over 40% of our Health Care premiums.","Our Government business grew by 45,000 members in the quarter, primarily due to Medicaid growth of 26,000 members. Aetna's continued Government membership growth drove fourth quarter Government premiums to $5.4 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year period.","Our Government medical benefit ratio was 84.4% in the quarter, an excellent result in absolute terms and a 260 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Drivers of this year\u2019s excellent performance include favorable prior period reserve development, the success of actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap, including the health insurer fee, and continuing strong performance in our Medicaid business.","Finally, Group Insurance operating earnings were $21.3 million in the quarter, compared to $47.9 million in the same quarter of 2013, driven primarily by lower net investment income. For the full year 2014, Group Insurance operating earnings were $171 million, well in excess of 2013 results in our initial full year projections.","Turning to the balance sheet, our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At December 31, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 37%. Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with $100 million.","Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $169 million. We repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $243 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $79 million. After other sources, we ended the quarter with $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 349.8 million shares at December 31.","Moving on to 2015. This morning, we increased our 2015 outlook to at least $7 per share, up from our previous projection of at least $6.90 per share. As a reminder, Aetna's guidance does not include any projection of prior year development. This increased projection reflects the impact of our recently disclosed preferred drug contract for hepatitis C treatments on our commercial business, higher medical membership then we had previously projected, driven by our solid finish to 2014 and our encouraging early 2015 growth in both our public exchange and Medicare Advantage businesses.","These two favorable items are partially offset by a projected increase in flu and related costs in 2015, based on the severity of the current flu season. Our 2015 guidance is further influenced by the following drivers. We project that our first quarter medical membership will be approximately 23.5 million members, an increase of approximately 100,000 members versus our previous guidance.","Specifically, Aetna's commercial ASC membership is now projected to decline by approximately 175,000 members, a modest improvement versus our previous guidance. Commercial insured membership is now projected to be flat to slightly down as compared to year-end 2014, influenced by public and private exchange growth, offset by the previously discussed increase in small group renewal activity that occurred in late 2014 rather than in early 2015, and the potential for increased attrition in our smaller middle markets and off-exchange individual businesses.","Medicare membership is projected to grow by approximately 120,000 members, comprised of, at least 90,000 Medicare Advantage members and approximately 30,000 Medicare Supplement members, growth that is again higher than our previous projections. And Medicaid membership is now projected to be better than our previous forecast, with other growth almost entirely offsetting the exit from Delaware's Medicaid program.","We continue to project full year operating revenue to be at least $62 billion, as the impact of higher than projected membership growth on exchanges and individual Medicare Advantage is projected to be partially offset by the potential for increased attrition in our smaller middle-market and off-exchange individual businesses. We continue to project our full year total health medical benefit ratio to be 82% to 83%.","Aetna's 2015 core commercial medical cost trend is projected to be in the range of 6% to 7%, reflecting a projected increase in utilization of 50 to 100 basis points over 2014. We project our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18%. This metric is impacted by the increase in expense related to the ACA fees and taxes, which runs through the SG&A line, increasing the reported SG&A ratio for 2015 by approximately 140 basis points.","Our underlying operating expense ratio, excluding these fees and taxes, is projected to show improvement over our 2014 results. We project pretax operating margin to be at least 7.3%, consistent with our high single-digit target.","We project operating earnings to be over $2.4 billion. And finally, we project net dividends from subsidiaries to be approximately $1.8 billion as additional capital to support growth is held at the subsidiaries. We continue to project excess cash flow to the parent to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion, noting that increased premiums versus our initial projection could push us into the lower half of this range.","To the extent that current analyst consensus for 2015 contemplates the same quarterly earnings progression Aetna experienced in 2014, especially as it pertains to the first quarter, we would remind investors that the first quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by severe winter weather and a lower than normal flu season, both of which we do not project to recur in 2015.","In closing, we are very pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. I want to reiterate that our 2015 operating EPS projection of at least $7 as a floor and that we are committed to delivering results in excess of this early view. To that end, we remain focused on executing on our exchange strategy both public and private, delivering on our government growth strategy, improving the performance of our 51 to 300 employee commercial block of business and solving for the incremental ACA fees and taxes.","As we continue to execute during this challenging time for our industry, we are confident that we can achieve our 2015 projections and are well positioned to attain our 2018 goals of at least $80 billion in operating revenue and $10 in operating EPS.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Tom Cowhey","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Josh Raskin","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess question for some of the comments that Mark had made around the value-based reimbursement and you\u2019ve seen some announcements from the government. I guess I am just curious from your perspective what do you think the government is trying to accomplish? And then how do you think that impacts Aetna's ability to sort of differentiate delivery systems relative to whether it\u2019s a fee-for-service world on the government side or even other payers that are going to start sort of accelerating that change?","Mark Bertolini","Thanks, Josh. I think probably the most important part of what the government is trying to do is to partner with private sector to get more value-based contracting underway. And so, I actually welcome the opportunity to work with the government, because as you know Medicare and Medicaid can comprise up to 60% of a hospital\u2019s revenue.","And as a result, unless we have impact with the government as a partner, unless we can\u2019t move value-based contracting along and get the kind of behavior change that we need to get as a result from health systems themselves. So we view this as positive. We are not quite sure on the details yet. We will probably likely to go faster and bigger, but I think we have more a longer road to hold before we get to a conclusion that we are completely comfortable with where they are headed. But so far, so good and we welcome the opportunity.","Josh Raskin","And I guess just to follow up on a pragmatic view of Medicare Advantage, does this help expand networks to make MA more attractive in light of the fact that providers may be you know looking at some of those same types of arrangements, whether it\u2019s with the government or with the health plan?","Mark Bertolini","I think, actually Josh, the genesis of our whole Healthagen program was built off of early positive results by us partnering with health systems on Medicare Advantage by sharing with them the risk-adjusted revenue through capitation to those health systems.","So I think the most important part of value-based insurance is changing the hospital, the health system model from one of revenue generation to one of margin generation, and you can only do that by passing some of that risk and helping those health systems manage their risk. So I think for us 6, 7 years ago this ability to pass across risk adjusted revenue to health systems was, hah, moment for us in building the Healthagen enterprise.","Josh Raskin","Okay. Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","We will go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Costa","Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the decision to not book receivable for the risk quarter payment relative to what you did in the third quarter where I think there was an offsetting receivable relative to the adjuster?","Shawn Guertin","Yes, Peter. That is correct. We did have that contemplated when we closed the third quarter. The decision to not do that, probably strained our numbers by about a dime this quarter, but obviously the performance of the core business was strong enough that we can overcome that. This really is a question about sort of certainty at this point and make no mistake we believe the loss certainly says we are out the money. We believe it's an important part of the early stages of this program. But some of the activity around the budget process and some of the guidance that came out frankly created a degree of uncertainty about the collectibility and we just didn't feel like we were over the threshold to do that.","In addition, I mean the risk -- on this whole topic, it is really important for everyone to realize what I would call the relative immaturity of the data that pertains to both the base estimates of claim experience, which is still emerging in this new program, but also the data we are using to estimate risk adjustors is, as you know, from an outside consulting source of gathering industry data. It is certainly not the official data set upon which we will ultimately make that calculation. And so, there still is a lot of uncertainty. So I think when you put all those things together, it led to our decision.","Peter Costa","This is a follow-up. So do you expect to adjust those sometime in the first quarter or not till really the second quarter when you get the final numbers from the government?","Shawn Guertin","It will depend on what comes out of this emerging dataset. So I would say conceptually, we would directionally adjust those numbers as the data matures. But to your point, the real sort of final adjustment and the real meaningful adjustments I think will be in the middle to second half of next year when we actually get quote the real data.","Peter Costa","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next, Ana Gupte with Leerink.","Ana Gupte","Thank you. Good morning. On the initial cost trends of 6%, 7%, you had a huge increase baked in because of hepatitis C and then just overall from pharmacy. Now that you have negotiated this contract with Gilead, do you feel there is any upside or is that contributed to even higher going forward in '15?","Shawn Guertin","Part of one of the reasons that we increased our overall guidance outlook for 2015 is I do think that our final negotiations on this topic are creating upside. And I think sort of within the range it clearly will be a positive for us. We've held the overall range at this point. It is still early, but directionally it certainly would -- is a positive factor for us, both from an earnings standpoint and a medical cost trend standpoint.","Ana Gupte","And then, Shawn, you talked about the 49.2 on trends, it\u2019s not only four days higher than last year, but that is historical high from the recent perspective? Any reason to keep it that high into '16 now that the raw materials have been implemented, do you have much better understanding of exchanges you saw?","Shawn Guertin","A couple things. I would like to continue to think on exchanges that we have tried to continue to be prudent in our reserve setting. We also have a lot of early growth in our Medicaid high acuity programs with the duals, where we are trying to position that appropriately.","I would also say that just on directionally the days claims payable in our government business is a little bit longer than our commercial business. And so some of this is just the mathematics as more of that is mixing in and more of our growth is coming for there.","So I think it\u2019s really a combination of -- there still is some uncertainty on the new programs, and we have tried to be prudent there, but some of it is just the changing mix of our business.","Ana Gupte","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andy Schenker","Good morning. So maybe just to start, if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the moving parts in the commercial risk business, I know you touched on earlier, but clearly better public exchange. Enrollment being offset by a little bit more losses and some of the group business. But maybe you could just give us a little bit more details on the moving parts since the Analyst Day, thanks?","Mark Bertolini","Andy, I think you might be talk -- sounds like you are talking about volume. So let me talk about couple of things that played out. The biggest thing is around small group. And the most important thing there is in small group 12\/1, December 1st has become because of keep what you have sort of the new 1\/1 in this business. So there is a good chunk of renewal activity that is now taking place in December. And at the end of the day, we did better in renewing that block of business than we had initially projected.","And so in many ways, if you think about business that used to be 1\/1 is effectively 12\/1 now, we are getting some of that growth earlier in the cycle than maybe we would\u2019ve had in the past. On individual, we continue to feel good about it. We expect net will probably grow in the first quarter from about a million members both on and off exchange at the end of the year to about 1.1 million members at the end of the third quarter with probably up to 800,000 of that being on exchange membership.","Andy Schenker","Okay. Great. And just real quick following up on the three Rs. So I appreciate the reversal in the risk quarters here. But also on the risk adjusted, it sounds like you are booking additional payables here. So the interpretation here to be that their membership may have actually turned out to be a little bit more profitable than you expected. And maybe how does that influence how you ended '14 about your expectations for '15 with the new calculation? Thank you.","Mark Bertolini","Yeah. I don't know that I\u2019d go there quite yet to say that it's going to be more profitable and it's really not due to anything other than what I was talking about before, which is just the degree of estimation we are having to deal with all of the data sort of the emergency -- the emerging claim experience, as well as the risk adjusted payable.","So again we've continued to look at that data and make our best estimate off of that. We continue to feel good about this business going forward and would expect this business to be modestly profitable in 2015.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch","Yes, hi. Good morning. I realize it\u2019s early to talk about 2016, but I am -- what I want to ask about is your early conversations with large employers about next year, which I'm sure are already underway. And where you have three-year type contracts, how much is the Cadillac tax coming into the range of discussion given the three-year window from 2016 will bracket that? And then what changes do you see employers contemplating and where do private exchanges come into that mix?","Mark Bertolini","Hey, Matt, I\u2019ll start with the latter part of your question first, and then I\u2019ll turn over to Karen to talk a bit about what we are seeing in the conversation with large employers. I think we've already seen the impact of the Cadillac tax on certain large accounts, particularly those that are in the midst of negotiating five-year labor agreements.","So I thing the Cadillac tax is already playing a role. Our three-year agreements with employers, I don't know that that will have an impact right away, unless there is a union contract as part of it. But we are already seeing it on the union side, not quite on the large employer side.","So I think the real question is whether or not, we have private exchange models that are stable. And I think this year we saw less enrollment in private exchanges on the part of large employers than we had anticipated and that rippled through our own private exchange membership as we participate in some of those. Or maybe Karen you could talk a bit about what we are seeing for the large employer season.","Karen Rohan","Hi, Matt. It is really early for 2016. However, we are starting to have those conversations with our national account members. We have actually seen increase in our pipeline even earlier this year than we did last year, and it looks somewhat stronger than it did last year as well. So we are quite pleased with the conversations that we are having, and the pipeline that we see for '16, but again it really is early.","Matthew Borsch","And so the pipeline overall as it relates to the enrollment growth potentially for next year, but what about on the private exchange side, do you see any signs building that will see an acceleration going into next year on that front?","Karen Rohan","We continue to have conversation around private exchange with a lot of interest in discussion on the private exchange both in the national accounts and in middle market. So we continued the dialogue and we have continued to see that interest.","Matthew Borsch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. First question is just around the re-pricing of the middle market business that you talked about in the third quarter. Can you give us an update in terms of what you are seeing on membership retention and target yields in terms of achieving them?","Karen Rohan","Yeah. I\u2019d be happy to. It\u2019s Karen. Relative to the 51 to 300 block, what you are referring to, as we talked about in December, that block was not performing relative to our expectations, so we took pricing actions.","As a result, we continue to monitor those pricing actions. We are seeing what we would have expected relative to membership and one other things that you know, we monitor is the business that stays with us versus the business that leaves us.","We are pleased with what we are seeing that we are keeping the business that we want to keep the business that we don\u2019t want to keep we are shedding and it is in line with expectations. However, I would comment, again, that continues to be early in the cycle. But so far the performance is in line with where we would have expected it to be.","Justin Lake","Got it. And then just the question on the pharmacy side, I know there were some network issues with CMS? Can you give us an update in terms of what happened there? What you are doing to fix it? And then in terms of, should we read this toward any kind of issues with the -- was it a function of the PBM outsourcing relationship you have there or was it more internal to Aetna? And then just any view on any potential sanctions or issues from a CMS perspective, we should think about?","Mark Bertolini","Hey, Justin. I always start with the sanctions we have received to Corrective Action Plan request and we expect that to have marginal impact on our star ratings overall. So we believe that we have this under control.","We have been in constant contact with CMS. This is a little bit the trouble with some innovation. We innovated with narrower networks to provide better pricing for enrollees and we\u2019ve got some pushback from the pharmacy side, particularly independent pharmacists in talking to those enrollees, which created noise in the system.","We have reached out. We have solved a lot of these issues so far. We are making sure that the beneficiaries are not at harm from any standpoint in getting their drugs or their treatment is necessary. We are on the phone with CMS everyday on this issue and we believe that we have a plan to fix this. The impact financially to us as an organization in the near-term is manageable, very manageable.","Justin Lake","And just the PBM impact in terms of CVS, is there any read through we should have in terms of this is part of the complexity or non you said it was just your narrow network?","Mark Bertolini","It was just us. It was product innovation, putting a different kind of product in the marketplace. We communicated it pretty thoroughly. We\u2019ve reviewed it with CMS before we did it. It was all approved. But we got pushback from the marketplace. And as we know and as we are very carefully to know, all the time we do not want to put the beneficiaries at risk, and so we move down a very quickly. We were the ones who found it, reported it and got engaged.","Justin Lake","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold","Good morning. Could you speak to your expectations for the duals in terms of profitability and also your Medicare Advantage book? How are you thinking about profitability of that in 2015?","Mark Bertolini","I\u2019ll start with Medicare Advantage book. I\u2019ll pass it over to Shawn for the duals. On the Medicare Advantage, we saw 80% of our growth so far and for this year in four plus star plan, so that always bodes well from a revenue standpoint and MBR standpoint. Those are plans that generally we have good results with.","So our expectation is that we\u2019ll move margin up again for Medicare this year. That is our goal and part of our objectives. So we are happy with our Medicare performance -- Medicare Advantage performance and look forward to another strong year from that organization.","Shawn Guertin","Yeah. And to wrap that going back on Investor Day, we did talk about our Government MBR being essentially flat ex-PYD. But inside that we are expecting to see the Medicare business improve and the Medicaid revert a little bit to more normal levels after a very strong year.","On the duals, given that it's still in the very early stages of maturity on these programs, they will certainly generate a lot more revenue in 2015. And I -- the marginal, the profit of these early on will be relatively low if any in the early stages of these programs. So it's not a big profit contributor per say. We\u2019re certainly not seeing anything now in the early stages of these contracts that would make us feel any differently than that at this stage.","Christine Arnold","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Dave Windley with Jefferies.","Dave Windley","Hi. Follow-up there on the Medicare Advantage, you mentioned a couple of times that 80% of your growth is coming in your four star plans. I believe that kind of an 80% mix of membership in four star plans is your starting point. Also, are you surprised that you're not seeing, say disproportionate growth into your higher star plans?","Mark Bertolini","Not really. I think it\u2019s early. And I think it all depends on the pricing in the market relative to the marketplace. So at zero premium markets where all prices are pretty equal, I think star ratings matter.","In other markets, we\u2019re all over the competitive map relative to our competitors and so I wouldn't necessarily jump to that conclusion. I think, we like the fact that 80% of our membership -- new memberships coming from those plans.","It is the right kind of footprint for us. We\u2019re not done yet with our star ratings and moving those up. Our goal is 100%. And so I think that is, we will continue to build on that. But we\u2019re pleased. We\u2019re not at all worried.","Dave Windley","If I could ask a similar question but in the individual market, I think, you talked about bringing lots of new product to market through your ACO relationships. Could you talk about how that is influencing your membership gains in the -- on exchange market?","Karen Rohan","Hi. It\u2019s Karen. Relative to the on-exchange market, as you know, we extended our footprint this year to add an additional market. We have put competitive products into the marketplace on the exchanges. As you might recall, our strategy was to go into markets where we had a competitive cost position, where we were comfortable with the regulatory environment and where we could have our return on capital. You can see from the results that we are expecting about 800,000 members at the end of the first quarter and that is in line with our expectations and we\u2019re quite pleased with the results to date on exchange.","Dave Windley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. I might go back to asking about the days claims payable. I know you had that in remarks, 42.9. It\u2019s up four days year-to-year. Would you characterize that as a change that\u2019s related to the mix of business change, or would you say the balance sheet more conservatively positioned as you exit this year than last year and is there a target for that?","Mark Bertolini","I would say that I wouldn\u2019t go as far as sort of forming that conclusion that we\u2019re necessarily more conservative. We had a very strong year, last year on prior year development. It could certainly turn out that way as you all know. But, again, this is really driven I think by two factors. Again, it\u2019s the growth in the Government business and that's just a structural factor to the point of your question that's going to push on that number as that business grows.","But as these new programs grow like exchanges for example, like the new dual contracts for example. We certainly are trying not to get ahead of ourselves on the reserve side. And again, I think that\u2019s one of the uncertainties. And if it turns out that and that we've been overly cautious then we may get a result more akin to what you're asking about. But at this point, I wouldn't go that far. And I would say there are elements of sort of both structural change and caution regarding growth populations in that number today.","A.J. Rice","Okay. And if maybe I can slip in on the area of co-ops that\u2019s been in the news and particularly one co-op liquidating in Iowa, Nebraska where you guys have a presence. Can you give us a little flavor for how that changes the dynamic? Does that end up being a positive for you, or is it something that if you caution and what do you see in generally around co-op activity in your exchange markets?","Mark Bertolini","I will trust Karen. I just want to make one comment on the co-ops. We believe that the recent failure of Iowa, Nebraska is a president kind of transactions. So the way we handle this was very much aim toward is probably is not the first, although not the last of these co-ops to have issues. And we want to make sure that first and foremost customers are not left out and lurch on this. But secondly, that we obviously have the right kind of products in the marketplace. So, I\u2019ll turn that over to Karen to talk a little bit about how we handle this specific situation.","Karen Rohan","Yeah. We\u2019ve been working very closely with the state because as Mark said, we want to ensure the access to care by those members. Essentially, the state has encouraged those members to go into the open-market and that\u2019s essentially what\u2019s happening and we are pricing those members in accordance with the prices that we have put in the marketplace. So, we are managing those individuals as we would normally manage the enrollment process. So, we expect to see an increase in overall membership but at the price appropriately.","A.J. Rice","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. Debt-to-cap came up a little bit 37%, I think from under 35%. I guess how quickly do you want to get that back down? And then if a deal presented, where is your tolerance on sort of the high-end that where you\u2019d take debt to cap? Thanks.","Mark Bertolini","Our commitment now is to return that debt-to-cap to 35% by the end of 2015, so that's what will be marching towards. I don\u2019t really want to speculate on sort of a hypothetical debt-to-cap on a hypothetical deal. Obviously, we look at every deal on the strategic merits and the financial merits of the deal and it is all part of that equation when we make those decisions.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. And if I could squeeze one another one in. You had pulled forward some Coventry synergies I think last year. I guess, can you help us, what did you capture and what sort of the incremental opportunities we think about in 2015 and maybe what\u2019s baked into assumptions? Thanks.","Shawn Guertin","Yeah. We -- I think the last time we\u2019ve updated you, I think we said something in the order of $0.60 was we achieved or at least that. And as Mark mentioned, we are confident that the run rate with which we are exiting the year is at least $0.90. It is in fairness getting more difficult as the organization has become more integrated, to sort of tease out that\u2019s a synergy versus that\u2019s a productivity improvement, which we\u2019re working on all the time anyway. So, again, we\u2019re confident that we will achieve at least the $0.90 that we had committed to you when we announced the deal.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. We\u2019ll go next to Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. First question, just -- if you can give us an update on how performance has been tracking in international and student ever since you put in collective pricing a couple quarters ago? And then just more broadly. Mark, just interested if, as you\u2019ve been down in Washington, if you are seeing any signs at this point of any type of viable contingency strategy being developed here in terms of, if SCOTUS does hand out an adverse ruling on the subsidies?","Mark Bertolini","Sure. Scott, I\u2019ll handle both of those. International is performing ahead of expectations based on the changes we\u2019ve made in the third quarter and student health is performing at expectations.","So when you combine that with the 51 to 30, actually the Commercial MBR is performing better, offset by the impact of flu in the fourth quarter and the change we made regarding risk adjusters. So I think that's how we look at the overall bridge to the MBR in the fourth quarter and for the full year.","As it relates to the conversation of Washington, I\u2019ve obviously been engaged there on a number of points. And I think, there is a realization that throwing pick your number, 10 million people into the uninsured marketplace as a result of decision by the Supreme Court would not be a wise thing for anybody.","And so I think there is a lot of conversation going on and what kind of continuance we would need, if I need to get through the end of the year, what kind of solutions would be offered by both sides to get to a place, where the program would just not abandon people. And I think that conversations are ongoing. I think it is actually constructive at this point in time. And I think there are people on both sides of the aisle who want to try and make something work should that decision come forward.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Thanks. Do you think just on -- this has been driven sort of equally on the administration and congressional side or is it more biased towards one or the other at this point?","Mark Bertolini","It\u2019s hard to say. I\u2019m not involved in all the conversations. So I wouldn\u2019t say that there is probably a lot going on around this issue.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Okay. We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. In the earnings release, there's a lot of talk about investments in the G&A line to fund growth initiatives, but I guess there wasn\u2019t a lot of commentary on the call about it. Can you talk a little bit about what you were spending the money on and how we should think about those investments spend to meet the leverage on that next year or is this a continued level of spending?","Mark Bertolini","Kevin, I think from an overall standpoint, I think our biggest investments are in health agenda continue to hold provider development and the ACO process. And so that organization gets a fair amount of capital. I think on the other though is preparing for the consumer marketplace particular the bSwift acquisition is one. There are some things we\u2019ll need to do to make that platforms more robust.","There's also a lot of work going on. A new consumer platform is very low cost and is modular. And all of that is aimed at connecting those two at some point in the future, where we have this consumer platform and exchange and benefit administration platform connected to ACOs and markets, that we think is disruptive in a lot of ways to the current models that we see in our marketplace.","So that\u2019s where the lion share of the investments going. However, we continue to invest in Medicare on stars and on solving the funding gap. Medicaid and expansion in the market particular dual eligibles and in the commercial business it\u2019s largely toward how do we streamline our operating costs and make that a better generator of capital for the kind of investments, we want to make for the future in the other items I just mentioned.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Great. And then I just want to clarify something on the trend guided. I think you guys reaffirmed trend to 6 to 7 but I thought at the Investor Day, you kind of sit on an apples-to-apples basis that would've been 5 to 5.5. But I think in the comment you said it was a 50 to 100 basis point increase off of where you were. And I think I was expecting at 125 last time. So is there a change there, did the 2014 base, change and that\u2019s the Delta or is there something else going on there?","Mark Bertolini","No. We just -- you're right. Your numbers are right, 5 to 5.5 and originally we had talked about an assumption of 50 to 100 basis points of utilization increased. But we had also talked about an additional 50 basis points of unit cost most of which was Hep C that got us into the 6 to 7 range. As I mentioned earlier, that Hep C number should be better now and as a result of the negotiations we've concluded. And so, clearly as a positive factor inside the range of 6 to 7, but for the timing being, we held to 6 to 7 range.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. That\u2019 s right in there. All right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Tom Carroll with Stifel.","Tom Carroll","Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Shawn, just a quick clarification on your 2015 quarterly comments, are you suggesting first quarter \u201815 will be a flat down or slightly up from first quarter \u201814 given the items you mentioned?","Shawn Guertin","Well, if I hold all other things being equal, it's down right because what I'm talking about is the absence of a better event typical flu season on the absence of some of the temporary benefit, we got because of some of the severe weather. So I just would ask that again when we look at the pattern that's out there, and we think about the pattern projecting it. That first quarter pattern, we should not assume at least if those items recur.","Tom Carroll","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James","Thank you. Just a follow-up on that CapEx, could you provide a little bit more detail on seasonality, so it sounds like we have certain items that would be beneficial to the first half. As far as the earnings mix like high deductible plans and exchange is growing which is the backend cost items as well as the non-repetitive start-up cost with that balances against the flu and weather impact and improvement in dual. So how do you see the mix of first half versus second half finding up against \u201814?","Shawn Guertin","Again I think that, again with the absence of those factors, we wouldn\u2019t expect it to be as steep. I would say that when we look at the projections a little bit more than half of the earnings or in the first half of the year as they typically are. So if anything it's just a bit flatter and a bit more equal between the two halves of the year than maybe we saw a year ago. Again this will all turn hang on, how does the flu season play out, a few deep play out and things like that. But as we said right here, I would standby what I just said.","Sarah James","Okay. And can you tell us what the different between the below average flu year is versus an above average flu year?","Shawn Guertin","This year is looking -- in our guidance, we've assume at this point that we get strained by about $0.05 by the play out of the flu season. We probably had something around $0.05 in the fourth quarter as well. So that, the two of those together would give you a sense of what this is looking like as we play it out?","Mark Bertolini","The flu season looks a lot like 2012, 2013, if you look at the charts, they are almost identical.","Sarah James","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our last question from Michael Baker with Raymond James.","Michael Baker","Yeah. Thanks a lot. Mark, I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how you planned the position bSwift relative to the consult multi-carrier offering? And then if you could secondarily give us a sense for which employer segment you expect to see the greatest initial uptick, now that its can be push forward by Aetna?","Mark Bertolini","Well, I think, obviously, how we play it will depend by segment. I think in the large employer, the National Accounts segment we will need some participation from multiple carriers, which we are already engaged in conversions around.","I think from the middle market standpoint it can be total replacement and we view that as an opportunity to move people first to notional defined contribution, so they can fund it in a way and create a marketplace for their employees. And then ultimately to true defined contribution, which we think is an opportunity at the high-end of the middle market at the low-end of the middle market, obviously, be insured.","On the individual side, obviously, it\u2019s the public exchanges. But we see a lot opportunity in the public exchange marketplace, particularly as we work through all the issues with the Federal Government, where private exchange models that connect Medicare, Medicaid, Individual and Small Group, any marketplace, and create ubiquity or fundageability of products through one marketplace and opportunity for private exchanges, including the potential for subsidy in the longer run. So that all depends on how things work out in Washington.","But we see this private exchange model even more importantly with the ben\/admin platform on the backend, which most private exchange models do not have and that ability to provide benefit administration for the employer bundled into the cost of the overall product and the private exchange experience, our marketplace, really creates a lot of flexibility with us to provide value to certain employers segments.","Michael Baker","And then just one follow-up, in terms of the large end, is the initial drive to make it risk based or an initial stages be more flexible to the particular customer needs?","Mark Bertolini","We will be flexible but we will offer both alternatives.","Michael Baker","Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Mark Bertolini","Yeah.","Tom Cowhey","Thanks, Michael.

Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Thank you, Joe, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported second quarter operating earnings of $2.21 per share, an 8% increase over the second quarter of 2015. Underlying our solid second quarter performance, we grew operating revenue by 5% to nearly $16 billion. Our non-ACA Commercial Insured products performed consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial fee-based businesses remain strong and exceeded our previous projections.","Operating results in our Government business continue to be robust and perform better than projected. We have continued to drive operating efficiencies, as evidenced by our 17.1% adjusted operating expense ratio. We achieved high single digit pre-tax operating margins, consistent with our long-term target and we grew operating earnings by 8%. The strong performance in our core business more than offset the significant pressure in our ACA individual products. In short, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half results. They are representative of the rigor with which we operate our businesses and the value of a diversified portfolio in delivering solid bottom line results.","As we look forward to the remainder of 2016, we continue to expect strong operating performance despite pressure from ACA products. Based on our results year-to-date, we remain confident in our operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter results and current outlook. But first, I would like to provide an update on our proposed acquisition of Humana, as well as share with you some of our second quarter highlights.","Beginning with Humana, the combination of Aetna and Humana will benefit consumers, particularly those eligible for Medicare. We believe that the combination of these two complementary companies will meaningfully benefit the people we serve by enabling us to create more attractive and affordable products and services; enhancing our ability to help expand value-based care delivery where providers are paid for the quality of the care they provide and not just the quantity of services performed; and accelerating our evolution to a more consumer-centric company that can provide simpler solutions and engaging tools to help people achieve their individual health goals.","As most of you are aware, we are in the process of defending the Justice Department lawsuit to block our proposed acquisition of Humana. The DOJ action ignores the simple fact that there is robust competition in Medicare, as evidenced by, all Medicare eligibles are free to choose between traditional fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage, and approximately 70% of the Medicare eligible population chooses traditional Medicare.","A total of 178 Medicare Advantage organizations offer plans, with 28 new organizations entering MA in the last three years alone. 91% of Medicare beneficiaries have access to at least five Medicare Advantage options and healthcare is delivered locally, and regulators in 18 states of 20 states have already approved the transaction.","Finally, as the Justice Department states in its complaint, Congress created Medicare Advantage in 1997 to offer seniors a market-based alternative to traditional Medicare. This is consistent with a market definition that includes both traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage, and the presentation on the government's medicare.gov website of options available to newly eligible beneficiaries.","Consequently, we don't believe divestiture should be required at all. However, after reviewing bids from significant industry players, this morning, we announced that we and Humana have executed agreements with Molina to sell certain of our respective Medicare Advantage assets. We believe that taken together, these divestitures would address the DOJ's perceived competitive concerns regarding Medicare Advantage.","Shifting to our second quarter highlights, our Commercial fee-based businesses performed well in the second quarter. Fee yields remained healthy and pharmacy results were strong, driving better-than-projected operating earnings. As we look forward to the 2017 selling season for large ASC accounts, the RFP pipeline looks more modest than last year with fewer cases out to bid. While we expect our 2017 new sales to reflect this pipeline, we are encouraged by our retention efforts this year and project better retention in our Commercial ASC membership in 2017 compared to this year.","In our Commercial Insured business, our large group products are performing generally consistent with our pricing assumptions. However, as Shawn will discuss in more detail, our ACA small group and individual products continue to be challenged by a deterioration of the risk pool and an ineffective risk adjustment mechanism. As it relates to these challenges, let me take a few moments to provide an update on our public exchange strategy.","Our strategy has always been to participate on the exchanges in a manner that will allow us to gain enough membership to learn how best to provide affordable healthcare coverage for previously uninsured Americans. At the same time, we are committed to being good stewards of our balance sheet and managing the financial risk and level of investment associated with this opportunity.","In light of the disappointing year-to-date performance and updated 2016 projections for our individual on and off exchange products, combined with the significant structural challenges facing the public exchanges, we believe it is only prudent to reassess our level of participation on the public exchanges. Our initial action will be to withdraw our 2017 public exchange expansion plans. Additionally, given the deadline to attest to our final rate filings for 2017, we are also undertaking a complete evaluation of our current exchange footprint, as the poor performance of these products warrants such an analysis.","Moving on to our Government business, our Government business is having another strong year. We grew to serve nearly half a million additional medical members over the past 12 months. We generated over 15% year-over-year growth in Government premiums for the quarter, and we generated operating margins consistent with our targeted range. More specifically, our Medicare business is currently on pace to have another solid year of operating performance, driven by strong membership growth. The investments we have made in our value-based care models for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries helped to drive this strong financial performance.","These type of value-based care models have demonstrated performance improvements for the Medicare beneficiaries we serve. For example, for calendar year 2015, beneficiaries in our value-based models achieved improvements in clinical quality, including breast and colorectal cancer screening rates and diabetes control. In all, members in these arrangements outperformed populations in non-value-based models on the majority of clinical quality measures. Encouraged by these results, we are pursuing a robust pipeline of additional value-based provider contracts in conjunction with our broader population health strategy.","Additionally, we made good progress during the quarter toward our goal of helping the people we serve achieve more healthy days through our broader provider collaboration strategy. Specifically, in May we announced the creation of a jointly owned health plan company in partnership with Texas Health Resources, one of the leading healthcare provider systems in Texas. The combination of Texas Health's high-quality providers and investment in population health management, with Aetna's health plan expertise, care management capabilities and analytical insights, will provide the people of Northern Texas with more affordable, high-quality and better-coordinated care. This joint venture is just one of the provider collaborations we entered into in the quarter across a spectrum of value-based care models. With over 40% of our medical costs now flowing through these value-based care models, we are well-positioned to achieve our goal of 75% by 2020.","In summary, we are pleased with our first half 2016 performance. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders, as well as all those employees at both Aetna and Humana who have been working tirelessly to close our transaction and deliver a successful integration. With our second quarter results, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in the changing healthcare marketplace. We can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy, and we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our second quarter results and our current 2016 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2016 operating earnings of $783 million and operating earnings per share of $2.21. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong top-line growth, cash flow and operating margins. I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. We ended the quarter with 23 million medical members, essentially flat with the first quarter of the year. We grew operating revenue by 5% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of nearly $16 billion, driven by higher healthcare premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership declines in our Commercial Insured products.","From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pre-tax operating margin was 8.9%, a very strong result and consistent with the high-end of our target operating margin range. Our second quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 82.4%, a 130 basis point year-over-year increase, driven primarily by performance in our Individual Commercial products, and lower favorable development of prior period healthcare cost estimates in our Government business.","Our adjusted operating expense ratio was 17.1%, a 120 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2015. This year-over-year improvement speaks to our strong commitment to drive productivity improvements and our disciplined focus on managing our operating costs as we continue to grow our top-line. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to first quarter 2016 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth in the quarter, and on a year-over-year basis.","Additionally, days claims payable remained at a healthy level standing at 56 days at the end of the quarter. The sequential decline of approximately one day is consistent with the expected improvement in claim processing speeds as processing times improved from the elevated levels of the first quarter. Note that our days claims payable has increased by over four days as compared to the prior year quarter.","Turning to cash flow and capital, year-to-date operating cash flows have been strong. Healthcare and group insurance operating cash flows were approximately 1.5 times operating earnings. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter due to the proposed Humana acquisition. However, we did return $88 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our second quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. I will now discuss the key drivers of our second quarter performance in greater detail.","Beginning with our Government business where we continue to experience strong momentum, our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.4%, an excellent result and favorable to our previous projections. We grew medical membership by nearly 100,000 members in the quarter including growth of 12,000 in Medicare Advantage, 25,000 in Medicare Supplement and 61,000 in Medicaid. As a result of the strong medical membership growth, we grew our second quarter 2016 Government premiums by over 15% compared to the prior year period, achieving a record $6.6 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total healthcare premiums and this business continues to perform at a very high level.","Turning to our Commercial business, our Commercial fee-based businesses are performing well. We grew our fee revenue in the quarter as compared to the same period last year, and margins remain healthy driving year-over-year operating earnings growth that exceeded our previous projections.","In our Commercial Insured products, membership declined by roughly 125,000 members in the quarter, driven by attrition in our individual and small group membership, largely consistent with our expectations.","Our Commercial Medical benefit ratio was 83.4% for the quarter. This result was higher than expected as a result of the performance of our ACA individual products. The performance of our non-ACA Commercial products was consistent with our previous expectations.","Looking more deeply at our ACA individual products, we can now see that our 2016 population of which roughly half our new members have a distinctly higher level of morbidity than our 2015 population. This resulted in higher medical costs in the quarter than previously projected. Our second quarter performance was also negatively impacted by updated estimates related to the 3Rs, including amounts related to prior year dates of service. As a result of these two items, we no longer project we will achieve breakeven in our individual products in 2016, and have established a premium deficiency reserve in the second quarter of $65 million related to second half 2016 projected performance. The combination of all of these factors contributed to an approximate $200 million pre-tax operating loss in the second quarter in our individual products.","As Mark mentioned earlier, in response to our updated view of these products, we are reassessing our public exchange approach for 2017 as part of our broader action plan to improve the financial performance of our individual ACA products.","Moving on to our small group insured products, pre-tax operating earnings in the quarter were largely in line with our previous projections. However, this result reflects a favorable risk adjustment update from CMS related to 2016 that largely offset higher than projected medical costs. The higher than projected medical costs were almost entirely driven by our ACA small group products, and are a function of the continued degradation of the risk pool in certain states. As you know, our previous projections incorporated improvement in pre-tax operating margins in our small group products in 2016, particularly in our ACA products. While we continue to believe we will improve our small group pre-tax operating margins in 2016, we project the underlying pressure on medical costs in our ACA small group products will persist for the full year limiting our ability to achieve all of the 2016 targeted improvement.","For 2016, our non-ACA Commercial pricing incorporated a moderate increase to medical cost trend. Based on year-to-date results, we believe that our non-ACA Commercial Insured products are performing consistent with this expectation. As a result, we continue to project that our 2016 non-ACA Commercial Medical cost trend will be in the range of 6% to 7%. While disappointed by the performance of our ACA products in the quarter, the strong performance of our core business more than offset these ACA results.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our financial position, capital structure, and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 54% which reflects the debt financing that we completed in June to fund a portion of our pending Humana acquisition.","Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with approximately $970 million, net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $1.2 billion. We paid a shareholder dividend of approximately $88 million, and after other uses, and excluding the funds raised from our debt financing in June, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash at the parent. Including the funds from the June debt financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $15 billion at the parent. Our basic share count was approximately 351 million at June 30.","Based on our year-to-date performance, we are affirming our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. This reflects the strong performance in our core business, particularly our Government business, and our continued focus on operating costs, offset by our updated underwriting margin projections for our ACA products.","Our current 2016 guidance is influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our second quarter membership results, we continue to project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23 million members, as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including continued attrition within our individual products. We now project that operating revenue will be approximately $63 billion in 2016.","We now project that our full-year total health medical benefit ratio will be in the range of 82% to 82.5%. The increase from our previous projection is driven by our updated view of our ACA products. Based on our improved outlook and adjusted operating revenue and continued cost control initiatives, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18%. We continue to project pre-tax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high single digit target. We continue to project operating earnings of approximately $2.8 billion. Finally, we continue to project excess cash flow to the parent of up to $2.4 billion.","In closing, we are encouraged that the strength of results in our core businesses has been powerful enough to absorb the disappointing performance in our ACA products. Specifically, our Medicare business, in both group and individual, continues to deliver strong top-line and bottom-line results and is performing ahead of our previous projections. Our fee-based businesses continue to produce strong margin and operating profit growth. Our core non-ACA Commercial Insured business remains healthy and is performing consistent with expectations. And finally, our strong focus on expenses is delivering operating cost efficiencies that are tracking ahead of our initial projections for the year.","I will now turn the call back over to Joe. Joe?","Joseph F. Krocheski - Vice President, Investor Relations, Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions.","Operator, the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. First, just in terms of the divestitures to Molina, given the relative lack of experience in Medicare Advantage, I was hoping you could share what type of infrastructure systems like network, brand and stars you're providing within the deal structure to convince regulators Molina could be a strong competitor post the purchase.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Sure. As part of the agreement, we will obviously be providing transition services, which would include network continuity. And this will allow for hopefully a seamless experience for the member to continue in the network they are and give time, obviously, for Molina to ramp up what they will need eventually to take over the business. So that's been fully contemplated in the business. Again, they do have some experience in Medicare Advantage through the special needs plans and through some of the duals plans, but we've really thought about how to do this as smoothly as possible in the form of some transition services agreements.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Then, Shawn, clearly the business is operating well and offsetting the disappointing ACA results. I was just hoping whether you could tell us whether there are any one-time positives that are helping to mitigate here, or can we take 2016 results and add back the individual losses to get the core earnings power for Aetna going into 2017?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","So a couple things. As I mentioned, on the small group ACA business, we did get a prior year pickup on risk adjustment. So that was certainly something that came from 2015. I would tell you though that on individual, we had a number of things that then sort of went the other way. And so the net around all 3Rs is somewhat of a wash. I would be a little careful doing that at this juncture in terms of projecting for next year. There's always issues with sort of expense structure behind these products and things like that that you need to think through. But certainly, it would be our intent to improve this result for 2017.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed with our question.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. The divestiture package that you proposed, or that you've announced with Molina, was that previously proposed to the DOJ or is this something new to them? And how does that factor into what you think the potential trial date could be?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Josh, the form of it has been in front of the DOJ before with a number of other parties that were seeking to acquire the full book of business. In response to a number of issues that were outlined by the Department of Justice in their complaint, we decided that Molina was the best opportunity, but we had to update the divestiture to meet the specific requirements that were outlined in the Department of Justice's complaint.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So, Mark, it sounds like the DOJ, in your mind, has had time to vet and do the diligence and interview, et cetera, the potential buyer in this case?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say they've done their homework.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. And then second \u2013 although apparently they didn't have your answer sheet. But the second question, just on the total ACA book, individual and small group, if you think about the total losses that are being absorbed in 2016, I guess, one, what's the incremental amount relative to your previous expectations? I think it was breakeven, so I think it's all incremental; and two, if you were to exit exchanges, would that simply clear all of this up? Or are there some other costs that would sort of stay with the company?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So it's all incremental. We expect the year to have a loss on ACA business of \u2013 in excess of $300 million. We are evaluating our footprint as it exists today to understand what solutions we can put forward to either fix the business or exit the business. And so we're going through that analysis now. As you know, there's a short window to divestitures. But the simple \u2013 the solutions here are really two.","First, let me make the comment that the people that are seeking care through these exchange products need this care. So these aren't people running off to get services that they don't need. These are people that need the care that they're getting. What we're seeing in the exchanges is double-digit trend year-over-year, overall. You can double that when you talk about pharmacy. And you can triple that initial number when you talk about Specialty Pharmacy. So we have two very important things going on in the exchanges here. First, we now believe we have third parties paying premiums for special interest groups, both in small group and individual, that are supporting people getting access to these services. And because of that, we have \u2013 while we have the same demographic mix in this population, we have a much higher intensity and morbidity in that population, largely around Specialty Pharmacy.","So, given that the current risk adjustment mechanism does not include pharmacy, we're not actually \u2013 nobody is getting adequately reimbursed, and given that the risk adjustment mechanism is a zero sum game, there is no way to fix this unless we include pharmacy, we deal with the eligibility requirements of third party payers paying premium, and we find a way to cover these individuals. Again, these people need this care, and it's appropriate that they get it. But it's really about how the system works.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Josh, let me just clarify for you and everyone else, to just where these numbers are, because there is a lot of things moving around. As I mentioned in my remarks on individual ACA, we booked a pre-tax loss of about $200 million for the second quarter. The number Mark mentioned, north of $300 million pre-tax, that is our outlook for the year for the individual ACA business for the full year. So that was obviously a business that we had been trying to get closer to breakeven. So you can really think about that total swing as a swing from where we've been.","Small group continues to be profitable overall, and we had wanted to see some improvement there, particularly in the ACA business. So we are better year-over-year from an earnings perspective in small group, but just not as much as we had originally incorporated into our thinking for this year.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's perfect. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of A. J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello. Thanks, everybody. Obviously, there's some moving parts here, but I guess your updated MLR guidance of 82% to 82.5%, you were 81.5%, if I've got the calculation right in the first half, so you're assuming some deterioration in the back half \u2013 but the first half includes the PDR and the exchange drag. I know seasonality's a factor. Are there anything else that we should think about as we move from first half to back half and think about putting this all together?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So there's a couple things, and you're on the most important issue, which is the strain in both the ACA individual and small group products tends to worsen as the seasonality of the year intensifies. So there is some degradation in our forecast. And I'll go back as well in the quarter and small group. We did benefit from getting the 2015 risk adjuster update. Without that, we would have seen more pressure in the second quarter. So what you're seeing is that pressure continuing on in the appropriate seasonal progression for the rest of the year. So you have that clearly creating pressure. And as I mentioned, the government MBR though is helping and is better. The fee-based businesses are helping, and they are better. Our non-ACA Commercial business is consistent with expectation sort of through the rest of the year.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then Mark's comments about what the problems with the exchanges are don't suggest that there's much geographic diversity, but I did want to just check that and see, as you're painting the picture, is it bad across the board? Can you see areas where it's actually working okay? And if it is working okay in some areas, what's driving that?","Karen S. Lynch - President","We do have geographic variation in both our individual and small group ACA business. What I think is working, where it is working, is where we have very tight narrow networks, where we are effectively managing our medical costs. And what Mark has described relative to the third party, we see that in various geographies as well. That's putting pressure on us in some of the markets.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Yeah, maybe I could just pick up on the question that I believe Justin asked, which is on your planned divestitures to Molina, can you just elaborate further how you would help them to sustain the Medicare Advantage business in those markets or how you think they would do that? I mean, I guess the backdrop here is that management \u2013 their management, having said at various points in the past or at least somewhat recently that they did not plan to be in sort of regular retail Medicare Advantage. And I did note there's something special about this enrollment that you're planning to divest. Could you just give us a little more detail on that?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we'll let Molina speak for their abilities to deal with this. But I can tell you we have transition service agreement in place for an appropriate amount of time, not too long, not too short, and they'll outline more of that. That covers the network, covers the administrative services, and allows the stars to transfer over.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","And we have every intention, obviously, to treat this business just the same way we would treat our ongoing business sort of throughout this process. And again, this is all designed to provide a scenario of minimal disruption to the consumer.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And just as a follow-up, you talked about outperformance yourselves in Medicare Advantage. Did you see any Medicaid rate pressure or margin pressure as a result of the reset this year?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Well, clearly, Kentucky has been a market that as the rates have been now reset for a period of time, so if you thought about that year-over-year, you would certainly have that as one of the markets. That's probably the most notable one. There's always oscillations from quarter to quarter, but that would be the real meaningful one.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Can you talk about \u2013 you mentioned the retention in the ASO business for 2017 being a little bit better? Do you actually expect the ASO business to grow next year, or flat, or decline? Can you give us sort of an overall picture of what that'll be? And then in terms of looking at the ACA individual business for 2017, you talked about reevaluating it. Are you saying that you're going to actually reevaluate before September, and you may exit some of the 15 states that you're in now?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On the second part, Peter, and I'll let Karen answer the first, we are evaluating all of our exchange footprint and we're doing it within a timeline that allows us to react well before September 23.","Karen S. Lynch - President","And on the National Account business, what I would say is the pipeline as it's matured was lower than last year, so we aren't going to expect sales as robustly as we saw in 2016. We are encouraged by our retention efforts to date, and what I would say is we are still actively engaged in bids. So it's something that we're assessing. I wouldn't expect to grow in 2017 in the National Accounts space.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I guess I just want to understand a little bit the commentary about exchanges for next year. What does it mean to you to be appropriate for evaluating participation? Is it a view of getting to breakeven next year? Do you have to be profitable next year? And does this impact at all the negotiation discussions you've had around the Humana merger agreement about staying in or getting out of the exchanges?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Kevin, let me \u2013 this is really a balance sheet discussion and what happens to our capital and how big the loss could get. Unless some of these issues are addressed around eligibility and the risk adjustment, this could get a lot worse. And so we have to evaluate each market by its level of volatility, the other competitors, our amount of share in that market and whether or not it's appropriate for us to take that risk absent any other changes in the program.","And so that is the sole evaluation around our exchange footprint. Obviously, as it relates to the other discussion with the Department of Justice, all of this material goes into a review of markets as they have reviewed, and that is a separate conversation from our evaluation of how we think about the exchanges going forward.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just to clarify the comment that you made about this divestiture package and how you came to an assumption that this would be the best structure to address the issues and that the DOJ brought up in their complaint. I guess how different is this package versus what you had presented the DOJ before they decided to pursue a lawsuit?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That I would not want to comment on at this point in time. I think this is something that's now in front of a judge and we want to be careful about how we talk about this. I mean, as scintillating as all the legal theory may be, and believe me, we've had our share of it, it's something that we need to put in front of the judge and let him decide.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on the duration of the transition service agreement with Molina. How long that would be?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It is, I think, for now \u2013 maybe, Shawn, you could comment on it.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, it would depend on some of the timing of the ultimate close, so it could be through 2017. And if the close was later it could extend into 2018. Again, the buyer, if they're ready sooner than that always has the option to sort of assume full responsibility and exit that transition service agreement for certain markets when they're ready. But ultimately it will be a byproduct of the timing of close.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. When we look at the price per member here, $400 per member, which is quite low versus historic deals, what does it say about the profitability of this group of lives, and what does it say about Molina's realistic expectations of retaining this membership through open enrollment period?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","I won't get into the specifics right now, but I will tell you this is a profitable book of business. The valuation that you're citing is a per member valuation ex any capital so...","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","...keep that in mind. I'm not sure what you're comparing it to. Typically, people talk about the bigger numbers but they include the regulatory capital. That number is ex any capital.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the last question. ACA individual book, you're now saying lose $300 million pre-tax versus your previous expectation. That could be breakeven this year. Yet the PDR is only $65 million. I just wanted to understand that and I want to confirm it implies ACA individual be roughly a negative 10% pre-tax margin for the year.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, that's a little high but we're up into the \u2013 certainly the high single digits now as a margin for the full year. And again, keep in mind when you compare this to some of the other larger numbers you've heard, this is only for six months. While we've been in a loss position in 2014 and 2015, we haven't been in as deep a loss position as others have been, and you now probably are all experts in how the PDRs are calculated. You don't count all of the SG&A expenses, so it tends to be a fraction of what your sort of period losses would actually be on a fully reported basis.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, there. I'm hoping we could talk a little bit recognizing that you fully plan to close the deal. Are you willing to talk about a Plan B if the transaction doesn't happen, how much capital you have, what kinds of deployment of capital you're thinking about, what kind of growth rates you're thinking about in term of Aetna's standalone and other opportunities?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, Christine, we think we're going to get the deal done. We believe we're going to get the deal done. But it would be irresponsible for us not to have a Plan B in place and to understand all the levers we could pull. And we have reviewed the financial aspects of that with our board but have not finished all the various market impacts and growth rates, et cetera, on the plan. I think our long-term strategy is still our long-term strategy. The Humana combination allows us to get at certain assets and certain markets sooner than we otherwise would if we had to build it or buy it in other ways. And so our view is, is that we get the deal done, we have a Plan B on the sideline, our long-term strategy doesn't change. And we have already reconsidered all the capital redeployment. It's too early to go there. We're focused on getting our deal done.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And if the deal doesn't go through, how much of the transaction costs actually go away? Do 100% of the transaction costs that you've got below the line go away or is some of that your time, Shawn's time, the accounting department's time? How do I think about ongoing SG&A kind of standalone?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","So the easiest way to think about it is that there would be a bit of a wind-down but they would go away. We are not putting pieces, for example, of my time below the line. Those would be people who are fully dedicated to either work on the transaction and work on integration. Those people were taken from other jobs and they would go back likely to those jobs. So eventually, those would go away after a wind-down period.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Medicare Advantage continues to be strong. Maybe \u2013 so maybe if you can discuss your positioning for next year given your bids. I mean, you continue to say you're within target margins. I mean, are you looking for margin expansion next year or membership growth (44:32) excluding divestitures? And then related to that, how have conversations been developing on the group MA side? Thank you.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me speak to next year. I think we see less than 100-basis-point deterioration in the funding for Medicare Advantage, which we believe we can solve given the levers that we have to pull in multiple markets. As it relates to margin, it depends on the market. Medicare Advantage is local. It's a local market discussion and we have some markets that are at top margins and other markets that are performing under. We'll continue to work on all those markets to improve it. We continue to see good opportunities for growth, particularly with our STAR ratings and expect that we'll be able to continue to grow the top line on the book of business. So I think we're in a good place.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. And then for group, are you saying since the changes came out, any material conversations with some of your group clients about private exchanges or anything else?","Karen S. Lynch - President","Relative to group, we've seen a very strong pipeline, we feel good about our prospects on the group Medicare side. We grew membership in 2015, we expect to grow \u2013 we grew membership in 2016, we expect to have some modest growth in 2017 as well.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just lastly, your PPRD on the row flair (46:05) table is still quite strong though. On the release, you suggested Government was lower as you had called out previously. Does that mean Commercial was there? Maybe if you could talk about just some of the trends you saw in prior period reserve development? Thank you.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, it was across the board, and again that comment, I believe, in the press release is a year-over-year quarter-to-quarter view, as opposed to, did you get prior year or not. When you look at the roll forward and then when you look at the things like minimum MBR accruals, which offset some of that prior year development, it was probably worth around $0.10 in the quarter going back to last year.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Just wanted to clarify some of your comments earlier, Mark, on Molina. You said that the DOJ has done their homework on Molina. But at the same time obviously, they have thus far rejected the remedies that you've proposed. So do we \u2013 or do you know whether the DOJ have used Molina as a suitable buyer? Or that's still up in the air?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's not something that I could comment on. This will be in front of a judge to review. And so I think that's a further conversation that will continue to be had.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then Shawn, I believe you said in your prepared remarks, roughly half your ACA compliant members are new to Aetna. Did I hear that correctly? And then, you talked about the morbidity being worse now than it was \u2013 than what you expected earlier in the year. Is the morbidity worse in the new members only? Or is it across the board? Thanks.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","So that \u2013 yes. So that statement, half, that was specific to our individual membership, and the morbidity degradation is across the board, both existing, but also particularly in the new members that we have.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Gentlemen, do you view the Molina divestiture package as the complete response to the DOJ's concerns, or should we expect that there might be another transaction announced?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We think it responds in total to the DOJ's perceived issues around individual Medicare Advantage.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","And did you consider divestiture of businesses that would obviate the need for these interim transition services agreements? And if so, why were those not feasible?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure I understand your question, Dave. Could you explain it a little bit more?","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Well, I guess divesting a plan or a business with brand, with network, with contracts, et cetera, in place, where the acquirer is buying all of that in a package, that there is \u2013 essentially the member stays with the product and with the plan and with the network that they are on under you, they would transition all of that to the buyer. Is that not feasible?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Effectively, a lot of these things are not in clean legal entities that allow that sort of neat separation that you are describing, but effectively the transition service agreement provides exactly what you're describing in terms of sort of brand continuity, service continuity, network continuity. So effectively, that is exactly what the consumer will experience.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Just last question, switching gears, the efficiencies that you have talked about on the G&A front are pretty significant. Could you talk about some of the sources of those savings? I think you're seeing some absolute dollar declines in G&A there. Thank you.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Yes, this is really the sort of ongoing maturation of a fairly significant initiative that we've had in the company, where we would \u2013 we apply some of the tools around value stream design and lean and Six Sigma to our end-to-end sort of processes in the company. And so, to your point, I mean if you look at sort of our revenue growth and our absolute levels of G&A, you can really continue to see sort of the payoff in this particular area. So we've been working through a lot of significant processes all across the company now for the better part of probably a year and a half. And I think we're beginning to see the early payoff as a result of that.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","These investments in the quality of our processes and making them simpler is going to be better for a retail market. So it's an effort we've had underway for the last four years. Shawn pulled together a team that we pulled out of UTC and they've really started to get some traction. So we're excited about the prospects for that work going forward.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah. And I would emphasize Mark's point that this just isn't simple expense cutting. This is really meant to improve the quality of the end product to the customer, of which then efficiency savings sort of fall out of sort of better, more efficient processes.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Looks \u2013 just on the tax rate, looks like you guys took that guidance down by around 100 bps to 150 bps. Just checking on what the drivers of that was. Was that the HIC's losses affecting that, or something else? And then just a quick follow-up would just be the exchange lives, in terms of where you ended 2Q, I think you were at 911,000 in the first quarter, where that was in 2Q, and what you are expecting attrition for the back half of the year to be? Thanks.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Let me have Karen do the exchange lives, and I'll come back on the tax rate.","Karen S. Lynch - President","We finished the quarter at 838,000 exchange lives at the end of June.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah. So the tax rate is a couple of things. As the earnings sort of move around in proportion to the health insurer fee, that tax \u2013 there's some natural movement in that tax rate. So as we do better on the earnings front, it tends to bring that tax rate down a bit. But we also did implement the new accounting policy that some other people implemented in the first quarter around some of the equity comp treatment, and that had a very minor effect in the quarter. But that's also in there.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you. How should we think about the geographic dispersion of the book being divested? Is it concentrated for local density or disperse? And then what portion of this book is STAR bonus-eligible? For 2017, we were estimating Aetna's about 87%, Humana 77%, so is it in that range or is it more of an outlier book of business?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","I actually don't \u2013 I can certainly follow up, I don't know the exact STAR composition of this book of business in terms of in comparison to our 87% statistic. But needless to say, both Aetna and Humana are number one and number two in STAR ratings. So there is a good chunk of this business that has very high STAR ratings, and the purchase agreement assumes that those STAR ratings will continue to follow these members going forward.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","And the geographic dispersion on this? Are these locally concentrated groups that you are divesting or that really pretty spread out?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","They are specific counties. We've certainly thought about some of the issues around like the PPO products, for example, and have grouped those together where we think appropriate. It's obviously in 21 states, I believe, as you saw in the press release, but we have thought about that where appropriate.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean the counties are aligned in the DOJ complaint...","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Right.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...and where we had PPO product that touched those markets, we added actually more markets so that they could continue giving the same great experience to the members that we've given them.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, the counties are all out there and yet to be filed (55:07).","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Sanford C. Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lance Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and appreciate the color on the divestitures. Just had a follow-up question. It sounds, Mark, like you had talked about strength in the pharmacy results. I was interested in what drove that and how large of an impact it was.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Our pharmacy business, particularly around our self-insured customers has continued to do very well and has continued to grow year-over-year. So that's actually been an ongoing story.","Lance Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And one follow-up. Over on the selling season, it sounds like there has been a little slowdown, not for you guys, but just industry-wide as far as RFP activity. Have you seen any progress on the private exchange side there? And if so, what is your folks' outlook for that?","Karen S. Lynch - President","Yeah. I would say you're right that there has been a slowdown in the RFPs and there's been modest interest in the exchanges. We think people had to wait and see when the Cadillac tax changed. So we're seeing some activity, but not as much as we had anticipated.","Lance Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in. Appreciate it. So on the Commercial group business, you have had so many things going on internally and there's so much going on externally. I am just curious how you're thinking about margin versus membership there. The fact that you cited your Commercial book this year, you lost membership. You are not seeing individual, you won't have any expansion plans next year. The DOJ, you don't really know what will happen and it will be during your selling season. And simultaneously, I would expect the employer market may stabilize just because ObamaCare is leaving all these exits in its wake. And the small group definition is better. So how should we think about margin expansion again on MLR next year, or stable MLR, or more about a focus on membership?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Our MO around the Commercial risk business in particular has been to be cautious, cautious in terms of thinking about a trend increase and cautious of some of the new things coming into the market like ACA. And I'm certainly glad we've done that. I do think it's important though I wouldn't characterize it that we've had a number of issues. We have had one issue really in our group business, and that is the small group business, and particularly the small group ACA business.","Large group has been a very steady performer last year and this year. Frankly, even within small group, our non-ACA business is performing quite well. So this is really localized. And so as I mentioned in my remarks, we did assume that in our pricing that we would have a moderate trend increase this year, and that looks to have been a good assumption coming into this year. So I think we need to continue to be careful with this business. And in certain segments, you know we will continue to air on the side of caution versus growth, particularly the small group ACA is a good example.","Karen S. Lynch - President","And, Ana, one of the things that we're doing in the Commercial book is we are standardizing a fair amount of our products. We are introducing new exchange through our bswift acquisition. So we've got some introduction of new products and capabilities in the marketplace today, and we're seeing some good traction on our Commercial business as a result of those products and services.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. Thanks. So, can one assume that even though you don't commit right now to margin expansion in individual, you will likely see some? That combined with buyback and the G&A tailwinds from reduced transaction costs potentially and, of course, if the Humana deal goes through, then all of this is moot \u2013 would be enough for you to be very cautious still on your MLR rate on Commercial?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","I mean, overall, our margins are high single digit, at least 8% in our guidance. And so we think that's a really good standard to hold to. People have been waiting for that number to come down for a long time, and I think the diversified portfolio and the way we think about growing the business allows us to maintain that.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Very comforting. Thank you.","Joseph F. Krocheski - Vice President, Investor Relations, Aetna, Inc.","Thank you. Ana.","Joseph F.

Mr. Cowhey, please go ahead.","Thomas Cowhey","Good morning and thank you for joining Aetna's third quarter 2014 earnings call and webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna. And with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K. We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company's performance that are non-GAAP measures in our third quarter 2014 financial supplement and our updated 2014 guidance summary. Copies of which are available on the Investor Information section of Aetna.com.","We would also like to invite investors to mark their calendars for Aetna\u2019s 2014 Investor Conference, which will be held in New York City on December 11. Invitations for this limited attendance event will be sent shortly, and for those unable to attend in person, a webcast will be available. Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited. So we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini","Good morning. Thank you Tom and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we\u2019ve reported operating earnings per share of $1.79, well ahead of both analyst estimates and our previous projections.","Today, for the third time in as many quarters, we are also raising our 2014 operating EPS projection to a range of $6.60 to $6.70. At the midpoint this guidance represents nearly 7% year-over-year operating EPS growth and a 15% CAGR since 2010. And this performance will be good for a normal year. But to achieve this success in 2014, a year that many thought would spell the death of our industry, is a testament to the power of our strategy and the strength of our diversified portfolio as we seek ways to better serve our customers and create shareholder value through this period of significant change.","In the face of unprecedented change for our industry, our third quarter results position us to have a very good year. We grew medical membership by 470,000 members, achieving a record of approximately 23.6 million members. We grew quarterly operating revenue to a record $14.7 billion, a 13% increase from the prior year. We delivered 7.8% pretax operating margin, putting Aetna on track to achieve high single-digit operating margins again in 2014 and we continue to generate substantial free cash flow and aggressively deploy excess capital, returning over $1.2 billion to shareholders year-to-date.","As we reflect on our year-to-date performance, I\u2019d like to revisit some of the challenges we face this year, including pricing solving for nearly $1 billion in ACA related industry fees and taxes, solving for the largest rate cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in our recent history, navigating a host of new regulatory requirements in our small group and individual businesses, managing through a turbulent launch in public exchanges and controlling pharmacy costs in a year where heavy priced Hepatitis C treatments first became available and treatment guidelines changed in unforeseen ways.","Aetna\u2019s diversified portfolio continues to exceed our expectations in meeting these challenges. Our Government business, which now represents over 40% of our health premiums, is having a stand out year. Medicare continues to deliver in phase of a tough rate environment, strong execution in closing the 2014 funding gap and the corrective actions that we took last year to fix our underperforming Medicare businesses have resulted in higher than projected Medicare contributions.","Further, our year-to-date results put us on a path to have another excellent year in 2015. Finally, the recently released Medicare star ratings for the 2016 plan year were 79% of our current membership in plans rated four stars or greater, holds well for our future success. Medicaid continues to be another bright spot in the Aetna portfolio led by continued strong performance in our Kentucky Medicaid business. Medicaid membership and revenue growth also continue to be robust, ranging from our new contract in Illinois that went live on October 1st, our dual-eligible contracts in Ohio and Illinois, and continued growth in expansion lives. Group insurance which pressured earnings last year continues to post solid results in excess of our projections, driven by a favorable underwriting performance in our life insurance and disability products.","Finally, Coventry synergies continue to accelerate. We now project that we will achieve $0.60 per share of accretion from Coventry this year at the high-end of our $0.55 to $0.60 range and we have increased confidence in our $0.90 per share 2015 accretion goals. Well, we are quite pleased with our progress in achieving cost synergies and accretion from this transaction. We would note that there are other strategic and financial benefits that we have not quantified in our estimates. For example, we have not tallied the benefit of Medicare advantage revenue enhancement and star rating synergies that can be directly going to be influenced by Coventry\u2019s Medicare franchise.","Aetna\u2019s commercial business performance has also been quite strong with many of our businesses meeting or exceeding their projected contributions. Our fee-based businesses are having an excellent year. We have grown ASC membership by over 700,000 members\u2019 year-to-date and are exceeding our profit projections. From an overall perspective, our commercial risk business is performing well, notwithstanding the fact that we increased our outlook for the full year Commercial MBR. Our launch group commercial businesses are performing quite well and are meeting our year-to-date projections and our action plans to address pressures in our international and student health businesses have made excellent progress. As price increases in the international in a combination of pricing and other actions in student health have improved performance.","However, performance observed in the third quarter in the small end of our middle market business and premium accruals in our ACA compliant blocks of business caused us to prudently increase our full year 2014 Commercial MBR projections this morning to approximately 80%. Shawn will address our analysis of these commercial businesses and our action plans in greater detail. But we will remain quite pleased with the performance of our aggregate portfolio and our confident that this modest portion of the commercial business portfolio will not be a headwind to Aetna achieving its 2015 earnings goals.","As we look to 2015, we continue to believe we have the right strategy to drive growth and create long-term value for our shareholders. Our goal is growth both operating earnings and operating EPS every year and we believe we can achieve these goals in 2015. We plan on providing specific guidance for 2015 at our Investor Conference on December 11.","In summary, I am pleased with our results year-to-date and I am confident in our strategic direction and our ability to continue to execute, our ability to achieve Coventry synergies and our accretion goals, the power of our diversified portfolio to drive consistent and sustainable growth, our revised 2014 operating EPS projection of $6.60 to $6.70 per share, and our ability to grow operating earnings and operating EPS in 2015. I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers by focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers, and generating and deploying capital responsibility. We believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2014 outlook, and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2015. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin","Thank you Mark and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we\u2019ve reported third quarter 2014 operating earnings per share of $1.79, an 11% increase over the prior year quarter. Our year-to-date results are ahead of both our previous projections and analyst consensus estimates and as a result, we raised our 2014 operating EPS projection again this morning. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong operating fundamentals as evidenced by double-digit revenue growth, robust cash flow, healthy balance sheet metrics and achievement of target operating margins.","I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top-line performance continues to be very strong. We grew medical membership to a record of approximately 23.6 million members, adding 470,000 new members during the quarter, with growth in our Commercial ASC and Government businesses. The third quarter of 2014 represents Aetna's 10th consecutive quarter of medical membership growth. Our strong membership gains help to drive 13% operating revenue growth over the prior year quarter, achieving a record quarterly level of $14.7 billion. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our third quarter total Medical Benefit Ratio was 82.3%, a good overall result and an 80 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter.","Our operating expense ratio increased from the same period last year to 18.2%; however, excluding ACA fees from more expenses, our operating expense ratio went down by 70 basis points from the prior year quarter. This outstanding result was driven by fixed cost leverage as a result of our strong top line growth, Coventry synergies, and disciplined expense management. Our pre-tax operating margin was 7.8% consistent with our target operating margin range putting Aetna on track to achieve high single-digit operating margins in 2014. This result would represent Aetna's fifth consecutive year of achieving or exceeding this goal despite an increasing mix of lower margin government and public exchange revenue. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter 2014 dates of service.","Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days claims payable were approximately 50 days at the end of the quarter, up just over two days sequentially and higher by four days year-over-year. One of the primary drivers of this increase is our increased government revenue inside the quarter, particularly from high equity duals membership. We project this metric to return to a level more consistent with our recent historical experience over time.","Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. On a year-to-date basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.7x operating earnings. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing over 3 million shares in the quarter for $255 million and distributing approximately $80 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. We are quite pleased with our third quarter results, which we believe demonstrate the execution of Aetna's growth strategy, the success of the Coventry integration, and the value of our diversified portfolio.","I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business, our commercial membership grew by 390,000 members during the quarter, driven primarily by the addition of the TRS active care members, partially offset by declines in our commercial risk membership, and in-group attrition in our large group ASC membership. Our Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio was 81% for the quarter and 79.6% year-to-date, a good absolute result but higher than anticipated in our previous projections. For the full-year, we\u2019re now projecting that our Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio will be approximately 80%.","The change in our full year Commercial MBR outlook is primarily driven by three items. The first item is the performance of our smaller middle market business, groups with 51 to 300 employees which represent approximately 20% of our total commercial premiums. The second item is our individual business, where we have maintained a cautious posture all year and have maintained that posture in the third quarter, as we recorded our estimates for risk adjustors and risk corridors for the first time.","Finally, the third item is a prudent assumption of seasonally higher medical costs in the fourth quarter of this year. Let me walk you through these items in more detail. With respect to our smaller middle-market business, late in the third quarter as second quarter and early third quarter medical costs became more complete. Medical costs experienced almost higher than previously projected. As we examine this block of business in more detail, our analysis suggests that the impact of cost management initiatives, including benefit plan and network design changes, price into certain products have not had the desired impact on medical cost strengths for these populations.","Consequently, overall trend yield spread on this block are lower than previously projected. To address this emerging experience, which to be clear has not manifested itself in our larger experienced rated accounts, we have aggressively implemented pricing actions. First and foremost Aetna\u2019s forward pricing strategy remains consistent with prior years, favor in margin over membership and incorporating 50 basis to 100 basis points of increased commercial medical cost trend in our 2015 pricing formulas. Second, in September as we began to see lower than projected trend yield spread emerged, we took pricing actions on the affected businesses for 2015.","And finally, in October, we also took broader based pricing actions under remaining unpriced 2015 member months in our commercial business to further mitigate the impact of this emerging experience. We believe the performance of this specific block will improve in 2015 and should not serve as a barrier to achieving our 2015 goals.","Moving onto our ACA compliant blocks of business, based on our most up-to-date data and forecasting, we did make accruals related to each of the three hours this quarter, specifically we recorded $110 million of incremental re-insurance recoverable during the quarter, bring our total for the year to $162 million. We expect that the full-year accruals for re-insurance could exceed $320 million in 2014. Additionally for the first time this year, we recorded a net payable of $97 million related to the risk adjustors and risk corridors for our ACA compliant individual and small group policies. The booking of this net payable resulted in approximately 50 basis points of incremental commercial MBR pressure in the quarter, relative to our previous projections.","We\u2019ve maintained a cautious posture on this business all year and we believe it\u2019s prudent to continue to do so in the first year of this new and still largely immature program. To conclude on the Commercial MBR, I thought it would be useful to summarize the drivers of our change in our annual guidance. Based on the medical cost experience in our smaller middle market business this quarter, we have raised our 2014 Commercial MBR projections by approximately 50 basis points. To address premium approvals in our ACA compliance blocks of business this quarter and for the remainder of the year, we have lowered our premium yield assumptions increasing the Commercial MBR by approximately 25 basis points, and additionally we have assumed our Commercial MBR could increase by up to 25 basis points for the full year, based on a prudent assumption of seasonally higher medical cost in the fourth quarter of this year.","Stepping back, we continue to believe that aggregate commercial medical cost trend increases remain moderate. We continue to actively examine our experience for an uptick in utilization with a specific eye towards the newly approved all oral Hepatitis C treatments approved earlier this month.","We also continue to closely monitor the outpatient category, particularly emergency department usage. As we noted in September, the pharmacy category remains pressured and the outpatient category continuous to run towards the high-end of our projected range. But our in-patient, physician, and ancillary categories remain well-behaved. Based on our year-to-date experience and revised full year outlook, we currently projected that Aetna\u2019s standalone 2014 commercial medical cost trend will now be in the middle to upper-end of our original projected range of 6% to 7%. The change in this metric relative to our previous projections is primarily related to the performance of our smaller middle market business.","Moving on from commercial, our government franchise is another important growth lever for our business. Government is having a truly outstanding year, from both a growth and a profitability standpoint and now represents over 40% of our medical premiums. Our government business grew by 80,000 members in the quarter, consisting of: Medicare Advantage growth of 22,000 members; Medicare Supplement growth of 14,000 members; and Medicaid growth of 44,000 members, primarily from ACA related expansion and approximately 5,000 dual eligible members related to our participation in the Ohio and Illinois demonstration projects.","Aetna\u2019s strong government membership growth drove third quarter government premiums to a record $5.3 billion, a 19% increase over the prior-year period. Our Government Medical Benefit Ratio was 84% in the quarter, an excellent result in absolute terms and better than our previous projections. Drivers of this excellent performance include the success of actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap and continuing strong performance in our Medicaid business including in Kentucky.","Turning to the balance sheet; our financial position, capital structure, and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At September 30th, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 35%. Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $252 million. We repurchased over 3 million shares for $255 million and paid a shareholder dividend of approximately $80 million. After other sources, we ended the quarter with $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 351.7 million shares at September 30.","As a result of our third quarter performance for the third time and as many quarters, we are increasing our full-year 2014 operating earnings per share projections to a range of $6.60 to $6.70 per share, up from our previous guidance of $6.45 to $6.60 per share. This increased guidance range of the testament to the strength of our diversified portfolio and reflects strong performance in our government, fee-based, and group insurance businesses along with strong cost controls and increased accretion from the Coventry acquisition, which more than offset to specific performance items in our commercial insured business.","Our updated 2014 projections are also influenced by the following additional drivers. We continue to project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23.4 million members, a decrease of 200,000 members over the remainder of the year. This projected decrease is primarily related to projected declines in our individual business both on and off public exchanges. Based on our full-year membership projections and year-to-date results, we now project that our full-year 2014 operating revenue will be between $57 billion and $58 billion. As discussed, we now project our Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio will be approximately 80% for the full-year.","Based on our strong year-to-date performance across our government businesses, we now project our full-year Government Medical Benefit Ratio will be approximately 85% to 85.5% with [buyers] (ph) towards the bottom of this revised range. We now project our operating expense ratio will be less than 18.5% based on achievement of Coventry synergies and strong cost controls. It should be noted that a portion of our third quarter expense favorability is related to timing of spend, which will partially reverse in the fourth quarter.","We continue to project our pre-tax operating margin to be approximately 7.5% consistent with our high single-digit target. Consistent with our revised operating EPS range, we now project operating earnings to be approximately $2.4 billion. We continue to project net dividends from subsidiaries between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion with excess cash flow to the parent between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Based on our year-to-date share repurchases, we now project full-year weighted average share count to be at the low end of our previously projected range of 359 million to 360 million shares.","As you know, we do not typically provide forward your guidance on our third quarter call and we will not be providing specific 2015 guidance today. However, I wanted to offer you some insight into the major items that influenced our preliminary view of that just 2015 earnings power and give us confidence that we will be able to grow both operating earnings and operating EPS next year. As we complete our forecasting process for next year, we are incorporating a number of challenges into our preliminary view of 2015 including the projected impact of prior year\u2019s reserve development that we do not as a matter of course include in forward guidance.","The projected return to more normalized margins in our Medicaid business after the outperformance we experienced in 2014 and a modest headwind from exiting our Delaware Medicaid contract. The projected margin reset in our Group Insurance segment given the strong outperformance we experienced in 2014 and the risk that we will be unable to collect 100% of the increase in the health insurer fee including the necessary tax growth across all of our lines of business in 2015. We would also note several opportunities including the projected impacts of incremental Coventry synergies as we continue to work to achieve or exceed our stated goal of $0.90 of accretion in 2015. The prospects for Medicare margin expansion as we benefit from the investments that we have made in our Medicare Advantage business.","Fixed cost leverage as we continue to grow revenue and actively manage costs, up to $1 billion in share repurchases in 2015 and the prospect for growth and margin improvement in our individual business particularly in our declining of exchange membership base, which is driving losses in our overall individual business in 2014. In working through our preliminary view, we also considered the potential impact of our forward pricing strategy. Specifically consistent with past practice, our 2014 pricing contemplates a 50 basis points to 100 basis points increase in utilization in addition to the specific pricing actions we discussed earlier.","We believe this prudent pricing pasture that favors margin over membership, should largely mitigate the recent Commercial MBR performance in our smaller middle market businesses.","In closing, we are pleased with the strength of our third quarter and year-to-date results and our improved 2014 outlook, which at the midpoint represent 7% operating EPS growth, in spite of the many challenges facing our industry in 2014. As we continue to execute during this challenging time for our industry, we are confident that we can achieve our increased 2014 projections and are well-positioned for a successful 2015.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Tom Cowhey","","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. (Operator Instruction) Operator, the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We\u2019ll take our first questions from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","","Thanks. Good morning. So one question would be focus on that 51 book to 300 book. By my math it\u2019s coming out to \u2013 it sounds like that book is up 500 basis points higher than you expected, just kind of looking through the impact you\u2019ve laid out here. So, if that\u2019s so, can you flush out some of the details around the product changes, the medical management initiatives that you had expected to moderate trends this year in that book? And what went wrong looking back? And then, can you lay out how much of this you were able to price back for next year? How much of this renews for one-one, how much you catch and when? All those details, so we can kind of understand the headwind into the next year. Thanks.","Mark T. Bertolini","Thanks, Justin. This is Mark. I\u2019ll give a broader outlook and then I\u2019ll have Shawn talk a bit about the numbers. I think what we\u2019re seeing with this book of business is the transition as we move into the Affordable Care Act and then transition of the 51 book to 100 book, particularly book of business moving into small group over time and having to be ACA complaint. There is a lot of noise in this book and in this segment relative to changes in the ACA regulation on the flag, keep what you have, early enrollments. And so we think a lot of it was related to the sort of (indiscernible) and the noise around all the things that were changing at the latter part of last year. But we did realize we were having a problem as we\u2019re moving through the year and this book of business. And we did take pricing actions, which I\u2019ll have Shawn give you a little more detail on.","Shawn M. Guertin","Yes. So, Justin let me start out and just make sure I level set for sort of everybody\u2019s benefit. While this 51 book to 300 book issue has manifested itself in higher medical cost trend versus our prior projections, we do not believe that it is a broad based movement in medical cost trend, but rather the difference between some assumptions we made in pricing and then what has ultimately emerged in the experience. So, to your question, we made \u2013 there are a number of things that we certainly have done in this block, and we\u2019ve looked at a network of providers that are smaller and higher quality to drive lower cost. We\u2019ve looked at a lot of benefit plan changes. We always have a host of medical management type initiatives sort of the trend vendors that people talk about. All of those things tend to have both, sort of a pair of medic effect of getting higher co-pays, for example, lower unit cost, but they also tend to have a behavioral effect as well.","And so, the ability to always predict precisely what they\u2019re going to do is an estimate. And at the end of the day we made some of those forward assumptions in the pricing of this block and as of yet we have not seen sort of the consequence medical cost savings. So that really is sort of a background on that in terms of that. In terms of pricing, and I think this is really the important part of this. As soon as we saw this, we took very aggressive action. So in September we acted on the affected block and put price increase and that would capture somewhere on the order of two-thirds of that block. And so keep in mind, this is smaller business. So there is both less lead time and a little more rate flexibility than we have on either large group or small group.","In addition to that, in October we took more broad based pricing action on our whole book to try to make up for the gap. Those two things right there would produce 60 bps to 65 bps of fix next year. And as we mentioned in the remarks, there are certainly other levers that we potentially have here like our forward pricing strategy, selected action on other blocks of business in the medical cost lever.","Justin Lake \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","So, Shawn, just to be clear that 65 basis points to 70 basis points of impact is relative to what would be \u2013 you said 50 basis points to this year, but only in the back half of the 100 basis points. So you got maybe that two-thirds essentially, but you\u2019re saying that\u2019s before the 50 basis points to 100 basis point of just pricing op for typical conservatism. That\u2019s the way that is operated?","Shawn M. Guertin","It is right, but let me be really clear about this, right. So there\u2019s 50 basis points of pressure, but as I mentioned in my remarks, this really began to emerge as we looked at how second quarter developed. So it really is a sort of three quarter effect if you will. So if you want to take the 50 basis points and say what kind of issue is that carrying into 2015, it\u2019s probably 60 basis points to 75 basis points. Those two actions that I described probably get you 60 to 65 and I\u2019m not counting anything from the forward pricing strategy or any other lever in there other than those two.","Justin Lake \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","","Thanks for the detail.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays","","Great, thanks. I hate to do, but I\u2019m going to stick on the same topic, so I guess my question is, you guys seems to think this is indicative of expectations, reality versus sort of expectations \u2013 last year you talked about an expectation and I understand that the broad book of business where you see, an uptick in utilization I was expected in pricing, you price for that. And then it sounds like for this specific book were you expecting some of your medical management efforts to actually, reduce medical cost and that\u2019s just not materializing or you actually seeing an increase in cost I guess I\u2019m just confused as to what exactly changed and what were you thinking coming into the year?","Mark T. Bertolini","I think it\u2019s coming into the year, we\u2019re thinking that the lower end of this block the 51 to 100, Josh was going to transition and move to more like small group into our narrow network models. But as we got into early renewal keep what you have, shop exchange is not coming up, we start to see pressures to move back the products that I already had, but I think it\u2019s in that early renewal strategy that our pricing wasn\u2019t as pinpoint as it could be on that block.","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays","I was just going to say, you sounds like your expectations are on that specific book of business that they were going to move into small group products that tend to run lower MLRs they stayed in existing ones that have higher MLRs?","","Mark T. Bertolini","I think that was part of the noise in the process, so we didn\u2019t get as much movement narrow networks, there is much movement toward the medical management programs we wanted to see. And so, the mix of business was different than we initially price for.","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays","Got it, and then just one quick one the prior period reserve development, I know some of that related to 2Q. So how much is the total, I know you guys don\u2019t project that but what is that you know, as you looked it as a challenge shown on the prior periods development in 2014 that would not be expected in guidance for 2015.","Mark T. Bertolini","I think we\u2019ve talked about that being in the neighborhood of about $0.40 this year through the third quarter.","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays","Perfect, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, just to be clear, the pressure on that mid-market, small mid-market group, are those in Grandfathered plans now that would \u2013 because you said that they were early renewals, so they are non ACA compliance or the Grandfathered, these plans would have, members would have to stay with you, (indiscernible) prices.","","Shawn M. Guertin","","No. Peter, this business actually isn\u2019t subject to that at all, it\u2019s 51 to 300. So it\u2019s not sort of the classic small group 2 to 50. One of the references is that Mark made is that the sort of sub-segment of that that\u2019s 50 to 100 will eventually have to become ACA compliant in 2016. And as a result of that I think a lot of other things in this space as Mark mentioned, there\u2019s been a lot more turbulence in this sort of book in terms of plan change, renewals, new business and things like that. But the 51 to 300 block itself is not a block that subject to sort of the ACA compliance.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay and then just talking about the overall price increases, you\u2019ve talked about 50 to 100 basis point of higher utilization expected, so that\u2019s added on top of I guess the 150 to 200 basis points, if you had in the 6% to 7% cost trend this year, is that accurate, or is it \u2013 are you lowering the view on utilization?","Shawn M. Guertin","No, it would be 50 to 100 basis points up from our view for this year, which we now or I think it\u2019s going to be in the middle to the high-end of our previous range of 6% to 7%.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","So if we add that to what\u2019s been going on for unit cost, you are being sort of the 6.5% to 7% \u2013 7.5%, view on cost trend for next year, is that accurate or is there some other math that should be factored in there?","Shawn M. Guertin","I think, I don\u2019t want to put too fine a point on it yet for that, but I would think about it is more cleanly as we would always try to sort of manage unit cost increases to not be accelerating, maybe we could make a little bit at in-roads. But I think for the purpose of your question and I think where you\u2019re going with it, it\u2019s easier to think about the 50 to 100 basis points being on top of sort of the 6.5% to 7% that we\u2019re talking about now.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, and then, in terms of just to finalize, you talked about additional pricing actions on top of that that were implemented beyond that 50 to 100, so how much more beyond that, is that the 60 to 65 Bips that you\u2019ve talked about?","Shawn M. Guertin","Correct.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay thank you.","Shawn M. Guertin","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay thanks. I wanted to ask about your commentary about the headwinds sort of next year you\u2019ve mentioned the returned in old margin the Medicaid after that performance in 2014. I wanted to understand what the mechanism was for that, are you expecting rate cuts, I know that the expansion of the population generally has come in well with our states, going back and looking at the rates for next year. Why would you expect to return?","Mark T. Bertolini","We have some renewal states next year that we will need to negotiate. And as we negotiate they look at the underlying trends in that book and what\u2019s they can afford. We know we have a new rate coming in Kentucky in July next year, so that will set a different benchmark, as well. So that will put pressure on the margins we have in Medicaid. In addition we have tools that are coming in through the latter half of this year and in the next year, and that will pressure, because we book conservatively our duals membership revenue of medical costs.","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So, you include duals on your Medicaid commentary?","Mark T. Bertolini","We do. Correct.","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just one other quick question, the Q4 commentary, you said that part of the guidance on MLR was a conservative view about seasonality into Q4. I guess, you\u2019ve always probably would have assume seasonality into Q4, something you can do and something different now with your guidance, I just wasn\u2019t sure? What exactly that was referring to?","Mark T. Bertolini","Really it is pretty straight forward, what it is, is just an assumption that we might see a little bit more incremental seasonality in Q4 then was inherent in our prior predictions and we\u2019ve banded that at anywhere from zero to 20 \u2013 up to 25 bips which the 25 bips for the full year would be about 100 basis points right in a quarter. So it\u2019s really just making greater provision for the seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter, than existed in our prior projections.","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, probably given some of the commentary on this call, people little bit worried about trend rising. So how do we think about, you provisioning more for seasonality in the Q4 versus an assumption that trend is accelerating, how do you differentiate that is those two points in your mind?","Mark T. Bertolini","It\u2019s a larger group of HICs membership, which there detectable et cetera to reset at the beginning of the year. So we have that book of business, which is maturing through the year remember we had a lot of growth in April and May in the later part of that enrollment period. So we are just being prudent and are thinking about how the fourth quarter is going to develop given ex-membership.","Shawn M. Guertin","Yeah. Kevin I\u2019d go back to the point of my statement about does not appearing to be broad base. So I would not read that into what we\u2019re doing with seasonality I would read it more into making a prudent provision for this metric in the fourth quarter. And again I reiterate part of the reason we see that is our large group business is performing with expectations and in someway that is the most trend evident business we have, and that it\u2019s largely priced on that customer\u2019s experience in a trend assumption.","And that business is performing very well. And as I mentioned, other than the categories I mentioned in the third quarter around outpatient in Hep C most of the other categories are very well-behaved in consistent with our expectation.","So that is not certainly was not the intent of making that provision and again I would reiterate that when we look at the data today does not appeared that\u2019s happening across our book","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That makes sense. So that is really just a specific part of the book that you\u2019re clearly more for that detectable part of the book, it\u2019s a seasonality comes on it.","","Mark T. Bertolini","","Yes, I mean that\u2019s what creates the seasonal affect on earnings.","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, right. Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Carrol with Stifel.","Thomas Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","","Hey, good morning. I wonder if you would comment a bit more on the three [oars] (ph) that you had in your prepared remarks. I think you said there was a $97 million payable for individual and small group. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of the process that you go through at this point to build out that number and I can\u2019t determine what kind of conservatism is built into that. And then, secondly, I was wondering if you would quantify the PPD amount that you would like us to exclude as we think about 2015?","Mark T. Bertolini","","Okay. On the latter, it\u2019s the same $0.40 that I referenced before. I think it might have been Josh who asked that question remember, but about $0.40, Tom. So, as you know, we have been accruing for reinsurance all along and that\u2019s a pretty clean accrual and that is based on known claims. So it\u2019s really these other two [oars] (ph), which we haven\u2019t accrued for up until now.","I think most of you know that we do not get any official data from the government to do this calculation. And so, we are relying on a consultant who is getting the data from as many payers as they can in these markets, so that we can get a better assessment of where our risk profile stands versus the average. You\u2019ll hear people refer to that as the weekly data. So we have that data and we got that actually very late in September. And I would tell you that looking at the data we know it\u2019s not perfect. And, so to some degree we had to exercise some judgment in what we saw in there.","And for example, we know not every payer is in there, and so a simple example of why it\u2019s not perfect. When we look at that data, it became fairly evident to me that we are going to be in a risk adjuster payable position. And so, I thought it made sense and I thought we could certainly make a reasonable estimate of then what that risk adjuster payable would be applying some judgment to the data and then running back through the rest of the formula. The net of that is this sort of $97 million payable that we have.","In terms of I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate with such (indiscernible) on the amount of conservativism in there. But as I mentioned we\u2019ve taken a cautious tack on this all year. And I think in arriving at our estimate of the $97 million, we maintain that posture as we analyze that data and applied our judgment to it.","Thomas Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","So is that turns out to be too conservative that would flow back through the income statement at some point, presumably in 2015. Would that look like \u2013 would you package that with PPD or would it be a separate process that you would communicate to us?","Mark T. Bertolini","It\u2019s really a revenue item and I think in our Q, we were disclosing the net amount, so I think it would be apparent, but you have a very good point, which is I\u2019m not sure that this data is going to be so far advanced for the fourth quarter that we\u2019re still not going to have to take a bit of a cautious pasture here. So probably will be into next year when we start to get a little bit more clarity or precision rather to this particular estimate.","Thomas Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks good morning. First just to following out on the exchanges maybe broadly \u2013 can you give us a sense of where you stand on margins for the exchange book at this point?","Mark T. Bertolini","Specifically, let me be clear about this. On our overall individual block, which is both on and off exchange business, we have a modest loss year-to-date and would be projecting a modest loss for the full-year. As this is emerging, we are losing money as I mentioned in my prepared remarks on the off exchange business and making a modest amount of money on the on exchange business. That\u2019s really driven more by the fixed cost leverage because we got more membership then we thought as opposed to sort of get the underwriting performance is a lot better than expected in fact the MBR, we\u2019re probably still booking at a little bit worse than we might have expected on a year-to-date basis, but we are getting some leverage.","So overall individual is a loss year-to-date and a loss for the year, the HIF is sort of marginally profitable and then we\u2019re losing on the off. And that\u2019s the point I was making in my prepared remarks, which is we\u2019re not doing keep what you have on that off exchange business. So that business will either decide to leave us or by one of our ACA compliant plans in which case generally those plans are at a higher premium level than the current premium rates in place. So we think both either one of those developments will serve to sort of improve the picture in 2015 as opposed to 2014 on this business.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, all right. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe could you just breakout commercial trend for inpatient versus outpatient book and at this point when you look at sort of the hospital spend, can you just remind us what percentage is inpatient versus outpatient? Thanks.","Shawn M. Guertin","Inpatient is 25%, outpatient is 15%. Yeah, that wouldn\u2019t change again most of we said impatient and all would be mid-to-high singles really driven more by unit cost outpatient is at the high-end of that high single digit range and the other\u2019s physician has been mid-single and that\u2019s behaving well, so again all the other categories really other than outpatient and pharmacy sort of Hep C driven are pretty much sort of right in the range of where we thought this year.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Arnold, Cowen and Company.","Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen and Company","Hi there. As I think about Medicare versus Medicaid performance year to-date this year versus next year on that broad level, I understand that Kentucky\u2019s outperformance the new rate may not continue second half of next year, how are you looking and you did mention that Medicare Advantage margins could improve, could you help me think about kind of the Medicaid headwind versus the Medicare Advantage tailwind, and how do you? What do you see driving that Medicare Advantage tailwind? Is it membership growth, is it margin or is it both?","Mark T. Bertolini","On Medicare it is both, I would expect that we would grow membership next year and I would expect sort of given some of the revenue things we\u2019ve been doing around stars and risk adjusted revenue and the improvements we\u2019ve made in that process, that will give us an opportunity to expand the margin in that business after a year or that was virtually impossible obviously to do given the rate cut.","The Medicaid that headwind is exactly the one you\u2019ve referenced in the previous person questioned about that will largely have to deal with rate reset throughout 2015 and I think your point on Kentucky is a good one which is that the rates do not reset there until July 1 of next year, so that is a back half issue for us. And as mark mentioned, the performance of these new high acuity populations and how that would play out, so I don\u2019t want to get into sort of quantifying these with specificity right now, but those are the big drivers.","Shawn M. Guertin","I would note Christine that this all relative to the rate for 2015 the Medicare Advantage is much smaller than it was last year we were 800 basis points last year were less than 200 basis points this year.","Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen and Company","And then (indiscernible) quarter that you have booked any of these quarters to offset the risk adjuster payable?","Shawn M. Guertin","Yes, we are in a risk adjuster payable position and when you run that through the math we then get a risk corridor receivable. I actually think the net number here because the two are very interrelated the net number here is the right number to think about and especially given some of the judgment that we had to apply with the data. But we do have risk adjusted on a payable position in the quarter and a receivable position with the net being the $97 million payable.","Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen and Company","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yes. Maybe I could just pickup exactly where you were on the three R\u2019s, my question on the $97 million. So that\u2019s a new item that you didn\u2019t \u2013 haven\u2019t guidanced, does that mean that other areas of your \u2013 I mean it\u2019s about $0.25 if I\u2019m calculating it right to the full-year EPS. What other areas of the business if I do that right absorbed the earnings impact of that?","Shawn M. Guertin","","Yes. As I mentioned, the impact of that was smaller and let me explain why, you may recall that, especially in second quarter. We accrued very carefully in anticipation of having to book for this and in an attempt to make sure we covered this when we had to book. So in essence that money had been in the claim reserve if you think about it that way. When we actually did the booking, and we did all the math and applied our judgment obviously, some of that \u2013 some of what funded that $97 million, what had been resident in our reserves, the breakage around that is what we are sort of talking about in the quarter, which is about 50 basis points, which is plus or minus $35 million or $40 million pre-tax in the quarter.","Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay, got it. Okay, that makes sense. And as you talk about, the pricing actions that you are putting in, can you give us any granularity on what you see in the market in terms of competitor price actions, in terms of the regulatory situation that you may face albeit that\u2019s not going to be an issue I gather in the 51 to 300 although maybe at the lower end to that would be, but can you just give us some detail on that?","Mark T. Bertolini","The markets remain rationale in pricing and as we go through [hick\u2019s] reprising and renewals. We\u2019re not at the top or the bottom and any of those markets. We are pretty much in the middle maintaining our competitive position. As we go into the market, where we have had concerns about what our rate increases would yield with regulators. We\u2019ve had conversations with them beforehand in order to ameliorate any public impact as a result of those discussions to get the rates where we were both comfortable.","And so I think overall, we see the market being pretty rationale, including in the non-regulated rate environments, particularly in the small middle market where we have taken these actions. So, we don\u2019t expect anybody to be pricing irrationally other than the occasional local markets where we see some impact from time-to-time.","Shawn M. Guertin","","Yes and then I would say sort of the best evidence of that is sort of a proof in the putting concept and that is we really haven\u2019t been growing in fact have got stronger commercial risk membership at its core this year. And so, I think that sort of evidence of the fact that of our cautious pricing pasture, but the fact that that\u2019s not some precipitous drop either also shows that we\u2019re sort of \u2013 that the market is sort of on or about and around us to Mark\u2019s point about the rationality of the market. It\u2019s a trade-off that we have been willing to make in order to try to protect the Commercial MBR over time.","Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Yes, okay, good point. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup","","Great, thanks. I was hoping if you could help me with the conservatism that you\u2019ve suggested for the commercial loss ratio in the fourth quarter to get to the 80% for the full-year, it looks like the commercial loss ratio would have to increase less than 50 basis points sequentially. You know when I look last year, it was up 130 basis points, 350 basis points up in the fourth quarter two years ago. So it seems like there is actually less of an assumption for an increase in this fourth quarter, despite appetite to see higher individual business, some of the other things that you\u2019ve cited.","Mark T. Bertolini","Yes, I think there is a couple of things that you\u2019re not thinking about there. And first half I would say, we\u2019re saying approximately 80% and if you go through the guidance bridge, it certainly could be 80.1% or 80.2%. I mean I\u2019m not going to put that fine \u2013 a point of it on, but most importantly, when you think about the 81% that were just printed, as I mentioned some of what we incurred this quarter for the small to middle market business and the risk adjuster true up really has to do with Q2 as well as we\u2019ve seen that experienced a merge.","So you sort of have to back out of the 81%, maybe 50 basis points or 75 basis points of the 150 basis points of pressure. The other thing is the point I made last quarter, if you go back to my comments, the reinsurance accrual on the individual business is going to go from a $160 million and our projection is to at least 320, okay. So that went up about $100 million in Q3, so that\u2019s call at a 150, 160, when you do the math on that that\u2019s probably another 70 basis points of sort of positive MBR effect that we get out of the reinsurance timing.","I think when you do that math you\u2019ll come up closer to sort of 150 to 200 sort of basis point uptick for a seasonal progression.","","Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andy Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide any updates at this point on how the National Accounts kind of ASC selling season progressed and then maybe related at your beneficiary of private exchange at this year, any update on how we should think about the private exchange opportunity and or headwinds maybe heading into 2015? Thanks.","Mark T. Bertolini","We expect to see some ASC, Commercial ASC attrition in the fourth quarter and that will continue into the beginning part of next year, so we\u2019ll see some shrinkage in the ASC market. But we will see net \u2013 an increase in revenue as a result of more private exchange membership and the commercial insured market.","Andy Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks. And then just lastly in the G&A, you\u2019ve kind of suggested there is a slightly different maybe seasonality this year with this quarter being a little bit lower with more investments maybe next year \u2013 next quarter maybe if you could just talk about what some of those moving pieces were and then just related to that how we should think about the seasonality maybe going forward, is this 2014 kind of the way we should think about that we\u2019re remodeling 2015?","Mark T. Bertolini","Yes, as you know it\u2019s always sort of our seasonally highest SG&A quarter and so there are number of items going on, the typical sort of marketing, an open enrollment and customer initialization type expenditures. Obviously, we\u2019re bringing up these new dual contracts in Medicaid and things like that. In addition, the type \u2013 the timing of some of the revenue enhancement work we\u2019re doing at Medicare is pushing into the fourth quarter.","We wrote 400,000 ASC members on the TRS-Active Care account on 09\/01. So that expenses were shows up for a full quarter. So you\u2019re right. The biggest item driving sort of Q3 earnings to Q4 is really on the SG&A line, but really it\u2019s a host of items that are both typical and growth related that are driving that uptick.","Andy Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks. So Shawn I\u2019m just interested if you could may be walk us through the mechanics of how you \u2013 we can be seeing a large increase in the reinsurance assumption that at the same time that we\u2019re also seeing an increase or an update in the risk adjustment payable? Does this just mean that the overall launches or cause are so much more significant across the overall market or does this just have to do more with that pressure that you\u2019re sighting in the off exchange business, which is really driving the higher reinsurance payments in the Neon exchange business it\u2019s different in terms of the profile the membership there, which is why you could have a risk adjustment payable relating to that.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah, some of that is sort of the OpEx change ACA business and remember there is also some ACA small group business that\u2019s subject to this now, so some of it is that. But don\u2019t confuse the size of the re-insurance recoverable as being worse than expected, and in fact it\u2019s not and in terms of sort of what we had originally estimated in pricing which lines up actually quite well with the conclusion that were going to be a net pay in on risk adjusters.","So while it\u2019s a big amount and it\u2019s stepping up, this just has more to do with how this emerge is inexperience than it does sort of a this is worse than expected, that\u2019s not true actually.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, so it\u2019s more \u2013 just you\u2019re giving us more granularity on the quarterly breakdown of how of those re-insurance or accruals will develop over the course of the year?","Shawn M. Guertin","I think it\u2019s the first time we\u2019re giving you a full year estimate now that we have sort of gotten into sort of a bit more stable block.","Mark T. Bertolini","But typically we reinsured this business ourselves and it\u2019s included in our reserves as we go through the year this we have to do separately because we have to charge the government for as it occurs. So you are seeing something that normally occurs in our small group in individual business, all of our commercials insure business for that matter, that usually stuck into the reserving models that we\u2019re using into the pricing that we\u2019re putting into the market, so you\u2019re seeing that exposed to this process because we have to go to the government for the reimbursement.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then just one related follow up, just on the individual lives, just can you update us on what the total size of the membership is now and what the breakdown is between on and off exchange?","Shawn M. Guertin","At the end of the quarter we had a little under 600,000 on exchange members and a little bit under 500,000 off exchange members.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners","Yeah thanks. Good morning I appreciate you\u2019re taking my question. So it seems to me is that you guys beat on MLR we don\u2019t talk about all these little pieces of it on student health and small this and all that. So, just taking a step back it does feel like trend deal spread is narrowing, and they could be in a more macro perspective, three things I think you\u2019ve mentioned one more (indiscernible) than the other, that there is a new regulated channel for purchase, so are seeing pressure if you will because employers have an alternative.","The other two are competitive pressures I think you said its rationale and the third one which is brought up by hospitals. Is that there is actually a cyclical rebound in trend. Out of these three things, which one dominates (indiscernible) would you agree that trend deal spread is narrowing, at least it has for this year? And what is really the driver of this and how do you see that playing out to 2015 then?","Mark T. Bertolini","","Well, again this narrowing of the trend yield spread that you\u2019re referencing is really focused in this 51 to 300 block. And when you look inside that, it\u2019s even more focused in the 51 to 100 block that I mentioned before. That\u2019s about a third of that block, but it\u2019s more than half sort of the issue that we\u2019re talking about today. And there are certainly, I would say the biggest item is the item that I started with which is, we\u2019ve made some assumptions about cost and renewal behavior and things like that and we\u2019re not seeing sort of the resultant trend yield spread on that.","But I would say out of all of those things, it\u2019s the thing that Mark mentioned before. This is a very turbulent segment, if you will. And, again, we\u2019re seeing sort of different persistency and new business patterns in this segment than we\u2019ve seen before, as this is a block that will eventually have to become ACA compliant.","So, I think it\u2019s a combination of, again, the pricing assumptions versus what we\u2019ve seen manifest itself and then some of the churn, if you will, sort of inside this block that have pressured this specifically. I\u2019d reiterate again that the cleanest area to look at trend yield is actually our large group business and that\u2019s performing consistent with expectations.","Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners","So it sounds like it\u2019s more about the employers having some more negotiating leverage, if you will, as you either try to keep what they have or get them to really see \u2013 try to really see a compliant or whatever. So for 2015, what is the pricing flexibility that you have for 2015 in that block? And do you think employers would have that kind of price so that wouldn\u2019t be priced elastic and that they would just \u2013 they grew the commercial group market or do they all just move more to exchanges in the 50 to 100?","Shawn M. Guertin","","I think, Ana, if the small group shop exchanges were up and the individual exchanges were functioning at a fairly high level we would see more of that. I just think a lot of employers don\u2019t really at that level pay a lot of attention to this stuff until they have to. And given all the changes and regulations they\u2019re sort of struggling to fit this into how they think about, how they move forward with benefits. And so, we\u2019ve had approaches to them about our early renewals. We had all sorts of conversations with them about how they ought to think about this. And I think it\u2019s just very turbulent and difficult to pin down.","So our approach is to be much more conservative on the pricing. And so, if there\u2019s anything that we could agree with relative to trend is that we always look toward 50 basis points to 100 basis points increase in utilization in forward pricing on our business and we continue to hold that point of view.","Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners","Okay. And then finally, I think you\u2019ve made an interesting point about making some money on the public exchanges, but it was largely from SG&A leverage less about medical underwriting, and it seems like that\u2019s kind of just a broad schematic outlook for managed care right now, more top line, and finally a unit growth story, it\u2019s more about SG&A leverage and underwriting margins are coming in. Will that be fair and then given that what kind of an organic mode which you contemplate to?","Mark T. Bertolini","And I think we\u2019ve yet to see how the individual market will settle out. I would argue that the public exchange markets right now were more stable than off exchange individual market, which has a lot of turnover almost a third of it every year turns over. It\u2019s usually people in and out of employment and moving through and so there is not a lot of stability in the off exchange market. I think we\u2019re going to see more stability in the on exchange market. And we\u2019ve yet to see how that\u2019s going to mature over time and how the competitive dynamics going to come into play, we\u2019ll see that soon over the next couple of months. So I wouldn\u2019t argue that it\u2019s just about operating leverage. We\u2019re pricing to a margin. We expect to get that margin, so we can get our return on capital. We don\u2019t know what the dynamics of that individual marketplace will be on exchange and until we get to another cycle or to.","Shawn M. Guertin","That\u2019s much more to do with taking a cautious pasture on this new program and if in fact when you think about being in risk adjuster payable position having less than your actuarial best estimate of reinsurance. There\u2019re many things actually that you could look at that have a positive tone to them from an underwriting performance. It\u2019s just right now that is not where we feel we should have that business until matures more.","Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners","Got it, thanks a lot.","Mark T. Bertolini","I would also ask that everyone please limit themselves to one question, so that we can get to the remaining people in the queue. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David Styblo \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Good morning. It\u2019s Dave Styblo for Windley. I going to ask a question similar to Carl\u2019s earlier, but as we think about the bridge to the fourth quarter government [NOR] (ph), it looks like you\u2019re making in about a 150 basis point increase. I am curious \u2013 I think it was flat last year, so I am curious what the assumptions are that that would cause us to ramp so much, is it I sense perhaps but it\u2019s the duals coming online, but can you give us a better sense of that bridge please.","Mark T. Bertolini","It\u2019s largely \u2013 it\u2019s the duals. And so, we have a lot of passive enrollment coming online later in the year. The group \u2013 the business starting to grow, in the beginning it was not passive enrollment, but now we\u2019re seeing that as we go through the year and that\u2019s ramping up. So we\u2019re being conservative in our estimates of what we believe cost to be in that segment.","David Styblo \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Thanks","Operator","Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS","Hi, everyone. Mark, you\u2019ve commented openly about potential for consolidation within the industry. At this point in the call maybe I will ask that broad question do you see prospects for a consolidation activity stepping up as we look into 2015. You\u2019re in a position now with where you\u2019ve got Coventry to be an active participant. And how \u2013 as you thought \u2013 thinking about what would be of interest evolves at all.","Thomas Cowhey","One time on Coventry, so we are at the higher end of our range $0.55 to $0.60 on our accretion, we expect that $0.90 will be achievable in 2015. And we have not been able to qualify things like the impact of Medicare stars ratings and the impact of the Medicare team from Coventry on our results to-date, but we still see $0.90 is very achievable.","The Coventry integration is done, the Coventry migration is not. So we still have work to do in transitioning systems. However, our balance sheet is in better shape, our cash flow strong and we continue to look at acquisitions in the technology space around provider and around consumer and are always interested in discussing consolidation opportunity should exist where we believe we have an opportunity to get a fair return to our shareholders.","A.J.

My name is Celia, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Aetna First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cowhey, please go ahead.","Thomas F. Cowhey","Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call and Webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna. And with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will respond to your questions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently-projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC, including our 2012 Form 10-K and our first quarter 2013 Form 10-Q, when filed.","We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company's performance that are non-GAAP measures in our first quarter 2013 financial supplement and our 2013 guidance summary. These reconciliations are available on the Investor Information section of aetna.com.","In addition, please note that Aetna will now be guiding to our operating expense ratio rather than our previous guidance on the business segment operating expense ratio. This change reflects the decline in variability of pension obligation expense following our pension plan changes in 2010.","Also note that Aetna has begun providing adjusted operating EPS in our financial supplement. Consistent with our presentation of this metric at our Investor Conference in December, this metric starts with operating EPS and adds back the intangible amortization associated with our acquisitions. We believe this is a useful way to look at the strength of the cash generated by the business, particularly after the Coventry acquisition, as it helps demonstrate our financial capacity to invest in the business, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders.","Unless specifically otherwise noted, all of Aetna's projections discussed today include the impact of the sale of our Missouri Care business but exclude the impact of the proposed Coventry acquisition.","Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in nonpublic forums is limited. So we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini","Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.50, representing a 12% increase over the first quarter of 2012. Aetna's first quarter result is a testament to the strength of our diversified business model and represents solid performance across multiple business lines.","Underlying our first quarter result, Aetna grew underlying medical membership by a net of approximately 50,000 members, representing organic growth of almost 160,000 members, offset by the divestiture of 106,000 Medicaid members in the Missouri Care transaction. We grew health care premiums by 8% over the prior year quarter, with growth across multiple lines of business, particularly Medicare. We reported a pretax operating margin of 9%, at the high end of our long-term targets. And finally, we continue to generate substantial free cash flow and aggressively deploy excess capital. In short, I am very pleased with our first quarter results.","Looking ahead to the remainder of 2013, we continue to expect strong top line growth and solid operating performance. Based on our first quarter results, today we are raising our full year 2013 operating EPS guidance to a range of $5.50 to $5.60 per share from our previous projection of at least $5.40 per share.","Following the closing of the Coventry transaction, our combined projection for 2013 will be higher than the standalone projection, consistent with our previous disclosures and reflecting projected Coventry results and synergies.","Before I turn the call over to Shawn to discuss our results and guidance in greater detail, I would like to discuss the execution of Aetna's growth strategy. At our Investor Conference in December, we outlined 6 critical tenets that support the overall Aetna growth story: Aetna's diversified portfolio of businesses can grow predictably; our large group commercial business can grow profitably; Aetna's government franchise is a growth engine; Small Group and Individual are modest contributors to our consolidated earnings and represent an opportunity for future growth; Accountable Care Solutions is gaining traction and enhancing our core business; and Coventry is a strategically and financially attractive acquisition, which can accelerate growth across multiple lines of business.","I will now highlight some of our recent successes that demonstrate the execution of our growth story. We exhibited strong membership growth in the quarter and have now grown medical membership in each of the last 4 consecutive quarters, a validation of the strength of our diversified book of business. We are maintaining our year-end medical membership guidance of 18.4 million, in spite of the divestiture of 106,000 members associated with our Missouri Care business. This represents underlying organic growth of 100,000 members for the remainder of the year and 250,000 members for all of 2013.","In our large group Commercial business, despite a challenging economy and labor market, underlying commercial ASC membership grew by nearly 100,000 members, offset by the conversion of TRS members to our Medicare Advantage product. After 2 consecutive years of membership losses in our Commercial ASC business, we are pleased with this result.","In our Government businesses, we had a very strong quarter of membership growth, driven by Medicare. Medicare Advantage membership grew by 180,000 members, well ahead of our initial guidance from December. This growth is a testament to the strength of our Medicare Advantage products, relationships and distribution and speaks to the value we offer our senior customers. Also with the addition of approximately 150,000 members in group products in the first quarter, Aetna is now the leading national group Medicare Advantage player by membership.","Our Medicare Supplement business also continues to perform well. During the quarter, we added 75,000 members, a sequential quarterly increase of over 30%. Since we acquired our Medicare Supplement platform from Genworth in October of 2011, membership has nearly doubled, another example of Aetna's focus on deploying capital effectively to grow the business and generate shareholder value.","Let me take a moment to comment on the final 2014 Medicare Advantage rates. Medicare Advantage is a highly successful program that serves 14 million Americans or almost 30% of the Medicare population. The program has demonstrated excellent growth over the last few years, as eligibles have come to appreciate the exceptional quality and value that Medicare Advantage plans can offer. As our membership has grown, we have been strategically positioning our business to be able to provide attractive products at parity with fee-for-service Medicare rates. The changes in the recent 2014 rate notice suggest we will get to parity faster than we had previously expected.","Following the 45-day notice, Aetna engaged with leadership in Congress and the administration, including HHS and CMS, to seek solutions that would address the near-term challenges facing this highly successful program. On April 1, when the final 2014 Medicare Advantage rates were released, we were encouraged by the commitment that CMS demonstrated to the program, addressing many of our concerns. However, Medicare Advantage will still be facing significant challenges in 2014 that will be difficult to solve through efficiencies alone.","Tactically, we continue to undertake a combination of initiatives to address this funding gap, including: reviewing our contractual arrangements with providers; evaluating the impact of enhanced care management and medical management, including pursuing or accelerating ACO initiatives and provider collaborations; examining our administrative costs; and changing benefit plan design and premiums.","As we re-examine the challenge in front of us, the acceleration of these changes versus our previous expectations may force us to impact beneficiaries more than we would like in 2014. Aetna remains committed to the Medicare Advantage program, and we will continue to work to improve the health of our members, preserve member benefits while lowering costs and earn an attractive return for our shareholders.","As I just mentioned, Aetna's accountable care and provider collaboration efforts will be a critical part of our strategy to bridge the gap in Medicare Advantage. Aetna's collaborative efforts can have a meaningful impact on quality and cost.","Our 750-member NovaHealth pilot, featured in the journal Health Affairs last fall, speaks directly to the success our collaborations have had for Medicare Advantage populations. As a result of implementing many of our accountable care and provider collaboration strategies, NovaHealth's total PMPM costs for its Aetna Medicare Advantage members were 16.5% to 33% lower across all medical cost categories than for other comparable Aetna Medicare Advantage members not cared for by NovaHealth. Aetna currently has over 73 Medicare collaborations across the country, and one of our goals is to serve approximately half of our individual Medicare Advantage members through an ACO or provider collaboration by the end of 2013.","Our ACS capabilities and partnerships will also enhance the growth of our core Commercial business. These capabilities were instrumental in a recent contract win, where we were selected by the Commonwealth of Virginia to offer a self-funded health benefits option to over 200,000 eligible employees, retirees and family members effective on July 1. In Virginia, we are working to build another statewide ACO network similar to what we have built in Maine, and this win demonstrates the power that the network of ACS relationships can provide.","To date, Aetna has signed 20 Accountable Care collaboration agreements with leading health systems, with an additional 36 letters of intent in place and a pipeline of over 200 opportunities. We remain confident in our ability to grow to 30 ACS partnerships in 2013, encompassing approximately 375,000 members and $1.5 billion in revenues.","More broadly, we continue to make progress as we execute upon our strategy to transform the network model. During the first quarter, we introduced Healthagen, a new business brand for our provider collaboration and consumer empowerment strategy, including our Medicity, ActiveHealth and iTriage businesses. Under the Healthagen banner, we will continue to be an innovator in health care technology solutions designed to improve care quality, control health care costs and increase access. By engaging consumers with new convenient tools and mobile technologies to manage their health, we can keep people healthy and improve outcomes.","These advanced technologies and solutions will help to drive our core domestic businesses and also enhance our international growth opportunities. For example, in China, we have signed a joint venture to bid on a project to set up the health information technology infrastructure for an area-wide health system in Tianjin. Also, in the Middle East, we are piloting new population health management models for potential use on a national scale. Both of these pilots rely upon the core intellectual property of Aetna, in combination with some of Healthagen's leading population health management tools and technologies.","Moving on to our Small Group and Individual businesses. We have started to file rates for exchanges and plan to participate in Individual exchanges in approximately 14 states, as well as in the SHOP exchanges in a small handful of states. While we may continue to offer products in certain geographies off-exchange, our strategy continues to be defined by a measured approach as we evaluate these new and changing marketplaces. We continue to believe that if exchanges are successful and we can reasonably earn our cost of capital, they will represent an upside opportunity for Aetna.","Before I conclude, I would like to provide a quick update on the proposed Coventry transaction. As we are now within our projected mid-2013 closing timeframe, we thought it would be instructive to update you on our progress towards closing.","We have all of the state regulatory approvals needed for the transaction. Therefore, the closing is now contingent upon final approval from the Department of Justice, where we continue to cooperate with the DOJ; our discussions are focused on a limited set of issues; we believe that the impact of the resolution of these issues has been contemplated in our original financial projections; and negotiations are day-to-day, and we hope to come to a resolution soon.","We continue to project that the transaction will be modestly accretive to 2013 operating earnings per share, with $0.45 of accretion in 2014 and $0.90 of accretion in 2015. Our integration planning teams have been extremely diligent. And shortly following the closing, we will be prepared to discuss combined guidance for 2013.","In summary, I am confident in our strategic direction and our ability to execute; our ability to manage through the legislative and regulatory changes associated with health care reform; our ability to close and successfully integrate the proposed Coventry acquisition; our ability to maintain our pricing discipline and grow membership over the course of 2013; and our 2013 operating EPS guidance range of $5.50 to $5.60.","I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide insight into our first quarter results and our 2013 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, Aetna reported first quarter 2013 operating earnings of $495 million and operating earnings per share of $1.50, a 12% increase over the first quarter of 2012. These strong operating results are supported by solid revenue growth, sound operating fundamentals and high quality of earnings metrics. I'll begin with some comments on overall performance.","From a top line perspective, we are growing. During the first quarter, we grew underlying membership by 159,000 members prior to the sale of our Missouri Medicaid business. On a year-over-year basis, we have grown by 486,000 members, again, before the Missouri Medicaid sale. This sustained membership growth has led to an acceleration in our operating revenue growth, which is increasing by over 7% from the first quarter of 2012.","From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our first quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.9%. Our operating revenue growth and disciplined focus on costs have driven an 80-basis-point year-over-year improvement in our operating expense ratio. And our pretax operating margin was 9% for the quarter, at the high end of our target operating margin range.","From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. After adjusting for the Missouri Care divestiture, reserve growth kept pace with premium growth, and our days claims payable were 45 days at the end of the quarter, stable sequentially but up over a full day from the prior year quarter. Additionally, we experienced favorable prior year's reserve development of $325 million in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to $169 million in the first quarter of 2012. This strong favorable development was experience across all of our core business lines and is primarily related to fourth quarter 2012 dates of service. The basis for the favorable development figures I just mentioned is consistent with the roll-forward included in our SEC reporting. Prior year's development is the basis upon which we intend to quantify reserve development going forward. We believe this treatment provides improved consistency and comparability with our larger peers and is better aligned with our practice of providing annual guidance. To this end, Aetna now will regularly produce an updated roll-forward of prior year health care cost payable for investors each quarter, the first of which is included in this quarter's financial supplement.","Turning to cash flow and capital. Our operating cash flow generation in the first quarter was excellent, as Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow was approximately 1.3x operating earnings. And we continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing approximately 4 million shares in the quarter. In short, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which we believe are a testimony to the successful execution of Aetna's growth story.","I will now discuss the key drivers of our first quarter performance in greater detail. Our efforts to improve the positioning of our Commercial ASC business are beginning to show results. We grew membership by nearly 100,000 members in the quarter before adjusting for the TRS Medicare Advantage conversion. Underlying growth was driven by our network access products and continued improvement in our National Accounts business. While overall net growth was modest, we are pleased with the direction of these results after experiencing significant membership losses in the first quarter of each of the last 2 years.","One of Aetna's important growth levers is our ability to grow our Commercial Insured business. In the first quarter, we were able to increase our Commercial Insured revenue and underwriting margin despite a decrease of 93,000 members. Our previous guidance assumed a 50,000-member decrease. Majority of the membership losses above our guidance come from our Small Group and Individual businesses and speaks to our commitment to fair and financially responsible pricing, where we favor margin over membership and price to underlying medical cost trends.","Our commercial medical benefit ratio was 78.9% for the quarter, a very good result and a 100-basis-point improvement over the first quarter of 2012, including the impact of favorable reserve development. As a result of this favorable development, our 2012 commercial medical cost trend estimate improved by approximately 50 basis points and now stands at approximately 6%.","Another important growth lever is our government franchise. As Mark highlighted in his remarks, we had strong membership growth in our Medicare businesses in the first quarter. Total membership grew 255,000 members sequentially, comprised of 180,000 Medicare Advantage members and 75,000 Medicare Supplement members, leading to a 28% increase in Medicare premiums. Our Medicare medical benefit ratio was 87.8% in the quarter, which is an increase of 340 basis points year-over-year and consistent with our full year guidance. As first outlined at our Investor Conference in December, a 300- to 400-basis-point year-over-year increase in the Medicare MBR was projected, driven primarily by Aetna's Group Medicare Advantage business, where we have credited favorable 2012 experience back to customers through the renewal rating process.","Finally, in our Medicaid business, membership declined by 112,000 members in the quarter, reflecting the sale of 106,000 Missouri Care members on March 31. Premiums increased by approximately 30% on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to our in-state expansions and growth in serving high-acuity populations. Our Medicaid medical benefit ratio was 89.3% in the quarter, in line with our full year guidance of high-80s and an improvement from last year's first quarter.","Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At March 31, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 38%, consistent with our guidance. Prior to the closing of the Coventry acquisition, we continue to target a risk-based capital ratio of approximately 300% of company action level in our regulated subsidiaries.","Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with $2.4 billion. Of this amount, $100 million represents core liquidity, but the remainder held to fund the Coventry acquisition. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $230 million. We issued $100 million of commercial paper, and we repurchased 4 million shares for $184 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $66 million. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and investments at the parent. Of this amount, $100 million represents core liquidity, with the remainder held to fund the Coventry acquisition. Our basic share count was 325.9 million at March 31.","As a result of our first quarter performance, we are increasing our 2013 operating earnings guidance to a range of $5.50 to $5.60 per share. At the midpoint, this $0.15 increase from our previous guidance of at least $5.40 per share is driven by a $0.25 increase to our previous outlook due to favorable operating performance in the first quarter of 2013, including the effect of the favorable prior year's reserve development. This increase is partially offset by the projected impact of sequestration on our Medicare business for the rest of 2013, which was not reflected in our previous guidance.","Additional elements of our updated 2013 guidance include the following. We are projecting full year medical membership of 18.4 million members, an increase of 100,000 members over the remainder of the year, led by growth in our Commercial ASC and Medicare Supplement businesses. After adjusting for the sale of our Missouri Medicaid business, this would represent organic growth of over 250,000 members during 2013.","We now project that our operating revenue will grow by 8% to 9% in 2013, reflecting the impact of our first quarter membership results, the completed Missouri Care divestiture and sequestration.","Including the impact of favorable prior year's development, we now project our commercial medical benefit ratio will come in at the low end of our previous guidance range of 81.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. At this early date, we remain comfortable with our full year 2013 commercial medical cost trend guidance of 6.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points.","Our Medicare medical benefit ratio is projected to increase from the mid-80s in 2012 to the mid- to high-80s in 2013, consistent with previous guidance. Reductions to Medicare premiums related to sequestration will create upward pressure on this measure within our guidance range.","For 2013, our operating expense ratio projection remains consistent with previous guidance at 18% to 18.5%, an improvement over the 18.9% reported in 2012.","We now project operating earnings in 2013 of approximately $1.8 billion and a pretax operating margin of 8% to 8.5%. Based on these earnings, we now project net dividends from subsidiaries of approximately $1.3 billion, an increase of $200 million from prior guidance, resulting in deployable capital of approximately $700 million. Aetna's share count projections for 2013 remain unchanged at this time, as incremental repurchase dollars are offset by a higher assumed share repurchase price.","We believe that these results demonstrate our ability to execute on the growth strategy we shared with you in December. Our core business is growing, it's executing well, and we are well-positioned for the Coventry integration. Our emerging businesses continue to work to transform the health care delivery model, improve our cost structure and drive additional membership growth. Our capital generation remains strong, and we expect it to only be stronger going forward once we close the Coventry acquisition. Finally, we remain confident in our ability to generate low double-digit operating earnings per share growth on average over time.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas F. Cowhey","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll go first to Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first question just on the pricing environment and how your account base is reacting to the surcharges that you're starting to put through for health reform on the insured side that, that would include the industry fee. Is that starting to become a meaningful component as you head into July 1 renewals?","Mark T. Bertolini","Matt, this is Mark. I think we are early in the cycle of putting these fees and insurance premium charges into our rates. So we only have a couple of months worth of 2014 into the rates now. So it's fairly low noise, but I think the market is waking up to all the taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act, and we're getting a lot of questions. And that leads to the strategy as we think about how we renew people into 2014 and do we give them more time to adjust into the marketplace relative to impacts like benefit plan changes that they'll be required to make, impacts like guaranteed issue and the tighter rating requirements. So the market is waking up. People are asking a lot of questions. Too early to see the ultimate reaction, given that we only have a couple of months priced in.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just on the Medicare side, I guess sort of a 2-parter. One, the TRS conversion, did that spur any additional interest? I'd be curious to see what your group pipeline looks like. And then assuming you guys -- it doesn't sound like you're going to close Coventry today, do you think you'll have enough time to work together before that first Monday of June to sort of work on a combined MA strategy in terms of bidding for 2014?","Mark T. Bertolini","Thanks, Josh. On the first point, the TRS conversion and the group pipeline is strong. And we -- it's way too early to tell, obviously, the results on TRS, although we watch it on a daily basis as the activity moves forward, but that is part of the impact on our MBR for the first quarter of 2013. As it relates to how we think about Medicare going forward, let me have Shawn talk a little bit about -- respond to the second part of your question.","Shawn M. Guertin","Yes. So Josh, I think the one thing I'd say at the outset is our proposed acquisition of Coventry never contemplated that we had to see those bids before they went in. As you know, they have a pretty profitable product line there themselves. Having said that, in the event that we do have the opportunity, sort of post-close, to get in there and see what the bids look like and influence them if need be, we will be ready to do that. And we have teams of people and a process all set up to do that if indeed we have that opportunity.","Mark T. Bertolini","And Josh, we did have a clean-room setup, where we've had analysis already done in a format that we can react too quickly, so those teams will be able to react to that information the day we close, if it happens before we have to submit the rates.","Operator","We'll go next to Carl McDonald with Citi.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","To stick with Medicare, I'd just be interested in putting together your comments around the rate environment for '14, how you think that translates into membership next year, as well as the Medicare margin.","Mark T. Bertolini","I'll comment on the membership piece. I'll have Shawn comment on sort of the rate structure as we see it moving forward. For us, the first approach to impacting this coming pricing cycle is to, first, look at what we can do with provider contracting. We are getting more aggressive there; secondly, to look at what we can do at medical management and other programs to impact on the quality of care, like through our ACL models. And so the ACL is really an important part of our strategy, where we'll have half of our membership by the end of 2013 on the individual side into an ACO or collaboration model. The third part is to really streamline our administration, and we've been getting better and better at that. As we interface with an aging consumer that's more used to working with us over the Internet. And then finally, we have to indeed look at benefits and pricing, which will have some impact in 2014. Let me ask -- so from a growth perspective, everybody's impacted the same way, Carl, and so our approach would be is that we're in the same boat with our competitors. At least, we'll see people being sticky, given the quality of the products we offer, but it's too early to tell how the rest of the market shakes out, given that rates aren't in yet.","Shawn M. Guertin","Right. So Carl, I think -- as you know, I think others have commented on the rate impact being down, call it, 400 basis points. And that's pretty similar to, I think, what we would estimate it to be. And obviously, you're trying to bridge a gap of cost trend in the low single digits. So Mark mentioned all the levers that we would pull. And we would certainly want to pull all the cost structure levels first that we could to preserve the value in the product in the form of premium or benefits. The -- we are working through that now. I do not think a one-size-fits-all strategy is the right answer in every market. And that's really what we need to work through over the coming months. So that's how we're thinking about it. I would just say that if the notion, obviously, of this, as Mark mentioned, going to 100% fee-for-service environment, it certainly is a picture that we've had in our heads on how we have to operate in this product going forward. This might be a bit of an acceleration of it in terms of timing, but we are still sort of everyday thinking about making the product operate in that environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake, JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So question on the commercial side. You mentioned you lost some Individual and Small Group business, that came in with the pricing. So can you talk about whether you're seeing aggressive pricing out there that's costing you Individual and Small Group membership? And then can you air on your latest thoughts on exchange participation, what you're thinking in terms of economics there for next year and what you're hearing from employers on dumping or conversions to ASO in 2014?","Shawn M. Guertin","Justin, I'll let Mark answer the exchange question. On the Individual and Small Group, it is not a function of irrational pricing in any way, shape or form. We've talked before about the importance of having solid operating margins going into 2014. And so we have continued to air on the side of caution in our pricing on that product. And as I mentioned, we'll favor sort of margin over membership on this.","Mark T. Bertolini","Yes, Justin, the market remains rational, from our perspective, with, again, the occasional pockets of behavior that may be based on cost structure or just on trying to seek some membership. As it relates to the exchanges, we have 14 -- approximately 14 Individual exchanges, a handful of SHOP exchanges across the country. We are entering these exchanges very carefully. We are about 2\/3 of the way contracted for our exchanges. Those tend to be narrow networks that are generally 25% to 50% of the size of our base networks in those marketplaces. Currently, the rates we're getting for most of those networks is between Medicare and Commercial. And based on the narrower networks, the closer we get to Medicare. The rates will really be based on geography and probably, more importantly, will be based on how much we get the network contracted. So our approach in the initial pricing that we've submitted to the exchanges has been focused on where we have rates on a document inked. We'd include those into our cost structure, where we do not and we need to add providers for network sufficiency. We're pricing those at commercial pricing until we otherwise know that we have a better rate. And as you know, the negotiations will take place through the summer and into the fall. Obviously, at the end of all of this, we have an opportunity to pull out in September, and we continue to hold that as an option should the exchanges not develop favorably or they ask for unreasonable rates by the time we need to close on participation.","Operator","We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You talked about part of your rising medical loss ratio for the Medicare product is due to increased sharing with the -- your Group customers. You guys have a slightly different Medicare product than others and that you have much more Group business. Can you talk about how the rates will affect you going forward with your sharing with Group customers?","Shawn M. Guertin","Yes, Peter. So obviously, the input to that renewal process on the rates is the same as we discussed for Individual. But unlike the Individual side, obviously, we have the ability to negotiate with the employer over both -- frankly, both benefit design and premium. So it's one more lever that we have in that business that maybe we don't have on the Individual side. Having said that, it's still in negotiation. Raising premiums on an employer plan is still an issue that you have to work through. But I think it does give us one more angle to try to bridge the gap on that particular business.","Operator","We'll go next to Ana Gupte with Dowling & Partners.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","I wanted to get some color on the seasonal progression of the Commercial and the Medicare loss ratios and what the implications are for full year guidance for '13. Specifically, on Commercial, what is the underlying trend deal spread? You talked about the favorable development being a primarily contributor, but then you have lowered your cost trend guidance. Pricing should accelerate and seasonality, though is just a downside. So net-net, do you think there's upside to your 81.5%, the lower end revised guidance on Commercial?","Shawn M. Guertin","Let me try to cover all of that with an answer. Let me talk about our commercial business in particular in the first quarter. That business performed very well, as you saw by the MBR, and it was really very consistent with our internal expectations. Now I make that statement recognizing that we probably had $20 million to $25 million of flu expense pushing through there. So underlying that, the experience was a little bit better than we expected in the first quarter on the Commercial business. Given how early we are in the year and the fact that the quarter is still somewhat incomplete, I think it's premature to bank that for the rest of the year, but we did indeed see that in the first quarter. The one comment that I would make on just thinking about -- continuing to think about Commercial primarily, and sort of pattern of earnings is the question that was asked previously on the recovery of the ACA fees. As Mark mentioned, that's being phased in sort of in proportion to the number of months that a customer has in 2014. So the effect of that will build during this year. And in fact, about half of the effect of that is in the fourth quarter of this year. Other than that, I won't have any particular comments on the slope during the year on the Commercial business.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Sequestration and then the timing of the risk adjusters and any mix shift you've seen from -- to Group and HMO and so on? Is the mid- to high-80s still -- is that your full year guidance? Is there any upside to that as we progress through the year?","Shawn M. Guertin","It was hard to hear you, Ana. You were breaking up, but yes, mid- to high-80s...","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Yes, is there any upside to your Medicare full year progression, if you will, from the timing of any risk adjusters, how you built in the impact of sequestration and then the mix shift that you're seeing to Group and on the retail side to HMO?","Shawn M. Guertin","No, I think our Medicare, we -- our Medicare business with sequestration out there, I think we've quantified that accurately. So I do still expect that we will be in the mid- to high-80s, but I wouldn't -- I certainly wouldn't say that there's a strong bias either way in that estimate. If anything, again, sequestration is pushing up in that range, not down.","Operator","We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Mark, you mentioned that you're going to give accounts more time to adjust to the 2014 issues, guaranteed issue, rating bands [ph], all that kind of stuff in new benefits. Could you clarify what you meant on that? Was that kind of early renewals, and can you do with Individual and Small Group? And then how much do the ACA lower medical cost in Medicare Advantage?","Mark T. Bertolini","Okay. On the first one, I would say, Christine, that we expect that accounts will look at renewing early and into 2014, so they don't need to come up to full speed on that, although in Small Group, for all intents and purposes, they're in a bit of a community-rated environment, so there probably won't be a whole lot of impact there. But we are going to offer that opportunity as part of our renewal strategy with accounts. So that's how we think about that. Related to your second question, could you give me a little more color on that?","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","With respect to Medicare Advantage, you said that you were -- a big part of this is moving folks into these Accountable Care organizations. How much is in now, so how much are we going to move between now and the end of 2013 into this arrangement? And how much does reduce to Medicare Advantage medical costs? I'm trying to bridge this portion [ph].","Shawn M. Guertin","Yes, it varies arrangement by arrangement. I think for '13, Christine, as we said, we intend to have about half of our Individual membership in arrangements like that. It's a meaningful impact within those arrangements, but it obviously varies arrangement by arrangement.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can you give us ballpark, 20%, 30%?","Shawn M. Guertin","I don't want to speculate. Again, it varies Individual, arrangement by arrangement.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just interested if you can talk about what type of appetite level you're seeing from employers for self-funding in Commercial for 2014. There's been some market anecdotes recently that the interest may be accelerating due to the ACA premium taxes on fully insured business. So just interested in what you're hearing at this point.","Mark T. Bertolini","I think there's a lot of interest as people try and figure out how to react to the Affordable Care Act, and more interest as you get closer to seeing the economic impacts of the Affordable Care Act, particularly in the taxes and fees. However, people can buy time, again, by renewing early and into 2014 for the full effects. And the 2.5% that they'd see on the premium tax can be adjusted in other ways going into 2014, which gives them more time to consider how to move forward. We're also seeing in the large employer segment a lot of interest in private changes, where we are now participating in 11. We will also be participating in the Aon Hewitt, the Mercer, the Xerox and the Towers private exchanges, which will actually take large employers from self-funded to fully insured. So we see more of that activity as well. So I think a lot to watch happen. I think 2014, from a standpoint of an event for employers, is going to be wait-and-see for the most part. In the Small Group market, we don't see a whole lot of traction in exchanges until we move into 2016, which, by then, we think there could be as many as 5 million lives that will leave the Small Group market through some sort of form of employers saying, \"I'd rather work with exchanges.\" But that's going to depend on how well these things operate in the first couple of years, which we have yet to, obviously, experience.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just want to talk about some of the comments that you've made on the exchanges. I think you mentioned 14 states to participate in, and I think you had mentioned 15 states last quarter. So I just wanted to see what state that was that you decided not to participate in. And then just to kind of go into the commentary that you want to participate in more Individual exchanges than Small Group exchanges. How did -- that's a little bit counterintuitive to me just because Individual market is going to be changed so much by the changes that are happening in 2014, whereas the Small Group exchanges feel more like just one more distribution network for your Small Group exchange. Why are you being more cautious on the Small Group side than on the Individual side?","Mark T. Bertolini","We just think that we've got to see how these things operate. And we're not going to go in for land grab as we've heard some of our competitors have thought as an opportunity. I also believe that in the Individual market, that this is going to be a slow uptake. The process required to sign up to get the subsidies is going to take some time. And I think this is a 2-year ramp to get the individual exchanges up to a level where customers are going to feel appropriate signing up. And so our estimates of what we believe in enrollment are dropping for the first year, given the opportunity to enroll -- reenroll early, enroll into next year, and the fact that we don't have all the mechanics worked out about how these things enroll. And I think people are going to take a wait-and-see attitude. I think the people that will join will largely be low-income subsidy people, who have an opportunity to get health care at a very affordable rate that they otherwise would not have gotten. And I think that's where, actually, a lot of the marketing is going to be focused initially on this product. So our opinion is stand firm, participate where we know we have reasonable rules. We did say it was up to 15. We're now quantifying that to be 14 or approximately 14, but yet there is a lot of road to go yet before we get final rules on how these things are going to work.","Shawn M. Guertin","Yes, Kevin. And I would just add that, precisely for the reason you mentioned, that it's really not that different, is why we don't think there will be a lot of immediate uptake on the Small Group side.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So you don't see the Small Group as being a real opportunity, so there's no reason to go after it aggressively. But I guess it still doesn't -- it's still not clear to me why you're getting in -- I guess that you're saying the 14 markets that you're getting into are just kind of still in a measured small way, isn't that most of your kind of strong individual markets, 14?","Mark T. Bertolini","We're focused on those markets where we have strengthened networks and affordable price, sure. And so that's a lot where our membership exists today, so it's a good place to start and learn more. There's always an opportunity to participate in future markets. Also, remember on the Small Group market, a couple of things. First, because they're already pretty much community-rated in a lot of ways, with Group pooling and everything else and they're guaranteed issue, there isn't a whole lot of impact to rates unless an employer has a lot of low-income subsidy employees. And I think that's where we see that 5 million coming out of over the next couple of years. Also, the second point I would make is that private exchanges will emerge and are emerging that will provide very affordable alternatives to Small Group employers without having to go into the public exchanges.","Operator","We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just want to go back to the MA and your commentary on reviewing your contractual arrangements with providers. Just some more color there. Is that specific to MA rates? Maybe help us understand how you price that relative to kind of fee-for-service and\/or is the point that you'll potentially squeeze on the Commercial side because of the MA pressure.","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, I can give you some color. Overall, we're just a little bit above Medicare rates when we look at our whole network, but we're under on the physician side, and we're over on the hospital side, particularly in outpatient. So that's where we view the opportunity, particularly as we start looking at exchanges and we start re-contracting these networks. It gives us an opportunity to open up those discussions with hospitals. Also, the ACOs that we're building give us fundamentally different rate structures than the current rate structures we have in Medicare and an opportunity to move people into those. So high on the hospital side, low on the physician side and average, just a little bit above, fairly above the Medicare average rate structure across markets. So we view the opportunity in pockets, by markets, focused on the hospital, particularly the outpatient side. And we're largely having those conversations around as we do other contract renewals and as we look at ACOs.","Operator","We'll go next to David Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was going to change gears a little bit here. Just hoping for an update on your duals activity, I believe, in Illinois, and Ohio. Where do you stand on kind of getting visibility on rates and your thoughts on updates on timing? And then, finally, I think we saw that you -- that Aetna did not bid in the Florida Medicaid. And I was just curious if you had thoughts or reasons why you didn't go after the Florida Medicaid?","Shawn M. Guertin","David, let me take on the duals. That has been pushed back in the year, and it is one of the reasons why we've talked about our revenue guidance going from approximately 9% to 8% to 9%. So that's generally pushed to the very end of the third quarter, the fourth quarter in those instances. So it's going to have a very minimal effect on 2013.","Mark T. Bertolini","And then on Florida Medicaid, we just believe that, that market was something that we could not adequately compete in nor can we get to a rate structure that will be satisfying for them, so we decided not to bid. And I think our record has been that we only bid where we believe we can have an impact on the marketplace and where we can win. And we didn't think we could win there.","Thomas F. Cowhey","David, it's Tom. One other thing that just is worth noting is that some people oftentimes don't see some of the work that we're doing because it's done with our ASC partners. And so we do have a partner in Florida. It's integral. And so we -- there is some expansion activity that has happened there under that banner. But under the Aetna or Aetna Whole Health banner, we have not just participate in that market.","Operator","We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two quick things. First of all, one more aspect to the exchanges. You mentioned that it will be your objective to get -- to be able to generate acceptable returns. I'm wondering, in a new product area like this on the exchanges, is that something you're trying to get to pretty much right out of the box? Or will you give yourself some time for that? Just a perspective along those lines. And my other question was regarding your reiteration of your overall cost trend at 6.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. There's been a lot of commentary on the provider side about soft utilization. Could you comment within the buckets of that cost trend, whether you're seeing any variation relative to your expectation and maybe just comment on some of the components and what you're seeing there?","Shawn M. Guertin","Let me take the first one, A.J., on that, on the exchange strategy. Again, as we mentioned, we don't view this as a landgrab strategy. So I would certainly think that we would want to position our pricing in year 1 to earn a fair return on capital. That's not certainly any kind of excessive return. I think we've talked about this fundamentally being a low single-digit margin business for the long haul. But again, as Mark described, our approach is being measured and not doing it as a landgrab, I think we would look for a fair return on our initial pricing.","Mark T. Bertolini","And then as it relates to provider utilization, about 70% of our trend is related to unit pricing, and 30% is related to utilization. And so in our view, we believe it's prudent at this point in time to hold. We haven't seen any of the categories, inpatient, outpatient, physicians or pharmacy, move to our expectations. We did see some better performance in the first quarter, offset by the flu, which is hard to discriminate exactly which is which. And it is our best guess, at this time, given where the economy is headed and the potentials for behavior in the marketplace to change, that it's prudent for us to hold that trend at this point in time.","Operator","Our final question comes from Sarah James, Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I wanted to take a step back and ask for your big picture view on '14. Could it be a year of earnings growth on existing Aetna business, meaning x-Coventry? And then with respect to 2 major buckets, first, Commercial, you mentioned a slower exchange uptake but maybe some ASO to risk conversion on the private exchanges. So does that net out to a headwind or a tailwind on Commercial? And second bucket would be Medicare, if you could just size up the risk coding update, particularly given your exposure to collaborative care, given that's a model that some of your peers noted maybe more heavily impacted by these coding changes.","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, Sarah, generally, first, I will comment on the fact that we're not giving any guidance on 2014 earnings growth at this point in time other than to say that we see additional opportunity with the Coventry acquisition. So absent the Coventry acquisition, we are not in a position to give any kind of guidance for 2014 on earnings at this point in time. We would reiterate, though, with 2014, as part of our 5-year outlook, that we believe low double-digit earnings growth year-over-year, EPS growth year-over-year is our commitment to the Street. As it relates to some headwinds and tailwinds, maybe I can have Shawn comment on those.","Shawn M. Guertin","Yes, so I think as we sit here a quarter later, what I would say is we know more, but there's still an awful lot that we sort of need to see how it plays out. We've talked a lot about exchanges today. You talked about the Medicare bids. We're working through that now as we speak. And we also talked about the recovery at the ACA taxes and fees. We're early on in that process, where, really, we don't have a lot of data points yet in terms of recovering those from the Government business. So those are 3 big things we're looking at. I would say, again, though, that we do have a diversified portfolio of businesses. We're not overexposed to those areas that will feel the greatest impact from ACA. And that's true on an Aetna standalone basis, and that will be true even after we combine with Coventry. So I think we've talked a lot about the exchange strategy being sort of measured and looking to earn a fair return on capital. So this has more to do about looking at and getting some more information on these big data points. Probably the most immediate one is finishing our Medicare bids over the next 30 days or so.","Thomas F. Cowhey","Thank you, sir.

Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today.","This morning, Aetna reported record first quarter operating earnings of $2.39 a share, a 21% increase from last year's very strong first quarter. Our first quarter performance speaks to Aetna's focus on operating fundamentals and the continued execution of our growth strategy.","Specifically, we grew medical membership to 23.7 million members, an increase of over 120,000 members during the quarter. We now project that 2015 will be Aetna's third consecutive year of membership growth.","The combination of this membership growth and strong yields from disciplined pricing actions drove solid topline growth as quarterly operating revenue reached $15.1 billion. Medical cost trends remain moderate and we experienced a healthy level of reserve development in the quarter and we now project that pretax operating margins will expand in 2015, despite an increasing mix of lower margin government sponsored business.","With this strong start to 2015, today we're increasing our operating EPS projection to $7.20 to $7.40 per share from our previous projection of at least $7. At the top end of the range Aetna would achieve its low double-digit operating EPS growth call in 2015.","With this backdrop, let me discuss some of our businesses in greater detail. Beginning with our group commercial business, operating results in the quarter were solid as the impact of pricing actions in our 51 to 300 employee block of business took hold and improved underwriting margin.","Aetna has consistently favored margin over membership in our group commercial business and our first results are proof of that commitment to our shareholders.","Moving on to our Government business, 2015 will represent another year of topline growth in our Medicare business driven by increased membership. Aetna's Medicare Advantage business added 88,000 members in the quarter, a 12% sequential growth in individual Medicare Advantage membership.","We continue to believe that our success in this business is representative of the quality and value we provide to our members as demonstrated by our high-performing four plus star rated plans where 85% of our members reside.","Medicare Advantage is an important business for Aetna and we continue to be encouraged by the support that the administration has shown for this program. It now serves nearly one and three Medicare eligibles.","For the first time in several years federal funding for this program will increase in 2016, which we expect will help us to further improve the value we offer to seniors as well as our returns to shareholders.","Going forward the stability and predictability of payment rights as well as risk adjustment and star ratings will be critical in ensuring health plans can continue to provide comprehensive, affordable benefits to the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who choose Medicare Advantage plans.","Continuing with the Government business, Medicaid is a key component of Aetna's long-term growth strategy and our Medicaid franchise delivered another solid quarter. We continue to be pleased with our ability to win and implement high acuity contacts, expanding our footprint and bolstering our reputation for excellence in the marketplace.","This quarter we began serving new members as part of our recent launches in Louisiana and New Jersey and we added over 30,000 members across multiple state programs related to ACA expansion.","For 2015 we project that Aetna's Medicaid business would grow revenues by over $1 billion, representing over 15% annual growth while exceeding our target pretax operating margin.","Shifting to our individual commercial business, we had another highly successful open enrollment period in our public exchange business, growing membership to over 950,000 members and exceeding our initial projections.","The demographic profile of Aetna's public exchange membership remains generally consistent with last year. While the average age of our membership has declined modestly, the vast majority remains in silver and bronze plans and nearly 90% of our members receive a subsidy from the federal government, consistent with national averages.","In addition to our public exchange success, we continue to extend our plans with trying to position our individual off-exchange membership to ACA compliant plan. As a result, we ended the quarter with nearly 1.3 million total individual members and we now project that the individual business will represent approximately 6% of our 2015 revenues.","We remain cautiously optimistic on the potential for the public exchanges to develop into an attractive growth opportunity where we can continue to offer value to customers and generate a reasonable return for our shareholders.","Finally as we consider our long-term objectives, we continue to focus on several key strategic initiatives. We continue to advance Healthagen as it seeks transform the network model from episodic acute care management to population health management.","Value based contracting now represents approximately 30% of Aetna's medical spend with a goal to achieve 75% by the end of the decade.","Our consumer platform continues to develop as we integrate the bSwift acquisition and advance our plans to launch a new suite of individual products in four pilot markets in 2016 and international continue to grow exceeding its operating targets this quarter, while continuing to evaluate opportunities to accelerate growth in emerging markets.","I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering this record-breaking quarter for Aetna. Our people are one of our greatest assets and one that we continue to invest in as evidenced by our recent minimum wage commitments.","Building on the strengths of this team, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in a changing healthcare marketplace. We can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy. We will continue to be disciplined across all our lines of business and we can achieve our 2015 operating EPS projection of $7.20 to $7.40 per share.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn who will provide additional insights into our first quarter results and our updated 2015 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn Guertin","Thank you, Mark and good morning, everyone.","Earlier today, we reported record first quarter 2015 operating earnings of $844 million and operating earnings per share of $2.39. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flow and operating margins.","I\u2019ll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our topline performance for the quarter was very good. We grew medical membership to a record 23.7 million members adding over a 120,000 new members during the quarter with growth in our Government and Commercial businesses.","We grew operating revenue by 8% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of $15.1 billion driven by growth in medical membership as well as higher premium yields.","From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin exceeded 10% a very strong result and above our target operating margin range.","Our first quarter total medical benefit ratio was 79.1% a strong result that benefited from continued moderate trends in favorable prior year\u2019s reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18.4%, a 60 basis point increase over the first quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and the inclusion of our 2014 acquisitions in first quarter results.","From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior year's reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to fourth quarter 2014 dates of service.","Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth and days claims payable were 53.5 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of approximately four days. The increase in days claims payable was primarily a result of business mix, but was also due to payment timing changes associated with pharmacy spend, the later accounting for approximately 1.5 days of the increase.","Turning to cash flow and capital, operating cash flows in the first quarter were strong. Healthcare and Group Insurance operating cash flows were over 1.8 times operating earnings driven by membership growth and strong operating results.","We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing over two million shares in the quarter for $196 million and distributing another $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend.","In short, we're very pleased with our first quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. I'll now discuss the key drivers of our first quarter performance in greater detail.","Beginning with our Commercial business, out total commercial membership grew by 37,000 members during the quarter exceeding our previous projections. Public exchange membership was the primary driver of this growth, which was partially offset by declines in our middle market businesses, a direct result of the previously disclosed pricing actions to improve performance in this block.","As we examine our result in commercial membership base, we continued to be pleased with the early indicators on membership attraction and selection as well as overall performance. Our commercial medical benefit ratio was 77.4% for the quarter, an excellent result that benefited from higher premiums, moderate cost trends and strong prior year\u2019s reserve development.","With respect to our ACA compliant blocks of business, we continue to take a prudent stance on our accruing for the 3Rs. Specifically, we accrued $47 million of additional reinsurance recoverable during the quarter, the vast majority of which relates to 2014 dates of service.","Aetna\u2019s reinsurance recoverable related to 2014 now totals approximately $370 million. For the remainder of 2015 we project that we will record additional recoverable in excess of $400 million related to this program.","We also recorded additional risk adjustor payables of $198 million during the quarter roughly a quarter of which relate to 2014 dates of service bringing our total payable to 2014 to $276 million.","Based on our current projections, Aetna expects to record incremental net payables in excess of $300 million over the remainder of 2015 related to the risk adjuster program bringing our total payable related to 2015 to over $450 million.","We expect to be able to update our projections for this program with our second quarter 2015 reporting, based on information CMS is expected to provide in late June on actual 2014 risk adjustor amounts. Finally, consistent with our year-end reporting, we've not recorded any receivables for the risk corridor program.","Moving on from the 3Rs, medical cost trends continue to be moderate and based on first quarter results including our previously disclosed preferred drug pricing contract for hepatitis C treatments, we now project that Aetna\u2019s 2015 core commercial medical cost trends will be in the lower half of our previously projected range of 6% to 7%.","Another important growth lever is our government franchise. Our Government business grew by 85,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 88,000 members. Medicare supplement grew by over 26,000 members and Medicaid membership declined by 29,000 members.","However, underlying Medicaid membership grew by 108,000 members, which was more than offset by our previously disclosed decision to exit our Delaware contract that accounted for a 137, 000 members.","Our first quarter 2015 government premiums reached a record of $5.7 billion and our government medical benefit ratio was 81.3% in the quarter. Drivers of this excellent result include stronger than projected membership, revenue and yields, actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap and strong favorable prior year\u2019s reserve development.","Moving on to the balance sheet; our financial position, capital structure, and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At March 31, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of 35%, completing our target deleveraging after the Coventry acquisition earlier than our initial commitment.","Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $862 million.","We reduced outstanding debt by $432 million. We repurchased over two million shares for $196 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 349 million at March 31.","As a result of our first quarter performance we're increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.20 to $7.40 per share. At the top end of the range our guidance has increased by $0.40 per share reflecting favorable operating performance including the effect of favorable prior year\u2019s reserve development.","However certain risks and challenges remain that tamper our outlook at this early stage in the year including the ever present concern that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected, current low visibility associated with our higher than projected public exchange membership and the uncertainty related to accruals associated with the 3Rs and the potential for the mid-year rate reset in our Kentucky Medicaid contract to pressure performance by more than previously projected.","Our updated 2015 guidance is also influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our first quarter membership results we now project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23.7 million members as growth in government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in commercial insured membership including in our individual business.","As we consider our year-to-date mix of commercial membership and the probability of continued delays in implementation and ramp of our existing duals contract, we now project full year 2015 operating revenue will be in the range of $61 billion to $62 billion.","Based on our strong first quarter results including the positive impact of prior year reserve development, we now project our full year total medical benefit ratio to be in the range of 82% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Primarily as a result of our updated revenue projections, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be in excess of 18% for the full year. We now project pretax operating margin to be at least 7.6% consistent with our high single digit target with operating earnings at, at least $2.5 billion.","Finally, we continue to project excess cash flow to the parent of $800 million to $1 billion and our share count projection remains unchanged. Looking back to the beginning of 2014, we had outlined four focus areas for our company that would be key to our success.","Delivering on our Government growth strategy, integrating Coventry in achieving or exceeding our synergy targets, collecting or solving for the ACA mandated fees and taxes and executing on our exchange strategies both public and private.","As we look back on our performance in 2014 and through the first quarter of 2015 we can say with confidence that we achieved and often exceeded our goals across these four areas.","As we look to the remainder of 2015, many of these focus areas remain unchanged. We are encouraged by the strength of our first quarter results and our improved 2015 outlook particularly at this early stage in the year. Further, we continue to believe we are well positioned to attain our 2018 goals of at least $80 billion in operating revenue and $10 in operating EPS.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Tom Cowhey","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question, so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions.","Operator the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","A.J. Rice","Thanks. Hi everybody. On the medical cost trend and the fact that you're moving toward the lower half of that target now in your guidance, sounds like that's mostly because of specialty Pharma particularly the FC renegotiated contract, if you potentially give us some flavor for which you\u2019re seeing the other pockets and inputs for your cost trend?","Mark Bertolini","Yes A.J. I would say that there is really two things, obviously the preferred drug pricing contract is part of that movement. And as you know we anticipated that we would see a trend increase this year, utilization increase. We really did not see that, trend was very moderate in the first quarter.","So those are really the two items when we think about 2015 trend that are bringing that down.","Under the covers looking at it by category, there really hasn\u2019t been anything I would say that is fundamentally changed in the story. Outpatient, emergency department usage continues to be one area that's running.","Specialty Pharma continues to be part of the story, but there is really nothing that I would say is very different or extraordinary in the other categories compared to what we talked about over the last couple of quarters.","A.J. Rice","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Raskin","Thanks. My question also relates to the cost trend and just trying to understand a little bit better Shawn, I know you\u2019re explicitly changing the cost trend guidance for the commercial side, but I was wondering are you seeing similar trends on the Government?","And then is there any way to think about how prior figures development is playing into that across the segments? Should we think of that as the PPRD is ratably within each segment or was one of them more than the other?","Shawn Guertin","So I would say that across all products, we certainly saw a moderate trend results. There is a lot more things going on in the Government business in terms of growth and new launches.","So we were probably a little bit more cautious there with things like the duals ramping up. So there is probably a little bit less of that benefit right now in the government business than we saw in the commercial business.","The area that was particularly strong this year was Medicare. We've had a very good result and you see that in the Government MBR obviously. The PPD frankly though was strong across all products and as again as you see in the Government MBR was also very strong in Medicare and Medicaid.","Josh Raskin","And I know you don\u2019t break out the specific segments, but that 13% revenue growth, is there just sort of a rough ballpark with Medicare advantage higher, Medicaid probably a lot higher, PDP a lot lower is that a way to think about it?","Shawn Guertin","Yes I mean -- this is in our guidance previously, but we\u2019ve obviously done a little bit better on the Medicare side. I would say the one thing on the Medicaid side is that the ramp-up in some of the opt-out rates on the duals contracts, that has gone a little bit slower on the uptick side than we thought. So that has pulled revenue the other way.","Josh Raskin","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Ana Gupte","Yes thanks good morning. Wanted to ask about the individual book. I think you had said that with the individual off exchange, you lost money last year. You moved to ACA compliant plans. I am just trying to understand this.","You've reached normalized margins on the off exchange book and then on the on exchange book as you get more visibility into the risk adjusted data, maybe even be able to book some risk quarters.","Is there potential to expand margins and then what are normalized margins just under on a blended basis? Might we see some margin expansion this year and continuing into 2016?","Karen Rohan","Ana on the off exchange individual book what we did is as you know as we told you we would be moving that entire book to ACA rated plans and we have done so. So we're tracking along where we expected. Obviously risk adjustor is having an impact on that book as well. And we expect that that book for the rest of the year will have some pressure in our overall margins. I'll let Shawn talk about the on exchange risk adjustor.","Shawn Guertin","Yes so the -- I would like to think that we\u2019ve been prudent on these accruals and so I would certainly say there is potential for things to be favorable, but I would also just reiterate the lack of I would say, the lack of information that we have right now on the sort of what I would say official information rather still leads to a lot of estimation.","So I wouldn\u2019t -- I certainly at not this point saying that it\u2019s only a one way street just given the level of uncertainty, but we\u2019ve typically thought about this business as a mid-single digit margin business in a normalized state and there is nothing that's happening today that would make us feel different about this business going forward.","Ana Gupte","Thanks so much. It\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. So you didn\u2019t book a risk quarter payment, but I guess can you help us frame or think about what you maybe think you owed at this point if that payment did come through and when do you expect visibility on that? Thanks.","Shawn Guertin","Yes so we had said last -- at the fourth quarter call, this was worth about 20 bps on the commercial -- full-year commercial MBR. It's a little bit less than that now as we've updated the calculation for reinsurance and risk adjustment but that's still in the same neighborhood of what it's worth.","Ralph Giacobbe","And then just on the visibility side, when do you think you'll know whether that you can book that or not?","Shawn Guertin","We're continuing to be told that we will get this information at the end -- by the end of the second quarter. So assuming that that timing holds, we would think that we could update our estimates based on that information on our second quarter call.","Ralph Giacobbe","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. Just wanted to ask just first on the public exchange membership growth, it looks like that, that growth is tracking quite a bit faster than the overall market growth was in the 2015 AET.","So just interested about whether there were specific new geographies that drove most of that growth and then also in terms of share gains, what type of competitors you saw share gains from in public exchange?","Karen Rohan","So as you know, we ended the quarter with over -- little bit over 950,000 public exchange members. We continue to operate in 17 states. A handful of states drive the biggest share of our overall membership.","It's all in line with our expectations relative to where we grew in our geographies. As you know our strategy has been where we can achieve competitive cost structure where we have a strong regulatory environment and where we can return our capital. That's where we're investing in our public exchanges.","Just generally speaking, the growth is consistent with what we had anticipated when we saw the open enrollment season unfold. The demographics are consistent with our pricing. We maintain that we're still in silver and bronze plan.","As Mark indicated, our average age has reduced slightly. So we feel good about that as well and our book continues to remain 90% subsidy eligible. So as you know, we believe this is an important business for us and we'll continue to evaluate this business.","We're in the midst of pricing for 2016 and we're monitoring this business very closely as it affect for three hours.","Scott Fidel","And Karen, do you think that all the growth primarily is just from market growth or did you see, also see share gains from competitors and if so, what type of competitors? Thanks.","Karen Rohan","We saw both market growth and taking business from competitors. It's a very competitive price market and we saw both I don't have actual numbers to share with you. Over half of our membership we know is new to us.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Costa","Nice quarter guys, but let me focus a little bit on one of the pieces of guidance that was a little bit weaker the term in revenue guidance, can you describe sort of what contributed to that? I've heard slower tools. There was the MLR contractual that adjusted revenues this quarter and then the mix of high deductible health plans in the exchanges versus the group business.","Can you quantify sort of those three items in terms of what their impact was to your revenue?","Shawn Guertin","Yes, so you've largely hit the items. So we have a number of things going on in the commercial business as you alluded to. In a relative mix we have more individual and less group. Those are at that set of lower premium inside individual. Our population has gone a little younger and it's more bronze than we had originally forecast.","And we've also continued to make some assumptions obviously around risk adjusted payables. So all three of those things are contributing to pushing the commercial revenue down and that's probably more -- little bit more than half of sort of the pressure on the number.","And the other side you mentioned the other one, which is just this delay in ramping up the duals and bringing the duals on Board and that's really the other big piece of this that's contributing it.","So just rough numbers. We're probably talking something in the order of magnitude of maybe $900 million or $1 billion and again the commercial mix piece of this is a little bit more than half of that and then the rest really is the delay in duals.","Peter Costa","And what about the adjustment for the contractuals in the MR?","Shawn Guertin","Yes, let me talk a little bit about that. So that is the revenue sense relatively modest -- relatively a modest adjustment. So we're probably talking a number between $30 million and $40 million is what we had to accrue as a result of the PYD that we experienced and we went back and revisited those calculations for 2014.","Peter Costa","Perfect. Thank you.","Shawn Guertin","But the one point I would make just as people think about that is obviously that's not only revenue offset, but what that means is obviously all of the PYD is not necessarily flowing to the bottom line as we had to make some of these minimum MLR accruals.","Peter Costa","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Christine Arnold","Hey there. You guys mentioned that 51 to 300 was improving. Could you talk to us about what you're seeing in terms of the improvement in profitability there and if possible quantify kind of what you're expecting this year versus last year in turn there and what you're seeing in selection on that book?","Karen Rohan","Hi Christine, let me just remind you all that last year when we looked at this book, the 51 to 300 book, it wasn\u2019t performing or meeting our internal expectation. So as you may recall, we decided to take very deliberate pricing and underwriting actions to improve the performance of this book.","So as we came through in the first quarter, we evaluated the book as it stood and as we looked at our fairs and levers analysis, we're quite pleased with the book that stayed with us. We were able to receive and get the rate increases that we had anticipated and for the book that left us.","We feel good about the level of performance on that book as it left. As you know, we're committed to margin over membership and I think what we've demonstrated here with the performance of this book that we remain committed to it.","As you know it's still early in the year to evaluate the total performance of the book, but based on the overall rate execution of what we have, we see that we're quite pleased with the performance of the book where it stands today.","Christine Arnold","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Borsch","Yes. Good morning. I realize it's early in the selling season, but I was hoping you could give us a glimpse of what you're seeing as you have discussions with larger employers about 2016, where the Cadillac tax. figures into that and where you think things stand in terms of consideration on private exchanges?","Mark Bertolini","Hi Matt, Mark. It is way early in the season. However there is a lot of conversation going on for the claim on unionized populations about the effect of the Cadillac tax and I expect that we'll see some pretty contentious discussions and maybe even the potential that union trust will pick up membership.","We've already seen that in a couple of accounts and expect that that could be a continuing trend until there is better clarity on the Cadillac tax.","We also see a trend toward more market specific buying on the part of large employers. We think this is a positive trend as we think about private exchanges, local market ACOs and the strategy we're pursuing as employers are going back to more multiple offerings versus having one carrier.","Relative to the numbers so far on the season Karen, I don't know if you have any specifics.","Karen Rohan","Yes, what I would say is that we look at activity remains consistent with the pipeline that we have last year. We're currently responding to overall bid activity. As you would expect it would be premature for me to estimate 116 membership at this point.","Matthew Borsch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dave Windley","Hi, I wanted to ask around -- good morning and thanks for taking the question, I wanted to ask around your value-based purchasing strategy. I am curious how many -- how many situations -- into how many situations have you deployed your Healthagen stack and how integral is that to driving your value based purchasing goals by the end of the decade?","And then if you could quantify at all any differences in margin or trend between your experience in and out of the value-based contracts, thanks?","Mark Bertolini","Dave, this is Mark. I think our value-based contract now we're in 62 ACOs. We have almost a million members in patients that are medical homes, which is 38% growth since the beginning of '14 and over 760,000 members in what we call our high performance networks, which we picked up with Coventry.","And so we have value-based contracting a little bit of map. I would say that full stack on Healthagen rather limited at this point in time. We do have pieces of our technology in a number of different relationships and our strategy is to get at least a backbone in place early on.","Some relationship around data so that we can growth the stack over time and actually with [Medicity] [ph] we're seeing a lot of growth as they add on more capabilities with the providers that are currently in their network which are over a 1,000 households and over 270,000 physicians.","So we're about 30% of the medical spend today in value-based contracting. I would say our most advanced programs are showing a lot of opportunity for us in lowering cost structure and improving the price in the marketplace, but again we're across the map with a number of different relationships, our goal ultimately to move them to the highest form in most advanced form over time.","Dave Windley","Thank you. Are you able to quantify in those -- say those most advanced situation, how much trend benefit you're getting?","Mark Bertolini","Our goal is to reduce our price point in the marketplace between 8% and 15%.","Dave Windley","Fantastic. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Rigg","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know the Kentucky RFP process is still ongoing, so it's probably going to be hard to say a lot, but can you give us just some general parameters for what you're seeing there.","Why you now think the rate pressure is going to be even worse. Whether you guys were surprised by the RFP and whether there is any risk to actually losing the business outright, given the timing. Just any color on what's going on there would be helpful. Thanks a lot.","Mark Bertolini","Obviously this is too early to talk about the contract. We're in the midst of discussions with them now and we expected that we would have some activity around this contract mid-year.","We would say that the pressure we anticipate in our guidance is more than we originally anticipated in our operating plan. And so -- but we're able to accommodate that within the guidance we put forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with our questions.","Andy Schenker","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just going on to your thoughts here on capital deployment and your appetite for M&A given obviously the increased expectations for dividends from subs to the modest as well as the fact that you completed your targeted deleveraging earlier than you kind of originally had guide us to. Thanks.","Shawn Guertin","Well thanks for the question Andy. I would say that we continue to look for opportunities to grow in the provider space around technology in better building out the Healthagen asset.","We just recently made an acquisition in the exchange space bSwift last year and so we continue to look for assets in the commercial space that will work for us. As it relates to larger consolidations of M&A, we have a strong balance sheet and we're paying attention to what\u2019s going on in the market place and will react appropriately or act appropriately should the opportunity arise.","Andy Schenker","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please proceed with our question.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. Just wanted to go to the guidance because your last quarter when you provide a guidance of at least $7 you kind of highlighted the fact that it was at least and then based upon the favorable development this quarter you would be consensus by $0.44 and yet you didn\u2019t raise by that amount.","So wanted to dig a little bit more until I guess you highlighted three things specifically. I don\u2019t know if we should be reading anything at all into the fact that you put cost trend first as a potential risk, but just wanted to get into kind of each of those three things the cost trend, the exchange membership and 3Rs and then Kentucky is kind of how we think about that because all equal, it seems like it\u2019s a conservative number, but I just want to kind of understand if any of these things is may be bigger than what we are looking at from the outside.","Shawn Guertin","On the last two on the public exchange it is early given the growth we've had, the way we're accounting for the system. The issues we saw last year in accounting for the way we have to for public exchange. So it's just really caution particularly on that front around what to expect for the rest of the year. As it relates to Kentucky, obviously early and still in the midst of that conversation.","Cost trends, if there is one number that always has us keep one eye open at night and has the biggest impact on our ability to deliver is cost trend. We are down at the lower end of our guidance. We've seen present cost trend. We also positive cost trend in the first quarter of last year and we don\u2019t see any reason to get out in front of relatively cautious view on what we're trying.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush. Please proceed with our question.","Sarah James","Thank you. Can you speak to how revenue diversification and growth in the non-risk based revenue stream is impacting your discussions with rating agencies and how they're evaluating your balance sheet and may be how that may change what you view as the goal that to cap for Aetna?","Shawn Guertin","What the rating agencies tend to be interested and is obviously the dividends that we get from non-regulated subsidiaries, which is typically where some of that service fee business is as you suspect.","Given the composition of our company, most of our dividends do come from regulated subsidiaries, but it's not insignificant the amount that does come from the non-reg business.","So it's certainly something that they look at and we think about, but it's really just part of a bigger strategy to grow the revenue, you know the revenue profile of the company as opposed to a specific strategy just to grow the non-regulated fee-based business.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Baker","Yes. I was wondering if you could give us some color on what -- how Aetna is approaching the shift from a pharmacy benefit management to a drug benefit management. I know you have CVS that you work with, but given the fact that a lot of that pipeline will flow through major medical, may be you could outline just couple of initiatives that you guys are working on yourselves so to speak on that front.","Mark Bertolini","I'll remind you, everybody and also you Michael first that we did not give up PBM -- complete PBM relationship from a pharmacy benefit standpoint when we did our dealer CVS. Our dealer CVS is very structured where we continue to control formulary, we continue to control actions around case management and how we look at drugs and introducing drugs.","So our P&T Committees are still very active and then involved in how we manage drugs, but in the end analysis I think as we look at the pressure, it's on the specialty side and we're looking for ways to move the cost of these drugs away from the medical benefit into the pharmacy benefit where we can both negotiate formulary and rebates and we can also have coinsurance cost sharing on the drugs and we can tier the drugs based on their efficacy, clinical efficacy.","So that's how we think about managing this going forward and if there is one trend on the page that continues to move up, it's larger on the specialty drug area.","Michael Baker","Thank you.","Tom Cowhey","Thank you, Michael.

My name is Jenny and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Aetna Q1 2014 Earnings Call. (Operator instructions.) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Kelly, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kelly, please go ahead.","Tom Kelly","Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna\u2019s Q1 2014 Earnings Call and Webcast. This is Tom Kelly, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna, and with me this morning are Aetna\u2019s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks we will answer your questions.","During this call we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning\u2019s press release and the reports we file with the SEC including our 2013 Form 10(k). ","We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company\u2019s performance that are non-GAAP measures in our Q1 2014 financial supplement and our 2014 guidance summary. These reconciliations are available in the Investor Information section of www.aetna.com.","Please note that the inclusion of Coventry\u2019s business in Q1 2014 results impacts the quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Additionally, all references to 2014 operating earnings and operating EPS reflect Aetna\u2019s current definitions which exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets.","Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call. With that I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark Bertolini","Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. On prior calls we have discussed 2014 as a year with many challenges, including solving for ACA-mandated fees and taxes and offsetting the rate pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. Overcoming these challenges in Q1 has required a clear strategy, the power of a diversified portfolio of business, and above all strong execution.","As a result, this morning Aetna reported record quarterly operating EPS of $1.98 per share, a 27% increase over the prior year quarter. Underlying this result we grew medical membership by over 500,000 members, reaching over 22.7 million members. We grew quarterly operating revenue by 47% from the prior year, reaching $14 billion and we grew quarterly operating earnings by 40% from the prior year, reaching $722 million. Each of these quarterly metrics represents historic highs for our organization. ","Based on our Q1 results today we made several adjustments to our full-year 2014 guidance. We increased our projected full year operating revenue to a range of $56 billion to $57 billion, representing at the midpoint projected year-over-year growth of nearly 20%. We instituted year-end membership guidance of over 23 million medical members, projecting between 800,000 and 1 million members of growth for 2014, and an incremental 300,000 to 500,000 members of growth for the remainder of the year. ","And we raised our operating EPS projection to a range of $6.35 to $6.55 per share from our previous projection of at least $6.25 per share. At the midpoint Aetna is now projected to grow operating EPS at a compound annual rate of 14% since 2010, well in excess of our managed care peers. ","We are pleased with our Q1 performance and our updated 2014 outlook. While uncertainties remain the power of Aetna\u2019s diversified portfolio, an enduring commitment to maintain our pricing discipline, continued progress on the Coventry integration and solid execution gives us increasing confidence that we can achieve our 2014 projections. ","At our Investor Conference in December we highlighted the following elements of our growth model built on the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses. Specifically we project that Aetna\u2019s large group commercial business can grow profitably, Aetna\u2019s government business can be a growth engine. Small group and individual represent an opportunity for future growth. Next generation networks enhance the core business and Coventry is highly accretive, enhances top line growth and strengthens our capital position.","I will now provide a brief update on how we are executing against some of these growth levers. Starting with our large group commercial business, we grew nearly 300,000 members in our large group commercial business in Q1, predominantly through self-insured membership increases. These gains were attributable to new customer wins in public and labor, continued growth in our network access products and new, private exchange membership. We are pleased with this result and our continued prospects for growth for the remainder of 2014.","In our government business we had another notable quarter of new sales in Medicare Advantage, adding over 130,000 members in the quarter. Our continued momentum speaks to the popularity of the Medicare Advantage program and the value we provide relative to traditional fee for service Medicare. This value is demonstrated by our STARS performance where we have a higher percentage of members in 4-STAR or greater plans than any of our national managed care peers. We continue to invest in our Medicare Advantage business and project that our STARS performance will improve in 2015, further enhancing our value proposition.","Moving on to the final 2015 Medicare Advantage rates, Medicare Advantage continues to be a highly successful program with nearly 16 million Americans or 30% of the Medicare population relying on the value that this program provides. We were encouraged that the final rate notice demonstrated a commitment on the part of CMS to mitigate the funding pressures outlined in the advanced notice. However, with the final notice it is clear that rates for this popular program will decline once again. When combined with last year\u2019s rate action this will represent a high-single digit decline over the 2014 and 2015 period.","Despite our efforts these continued funding cuts may drive increased member disruption in 2015, including more meaningful increases to premiums, lower benefits, and even market exits. Aetna remains committed to the Medicare Advantage program and we will continue to work to enable our members to better manage their health, enhance the quality of our products, preserve member benefits and earn an appropriate return for our shareholders.","Continuing with the government business, our Medicaid franchise performed well in Q1 producing strong operating results and growing by over 60,000 insured members during the quarter. Additionally on April 1st in the partnership with Mercy Maricopa Integrated Care we began serving over 600,000 behavioral health members through one of the largest integrated behavioral health contracts in the nation. Note that these members will not be included in our medical membership counts.","Finally, we expect that we will begin enrolling dually-eligible members through both our Ohio and Illinois demonstration projects beginning in Q2. We are pleased with the execution and momentum in our Medicaid products and look forward to serving these additional members in 2014.","Moving on to our individual business, despite some initial challenges with the launch of the public exchanges enrollment has continued to build through the end of the open enrollment period. At the end of Q1 Aetna had 230,000 paid public exchange members included in our reported results. Based on our experience to date, we now project we could end the year with approximately 450,000 paid public exchange members. ","At this early stage we do not have enough experience with this on-exchange population to draw meaningful conclusions as to their overall health status. However, we would note that in the aggregate our early medical cost indicators for this population remain within a manageable range as compared with our pricing assumptions.","As we think about the individual business it is important to put it into the proper context for Aetna. We now project that our combined on- and off-exchange individual business will represent approximately 5% of our 2014 operating revenues and continue to project that it will be a modest headwind to operating earnings in 2014. This projected result is consistent with our strategy to gain meaningful early experience in the on-exchange marketplace and still represents a manageable financial exposure for Aetna that is contemplated within our updated guidance range.","Looking forward, as we prepare to submit our 2015 on-exchange bids our bias is to maintain our current footprint across 17 states. While each rating area within a state has distinct demographic and competitive dynamics, at a high level we are evaluating our projected medical cost experience with this population, the risks and uncertainties of recent public exchange regulatory changes, and the pricing levels necessary to achieve reasonable returns on capital for our shareholders. ","Our teams are hard at work evaluating these critical criteria and weighing the risks and benefits of our continued participation and the appropriate pricing for each separate weighting area. We look forward to updating shareholders on the outcome of our deliberations as we move throughout the year.","Shifting to our ACL and next-generation network strategy, we continue to execute on our strategy of enabling providers to transform their models from episodic acute care management to population health management. By aligning economic incentives between Aetna and providers we are able to offer high-quality, low-cost products, enhancing the growth of our core businesses.","Our Innovation Health joint venture with Anova Health in Virginia speaks to the power of these relationships. Powered by Anova\u2019s high quality of care, integrated clinical model and attractive cost structure, we have been able to win a 30,000 member public and labor account in Virginia, offer attractively priced individual public exchange products to over 8000 new members, and attract interest from a number of Fortune 500 companies in accessing this high-quality network for their employees. ","In total we now have more than 100,000 members enrolled in Innovation Health plans, a figure we expect to continue to grow. By partnering with providers like Anova we are creating a scalable, capital efficient model that enables true population health management, ultimately creating a healthier world one community at a time.","Finally, a few comments about our long-term growth outlook: at our Investor Conference in December we outlined our long-term growth strategy, backed by the strengths of our diversified portfolio and the many growth opportunities we believe we have before us. ","Our growth in Q1 across multiple businesses speaks to these growth opportunities as we added 130,000 private exchange members, of which over two-thirds are fully insured; enrolled approximately 230,000 paid members through the public exchanges; grew our Medicare Advantage membership by over 130,000 members, expanded our Medicaid Risk membership by over 60,000 members; and further expanded our presence in the international private medical insurance marketplace by closing the InterGlobal acquisition earlier this week."," Collectively, we project these new members to contribute over $3 billion in annual premiums and fees and represent an encouraging start as we seek to double operating revenues by the end of the decade.","In summary I am pleased with our Q1 results and I am confident in our strategic direction and our ability to execute, our continued pricing discipline across all lines of business, our ability to achieve Coventry synergies and our accretion goals, the power of our diversified portfolio to drive growth, and our 2014 operating EPS guidance of $6.35 to $6.55 per share. ","I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication to meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers, and generating and deploying capital responsibly we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn who will provide additional insight into our Q1 results and our updated 2014 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn Guertin","Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone. Earlier today we reported record Q1 2014 operating earnings of $722 million and operating earnings per share of $1.98. Aetna\u2019s operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flow, and operating margins. I\u2019ll begin with some comments on overall performance.","Our top line performance for the quarter was very good. We grew operating revenue by 47% over the prior year quarter to a record quarterly level of $14 billion driven by the Coventry acquisition and underlying revenue growth. We also grew medical membership to a record 22.7 million members, adding over 525,000 new members during the quarter with growth in our commercial self-insured and government businesses. Q1 2014 represents Aetna\u2019s eighth consecutive quarter of medical membership growth.","From an operating margin perspective our businesses are performing quite well. Our pre-tax operating margin was 9.5%, a 50 basis point year-over-year improvement and at the high end of our target operating margin range. Our Q1 total medical benefit ratio was 80.4%, a strong seasonal result that benefited from actions designed to solve for ACA-mandated fees and taxes, favorable prior years\u2019 reserve development, harsh winter weather and a moderate flu season.","Our operating expense ratio was 17.8%, a 20 basis point improvement over Q1 2013 as growth in operating revenue, a disciplined focus on cost, and Coventry synergies more than offset the negative impact of ACA-mandated fees on this metric.","From a balance sheet perspective we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior years\u2019 reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to Q4 2013 dates of service. Our reserve growth well exceeded our premium growth and days\u2019 claims payable were 47 days at the end of the quarter, up two days sequentially. This increase in days\u2019 claims payable was driven primarily by new membership in the quarter, including our new public exchange membership. As Risk membership growth levels out over the balance of the year we expect this metric to return to a level more consistent with our recent historical experience.","Turning to cash flow and capital, operating cash flows in Q1 were strong. Healthcare and group insurance operating cash flows were 2.1x operating earnings driven by higher premium receipts resulting from pricing actions designed to recover ACA-mandated fees and taxes and the growth in insured membership in Q1. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing over 6.5 million shares in the quarter for $465 million and distributing another $82 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. ","In short, we are very pleased with our Q1 results which we believe demonstrate the execution of Aetna\u2019s growth strategy, the success of the Coventry integration, and the value of our diversified portfolio. I will now discuss the key drivers of our Q1 performance in greater detail.","Beginning with our Commercial business, our commercial membership growth significantly exceeded our projection during the quarter, growing by over 400,000 members. This growth was almost entirely driven by commercial self-insured membership gains as commercial insured membership was flat sequentially. Given the numerous moving pieces I will discuss each of the component parts separately.","Starting with commercial self-insured medical membership we grew by just over 400,000 members in the quarter driven by new customer wins in the public and labor and network access products. Additionally, we recently announced that we will add over 400,000 new commercial self-insured members associated with the Teacher Retirement System of Texas starting on September 1st. Commercial self-insured membership also benefited as a result of a large customer transition that was projected to occur in Q1 but that has been delayed until at least Q2 2014. Given the TRS contract win we are confident that we will grow self-insured membership over the remainder of the year.","Moving on to commercial insured, membership was flat sequentially, a result that speaks directly to our commitment to fair and financially responsible pricing where we favor margin over membership and price to underlying medical cost trends. This result was primarily driven by two items \u2013 individual membership grew by approximately 100,000 members as new public exchange enrollees more than offset declines in our off-exchange enrollment. However, this new exchange enrollment activity was offset by the loss of membership in limited benefit products, reducing membership in the quarter by approximately 100,000 members.","As we examine the remainder of the year we project that continued on-exchange membership growth will more than offset remaining lapses in our limited benefit membership, and therefore project that commercial insured membership will increase over the balance of the year. ","Our commercial medical benefit ratio was 77.2% for the quarter, an excellent result. This result benefitted from both higher premiums driven in part by pricing actions designed to recover ACA-mandated fees and taxes, strong prior years\u2019 reserve development, the favorable impact of harsh winter weather, and a moderate flu season. Excluding these items, Q1 underlying commercial medical cost trends are emerging consistent with our previous projections. Based on our year-to-date experience we continue to project that Aetna\u2019s standalone 2014 commercial medical cost trends will be in the range of 6% to 7%.","Another important growth lever is our government franchise. Our government business grew by over 120,000 members in the quarter consisting of Medicare Advantage growth of more than 130,000 members, Medicare Supplement growth of over 30,000 members, and Medicaid Insured growth of more than 60,000 members; partially offset by the previously disclosed exit from a low-revenue Medicaid [ASC] contract in California accounting for 125,000 members. ","The Coventry acquisition combined with strong underlying membership growth drove Q1 2014 government premiums to a record $5.1 billion, nearly double Q1 2013. Our government medical benefit ratio was 84.7% in the quarter, an excellent result in absolute terms and a year-over-year improvement of over 300 basis points. Drivers of this year-over-year improvement include actions impacting revenue and medical costs designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap including the health insurer fee; increased favorable prior years\u2019 reserve development; and the favorable impact of harsh winter weather and a moderate flu season.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At March 31sr we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of 36.5%. Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with $200 million, net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $486 million. We repurchased over 6.5 million shares for $465 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $82 million. After other uses we ended the quarter with $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 357.4 million at March 31st.","As a result of our Q1 performance we are increasing our 2014 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $6.35 to $6.55 per share. At the top end of the range our guidance has increased by $0.30 driven by favorable operating performance and volumes in Q1 2014 including the effect of favorable prior years\u2019 reserve development, weather impacts and a moderate flu season, partially offset by increased levels of strategic spending in 2014 including additional actions to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap, investments in healthcare management, and investments in our consumer-centric and population health strategies.","However, at this early stage in the year certain risks and challenges remain, and the bottom end of our projected range reflects these uncertainties, including the ever-present concern that medical cost trends could increase more than we\u2019ve projected including but not limited to the potential for higher-than-projected utilization of new Hepatitis C treatments; current low visibility associated with our public exchange membership given the immature medical cost experience we have on this cohort, particularly in light of the late surge in enrolment; and the risk that our new Medicare Advantage membership will be less profitable than currently projected.","Our updated 2014 guidance is also influenced by the following additional drivers: we project that our full-year medical membership will be over 23 million members, an increase of 300,000 to 500,000 members over the remainder of the year. Drivers of this projected increase are continued growth in commercial and Medicare membership, Medicaid expansion and the inclusion of membership from our recently closed acquisition of InterGlobal. ","Based on our full-year membership projections we are increasing our full-year 2014 operating revenue projection to a range of $56 billion to $57 billion. We continue to project our full year commercial medical benefit ratio to be 79% to 80% and our full year government medical ratio to be 85% to 87%, noting that our updated guidance implies relative improvement inside our guidance ranges.","We now project our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18.5% as higher volumes enhance operating leverage. We continue to project pre-tax operating margin to be at least 7.5%, consistent with our high-single digit target. We now project operating earnings to be approximately $2.3 billion.","Based on our increase in operating revenue guidance we now project net dividends from subsidiaries to be approximately $1.7 billion as additional capital to support premium growth is held at our regulated subsidiaries. We continue to project excess cash flow to the parent of approximately $1.2 billion.","Finally, as we examine the progression of quarterly earnings for the remainder of the year we project that Q1 will be the highest one for operating earnings per share. This projection is consistent with the high level of prior years\u2019 reserve development in Q1, the typical seasonal pattern of medical costs, and an operating expense ratio that we project to increase over the course of the year. As a result we project that our Q4 operating EPS will be the lowest result of this year. ","In closing, we are encouraged by the strength of our Q1 results and our improved 2014 outlook, particularly at this early stage in the year. As we look to the rest of the year we remain focused on delivering on our plans to offset the Medicare Advantage rate pressures, integrating Coventry as we continue to invest to achieve or exceed our 2014 synergy targets, collecting or solving for the ACA-mandated fees and taxes, and executing on our exchange strategies both public and private.","As we continue to execute on these key focus areas during this challenging time for our industry we are increasingly confident that we can achieve our 2014 projections, meeting our goal to grow both operating earnings and operating EPS this year. I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Tom Kelly","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna Management Team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, the first question, please?","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, we\u2019ll go first to Carl McDonald with Citi.","Carl McDonald \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Great, thank you. I was hoping that you could quantify as best you can the impact of weather and also the net favorable development on earnings in Q1.","Shawn Guertin","Carl, what I would say is if you put those two items actually together which would include also a more modest flu season than we had projected, that\u2019s probably a $0.45 good guy.","Carl McDonald \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Great, thank you very much.","","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Josh Raskin of Barclays.","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, thanks, good morning. Based on the comments from United last week I was wondering if you guys could update your thoughts on how the early renewal process went in your commercial risk book, and then any expectations for what we\u2019ll call the ACA-compliant plans that signed up or groups that signed up after January 1st, and any thoughts around the risk pool for the remaining risk accounts that signed up in Q1?","Mark Bertolini","Yeah, Josh, we started working on healthcare reform back in 2010. We put together a PMO, over 350 people that focused on the mechanics of how to think about this pricing, and so we fully anticipated that with early renewals, which was a strategy we adopted earlier, and with the potential for ACA-compliant plans that there was going to be definite risk shift in the pools. And we priced for that in our pricing models. ","So at this early point, absent more data on the underlying experience of this population we feel we are priced appropriately for both early renewals and for the ACA-compliant plans at this time.","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital","And so Mark, just on that just specifically, relative to your previous expectations did the early renewal process meet those expectations; i.e., did you see more or less of those early renewals? And then any change in thought relative to say three months ago as to what that existing pool looked like when you did get into Jan. 1?","","Mark Bertolini","We saw a little more than we expected \u2013 about a third of the book was early renewal which we were expecting 25% to 30%, somewhere in there. So I think at the end of the day we had a little bit more but not meaningfully more number one. Number two, as we look at going through this year that \u201ckeep what you have\u201d has been extended. We\u2019re obviously going to reflect that in our pricing which will have a meaningful impact on our pricing as we go into 2015.","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, perfect. Thanks.","Operator","And we will move to our next question from Justin Lake of JP Morgan.","Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan","Thanks, good morning. My question, Shawn, you mentioned Medicare Advantage and new membership as an area of uncertainty, specifically on what the margins are going to look like. Can you walk us through what new Medicare Advantage membership margins look like typically for new members and then what you\u2019re seeing with early experience on the new membership for 2014 in terms of the potential for adverse selection and other uncertainty?","Shawn Guertin","Yes, I would say that typically the new membership will be profitable but not as profitable as what I call sort of the mature book or the overall book. That was our outlook a quarter ago, and we didn\u2019t see anything different in Q1 that would make us feel any different about the performance of that membership as evidenced by the very good government MBR that we posted for the quarter. But again, it is early and before we would declare victory on that we\u2019d like to see a little bit more experience.","Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan","So we should have an idea of kind of how that shakes down maybe by the time you report Q2?","Shawn Guertin","Yes. I think we will definitely have better insight at that point.","Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, great, thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll hear next from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo","The weather, flu and prior period development were all a good guy \u2013 you said $0.45. It made your loss ratio also look quite good compared to what your guidance is, yet you left your medical loss ratio guidance alone and you didn\u2019t raise your earnings guidance by as much as the $0.45 [fee]. Can you talk about what other incremental costs you\u2019re expecting relative to what you were expecting before? And if that\u2019s Hep C can you kind of quantify what that was in Q1 for you guys in terms of costs?","Mark Bertolini","Peter, I\u2019ll answer the broader question and I\u2019ll ask Shawn to talk about the specifics of Hep C. But in the end announcement, if you think about the $0.40 to $0.45 on prior period development, weather, flu, the offsets we see to that is based on what we\u2019re seeing in the 2015 Medicare rates. Our anticipation is that we should start investing now so we will think about an investment portfolio of $0.10 to $0.15 the remainder of the year that\u2019s going to be aimed at getting ready for Medicare, getting some more of our Medicaid dual eligible populations up, and to think about the private exchange investments that we would have to make. And so that would be an offset to that.","And then Sovaldi going to be a headwind. Let me turn it over to Shawn and he can talk a little bit about Sovaldi and Hep C.","Shawn Guertin","Yes, Sovaldi as some of you mentioned in your pre-call notes, we didn\u2019t talk about that a lot in the press release and that is because largely for us in Q1 it came in right around what we had built in for Q1. Now having said that, there was a delayed ramp in some of our segments of business so I\u2019ll call that it was a bit of an artificial hit planned because there was a bit of timing delays. And when we look at the run rate we would expect, and our guidance contemplates that we will actually have more expense related to this item during the rest of the year.","I want to point out though that again, even with this item in isolation which will be a strain, our outlook for the full year is still intact as far as our outlook on trend and the MBR. The majority of what we saw in Q1 on Sovaldi was in our commercial business and our Medicare business and a very small amount in Medicaid, and again, to some extent that\u2019s an outgrowth of the timing of various Medicaid plans covering this. Some of our Medicaid plans have carved out pharmacy as well; some of them we don\u2019t have any exposure.","So overall we look at this as one of the strain items that could potentially be there, but I\u2019ll take you back and try to wrap up Mark\u2019s question, too. You talked about the positive items being $0.45. A simple way to think about this is the investment that Mark talked about which we think is appropriate for the future maybe takes $0.15 off of that. That takes you to $0.30; that\u2019s the top end of our range. To the bottom end you have the risk factors I mentioned in my remarks, clearly one of which is Sovaldi.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo","That\u2019s very helpful. And is there any way you could quantify the number of Hep C patients that you had in the quarter or the expense you had in the quarter for Hep C?","","Shawn Guertin","I don\u2019t have the patient count. We spent about $30 million on Solvadi in Q1 again with the majority of that being in commercial and Medicare.","","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Can you just give us an update on what you\u2019re seeing in the commercial pricing environment at this point and maybe focus a bit on New York, just given some of the comments that United had made. And then just also we\u2019d be interested, Mark in your thoughts on the 2015 exchange premiums, just the CBL having come out recently with a view that exchange premiums across the industry will only be up around 3% which seems to vary quite significantly from what we\u2019re hearing from companies. So we just wanted your thoughts around that, too.","Mark Bertolini","Sure. I think the pricing environment remains rational. I think we would say if there was any irrational pricing it happened with a few of the co-ops as they went into the exchange. We in those markets actually withdrew from those markets as we were asked to meet co-op rating. And so I think our view was where was saw irrational players it wasn\u2019t appropriate for us to participate.","I think other than that I think we have a very rational marketplace as we always do. Our pricing did consider the shift between ACA-compliant plans and early renewals. And so I think for us we believe the pricing environment is a good environment now, and I think again as I\u2019ve said before minimum [MORs] create sort of an inability for you to scrape back losses if you go out and buy business. So it\u2019ll be interesting to see in some of these cases how people look at their rate increases in the future.","As it relates to 2015 I would say, and I\u2019ve seen the first review of our pricing as we get closer to May and I\u2019ve sat with the team actually this week, we have 132 rating areas that we are applying across 17 states. And so as you know all of those need to be approved individually and I would say the range of our rates are very low single digits to some that will be over double digits, and in large part that depends on number one, the amount of membership we have in the market; number two, the demographics of that membership, but probably even more importantly the lack of clarity about what kind of experience we have.","In the individual market, we generally rate this business 60 days beforehand, and here we\u2019re being asked to do it months, seven months beforehand. And as a result our conservatism goes up. As a result of looking at \u201ckeep what you have\u201d and other changes that have been made on the fly to this program we would say that that adds at least half of the rate increase in most markets where we\u2019re applying those rates.","And so all of this in the rating models creates conservatism and creates pressure, but again, our range is low single digits, very low single digits to over double digits and we\u2019ll have to go market-by-market as we move ahead.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks. And just to clarify, just the comments on seeing a very rational market in commercial \u2013 that would be inclusive of the New York market as well?","Mark Bertolini","Yes, I mean the New York dynamic is actually interesting compared to the rest of the country. New York is unique with a couple of other states where they were guaranteed issuing community rated to begin with. So the effect of ACA rates on that marketplace was a lot smaller than most other marketplaces where we had to factor in all the ACA changes. And so for us prior to this change we were sort of on the edges of the market, fairly highly priced because we didn\u2019t like the guaranteed issue nature of the marketplace.","Given that we had to get our head around how to do that across the individual market and some small group markets across the country in the shop exchanges we now have a model where we can work with that. The impact on rates was a lot smaller than most other markets.","Shawn Guertin","Yes, and Scott, I would tell you that in Q1 our small group ratio nationwide was fine, it was right on expectations; and our small group loss ratio in New York was fine. So I think that that speaks to Mark\u2019s points.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen and Company","Can you please speak to where Coventry\u2019s synergies and accretion are coming in relative to your initial guidance of about $200 million?","Mark Bertolini","Christine, Coventry continues to perform very well for us, and as I mentioned it is one of those areas that we continue to work at because I think it is an area where we could have the potential to overachieve this year on the synergy and accretion side. And like I mentioned on past calls we are definitely trying to do that. At this point, though, I wouldn\u2019t go there quite yet in the year and so we\u2019re standing by our original estimates for this year of $200 million in synergies and $0.50 of accumulated accretion.","Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen and Company","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to our next question from Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse ","Thanks, good morning. Do you have any better clarity or understanding of sort of the three Rs at this point \u2013 how those protections may sort of impact 2014 and at this point how that will sort of influence the 2015 bids?","Mark Bertolini","So I think one of the important things to think about here, Ralph, in the overhang of all of this is that the government has said it\u2019s going to be budget neutral which means that there have to be plans that make a lot of money in order to subsidize plans who don\u2019t. And given where the changes have been and a whole lot of other noise we don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s going to be a whole lot of money coming into the program to send to companies who lost money. And so our view is pretty\u2026 We don\u2019t expect a whole lot out of the three Rs coming from the 2014 plan year.","Shawn Guertin","And just specifically, Ralph, in Q1 we did not book anything for the risk corridor or risk adjustment, and we have a very modest reinsurance recoverable which is based only on known claims at this point.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse ","Okay. And how does that influence I guess the 2015 bids?","Mark Bertolini","Again, changes to the program that we have seen on the fly here have added we believe half the rate increase to most of our rates across the 132 rating areas.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse ","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ana Gupte at Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners","Yeah, thanks, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on your membership commentary. I think you said you had 230,000 paid members from public exchanges if I understood this right \u2013 100K came into your off-exchange individual but that was offset by 100K loss in limited benefits? And then overall your commercial insured is flat, so is the implication of that then you had a 230K-ish loss from your group membership? And if so where did they go? Did they migrate to exchanges or did they migrate as a group to other plans? In other words did you get uninsured in your exchanges or not?","Mark Bertolini","The simplest way to think about what has happened with the commercial insured membership is that the individual membership grew by 100,000 members. 230,000 of those were on-exchange members, so we lost 130,000 off-exchange members but that\u2019s net plus 100,000. That was offset by the loss of about 100,000 members on the limited benefit products which are going away as a result of the ACA, so overall membership was flat. The implication of that is that our sort of core group membership if you will was more or less flat over the quarter.","Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners","Got it, okay. And so that means that you actually lost members in off-exchange.","Mark Bertolini","Yes.","Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners","It seems like the [Blues] and some others are reporting a lot of growth in off-exchange.","Mark Bertolini","Yes, we lost 130,000 off-exchange members in the quarter.","Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go on to our next question from AJ Rice of UBS.","AJ Rice \u2013 UBS ","Obviously a lot of questions have been asked and answered here but I think I might just ask you to comment for a minute on the international side. Obviously you have highlighted it \u2013 you just announced yesterday that you closed on InterGlobal. Where are investments in international at this point in your thinking and maybe just any update on your strategy regarding international?","Mark Bertolini","Sure, AJ. What we\u2019re doing is private medical insurance in certain markets, so InterGlobal gives us a greater presence in Europe and some parts of Africa. So we\u2019re looking for footprints where we can gain access to members in those markets for private medical insurance. The bigger opportunity in our mind is in population health management where we are able to influence the construction and structure of healthcare delivery in markets. And so for example, in Qatar we are now managing their national health system providing fees management and information about how to address demographic and disease burden issues in their population.","We see more of that as an opportunity to build a solid base and foundation upon which we can then begin to offer affordable insurance to the emerging middle classes in those nations. So we\u2019re continuing our expat business, we\u2019re looking for more private medical insurance opportunities in local markets and footprints where we can do that. And then third, I think the longer term investment that will take some time but affords us opportunity to go after the emerging middle class in these nations where the middle class is growing the fastest in the world by helping to create the infrastructure necessary for an affordable healthcare system.","AJ Rice \u2013 UBS ","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go on to our next question from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yes, thank you. I was hoping you might just talk about the member composition on the ACA exchanges. And sorry if I missed something here but as you look at those 230,000 do you have a sense for or any tabulation for how many were previously Aetna members? Or I guess that\u2019s a net add so maybe the answer is zero, but where they came from in terms of being previously insured or uninsured?","Mark Bertolini","Well, let me give you some broad statistics and then I\u2019ll have Shawn get into some of the details. But I think first of all 230,000 in Q1, since then we have over 600,000 that have enrolled but less than 500,000 that have actually paid. And so our view of this is that we\u2019re not quite sure how this last cohort of individuals that came into the program, whether or not they will actually pay it or whether or not they were somehow encouraged to enroll. And so we\u2019re waiting for that to clear, but generally we see about 80% of the people who enroll actually pay. ","Shawn Guertin","Yeah, Matt, about 20% plus or minus appear to have been previous customers of ours. We really don\u2019t have a good statistic on whether the balance of those people were insured or uninsured.","Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And sorry, just related to that can you comment on the Medicaid expansion and your view of robust you think that is across your markets?","Shawn Guertin","Yeah, we had about 50,000 members added in Q1 as a result of Medicaid expansion and as we look to the balance of the year we\u2019re expecting roughly another 50,000 more for a total of about 100,000.","Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll hear from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. I think last quarter you kind of provided a view about where you guys might be going from an earnings perspective over the next three years, talking about the headwinds for 2014 and then lessening to some degree in\u201915, and getting back to normal growth in 2016. I just wanted to see if, as you get more color about what\u2019s actually happening in \u201914, what the MA rates are for \u201915, how do you think about that? Has anything really changed in your view?","Mark Bertolini","Well, I think a couple of things. Number one on the Medicare funding gap solve it\u2019ll be high single digits for both years, \u201914 and \u201915, which by implication means it\u2019s very low single digits for us for 2015 \u2013 the advantage of the Medicare STARS ratings in some of our geographies where we actually enroll members. And so for us getting in where we are in Q1, the opportunity to get way in front of that by making investments now for 2015 and making investments in STARS is a very important part of what we\u2019re doing in giving you the kind of guidance range that we\u2019ve given you already, is to start those investments now. ","So we\u2019re trying to bolster the \u201915 commitment that we made, that \u201915 looks better and then \u201916 better than that, but over time, 10% plus on average over time for our EPS growth. ","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then I just want to understand how you guys end up thinking about Solvadi, if it does end up being an issue this year. Is that just a one-time issue? Is that something that you would expect to fully recapture in the 2015 rates or do you expect that either this becomes something that becomes a permanent headwind or it takes longer than next year to fully recapture that?","Mark Bertolini","Yeah, I think that remains to be seen. I mean obviously it would be our intent to capture this as best we can in pricing, and the uncertainty around this issue really is the degree of ramp and the pace at which this keeps ramping up and if and when it starts to stabilize. And I think those would be the factors. As with anything new in terms of how quickly you get it into pricing is how good a job you do projecting the ramp up and then sort of the ultimate stabilization point, and it\u2019s just awful early in the lifecycle of this to know with any specificity whether we would do that. But clearly that would be our intent.","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Chris Rigg of Susquehanna Financial Group.","Chris Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I guess when I think about your public exchange enrollment and what you\u2019re expecting over the latter three quarters of the year, it seems like it\u2019s been pretty successful. But at the same time if I heard you correctly you kind of want to keep your footprint relatively unchanged for 2015. Can you help me sort of think through that? Is it just you want sort of two years\u2019 of experience under your belt before you expand markets? Or just any color about how you think about that business going forward, thanks.","Mark Bertolini","I think it\u2019s literally that we just don\u2019t know what we have and we don\u2019t know how profitable we\u2019ll be or what we\u2019ll need to do to be profitable in those markets. So we think given how little we know, and more importantly, this program keeps changing every month. Until it somewhat stabilizes and we know what kinds of investments we need to make we just want to play the cards. We\u2019re a large participant; we want to be playing the cards we\u2019re dealt right now.","Shawn Guertin","Yeah, Chris, and if you think about our strategy, it was looking at this as optionality. And getting in and getting enough meaningful experience to sort of know how to take advantage of this down the road \u2013 we\u2019ve accomplished that this first year. And I think prudence dictates that we don\u2019t necessarily need to dramatically expand that any further when you think through that strategy.","Chris Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Understood, thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sarah James of Wedbush.","Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Morgan Securities ","Thank you. I wanted to talk about your multiyear Medicare strategy for a moment. You mentioned planning some exits in \u201915 but several of your peers have talked about the Medicare environment improving in \u201916; and given the stickiness of Medicare members it seems unlikely you\u2019d exit a market in \u201915 just to reenter in \u201916. So I\u2019m wondering if this suggests that you see continued rate pressure in \u201916 and beyond and how we should think about the scale of the \u201915 exits versus the \u201915 exits, thanks.","Mark Bertolini","I think, Sarah, that the market exits are a last resort for us. So the very first thing we look at are network contracts and medical management, what can we do to bolster that, overlaid by STARS. And then we start looking at benefits, and to the degree we hit benefit limits we\u2019re not able to make the changes, or we\u2019re not large enough in a market to get the cost structure right then pulling out of a market is a last resort. So I always view that as our darkest day when we have to pull out of a market because of the opportunity that we think we have in the program.","Shawn Guertin","And Sarah, I would view that as more of a directional comment. Market exits were not a big part of our \u201914 strategy but as we mentioned, when the plan gets cut again at less than trend that just puts pressure on everything that you need to do, including the potential for market exits. But it would not, as Mark said it is not sort of the first choice \u2013 it is the last choice.","Mark Bertolini","And then on funding I think politically the question is what happens next year? I mean this year is an election year and were there considerations made for that? There\u2019s going to be a change in the administration at CMS in a number of different ways and HHS, and so what is the tell? We don\u2019t know yet but we do know that we have a better dialog now as an industry, that the business is now 16 million members, Medicare Advantage members \u2013 30% of the Medicare marketplace; that the people who are retiring, 11,000 a day, are people who like these kinds of programs.","So I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to destroy the program. I think the dialog has been a constructive one and we hope that continues.","Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Morgan Securities ","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll hear next from Dave Windley of Jefferies. ","Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Thanks. Curious about your conversations with your national account, large group-type commercial clients especially as it relates to motivations to move to private exchange. I\u2019m wondering if you expect that to accelerate as we move toward 2015 and if you also expect that the distribution between [ASC] and full risk selection as a movement to private exchange will match this two-thirds that you\u2019ve seen this year.","Mark Bertolini","Yeah, I think on the first one there is definitely a lot more interest and we\u2019re having a lot more conversations, and a lot more people are talking about private exchanges. I think as the renewals come in for the second year, those already in the exchanges, that\u2019s going to be sort of a marker as to whether or not the current structure of the private exchange marketplace works. ","We have a number of proprietary private exchange opportunities we\u2019re pursuing as a next evolution of the private exchange model, and we think that\u2019s going to have more economics associated with it. So we think this trend will continue and we hope that if we can prove that we\u2019re able to manage trend more effectively over time, that employers will consider moving to defined contribution sooner \u2013 and as a result we\u2019ll create more of an opportunity in the insured marketplace. But that all is you know, stuff that we\u2019re going to have to manage as we move ahead.","Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","The proprietary approaches that you allude to I presume are what you call the Aetna Marketplace \u2013 is that correct?","Mark Bertolini","Right, and the Aetna Marketplace can take any number of versions. Number one, it can be around an industry vertical where we have strong industry strength, and for us in the national accounts space that\u2019s in the healthcare business, that\u2019s in gas & oil and energy, and that\u2019s in retail and hospitality. So those are opportunities to build exchanges around groups of employee populations that have similar risks and similar needs, and to build not only the buying experience but also the care management and network models necessary to effectively address those populations.","The other models that we\u2019re experimenting with and are launching here very soon are private exchanges bolted onto the front of our ACO models where those provider systems in those communities can be able to sign up individual and small group and participate in what we\u2019ll create as a national ACO chain where we have private exchanges on the front of ACOs that can address large employer populations in specific markets \u2013 potentially disrupting the national account business by making their purchases more local.","Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Interesting, thank you very much.","Mark Bertolini","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Michael Baker of Raymond James.","Michael Baker \u2013 Raymond James","Yeah, thanks a lot. Mark, just to follow up on that last question, can you give us a sense of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of in-market employers given the fact that some of the consulting shops that target them have come up with their own exchange solutions? And then I just have another question after that.","Mark Bertolini","Yeah, not a lot right now. I know there\u2019s a lot of interest but quite frankly for those businesses it\u2019s not time to think about this yet. So the national account business is early because this is the cycle, but the middle market businesses are going to be later in the year. So we haven\u2019t seen a lot of activity, a lot of talk but not a lot of activity.","Michael Baker \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, and then just on the specialty pharmacy management side, obviously you have a partner there. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for if you\u2019re starting to do things that are unique in the marketplace, whether through your contracted relationships with providers or other types of means that would more meaningfully bend trend there, especially on the pharmacy management side of the house so to speak.","Mark Bertolini","Our CVS relationship is going well. We\u2019re finalizing our transition as we\u2019re migrating our business over. We\u2019re going to migrate the Coventry business, so migration when the other contract expires. But we\u2019ve been focused on making sure the migrations happen effectively. What we\u2019re seeing is that our penetration into national accounts is actually coming back up so we\u2019re having some good successes there, so those are sort of first order issues in that relationship.","Other issues around how do we think about these drugs, we\u2019re now beginning that process in strategy development and how we can work more closely together; fraud and abuse, specialty pharmacy, mail order both at the store and at home.","Michael Baker \u2013 Raymond James","I appreciate the update, thanks.","Operator","And our last question comes from Tom Carroll of Stifel.","Tom Carroll \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hey, good morning. I wonder if you might give us an update on the two dual programs that Aetna was awarded this year, and also maybe make some comment as to if you\u2019re tracking any attractive emerging markets or state programs that you see on the radar screen. Thanks.","Shawn Guertin","Yeah, Tom, we do have some clarity now on Ohio and Illinois in terms of timing. We can get you, I have the specific dates, but really the voluntary enrollment will largely be starting sort of at the end of Q1 and in Q2, and then the passive enrollment \u2013 which is where we would get more of the membership presumably \u2013 is going to be starting I think on 6\/1 in both the markets, or 6\/1 and 7\/1 actually in both of the markets. So the easiest way to think about it is we\u2019ll get some voluntary enrollment this quarter and then we\u2019ll see the passive enrollment largely in Q3.","Tom Carroll \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Do you have any estimated rate amounts you\u2019re going to be getting that you can give to us?","Shawn Guertin","Our updated guidance probably has $500 million of revenue attributable to this dual enrollment.","Tom Carroll \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Great. Let me sneak one more in if I could: can you just give us a sense of how Aetna is managing or assisting in managing the Solvadi ramp for the rest of the year, something to the tune of are you stratifying different membership, different enrollees into high risk and low risk and also looking at pricing discounts and things like that? Maybe just chat a little more in detail if you could.","Mark Bertolini","As a general rule right now it is on prior off, and so our clinical folks will review the appropriate clinical guidelines and make decisions on that basis. And I know there\u2019s a lot of, this is sort of number one, right, on the list right now and there\u2019s a lot of active discussion about sort of clinical protocols and how we should be employing those down the road. But right now the simple answer is we are following the existing clinical protocols.","We will obviously look at an array of strategies to manage the cost side of this equation but it is important to keep in mind that our ultimate decision on this is going to be a clinical decision by our folks.","Shawn Guertin","Also there are new drugs coming in for next year without the Interferon so there may be some queuing in the later part of the year that could slow some of this down.","Tom Kelly","Great, thanks Tom. A transcript of the prepared portion of this call will be posted shortly on the Investor Information section of www.aetna.com where you can also find a copy of our updated guidance summary containing details of our guidance metrics, including those that were unchanged and not discussed on this call.","If you have any questions about matters discussed this morning please feel free to call me or one of my colleagues in the Investor Relations Office.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Aetna Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Krocheski, you may begin.","Joseph Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining Aetna's second quarter 2017 earnings call and webcast. This is Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna and with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Bertolini, and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared remarks we will answer your questions. Karen Lynch, Aetna's President will join us for the Q&A session.","As a reminder, during this call we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently-projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC. We have also provided reconciliations with certain non-GAAP measures in our press release and guidance summary. These reconciliations are available on the Investor Information section of Aetna.com.","As you know our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited. So we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you, Joe and thank you all for joining us today. This morning Aetna reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $3.42 per share, a 55% increase over the second quarter of 2016. This strong second quarter performance represents a continuation of the positive results we delivered during the first quarter. Specifically, operating results in our Government business remain robust with Government premiums representing more than half of the total Health Care premiums. Medical cost trends remain moderate and we experienced favorable development of prior period healthcare cost estimates across all of our core products in the quarter.","Our total Health Care medical benefit ratio improved 240 basis points compared to the same period last year. We achieved an adjusted pre-tax margin above the high end of our target range and we grew adjusted earnings by 46%. Based on our strong first half results, today we increased our full year 2017 adjusted EPS projection to a range of $9.45 to $9.55 per share, up from our previous projection of $8.80 to $9.00. At the midpoint this represents 15% growth versus 2016 above our target long-term growth range.","In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter results and updated 2017 guidance. But first I would like to highlight the traction gained by our strategic initiatives and key operational accomplishments in the quarter. At our May investor update meeting we outlined our strategy to achieve mid to high single digit top line growth and low double digit adjusted EPS growth over time. Specifically, we discussed our opportunity to drive above-industry growth in Medicare Advantage based on our strong Star Ratings and geographic expansion. The potential to participate in the ongoing shift to manage Medicaid by targeting an active RFP pipeline with our integrated community care model to profitably grow our Medicaid revenue and our ability to continue to achieve stable results in our Large Group commercial products while maintaining a strong adjusted pre-tax margin profile and generating cash flow for reinvestment to drive future growth.","Underlying these growth objectives is the overarching mission of building a healthier world by focusing not just on improving clinical care but influencing the social determinates of health. Our goal is to strengthen all aspects of the care delivery model through analytically driven personalization, community-based services and aligned provider incentives. As we discussed on our first quarter call, harnessing these opportunities and driving future growth will require prudent investments. In the absence of major horizontal acquisition opportunities, we look to instead build the capabilities that will support our growth going forward.","Our strong performance through the first half of 2017 has provided us the flexibility to continue to make these investments and still deliver strong financial results. This increased investment is incorporated in our updated 2017 projections, which Shawn will discuss in more detail shortly.","I will now spend a few minutes discussing how we are executing against some key operational objectives, beginning with Medicare, which remains a critical component of our enterprise growth trajectory. Our Medicare business performed very well in the quarter, generating strong premium growth and profitability metrics. Our individual Medicare Advantage products continue to be the primary driver of growth with 14% year-to-date membership growth, nearly a third of which is the result of our geographic expansion in 2017. This strong growth is consistent with our targeted percentage growth of low- to mid-teens that we shared with you in May. Year-to-date, including Medicare Supplement, we have grown to serve 130,000 additional Medicare members reflecting another strong annual enrollment period complimented by solid second quarter follow-on growth.","In June we submitted bids to CMS that would facilitate the expansion of Aetna's reach from 56% of the Medicare population in 2017 to approximately 60% in 2018. As we discussed previously, our goal is to accelerate our geographic expansion in 2019 and beyond to serve more of this growing population.","Continuing on with our Government business. Medicaid delivered another solid quarter, including stable revenue and underwriting results compared to the prior-year period, despite the exit from Missouri during the quarter. Aetna served approximately 2.1 million Medicaid members at the quarter end, a decrease of approximately 250,000 compared to the year-ago quarter. This membership reduction resulted from the previously-noted exit of the Missouri Medicaid program and was in line with our expectations for the period.","In May, we discussed the importance of growing our Medicaid revenue as part of our diversified growth strategy. However, we also highlighted that we would be selective in choosing where to participate. Specifically, we would only participate in state programs where we can achieve enough membership to support the level of service our Medicaid members deserve and we can earn a reasonable return for our shareholders. As a result of receiving an insufficient level of membership to achieve a long-term viable presence in our recently-launched Nevada Medicaid contract, we gave a termination notice to the state and our contract will end on August 31. While disappointed in this particular outcome, we remain confident in Aetna's ability to continue to grow in Medicaid.","Shifting to our Group Commercial business, our Large Group Commercial Insured products performed well in the second quarter, achieving underwriting margins that exceeded our previous expectations as medical cost trends for Large Group Commercial Insured products remained moderate. Our commercial fee based businesses also performed well during the quarter continuing the momentum from the first quarter. While our government sponsored programs have become a more meaningful driver of our overall portfolio, our Large Group Commercial products continued to deliver steady growth, adjusted pre-tax margins and cash flow and we remain confident in the sustainability of these results.","Lastly, we made good progress in the quarter towards our long-term vision of positioning Aetna as the health partner of choice for people looking to achieve their personal health ambitions. During the quarter, we advanced the development of our machine learning and analytics engine. We rolled out our new brand campaign, highlighting our consumer-centric focus. We made additional advancements in our consumer-facing tools to provide an even more engaging consumer experience. We furthered our provider engagement strategy by signing a joint venture with Sutter Health, marking the fourth JV in the past 15 months and our bswift platform signed its largest planned sponsor to date serving as a proof point of the strong capabilities of our platform and the ability to move upstream and serve the needs of larger plans.","It has been a very productive quarter on many fronts. The entire Aetna organization is energized by our mission to help our members achieve their health ambitions and the strong financial performance their hard work has delivered year-to-date.","In summary we are very pleased with our strong first half results. I want to thank all of our employees for their efforts in serving our members and delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders. With positive momentum from the first half of 2017, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in a changing healthcare marketplace, that the investments we are making will position Aetna to succeed as the health partner of choice for the people we serve and we can achieve our updated 2017 adjusted EPS projection of $9.45 to $9.55 and drive long-term sustainable growth.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our second quarter results and our updated 2017 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Mark and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we reported second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.42, year-over-year growth of 46% and 55% respectively. Our second quarter results reflect strong core business fundamentals driven by disciplined pricing, moderate medical cost trend and capital deployment. I'll begin with some comments on overall performance.","Our medical membership of 22.1 million is roughly in line with our expectations for the period. Adjusted revenue was $15.5 billion, a year-over-year decrease driven by lower membership in our ACA-compliant individual and Small Group products and the 2017 suspension of the health insurer fee. These dynamics were partially offset by higher premium yields in our Commercial and","Government businesses and membership growth in our Medicare products. From an adjusted pre-tax margin perspective, our businesses are performing exceptionally well. Our adjusted pre-tax margin was 11.7%, a very strong result and above the high end of our target range.","Our second quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 80%. An improvement of 240 basis points compared to the same period last year. Our second quarter results benefited from continued moderate medical cost treads, favorable prior-period reserve development and our updated estimate of ACA-related risk adjustment payables for 2016. Our adjusted expense ratio was 16.5%, a 60 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2016, driven primarily by the suspension of the health insurer fee in 2017 and execution of our expense management initiatives, partially offset by targeted investment spending on growth initiatives.","From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves, we experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products primarily attributable to first quarter 2017 dates of service. And, our days claims payable were 54 days the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of approximately one day.","Turning to cash flow and capital. Our year-to-date Health Care and Group insurance cash flows were approximately 1.1 times net earnings. During the quarter, we distributed $166 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. Year-to-date we have returned a total of approximately $3.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our second quarter results and the continued successful execution of our strategy to become a more consumer-focused company.","I will now discuss the key drivers of our second quarter results in greater detail. Beginning with our Government business, we delivered another solid quarter, continuing our positive momentum from the first quarter of 2017. From a membership perspective, we grew by 23,000 Medicare members in the quarter including growth of 10,000 in individual Medicare Advantage. Medicaid membership declined by approximately 250,000 members in the quarter, related to our exit of the Missouri Medicaid contract. This membership decline was in line with our previous projection for the period. We grew our second quarter 2017 Government premiums, which represent over half of our total Health Care premiums, to $7 billion, an increase of nearly 6% compared to the prior-year period.","Medicare premiums grew 8% in the quarter, driving by growth in individual MA premiums of nearly 15%. Medicaid premiums were stable year-over-year despite the exit of our Missouri Medicaid contract during the quarter. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.3%, a continuation of the strong results we achieved in this business during the first quarter as strong underwriting results largely offset the impact of the 2017 suspension of the health insurer fee.","Shifting to our Commercial business, which also had a very strong second quarter from an operating margin perspective. Insured Commercial membership in the quarter was most influenced by our continued repositioning in Small Group ACA related products which drove reduced Small Group Insured membership. From a year-over-year perspective, total Commercial premiums were lower, largely the result of our reduced ACA-compliant individual and Small Group exposure, and the suspension of the health insurer fee, partially offset by higher premium yields. However, our Large Group Commercial premiums were modestly higher as compared to the second quarter of 2016 despite the impact of the suspension of the health insurer fee.","Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 78.6% for the quarter, a very good result and a 480 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2016 despite the negative influence of the suspension of the health insurer fee. To better understand the year-over-year comparison, let me discuss the drivers of our underwriting results by major market segment. Looking more specifically at our Large Group Commercial products, continuing the momentum from the first quarter, we delivered another strong quarter of underwriting results. Our second quarter results reflect continued pricing discipline and moderate medical cost trends. Based on our first half 2017 results, we now project that our 2017 non-ACA core Commercial medical cost trends will be approximately 6% which is an improvement over our previous projection of 6% to 7%.","We also had a strong quarter of underwriting results in our Small Group Commercial products, as we continue to have success in repositioning these products to improve their profitability. Our second quarter Small Group Commercial results were also influenced by our updated estimate of ACA-related risk adjustment payables for 2016 based on CMS data received in the quarter.","Moving to our individual Commercial products, our second quarter results were impacted by our updated estimate of risk-adjustment payables and reinsurance associated with ACA-related individual Commercial products based on CMS data received in the quarter. Specifically, we now project a payable of $375 million for 2016, associated with our individual Commercial products. Lower than our previous estimates but still a significant payable. In total, our updated estimate of 2016 ACA-related risk adjustment payables and reinsurance for both our individual and Small Group Commercial products reduced our second quarter total Commercial medical benefit ratio by approximately 310 basis points.","Shifting to our fee-based group Commercial business. We grew Commercial ASC membership by 24,000 members in the second quarter. We now serve nearly 430,000 additional commercial ASC members as compared to the same period last year. From a profitability perspective, our group Commercial fee-based business had another solid quarter exceeding our previous expectations.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 37.3%. Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with approximately $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $607 million. We repaid $250 million in debt in the quarter. We paid a shareholder dividend of $166 million, and after other sources and uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $200 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was approximately 332.1 million at June 30.","As a result of our first half 2017 performance we are increasing our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $9.45 to $9.55 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a $0.60 increase relative to our previous projection of $8.80 to $9.00. Our increased adjusted EPS outlook reflects our favorable second quarter results, including the effect of core business outperformance, favorable prior year's reserve development and the other items related to 2016 dates of service discussed today.","Also incorporated in our increased outlook is continued investment spending to accelerate a number of our growth initiatives. Specifically, we now plan to make additional investments in 2017 to position Aetna for faster Medicare geographic expansion in 2019 as well as solidifying our Medicare Advantage administrative infrastructure to support our expected future growth. Included in our updated projections are also additional investments related to our brand campaign and targeted technology-related investments.","Certain risks remain that temper our outlook for the remainder of the year including the ever-present concern that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected and the potential for higher utilization in our individual Commercial products during the second half of 2017 due to our product exit strategy or other factors. Our updated 2017 projections are influenced by the following additional drivers. We expect our full year 2017 adjusted revenue to be approximately $61 billion, consistent with our previous projection. We now project that our full year total Health Care medical benefit ratio will be in the range of 82.5% to 83%. This improved outlook is driven by continued moderate medical costs and our latest estimates of 2016 ACA-related risk adjustment and reinsurance programs.","We now project that our adjusted expense ratio will be within a range of 17.3% to 17.5% for the full year. This increase is driven primarily by accelerated investments in targeted growth initiatives discussed on today's call. We now project our adjusted pre-tax margin to be approximately 8.5%, consistent with our high single digit target. Based on our year-to-date results, we now project our full year tax rate to be approximately 35%. We now project adjusted earnings will be nearly $3.2 billion and full year excess cash available at the parent to be at least $4 billion. Finally, we expect our 2017 weighted average share count to be in the range of 334 million to 335 million shares, consistent with our previous projections.","In closing, we are encouraged by the strength of our first half performance and our improved 2017 outlook. These strong results support our confidence in Aetna's long-term trajectory and growth prospects.","I will now turn the call back over to Joe. Joe?","Joseph Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question is from A.J. Rice of UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Hello, everybody. Maybe just to focus on the Medicare Advantage. Thanks for laying out some of your thinking there. I wonder, you had a couple of buckets. You've got the underlying growth in the individual market. You've got your favorable Star Ratings. And this year is allowing you to grow faster than that underlying growth rate. We can decide whether that happens next year or not. But you've got two other buckets that you guys are highlighting: the group MA business where a lot of those contracts are very close to being done, I would think at this point for January 1 starts, and then you've got your geographic expansion. Is there any way, setting aside the underlying individual market growth and share relative to that, that we can triangulate a little bit what the geographic expansion and the group MA might mean for your growth outlook in MA next year?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","A couple of things A.J. First, on the new market growth we have, in this last year, saw a third of our overall growth come from new markets. So that's one way to think about it. And we are expanding from 56% to about 60% as we finalize our participation for 2018 with CMS. The second part on the group is the pipeline is still robust and the pipeline isn't just big jumbo accounts. So there are more accounts to come. And maybe, Karen, you could comment on that.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. So A.J., we're very pleased with some very early wins that we've had on group Medicare Advantage. We had one large win that we spoke of then we've had a number of smaller wins to date. We're actually seeing the result of our strong value proposition in group Medicare. We've seen the Stars performance having a strong benefit. We've seen activity relative to our care management and quality outcomes as a key competitive advantage for us. And also, kind of what we're also seeing is our demonstrated track record of implementations and also we delivered a proprietary retiree exchange. So all that combined has benefited us from a strong group MA. So we're looking forward to seeing positive results in group MA in next year.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. Just wanted to ask a little bit about the guidance. You guys obviously beat by a lot more than what you're raising the guidance for. I understand the investments that you're talking about, but I want to get a little bit more color, when you think about making these investments, what kind of return could we potentially see I guess in 2019 on MA? And then as far as the two risks you highlighted, as far as trend rising or higher utilization on the exchanges, are these new risks or are there elevated potential that these risks play out, or are these just kind of boilerplate answers? I wasn't sure if you were seeing something to say this is a risk I need to highlight today, or whether it's just normal kind of conservatism?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of the investments in the guidance, as you mentioned, what we're doing is putting in place a lot of the things that we would need to drive the geographic expansion in 2019, and a number of other things around improving the overall member experience. And so I think these are the kinds of investments that we're going to need to make to be able to deliver on our mid double digit Medicare growth. And so I would expect that is what we're positioning for, for both 2018 and 2019. I'll let Mark talk a little bit about the risks. But I would tell you they're certainly not new risks in concept, but certainly on the individual market there continues to be a lot going on.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","One more comment on the Medicare Advantage investments. Karen mentioned bswift, which is our new platform. We launched that in 1\/1\/2017 for the Group business. We're launching it 1\/1\/2018 for group to individual conversion. And that engine is a really powerful tool for working in the Medicare Advantage market. So our investments are aimed at staying ahead of the competition and offering more capability.","In 2018 we will also offer a portable product across our current network as we get ready to understand how much of that we can do when we get to more markets by 2020. On the fourth quarter, I would say the largest issue here is uncertainty, and uncertainty on two sides. The plans, as you well know, are trying to figure out whether or not the CSR is going be covered and whether or not the legislature will step up to their responsibilities to the American people.","I think on the other side, you have individuals who are sitting there with coverage not knowing whether they'll have it next year. And for those individuals, a run on the bank is more likely the longer the uncertainty continues into the fourth quarter. And I think that is a dangerous precedent that we need to pay attention to.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah, and I just would add just Kevin, I mean, we were a little bit worried about this at the end of last year. We made provision for it and indeed we did see an uptick. And so to Mark's point, there's certainly, in some ways, even heightened characteristics that exist in the market today that could drive that.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Given the strength of the business specifically on the margins, Shawn, I know you've historically said this business is experience rated and thus, trying to think about how much of the upside from 2017 you retain versus price back. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the jump-off point for 2017 that we should be thinking about for earnings growth into 2018. And then also just any moving parts that you think are worth spiking out like the return of the health insurance fee for instance and how we should think about that. Thanks.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. So let me sort of frame potentially a jump-off. If you thought about where our guidance is now at around $9.50 and you think about how we position this, clearly, we had about $0.45 of a good guy that goes back to 2016 related to these ACA updates. We're north of $0.50 probably on PYD, and you know our convention is to start without that. So those would be the two big reset items. Clearly, as we look forward, there will be opportunity to continue to improve the results as a result of reducing our losses on individual that we've talked about. But I do think you did hit on a good point; when you have underwriting results that are this good, certainly in our Group M&A business and in our Large Group Commercial business, there will be experience rating pressure as part of that.","It's a little too soon for me to make a call on how much, but, clearly, that will be one of the pressure points that'll offset some of those things. The health insurer fee, I'm also glad you raised that, because we in essence are reliving 2014 by reintroducing the health insurer fee back into pricing. And, again, while it's our intention to recover 100% of that, that is a lot of expense that we have to sort of push into the pricing equation, and I do think it is one of the risk factors for 2018 as well.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. A follow-up on that last one. When you talk about kind of pushing the price or pushing the HIF back into pricing, it sounds like, Shawn, you were inferring that you might not get all of that in in, say, the non-Medicare book of business when you try to price that through.","I'd love for you to expand on that, if you would. And then, if you could also \u2013 as it relates to your strategy in 2017 of kind of embedding the HIF or deploying the HIF into Medicare benefits, is it possible to size how much of that you need to then protect, for lack of a better word, for margin in 2018?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. So I want to be clear. It is always our intention to fully recover the health insurer fee. We largely did that in 2014, but it is a significant pricing item that adds to the cost of our products, and that just does inherently give you a little less pricing flexibility when you go into renewing this. So if you harken back to 2014, that was a year where I think commercial, we largely got it in, but it took a lot of work to do that. And that's what our positioning is for 2018.","In terms of benefit design, you're right. Given where we were, from a margin perspective, we, in essence, used the HIF suspension to generally enrich benefits in Medicare. As we look to 2018, I would not assume that all those are going to reverse. We go through the process every year of thinking about all the different levers that we have at our disposable to maintain the most attractive product offering we have that's consistent with our margin targets. And so we've largely done that again this year and feel good about the product that we're going to put on the street for 2018.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Morning. Just wanted to go back to the investment and particularly in M&A and geographic expansion. You talked about 56% going to 60% in 2018. And I think the longer-term goal was closer to 75%. So just hoping you could sort of help us frame what the opportunity is in terms of that penetration number for 2019 given these investments. Thanks.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","So two aspects, Ralph. One is we expect to get into the 80%s by 2020 with our market expansion. That is a footprint that when we look at the diminishing marginal returns of adding more markets and being able to support those markets, starts to fray at the edges, so we see something in the low-80%s as the kind of market penetration we'd like to have.","With that then, we get the national portability opportunity, which we will test with our portable product again this year, or in 1\/1\/2018 as we start off. And, again, this goes all after that 70% of the Medicare population, retired population, that does not select Medicare Advantage every year as a way to further penetrate that book and to get people interested in what we have to offer in that product.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","And, Ralph, this is a multi-step process. But two of the bigger steps, obviously, are the work that we have to do to put together a high quality provider network, but then we also need to work through CMS to get all of that approved and on a timely basis. So it is a process that needs a fair amount of lead time to execute on.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could run through June enrollment numbers for individual and Small Group, both compliant and noncompliant for numbers there? And then on the Small Group side, it's been a while since we talked about compliant, noncompliant margins and just wanted an update there.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","On Individual, we ended the quarter with about 240,000 members. That's about 180,000 that are on Exchange and about 60,000 that are off Exchange. All of those members in essence are ACA compliance. I can try to dig up the Small Group membership here. I don't have it right off the top of my head.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","So I do, Shawn. Small Group membership, at the end of the quarter, just to give you a sense, in our 2-50 it's a little over 600,000. In our ACA and pre-ACA business, it's roughly about the same. And then our 51-100, it's about 300,000.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And anything notable on Small Group margins? I know the White House pushed off again until 2019 when noncompliant business has to move. Anything notable in terms of margins, or just what Small Group employees are doing? Are they just sitting and waiting at this point? Attrition has slowed?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Relative to Small Group, the way I would think about the Small Group employers, and we have had a strategy relative to addressing the complexities of the Small Group market. And I think you know we've been really pushing at a self-insured AFA product, which we have seen very good success in in the quarter.","We probably have the most unique product out there in the Small Group market where we took bswift. We have simplified products, and from an employer and their employees' perspective, they have a seamless, paperless process in which to enroll in. So as you think about it, that gives the Small Group employers simplified products as well as some financial stability for us, and it addresses what I would say the volatility in the ACA.","I would tell you that we continue to reduce our overall exposure in the ACA Small Group. So you'll see continued reduction in our ACA Small Group book.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","And Gary, so I would add that the improvement in the overall Small Group margins is one of the elements that has contributed to year-over-year performance as a result of some of the product repositioning that Karen is talking about.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Lance Wilkes of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Just wanted to talk a little bit about Medicaid and ask how we should think about confidence in future growth there? What the pipeline is looking like? And in particular, the types of products that are in that pipeline? And then also, where Medicaid might rank among your M&A priorities?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Relative to Medicaid, I would say we see a very robust pipeline. We're actually monitoring RFPs in over 20 states, and if you think about those RFPs, over half of those would represent new footprint expansion opportunities for us. And the remainder would be expansion of programs with current states as well as re-bid opportunities. And what you're seeing for potential opportunities like North Carolina, which is a brand new managed Medicaid state \u2013 so that would present a new opportunity for us, and there are a number of other kinds of products like that. We are seeing an increase in LTFS capabilities as well.","So we've been talking to the states. As you know, this is their number one challenge and issue in reducing their overall cost in Medicaid, and I think what we are seeing with our conversations is that our value proposition, our unique care model is resonating quite well with them.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","And from an M&A perspective, Lance, we always look across the entire field. We've said in the past that horizontal M&A will probably be much more challenging right now. And Medicaid in particular, I think presents some unique challenges. I think from a capability standpoint, once we have these contracts, especially around care management, we have outstanding capabilities. So a lot of this has to do with are you just buying a portfolio of contracts or are you buying a capability? Or are you more likely to win that next RFP by doing M&A? So we always remain open minded. We look at everything but I do think there are some unique challenges in the Medicaid space.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead. Ms. Arnold, your line is live.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Sorry. I was muted. You highlighted some of the issues with the HIF and other things in 2018. Could you please kind of highlight the pluses and minuses in addition to the HIF that you're seeing next year and the ever-present opportunity for costs to accelerate? And trends seem to be really moderate this quarter. Where were they particularly muted?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","So, yeah, trend has remained very stable. In particular, where I would say that we've seen outperformance versus our expectation has actually been in non-specialty pharma. It's really somewhat across the board but higher generic utilization. Some of that is things we've done with some of our product design at the small end of the market. But some of it also appears to be fee market based. So I would say the only one where I would say fundamentally it's looked different has been pharmacy. Obviously, the improvements that we're seeing against expectations at this point in the year are generally utilization driven. So if we looked at things like outpatient, it's probably a little bit lower in the range that we've previously talked about but still in the range.","So, but non-specialty pharma. Now, I would contrast that by no means should anybody think that's specialty pharma. It's still not a major trend issue because indeed it does continue to be one. I want to be clear that we don't have any intention of providing 2018 guidance today. But as I mentioned, we talked about some of the 2016 updates in prior-year development. The experience rating and the health insurer fee are some of the challenges. Clearly, the opportunities are generally around reducing the individual loss; Medicare growth we talked about and things like that. So I think we've canvassed sort of the big moving pieces at this point but again, as we get closer to 2018 and we finalize our operating plan, we'll be in position to provide actual guidance.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","And as we accelerate investments, we expect that we should get some earlier returns than otherwise anticipated.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then what are you expecting for individual losses and how much could they go down?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Well, if I exclude the prior year true ups, we would still probably be \u2013 not probably, we still are projecting north of $200 million, probably closer to $250 million of pre-tax loss this year. This is basically in the same neighborhood that we were at the end of Q1. And so our goal is always to make all of that go away. But as we've talked about with various elements of fixed expense, it takes a degree of work to make that happen and those are the kinds of things that we're working in earnest on right now to try to deliver that.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets","Yes. Maybe I could ask on 2018, not guidance, but if you can just talk on, one, is the pricing that you're doing on the fully insured side, is that lower if you exclude the health insurer fee, at least just relative to 2017? And then maybe also if you could address, I know you talked about the Group MA business, but what about national accounts? And how you're doing, number one? And number two, what sort of differences versus prior years they're looking for in benefit changes?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Let's do the second one first. I'll let Karen talk about it again. I want to make sure, Matt and for everybody else, a lot of times we talk about national accounts as a proxy for Large Group ASC.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets","Yeah.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","And there's obviously some other major market segments that are in there that Karen will talk about.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","So Matthew, so couple things on national accounts. We're still in the season. Even last week, we were still competing for business and doing finalist presentations, so it's a little bit later cycle this year. But just to give you insight into \u2013 obviously, the customers are continuing to look for improvement in their overall productivity of their workforce, lower cost. We're seeing benefit buy-downs, those kinds of things, in the fully insured market in the higher end of middle market.","Relative to what we've seen in our national book, unfortunately, we're at the other end of M&A activity, so we did lose some accounts due to M&A, although I will tell you, on the sales side, as we've been investing in kind of our overall value proposition, we have more new sales logos in our national accounts this year than we did last year. But we did see some movement of one of our large accounts to a private exchange.","I would tell you at the \u2013 beyond national accounts, I think we have to look at our Large Group business. We are seeing very good performance in our public and labor vertical segment. We have seen strong performance this year. We expect to see strong performance in that segment next year as well, and I think that will carry us forward. And if you also think about kind of ASC membership, we are seeing a very strong reception to our Small Group ASC business. So overall, we're looking positive on ASC membership at this point. But having said that, we're still in the midst of the selling season and I'll have a better view for you in the third quarter of this year.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","And on your first one, Matt, I'm not sure if I'm going to answer your question correctly because I may not understand it, but in our forward pricing, we are maintaining the same discipline that we always have. We will forward price assuming that trend goes up as we have been the last few years. We will forward price trying to maintain margin and get growth on the top line. It's just a natural outgrowth of the experience rating process so that when you outperform, you can't always retain all of that margin and I expect we'll have some of that pressure in Large Group. It's a little bit too early, again, to sort of make a call on where that's going, but I would say that our forward pricing posture has not changed.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets","All right. Thank you both for all that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Scott Fidel of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. I just had a question, if you can give us an update on how the Group insurance underwriting trends performed in the quarter and how you're thinking about updated earnings for that segment for the year relative to your prior view.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","So relative to the Group insurance trends, we're in line with our overall expectations relative to long-term disability. We have seen lower terminations, lower reopens, although I would tell you our Life business has been volatile and remain volatile. I would say that what we said last quarter in guiding you down on a year-over-year basis as a result of a large loss in one customer is still in line, so we expect those results to be in line with what we've already previously told you.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Just looking at the $0.45 or 310 basis points of improvement that you got \u2013 the guide for 2016, theoretically, that should have informed how you're reserving for 2017 on those books of business as well, yet you're still talking about losing a similar amount of money in the individual business. So does that mean that the individual has otherwise deteriorated during the quarter? And then second to that question, how much of that $0.45 would you say is attributable to the Small Group business, which is sort of an ongoing business as opposed to the individual ACA business, which you're getting out of?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. So maybe the second one first. That's probably about $0.12 plus or minus attributable. That is the Small Group. It's in the neighborhood of $65 million pre-tax or thereabouts. Your point on 2016 to 2017 is correct sort of in a literal sense in that it informed us. But really, the change in population is so dramatic from 2016 to 2017, you really can't simply extrapolate that. And so we do have a bit different outlook where every year before this, we've been in a significant payable position. Our current forecasts say we probably won't be in that big a payable position and that's consistent with our outlook. So I would say on the margin it got better but we're more or less in the same spot when you look at all of the moving pieces. But again, the big thing here is you can't really go from a million-member book to a 240,000-member book that's concentrated differently and just extrapolate that.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you very much. And if I could follow up with just one question on PBM, any changes to your Medicare PBM near network for next year?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","No.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","No","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","No.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Chris Rigg of Scotiabank (sic) [Deutsche Bank]. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Deutsche Bank, but nonetheless, was hoping to ask just one big picture question on Medicare Advantage. Obviously, Aetna's growth aspirations there are not dissimilar to many others in the industry. Do you at all see any reason for concern about industry-wide margins or do you think most participants will remain rational in their margin expectations over the next year or so? Thanks.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. We have 11,000 people retiring every day. That's four million people a year. We're only getting 30% of them for Medicare Advantage. So that leaves another 2.8 million people of opportunity that the industry hasn't figured out how to crack and I think that level of focus, a focus on getting into the home, improving the quality of care and life for the individual through social determinates will generate more than enough business for the industry to have an opportunity to make this work.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah and I, often when this question is posed, it's posed as if this is some new phenomena and I think the competition for growth in this space has been certainly present for a number of years. And I would say I have not certainly witnessed anything that makes me think that people are doing anything irresponsible from a margin perspective; on the contrary. So I do think that we can achieve this growth profile and maintain our margins.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","The great thing about the product is everybody has to buy it in one way, shape or form from the standpoint of a retiree. So I think that sets a market that continues to grow and provides a lot of opportunity.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","Joseph Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Chris. A transcript of the prepared remarks for this call will be posted shortly on the Investor Information section of Aetna.com where you can also find a copy of our updated guidance summary containing details of our guidance metrics including those that were unchanged or not discussed on this call.

At this time I will like to welcome everyone to the Aetna Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Vice-President of Investor Relations. Mr. Krocheski, you may begin.","Joseph Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.","Good morning. And thank you for joining Aetna's Fourth Quarter 2016 earnings call and webcast. This is Joe Krocheski, Vice-President of Investor Relations for Aetna, and with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Bertolini, and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks we will answer your questions. Karen Lynch, Aetna's President, will also join us for the Q&A session. As a reminder, during this call we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from current projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports that we file with the SEC. We have also provided reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures in our press release and guidance summary.","Further, to assist investors in understanding our initial 2017 guidance, we have prepared a short presentation with additional details on our outlook and related reconciliations. The reconciliations and presentation are available on the Investor Information section of Aetna.com. Finally, as you know our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in nonpublic forums is limited so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you, Joe, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning Aetna reported fourth quarter operating EPS of $1.63, a 19% increase over fourth quarter of 2015. Out-performance in all of our major products more than offset ongoing losses in our Individual Commercial ACA-compliant products, which were $100 million worse than we had previously projected. Our strong fourth quarter result brings full-year 2016 operating EPS to $8.23, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. Underlying these full-year results, we ended the year with 23.1 million medical members, consistent with year-end membership projections. We grew operating revenue by nearly 5% to $63 billion, we delivered strong operating results from our Government business, we drove continued operating efficiencies as evidenced by our 18.1% adjusted operating expense ratio, we achieved a high single-digit pre-tax operating margin consistent with our long-term target, and we generated strong cash flow in 2016, putting us in a strong capital position as we enter 2017. Based on the strong finish to 2016, this morning we provided an initial 2017 operating EPS projection of at least $8.55 per share. Consistent with past practice, this projection excludes the impact to prior year's reserve development.","In a few moments, Shawn will discuss 2016 results and 2017 guidance in greater detail. But first I would like to provide some brief comments on last week's U.S. District Court ruling enjoining our pending acquisition of Humana and then discuss some of the operational highlights for the year.","Beginning with the Court ruling, we are disappointed in the Court's decision as we believe we put forward a compelling case that addressed each of the Department of Justice's concerns. We continue to believe this transformative combination will result in a broader choice of products, access to higher quality and more affordable care, and a better overall experience for consumers. Given the clear benefits of combining these two great companies, we are conducting a thorough review of the Court's opinion and considering our options for responding to this ruling, including an appeal. We expect to complete our review prior to the end date of our merger agreement, and we'll communicate our decision at the appropriate time. Let me be clear: Our commitment to our strategy has never been stronger. Humana offers one way to accelerate that strategy.","We are continuing to make investments in digital tools and differentiated care models to provide our members with access to simple, high-quality affordable products that help them achieve their best health. These investments position Aetna to continue to be part of the solution in an evolving healthcare landscape. Regardless of the Court's decision, we intend to maintain focus on delivering strong operating results and providing the same high-quality products and services that our members have come to expect from Aetna. We remain convinced of the strength of Aetna's positioning and growth trajectory as a standalone company.","Moving on to 2016 operational highlights, our Medicare business continues to be a meaningful source of growth for Aetna and performed very well in 2016. During the year, we grew medical membership by nearly 13% including nearly 9% in Medicare Advantage and 21% in Medicare Supplement, drove year-over-year premium growth of 15%, produced solid operating margins consistent with our targeted range, and increased the percent of members in 4-star or better plans to an industry-leading 93% based on first quarter 2017 membership projections. Additionally, we had another strong Medicare Advantage annual election period and project that we will grow our total Medicare medical membership by 120,000 in the first quarter of 2017, including 12% growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership.","Further, we are encouraged by a strong Group Medicare Advantage pipeline and the prospect for solid growth in 2018.","Our continued above-average growth directly speaks to the importance of our top-tier star ratings and our focus on creating more healthy days for our members. One way we measure our success is by how well we are able to keep our members out of the hospital and in their homes and communities. For example, in 2016, we reduced total acute admissions by approximately 4%, and we deployed predictive modeling to target members at the greatest risk of readmission. With the use of multidisciplinary care teams to engage facilities to develop appropriate and effective discharge plans, we achieved a 27% reduction in readmission rates. Collectively, these clinical programs have driven a best-in-class Stars readmission rate among national competitors.","Continuing with our Government business, from a financial performance perspective, our Medicaid business performed well in 2016. For the full year, we served 174,000 new members. We grew our full-year revenue by 13% compared to 2015, and we achieved strong pre-tax operating margins for the year despite the headwind from the rate reset in Kentucky. While pleased with our Medicaid financial performance in 2016, we are disappointed by our 2016 Medicaid procurement efforts. Despite the headwind this presents for 2017, we are encouraged by our successes in Nevada and Virginia and view our number one and number two rankings respectively in those procurement efforts as validation of our capabilities and revamped RFP process. Our strong showing in those states gives us confidence that Aetna could continue to grow in Medicaid beyond 2017 with our proven track record of successfully managing Medicaid populations for our state partners and a solid pipeline of opportunities across existing and de novo states.","Shifting to our Commercial business, our Large Group Commercial products performed well in 2016 achieving bottom line results that exceeded our initial expectations. We grew membership modestly in our Large Group Commercial Insured products, and medical cost trends for these products remain moderate and largely consistent with expectations. Our Commercial ASC and fee based businesses also performed well as positive fee yields and a focus on cost control produced another year of solid results. Moving beyond the financial accomplishments of 2016, we successfully advanced our strategy to help transform the healthcare system from volume-based payment models to ones that reward the quality and value provided.","We formed multiple collaborations with healthcare providers that span a wide spectrum of value-based care models including two new joint venture relationships. We carried that momentum into 2017 with the announced signing of a new joint venture with Allina Health in Minneapolis. All-in, we made solid progress in 2016 with over 45% of Aetna's medical spend currently running through some form of value-based care model, positioning us to achieve our 2020 goal of 75%.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Shawn, I would like to provide some thoughts on the evolving policy landscape. In spite of the best intentions of Washington and industry, the intended goals of the ACA have not been achieved. Millions of Americans remain uninsured and still lack access to affordable healthcare. Companies that have offered public exchange products, including Aetna and other for-profit and nonprofit companies, have collectively lost billions of dollars. These losses have forced most insurers to either scale back their participation or exit completely and in some cases even shut down, as is the case with the vast majority of the Co-Ops. The result is higher costs and more limited access for consumers.","As the public exchanges enter their fourth year, it is clear that in the absence of a significant shift in regulatory policy, the risk pools for the ACA-compliant Individual Commercial products will continue to deteriorate. However, we remain optimistic that the next wave of healthcare reform will focus on affordability, quality, and addressing the needs of the millions of Americans who remain uninsured or lack access to affordable healthcare. To that end, we continue to actively engage in constructive dialogue with lawmakers and regulators and are committed to working towards preserving the positive aspects of the ACA and developing consumer-based approaches that deliver access to affordable quality healthcare to all Americans.","In summary, I am pleased with our 2016 results, which exceeded our previous projections. I have a great deal of confidence in Aetna's future, including our long-term prospects for growth. Specifically, I am confident we have the right strategy to deliver long-term value to the people we serve and our shareholders, the right leadership to execute on our strategy, and the financial strength to deliver long-term growth. I want to thank all of our employees for their dedication to meeting the needs of the people we serve and delivering another strong quarter and year for Aetna and our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Shawn who will provide additional insight into our 2016 results and our 2017 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported full-year 2016 operating earnings of $2.9 billion, a 7% increase over 2015 and operating earnings per share of $8.23. Aetna's operating results represent solid earnings per share growth despite the lack of any share repurchases in the year and the significant pressure from our ACA-compliant products, continue to be supported by solid top line growth and operating margins, and are consistent with our long-term growth framework.","I'll begin with some comments on our full-year 2016 performance. From a top line perspective, we ended the year with 23.1 million medical members. We grew operating revenue by nearly 5% over 2015 to $63 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business and Large Group Commercial Insured products, partially offset by membership attrition in our Small Group and international Commercial Insured products. From an operating margin perspective, our portfolio of businesses performed quite well.","Our full-year pre-tax operating margin was 8.3%, a very strong result and consistent with our target operating margin range. Our full-year Total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio was 81.8%, a better result than our previous projection. Our full-year adjusted operating expense ratio was 18.1%, an 80 basis point improvement over 2015. This year-over-year improvement speaks to our disciplined focus on managing our operating costs as we continue to grow our top line.","Looking at our fourth quarter results, operating revenue of $15.7 billion was steady versus the third quarter. Our pre-tax operating margin was 6.4% for the quarter, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Our Total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio was 82.1%, a 20 basis point increase year-over-year. This result was better than our previous projections as medical cost trend remained moderate in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our adjusted operating expense ratio was 19.8%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 and consistent with our previous projections.","From a balance sheet perspective we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products primarily attributable to third quarter dates of service. Days claims payable were 54 days at the end of the quarter, slightly down from the prior year quarter. Sequentially, this metric decreased three days, driven by the decreased claim processing times and the reduction of the premium deficiency reserve.","Turning to cash flow and capital, operating cash flows remained strong. Our full-year Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.4 times operating earnings and 1.8 times GAAP net income. We did not repurchase shares during 2016 as a result of the pending Humana acquisition. We did, however, distribute $88 million during the fourth quarter through our quarterly shareholder dividend, bringing our full-year distribution to $351 million.","In summary, we are quite pleased with the strength of our full-year results, as core operations were able to more than offset the drag from ACA-compliant products. I will now discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter performance in greater detail.","Beginning with our Commercial fee based business, where our fourth quarter results capped off another strong year. We grew by 68,000 ASC members in the quarter, achieved positive fee yields, and generated solid year-over-year operating earnings growth. In our Commercial Insured business, our membership declined by roughly 139,000 members in the quarter, directionally consistent with our expectations. This change is the result of attrition in our Individual and Small Group membership, partially offset by growth of nearly 50,000 Large Group Commercial Insured members. Our Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio was 83% for the quarter, a result that was better than our previous projections. Underlying this result in the quarter was continued moderate medical cost trend in our core Large Group products and some improvement relative to our previous projections in our Small Group insured products.","Consistent with our fourth quarter MBR performance, we estimate that our full-year 2016 non-ACA Core Commercial medical cost trend was at the low end of our guidance range of 6% to 7%. Partially offsetting the fourth quarter out-performance in our group Commercial Insured business was the continued pressure in our Individual Commercial ACA-compliant products. Underlying medical costs and estimates of 3R reimbursements drove continued losses in the quarter pushing full-year pre-tax operating losses in our Individual ACA-compliant products to $450 million.","As you are aware, we have made changes to our footprint to reduce our risk exposure to these products for 2017. Based on our current view of open enrollment, we project our first quarter Individual Commercial membership will decline from approximately 965,000 members at year-end 2016 to 240,000 made up of mostly on-exchange members. Consistent with past years, there was a fair amount of churn in this product, resulting in approximately 50% of our Individual Commercial membership being new to Aetna. Given the high churn in membership combined with our fourth quarter experience and fixed cost deleveraging as we shrink our membership, we project losses on our Individual Commercial ACA-compliant products in 2017. However, we expect these losses to be meaningfully lower in 2017 as compared to 2016.","Shifting to our Government business, which had yet another strong quarter, we grew medical membership by 60,000 members in the quarter including growth of 16,000 Medicare members and 44,000 Medicaid members. As a result of strong medical membership growth throughout the year, we grew our fourth quarter 2016 government premiums by nearly 13% compared to the prior year period to $6.5 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total health care premiums. Our fourth quarter Government Medical Benefit Ratio was 81.2%, a very strong result driven by year-over-year improvement in Medicare.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our financial position, capital structure, and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At December 31st, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 53.6%, which reflects the debt financing that we completed in June to fund the pending Humana acquisition. Looking at sources and uses of cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion, excluding funds raised from our June debt financing. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $317 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $88 million, and after other sources and uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash at the parent. Including the funds from the June debt financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $15.1 billion. Our basic share count was approximately 352 million at December 31st.","Shifting to 2017, this morning we provided an initial standalone 2017 operating EPS projection of at least $8.55. This guidance excludes the impact of prior year's reserve development. While we are still considering our options in an effort to provide as much transparency as possible, this guidance presents a standalone scenario assuming there is no Humana transaction. Our baseline view of Aetna's 2016 operating EPS of $7.77 reflects our 2016 operating EPS of $8.23 less 2016's prior year's reserve development of approximately $0.46. Our initial 2017 operating earnings projection of at least $8.55 represents at least 10% growth over this baseline view.","While there are many puts and takes in our initial outlook, our projected 2017 operating EPS growth off of our 2016 baseline reflects growth in Commercial Insured operating earnings led by a reduced level of losses on our Individual products, suspension of the health insurer fee, continued Medicare top line growth powered by continued strong growth in Individual MA, and the resumption of share repurchase activity. Partially offsetting these dynamics are a number of challenges in 2017 including the projected impact of the previously disclosed Medicaid contract losses and lower projected Group Insurance operating earnings.","Our 2017 operating EPS guidance is further influenced by the following drivers: We projected our first quarter 2017 membership will be in the range of 22.2 to 22.3 million medical members. This projection includes continued growth in our Medicare products of approximately 120,000 members and Commercial ASC membership growth of between 75,000 and 100,000 members more than offset by Individual Commercial declines of approximately 725,000 members related to previously disclosed changes to our footprint, Medicaid membership declines of approximately 150,000 members primarily associated with our exit of the Nebraska contract, Small Group Commercial Insured declines of approximately 125,000 members reflecting our continued repositioning in these products. We project 2017 operating revenue to be in the range of $60 billion to $61 billion. This top line projection reflects our previously discussed ACA-compliant product decisions, the net impact of the previously disclosed Medicaid contract losses, and the suspension of the health insurer fee, partially offset by growth in our Government business, primarily Medicare products and higher premiums in our Large Group Commercial Insured products.","We project our 2017 non-ACA Core Commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 6% to 7%, an approximately 50 basis point increase over 2016 at the midpoint of this range. This projection reflects an increase in health care utilization, partially offset by one less calendar day. We project our full-year Total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio will be in the range of 84% to 85%, representing a 270 basis point increase at the midpoint of the range. This projected increase is driven primarily by the suspension of the health insurer fee, the exclusion of prior year's reserve development from our initial guidance, and experience rating pressure in our Group Commercial and Group Medicare Advantage products, partially offset by projected improvement in our Individual Commercial Insured products.","Our current view is that our full-year adjusted operating expense ratio will be 16.5% plus or minus 25 basis points, a 160 basis point improvement at the midpoint over 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of the 2017 suspension of the health insurer fee. Absent this impact, at the midpoint of this range, our operating expense ratio is projected to be essentially flat year-over-year, an excellent result given the previously disclosed revenue headwinds. We project our pre-tax operating margin to be approximately 8%, consistent with our high single-digit target with operating earnings of at least $2.9 billion. We project that net subsidiary dividends for the year will be approximately $2.9 billion. We project excess cash at the parent of approximately $4 billion after funding all Humana and Molina transaction-related fees and expenses.","In closing, I am very pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results which exceeded our projections despite the challenges we experienced in our ACA-compliant products. As we begin 2017, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remain strong and we are confident that we can achieve our initial standalone 2017 operating EPS projection of at least $8.55.","I will now turn the call back over to Joe. Joe?","Joseph Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just want to drill into a little bit more the capital deployment expectation for 2017, I understand you're including share buybacks and I see share count down, just under 11 million shares, but when I think about your debt-to-cap and the $4 billion of total parent cash, it seems like a relatively modest amount of buybacks just relative to where you are and the fact that you haven't really bought back stock in almost two years. So, is there an intentional \u2013 are you intentionally leaving a little bit of wiggle room in terms of potential M&A and I understand you've got breakup fee to pay, et cetera, in the standalone case, but I'm just curious, any updated thoughts sort of in a standalone post-Humana world for capital deployment?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. So, Josh, a couple things. As you think about capital deployment, there's \u2013 in addition to share repurchase, there's one other thing that you need to think about that we have assumed here, and that is $2.7 billion of the deal debt is non-callable. So at some point, that will come back above the line, if you will, and we will have to bear the interest expense on that debt above the line. That's worth a little bit more than sort of a $0.10 item. But going back to the main thrust of your question, what I would say is we have largely assumed the $4 billion for the purpose of this guidance does go into repurchase. But the one area where we still have some uncertainty as we work through our final decision-making is the timing of that and the application of that throughout the year. So for this guidance we have assumed I think cautiously that that's more back-end weighted than it ultimately could turn out to be. But I think given where we are in the process, that's the prudent decision right now.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, Shawn, just to follow up, $4 billion based on your current stock price would be with the understanding that even if you buy back late in the year, the 11 million, even if that doubles, it seems like, again, a real conservative assumption. So, I guess the question would be, would you be more aggressive and then have you guys thought about an accelerated buyback when you make your decision in the next couple weeks here?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah, so what this would largely assume is that we would get to a debt-to-cap that would be between 35 and 40 by the end of the year. We may go a little bit higher than that. And certainly something like an ASR is on the table. Again, the timing of when we would pull the trigger on that is something that we're still working through as we work through sort of the final steps in our decision-making process.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So my question is around the go-forward on Humana. I'm just curious, given the length of time this has taken. We're two weeks past the judge's decision. Mark, can you just walk us through the moving parts that we should or the key points that we should be focused on here that will kind of drive your decision either way to appeal or not? And any comments on the potential divestiture package that could be required here, whether it could be above and beyond what you've laid out originally given the judge's opinion would be helpful.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. Justin, I think the way to think about it is that we have a merger agreement that goes till February 15. So we're going to take all of that time to make sure that we have pursued all potential opportunities to either appeal or not, and I think we're in the midst of that evaluation and we'll come to a conclusion before the [February] 15th. That's why we've given the kind of guidance we've given you. But you'll either see an announcement that we've terminated the deal or an extension, and I think we are in no rush given that we're literally two weeks away from having to make that decision to rush past any opportunities that we could consider.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Maybe I could ask you your opinion then, just in terms of the \u2013 the way the case has gone, obviously you're in a position to speak with a more sophisticated view than anybody else right now in terms of how the DOJ is viewing this stuff, and there's all kinds of iterations of where the world could go with or without Aetna and Humana being combined. I'm just curious in terms of the divestiture packages here that are \u2013 and how they were viewed. Is there anything you could tell us in terms of \u2013 is the DOJ just looking beyond now the potential to divest one-off membership in competitive counties and now looking for infrastructure behind that? Is there just a new way that they're looking at it that you think could be helpful for us to think about the go-forward world that we're living in now?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","I think the one thing that we could say about our package and some of the criticisms that are in the opinion by the judge is that the DOJ is looking for sustainable competition. And I think that is their concern: Is there a management team, an infrastructure and an ability to remain in the markets, particularly in a retail product where people have a choice to select their products every year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everybody. I would maybe ask about the Government business a little bit. First on the MA side, you had obviously a strong year, it seems like margin-wise. Are you at sort of your target margin, and is there assumption of margin stability in the 2017 outlook or further improvement there? And maybe any comment on your perception about the underlying market trends both in the Individual and Group business, have you seen a pickup versus what you were saying last year? Maybe I'll stop with that.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","A.J., from the margin standpoint, we clearly have ended the year probably at the high end of our target margin ranges for both Individual and Group. So I don't view that further margin expansion is part of the future. And as you know, on group MA in particular, that is an experience rated arrangement, and when you have favorable experience as we've had, that actually tends to create some pullback on those margins. So \u2013 but I think the net story is that we are in that range now on Medicare, and margin expansion isn't part of the story.","On the Group MA, again, it \u2013 on the surface, our membership doesn't really tell the story of how strong the pipelines are on that product. I think as people know, we lost our largest Group MA account, and we still got close to breakeven again in terms of membership. And I think that speaks to the underlying strength of the pipeline and the interest in the value add of this product on behalf of employers and governments.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Any comment on the Individual market and the underlying \u2013 is your growth above market you think that you're seeing?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah, A.J., I would say that we're quite pleased with the Individual growth. We believe that as we said earlier we'll be at 12%. We believe that's above market growth. We really are quite pleased with the result. We believe that it's reflective of our Stars performance. We have about a quarter of our membership growth coming from our expansion counties, and then we continue to be competitive in the rest of the counties across the country.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","So, to fuel that growth, A.J., what we need to keep doing is expanding the number of counties that we're in, and depending on where we are with the Humana transaction, which we'll know here soon enough, accelerating our approach to market expansion is going to demonstrate some even further growth for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. I just wanted to ask a question on the Group Commercial \u2013 Group Commercial Insured pricing trends. So, I realize what we look at is not on a same store basis, but if we think about it on a same store basis, you price to a range something above a 6% to 7% trend for 2016. And I assume you're doing about the same for 2017. But if we looked at the pricing, would we see that it's 250 to 300 basis points lower for this year given the health insurer fee suspension?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. I think that you can consider about that, yes.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And just one other question on Individual enrollment. How did the 240,000 compare to what you expected? I know that was something that your guidance was riding on to a certain degree. And related to that, I thought that you were expecting most of the membership would be off-exchange. Did I get that wrong?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","First of all, the membership in the Individual business was in line with our overall expectations. We were expecting that that membership would be primarily on-exchange. If you recall, our off-exchange strategy was to go dormant in a number of states, and that's what we did. So if you think about the 240,000 that we're projecting, think about 190,000 as on-exchange.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. I just want to take a step back and ask about the long-term growth. Because you said a few times that you feel really good about the long-term growth of the company. I think 2017 is kind of an unusual year given all the exchange exits and Medicaid contract losses, and I think that the question that I get most often is kind of how is Aetna positioned to grow over a long period of time. I would just love to kind of hear your broad thoughts about maybe each product, what you see that top line growth opportunity being and any color you can give there about long-term growth rate?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Okay, Kevin. Thanks, Mark. We first of all believe that Medicare and Medicaid will be growth markets for us and continue to be even in spite of our procurement losses in Medicaid, we still have a strong pipeline and have had good growth. And so we think we've got that figured out and worked through, and part of it was related to exchange departicipation.","So, I think we've worked our way through those issues. So, Government, clearly a strong growth market. In the Commercial market, underlying our results, if you pull out what happened with the exchanges we've had strong growth starting up for the first time in quite a while, and particularly around our Small Group AFA or alternative funding arrangement products. And in our Large Group business. So we feel good about the approach to our group market on the Commercial side. More importantly, though, I think as we see the evolution on this next step of health reform, there is an opportunity for a retail market that is much more stable than the ACA has been as a way for us to grow.","And so we are actively engaged in those discussions of understanding how we can preserve the good parts of the ACA but also bring forward ideas around funding mechanisms that stabilize the market for all the people in it and encourage younger people to get in. And more to come on that as we move ahead, but we think that's a strong opportunity and could move retail market in healthcare much faster than even people would assumed would happen with the Cadillac tax.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess maybe also to that context, I think you mentioned Individual MA margins are about where they should be. If you look at the products and kind of say are you basically at target margins, is there room for opportunity in different products, or is there expectation of versus your 2017 guidance expectation for margins \u2013 tend to be up or down from those levels","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","It's a market-by-market approach, Kevin. So in some places we're approaching rebate status in Medicare Advantage Individual. And so in those cases, we have to evaluate how we price moving forward versus other markets where we're not where we need to be and have more opportunity particularly with our Star ratings. So I wouldn't categorize it across the board, but the margins are healthy, and we intend on trying to maintain those but in some markets it would be \u2013 wouldn't be productive for us to continue to push margins up because we'd just be rebating it back.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk, Mark, about providers' willingness to continue to enter into value-based purchasing or other types of more collaborative, strategic arrangements and then numerically looking at guidance around trend from last year to this year, you came in at the \u2013 from this time last year to now, you came in at the low end of your range, and it does appear that the gains that you made were on the price or on the unit cost side. And just wanted to kind of understand what the dynamics were in those areas.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah, we continue to see more opportunities for value-based contracting. I think value-based contracting is going to continue to be encouraged by even the current administration as a way of getting a handle on healthcare costs. We have a healthy pipeline of opportunities. They will not all be joint ventures. I think there are other models emerging. But currently we have 45% of our medical spend in value-based relationships and continue to pursue reaching our 2020 goal of 75%, 80%.","So I think that is the set of numbers that we can rely on to further push down our healthcare costs over time by putting in these value-based relationships which not only work on unit costs but also very much work on providing high-quality care and reducing utilization over the long term as we noted in our readmission rates and in our reduction of in-patient days. So, I think that is a strong opportunity. In our current trends, we still see unit price as being a driver and less about utilization, and we see this year over last year at the mid-range, a 50 basis point increase in trend.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company LLC","Hi there. Shawn, when you went through kind of the pluses and minuses, I think you said \u2013 tell me if I misunderstood \u2013 that you're expecting lower group operating earnings. First of all, did I get that right, and what might be driving that?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah, the comment specifically was lower Group Insurance operating earnings, not Commercial group. I can let Karen comment a little bit about what's going on in that business.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Christine, there's two factors really. One, if you recall two years ago, we announced that we had a large national account loss. This next year is the continuation of one of the products in the Group Insurance line. The second reason is lower net investment income, and if you think about this business, we have long-term duration assets, and as they're maturing, they're coming off the books in a lower interest rate environment, although the interest rate environment is improving, if you think about it seven years ago, it was much higher. So you're just seeing the turn of assets around that driving lower net investment income but those are the two factors.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company LLC","Okay. It looks like you're looking for some pretty meaningful SG&A cuts. Is that permanent, or is that going to represent a headwind to 2018? How do we think about that?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","No, as we have talked about this before, Christine, we've had a pretty concerted effort to sort of drive productivity gain, sustainable productivity gain. So, that's not something where there's anything meaningful in there that's one-time unique to 2017. This is really part of our ongoing approach to the business. And as we saw in 2016 in years where we grow, we usually get some tailwind from all of that productivity work. Obviously in a year where revenue is pressured, you're fighting the deleveraging aspects of that.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. I just had a couple questions on the earnings bridge, I want to make sure I understood it. One of them was around Group Insurance, and I think we just covered that. But is that primarily group disability? Would that be the primary product we're talking about?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Okay. Group disability and life is in the Insurance line but it is relative to the disability business.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, and then on the HHS suspension, Shawn, I just wanted to understand that. I guess if we just look at the MA business alone, we think there's close to $0.60, but we were only estimating perhaps $0.20 with flow through net of your below trend 2017 rate increase from MA. So that $0.10, is that a net number incorporating the rate increase you receive from MA, or how do you get that?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","The simplest way to think about it is that the $0.10 is, quote, the early recovery of the 2018 HIF as we work that into pricing. So that's largely a Commercial concept for 2017 because most of the Government business is on a one-one. So, that's really what that represents.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And in the MA business, there's not an assumption some of that lower G&A would flow through to earnings?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","No. I mean, we have largely in our bids given where our margin profile is, any relief, if you will, from the HIF for 2017 has been largely incorporated into benefit design. I think you probably can see that to some extent in our strong growth in Individual. But it's really not a meaningful margin concept for MA for us.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then last part on the capital deployment, could you just repeat I think what you had said to earlier, but you had said \u2013 I thought I had heard a $4 billion number and I wasn't sure that I heard that right, on the $0.18.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah, so what we said in the prepared remarks is that we anticipate after we settle termination and deal-related expenses that we would have $4 billion of parent cash to deploy. That is inclusive of some non-callable debt that we will bring above the line in that circumstance so there will be some added interest rate expense that comes with that. So, but $4 billion is the gross number","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Shawn, I'm wondering if you can just give us some more details on some of the margin assumptions within Individual and Small Group and sort of the roll forward from 2016 and 2017. So I guess first on Individual, sort of the margin losses basically built into 2016 and then what you're assuming on the lives for 2017 and then similarly on Small Group and within Small Group, it sounds like you ended up doing a little bit better in the fourth quarter on margin, so maybe what Small Group margins ended up being in 2016 and what you're assuming for 2017.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah, so on Individual, obviously we had a very poor margin result in 2016, and we anticipate, as I mentioned, that we'll continue to lose a meaningful amount in 2017 but not as much. One way to think about that is if you looked at our earnings bridge and you thought about the $0.75 that's identified there for core growth and Individual improvement, somewhere in the ballpark of two-thirds of that is probably driven by the Individual business, and that will give you from a $450 million loss some sense of at least where we stand today for guidance purposes. Small Group actually did improve 2016 actually versus 2015. We definitely \u2013 we actually saw favorability in Commercial across all segments, but it was nice to see in Small Group. This is really a repositioning story, as you know we continue to have some insured markets where the ACA business is pressured, we will likely continue to lose membership in those markets in 2017. And as Mark alluded to, we have some alternate funding products that are selling in here, and those will have a bit of a difference. So at the end of the day, I don't think that Small Group itself is a big part of the earnings move from year to year. It continues to be a repositioning year for us for that segment.","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","And I think it's important to note on the Small Group, we've really done a repositioning of the products with this self-insured. We are seeing very strong market receptivity relative to our offering. We have introduced differentiated products with our Visa capabilities, and we're quite pleased with the results in our alternative funding products.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, basically does that sound like Small Group margins may be getting to that sort of low single-digit range again in 2017? And really what I'm thinking about is, as we go through the healthcare re-reform process, if we ended up getting regulatory relief around a lot of the ACA mandates that pressured Small Group margins, how much potential \u2013 basically where were Small Group margins maybe even before ACA, and is there potential for sort of the re-reform process to provide some substantial relief on the Small Group margin side?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","I mean, I think over time, that's certainly a possibility. I mean we've always viewed this somewhat as like a mid single-digit insured sort of pre-tax margin business, and we clearly haven't been there. So I think over time, there is that potential. But as Mark alluded to, there's a lot that has to play out here in both Individual and Small Group, I think, before we could take a lot of comfort that that's coming.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Scott, I think one of the issues we need to be careful about is now we have three different pools of risk in the Small Group market. We have the keep-what-you-have market, which are people who are underwritten with old plans. We have the alternative funding market, which are people who have decided not to be insured and take advantage of different funding mechanisms. And then we have people who are in the ACA, and how that sorts out based on this new version of reform, the replace initiative, is going to be a delicate and interesting balance. And probably won't really happen much before 1\/1\/2019 quite frankly.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you. I wanted to clarify your comment on evaluating options post Judge Bates' feedback on the sustainable competition aspect. Does that imply there's some flexibility in an appeal process where you could change up the acquirer of divestitures?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","I think we're way too early in the process to have that kind of conversation. We're still working through. It's been eight days since we received the ruling. It took a few days to read it and understand it to a level of depth necessary to consider our next moves, and we're in the process of making all those next moves now. So I would want to wait until we have a full evaluation of our opportunities and alternatives.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Got it. So it's not laid out in the existing contract that it has to be one way or the other?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","There is no \u2013 there is no existing contract other than the agreement we have with Molina and the agreement we have with Humana that would address that issue right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Your components of cost trend guidance for 2017 are the same as they were for 2016, yet you changed up the mix of utilization versus unit cost a little bit. And you also came in at the lower end of those costs coming in at 6% or so as opposed to 6% to 7%. Can you tell us where the savings were and why you're projecting the same thing going forward into 2017?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Well, what I would say \u2013 and this will ultimately take greater shape and improved clarity as the quarter matures, but generally as the year goes on, we have good insight into unit cost. So, variations in trend tend to be updates on utilization. I know for example in the fourth quarter we had a couple of good months, anyway, of pharmacy experience in the fourth quarter. But generally these will usually play out as improvements into the utilization baseline. The outlook is a fairly detailed process we go through, sort of category-by-category looking at contracts, looking at the trends that we see. And, sometimes those end up with the same number, but the pathway there obviously looks different from year to year. I mean, I think, we continue to assume that we see a modest uptick in trend from year to year as we have, and that's continued to be our go-forward pricing position.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you talk about your PBM arrangement currently, and what you plan to do there and why that's triggering low double-digit growth in pharmacy spend?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Well, our current PBM relationship is in place until 1\/1\/20, and so we continue to work with CVS on finding ways to address our costs. I think our double-digit trend is really related to Specialty Pharmacy for the most part, which I think is plaguing everybody, and that's a place where we're both focusing both CVS and Aetna on how we can improve that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with our question.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. I've got a question on your long-term growth opportunities and really thinking less about the products, I'm thinking more about some of the underlying margin opportunities or beyond products. So, I was interested in an update on Healthagen status and the outlook for that. Is it really just driving membership growth, or do you see that as a standalone margin opportunity? And then also on the international side, if you see any further growth either inorganic or organic there?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Well, on the Healthagen side, it's still running full speed ahead, building more joint ventures, but I think as we look at that business and as we evolve through the next year or so, we will see it as much more of a standalone entity with its own standalone margin. But we very much want to make sure it's linked to the leverage inside our business in managing medical costs and bringing underwriting margin into Aetna the insurance company. So that's very much an important part of our relationship. And we will reward that organization and its leadership on that basis. So, with Gary Loveman now in the lead there and building new products and new insights into products as well as markets and individuals in the retail marketplace, we will hold Healthagen accountable for helping us deliver lower medical costs but also generating its own margin for its business and including however we go forward with CVS on our PBM relationship.","So, good organization, strong organization, great opportunity for us, doing well. They will not all be joint ventures, as I mentioned earlier. We will be looking at various other methods for getting value-based contracting across our book of business.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good, and also will you be looking at any sort of acquisitions of physician practices, kind of alternate site delivery, or do you see that as in conflict with providing services to some of those sorts of organizations?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","We see a huge opportunity of being in the community and in the retail marketplace as a way of delivering care to the home, and so I think we're going to focus more on that model versus the current structure of the hospital and particularly specialist physician marketplace. So we see opportunity in keeping people at home, getting as much care to the home as possible through either contingent or contracted workforce or our own employees, and then using local community resources and retail locations as a way of backing up the home-provided care. So, those are the areas we'll be looking.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Newshel with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Hello, thanks. Good morning. Can you walk us through your thinking and the timeline for making decisions on participation in the Individual market in 2018 and what do you need to see from Congress and when do you get enough clarity to remain in the markets that you're remaining in for 2017?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","We have no intention of being in the market for 2018. Currently where we stand, we'd have to have markets worked up, prices worked up for April 2017 in order to apply, and there is no possible way that we'll be prepared to do that given the unclear nature of where regulation's headed. We will, however, participate where we think it's appropriate in 2018 as we currently evaluate our performance in helping support the transition to whatever comes forward in 2019 or 2020.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Great, thanks. And maybe just one quick follow-up just to clarify on cost trend. Is that 6% to 7% forecast, is that adjusted for the fact that 2016 is a leap year and there's one fewer day in 2017?","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","We haven't made any specific adjustments for that in that trend.","Operator","Our final question is from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, thanks a lot. Mark, I was wondering if you could comment and add a little bit more color on the services business. You indicated that key focus is care in the home. I was wondering if you can touch on other elements as well as we're starting to see other players in healthcare leverage data. I know historically that's kind of been an area of focus for you. Are there certain moves or plans around that part of your business going forward?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Definitely there is. Under Gary's leadership, we have built up our data analytics department rather dramatically and are starting to come to some real interesting insights that have already begun to help us on our medical costs, on our sales, and on our underwriting margin. So we continue to see that as an area of focus and an area of investment for the company. As we have evaluated where we go without doing the Humana transaction, we had made priority decisions around again leveraging data analytics, leveraging in the home care and services as a way of impacting our medical cost and our growth and our quite frankly our retention of customers particularly in the Medicare space as an opportunity for us to move ahead. And so we will \u2013 you will see more investments in the services business as we move head.","Michael J.

My name is Casey, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Aetna First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cowhey, please go ahead.","Thomas F. Cowhey","Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna's first quarter 2012 earnings call and webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna, and with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark Bertolini; and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Following their prepared remarks, we will respond to your questions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC, including our 2011 Form 10-K and our first quarter 2012 Form 10-Q when filed.","We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company's performance that are non-GAAP measures in our first quarter 2012 financial supplement and our 2012 guidance summary. These reconciliations are available on the Investor Information section of aetna.com. Also, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in nonpublic forums is limited, so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini","Good morning. Thank you, Tom. And thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.34, a solid performance following on the excellent results we saw in 2011. Our businesses are performing well, and the operating metrics we posted this quarter are testimony to our having achieved the correct balance between maintaining our margins and positioning for future growth. ","We believe that our products are competitively positioned in the marketplace, and consistent with previous guidance we are pricing new and renewal business to a higher level of projected utilization for 2012. In short, we are pleased with our first quarter results and our sustained execution on the fundamentals.","As we look forward to the remainder of 2012, we expect top line and membership growth and strong operating performance. At this early point in the year and as we continue to watch our yields and trends develop through the first quarter, we believe it is prudent to maintain our current earnings outlook. As a result, we remain confident in our full year operating earnings per share guidance of approximately $5 per share. In a few moments, Joe will review our detailed results and our updated guidance. But first, I'm going to discuss our first quarter 2012 highlights and 2012 outlook and our progress in advancing our strategy.","Aetna's first quarter financial results are evidence of the rigor with which we manage the business. Underlying these results, Aetna grew Health Care premiums by over 6% this quarter, demonstrating growth across all our lines of business. As a result of Aetna's continued pricing discipline, medical cost management and unit cost control, we continue to maintain strong commercial underwriting margins. We continue to focus on striking a disciplined balance between margin and growth, erring on the side of margin. ","Our Medicare business posted an excellent quarter as we added 44,000 members. More than 75% of our Medicare Advantage growth came from our group Medicare franchise, a testament to our strength in the segment of the Medicare Advantage marketplace. We ended the quarter as expected with 17.9 million medical members. Our membership results reflects previously projected decreases in our National Account business and our exit from the Connecticut Medicaid program, partially offset by growth in our Medicare, International and middle markets businesses. ","We continue to be pleased with our membership traction across multiple business lines. As a result of this balanced membership traction, we are introducing year-end membership guidance of 18.2 million members, which represents growth of approximately 300,000 members over the remainder of the year. This projected growth comes from each of our major business lines and is driven by known wins in Commercial ASC, expansion in Medicaid and projected growth in Commercial Insured and Medicare in the latter part of the year.","In advancing our strategy, we remain focused on our long-term goal of making health care more accessible and affordable. To achieve this goal, we are focusing on growing the core business, adapting to the changing health care marketplace and deploying capital effectively. To accelerate growth in our core business, we have realigned some of our business units and added talent to our leadership team. In early March, we realigned our Medicare, Medicaid, public and labor and federal benefit planned businesses into one operating unit, Government Services. We believe this change will better serve our government customers, advance our retiree solutions and position us for the dual eligible opportunity. Kristi Ann Matus, who joined us in March as an Executive Vice President, is leading the Government Services businesses. Kristi joins us from USAA where she was a member of their senior leadership team. ","At the same time, we also consolidated and realigned all of our Commercial ASC and insurance businesses into a Commercial businesses operating unit. This alignment will help us to focus on the needs of our Commercial populations and drive solutions that meet the growing needs of today's health care consumers. Frank McCauley is now Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial businesses. ","We are seeing positive momentum in our core business, and we continue to focus on growing in a profitable and sustainable manner. In National Accounts, we remained focused on membership growth and are encouraged by the recent market response to our products. Our outlook for 2012 has improved due to better-than-projected first quarter membership, and several midyear additions. Moreover, while it's still very early in the 2013 National Account selling season, recent customer wins have increased our confidence in our ability to grow membership in 2013. ","Certain customers who left Aetna to pursue alternatives primarily based on discounts, are beginning to return to our integrated solutions and strengthen this composition. New business opportunities are twice what they were a year ago, and we have had only minimal account lapses to date, far fewer than we had at this point in 2011, including fewer existing accounts out to bid. We expect to provide initial 2013 National Accounts membership guidance on our second quarter earnings call in late July.","In Medicaid, we see strong momentum and are pleased to have been recently awarded contracts in 2 significant procurements in Missouri and Ohio. In the first quarter, our Missouri Medicaid business was selected as 1 of 3 plans to administer services in all 3 regions statewide starting July 1. We have operated in parts of Missouri for 14 years and look forward to continuing to provide quality programs and services across the state. ","At the beginning of April, the State of Ohio announced that we were awarded a new Medicaid risk contract in all 3 regions of the state. It was a very competitive process and Aetna was the highest scoring plan in each of the 3 regions. This win is another testament to the strength of the Aetna Medicaid value proposition and we are excited to be able to serve the State of Ohio and its citizens. ","The Ohio win also positions us well as we prepare to submit bids for Ohio's dual eligible demonstration pilot program. High acuity populations remain a focus of our Medicaid expansion strategies and we continue to work in partnership with states to serve these members. The health care marketplace continues to wrestle with the prospects for judicial or legislative change to the Affordable Care Act. At Aetna, we continue to focus on compliance with the law and delivering solutions that meet the long-term needs of our customers and members. If the Supreme Court decision changes the law, we will work with Congress, the Administration and others to develop alternative solutions that promote market stability, ensure broad access and improve the affordability of the health care system. ","Meanwhile, Aetna continues to move forward to address the nation's health care quality and cost challenges. Today's health care system is not working. It's expensive and disconnected and the quality of care varies unacceptably. To help address these growing issues, we are driving change in how we interact with providers and consumers through our emerging businesses.","Aetna has differentiated itself in the area of provided collaboration by commercializing the concept of accountable care organizations and formed a new business unit called Accountable Care Solutions under the leadership of Joe Zubretsky. Our Accountable Care Solutions business continues to develop innovative provider partnerships based on clinical excellence and payment reform. ","In our model, an ACO is more than a risk sharing or performance payment contract with a provider. The installation of an entirely new platform allows providers to engage in database population management rather than traditional acute episodic care management. Our suite of world-class technology tools, combined with Aetna's intellectual capital, is the enabler which allows us to partner with providers to deliver a cross-structured advantage and launch products across all lines of business. ","We have signed 9 ACS contracts and currently have 16 letters of intent with over 180 leads in the pipeline. These partnerships are strengthening Aetna's position in local markets and catalyzing growth in our core business. We project by the end of 2012, under our new and existing agreements, we will have meaningful medical membership service by our Accountable Care Solutions relationships. To meet the changing needs of today's health care consumer, we are also developing new capabilities to empower our members to live healthier lives. ","In the first quarter, we launched CarePass, Aetna's new consumer platform. CarePass is an easy-to-use web-based solution that improves convenience and leverages mobile technologies. Consumers can manage their health and their health care on a variety of devices whenever they want and wherever they are. The first implementation of our CarePass digital platform is our recently launched updated version of the iTriage smartphone application. ","iTriage harnesses health care information in an efficient and personalized way, bringing together provider search and appointment scheduling, health reference resources and a secure personalized electronic health record. Its core features are not Aetna specific and are direct to the consumers at large. In addition, we are developing value-added enhanced features for Aetna members. Most importantly, this new technology is free for anyone to download to their smartphone device from their resident application store. ","We are very excited about the power and flexibility of the CarePass platform and its ability to help drive growth in our core business. In fact, we expect these investments will enhance our Accountable Care Solutions strategy as we use tools such as iTriage to connect consumers with our provider partners. ","The third major component of our growth strategy is capital generation and deployment. For the full year we are on track to generate net subsidiary dividends of approximately $1.7 billion, which we will deploy for the benefit of shareholders through our shareholder dividend, pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities and buying back additional shares. ","In summary, I am pleased with our first quarter performance and expect continued strong performance in 2012. We remain committed to our operating model premised on financial discipline. We are seeing good momentum in the following businesses: National Accounts, where value proposition is beginning to resonate; Medicaid, where we expect growth in our existing markets and are gaining access to new markets; Medicare, as we look to grow in the group and individual marketplaces; Commercial insured, where we continue to see prospects for growth, primarily driven by our large group accounts; and Accountable Care Solutions, where we are driving innovative change and see a robust pipeline reflecting the value that providers see in our differentiated offerings.","Further, I am confident in our strategic direction and particularly, our execution; our ability to manage through the legislative and regulatory changes associated with Health Care Reform; our ability to grow membership over the course of 2012; our 2012 medical trend outlook; and our 2012 operating EPS projection of approximately $5. ","I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders. ","I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsky to provide insight into our first quarter results and our 2012 outlook. Joe?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Thanks, Mark. And good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported first quarter 2012 operating earnings per share of $1.34. This result was driven by solid execution on business fundamentals and generated excellent operating and parent company cash flows as evidenced by our Commercial medical benefit ratio, which was below 80%; pretax operating margins, which were 9.4% at the high-end of our targeted high single-digit range; our reserve position, which increased by a higher percentage than premiums; and operating cash flows, which were well in excess of operating earnings.","We also returned to revenue growth this quarter, posting a 6% year-over-year increase, reversing the recent top line trend. We continue to price with discipline, actively manage medical cost for superior quality and cost outcomes and strive for administrative efficiencies to deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. ","At the end of the first quarter, we had 17.9 million medical members, a decline of 544,000 members from year end 2011. This result is consistent with our previous guidance but emerged in a slightly different mix than we had projected. Commercial ASC membership decreased by 450,000 in the quarter, slightly better than our previous guidance, primarily due to better-than-expected open enrollment results and some new account wins; Commercial Insured membership decreased by 40,000 in the quarter, driven by declines in our federal employees business and certain clients converting to an ASC relationship with Aetna. Medicare membership increased by 44,000 in the quarter, with Group Medicare Advantage sales the primary driver; and Medicaid membership was down 98,000 in the quarter, primarily driven by the exit from the Connecticut Medicaid program. ","First quarter 2012 revenue generation was strong, increasing by 6.2% year-over-year to $8.9 billion, primarily due to higher Health Care premium and higher fees and other revenue. The increase in Health Care premium included a net increase in Commercial premium of approximately 3.5% due to a 6% increase in premium yields, all resulting from rates with no impact from mix. These gains were partially offset by volume, declining by about 2.5%. Health Care premium also reflected a 17% increase in Medicare premium, primarily driven by membership growth in Medicare Advantage and the addition of Genworth's Medicare Supplement business. We also reevaluated our Medicare premium estimates and we made appropriate adjustments to those in the quarter. ","We posted a 9% increase in Medicaid premium as growth in our Illinois ABD program, as well as in Pennsylvania and Texas, more than offset the impact of the exit from the Connecticut Medicare program. Fees and other revenue increased by 6.7% year-over-year as a result of the inclusion of revenues from our 2011 acquisitions. Our first quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.5%. Our Commercial MBR with 79.9% in the first quarter, an excellent result. Medical cost in 2011 have developed largely as reserve at the end of the year, resulting in no significant prior year reserve development occurring in the first quarter of 2012.  This is the direct result of the stabilizing medical cost trend we observed in the fourth quarter of 2011. ","Throughout 2011, Aetna's Commercial trend assumptions decreased by over 250 basis points from the midpoint of our original guidance. That meant we were consistently reserving, forecasting and pricing into a declining trend environment, which led to favorable reserve development and margin expansion. Currently, we believe that the trend estimate supporting our reserves in the fourth quarter 2011 has stabilized and that we have made prudent assumptions regarding medical cost trends for 2012.","Our days claims payable were 44 days at the end of the quarter, flat sequentially, and our Health Care cost payable increased 5.7% compared to sequential premium growth of 3.7%. We continue to invest in innovation through improved Health Care delivery for our customers, to capitalize on opportunities for profitable growth and to improve productivity. ","Our first quarter 2012 business segment operating expense ratio was 18.8% as expected, reflecting the addition of fee-based business, which have operating expense ratios higher than the company average, largely offset by shifts in our membership mix and continued execution of our expense initiatives. Our operating expense ratio for the insured Health Care business was 11.4% in the quarter, down 50 basis points year-over-year.","The final area of financial performance I will comment on relates to our investment portfolio, management of capital and cash flow generation. First quarter net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $160 million, as declining yields continued to create downward pressure on earnings. At March 31, the continuing business portfolio had a net unrealized gain position of approximately $1 billion before tax and is well positioned from a risk perspective. ","Our capital generation was very strong in the quarter. We started the quarter with $100 million of cash at the parent, net subsidiary dividends to the parent was $633 million. We repurchased 7.4 million shares for $344 million. We paid down $276 million in Commercial paper. After other net uses, including our shareholder dividend, we ended the quarter with $100 million in cash to parent. Our basic share count was 347.4 million at March 31.","At the end of the quarter, we entered into a new 5-year $1.5 billion credit facility in the consortium of 20 domestic and international banks. The new credit facility replaces the 5-year revolving facility that was due to expire in early 2013. The facility was attractively priced, provides us with financial flexibility and backstops our Commercial paper program.","Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At March 31, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 29%. We continue to target a risk-based capital ratio of approximately 300% of company action level. ","Operating cash flow generation was excellent for the first quarter. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow was approximately 2.3x operating earnings and benefited from an extra monthly Medicare payment in the quarter. Excluding the additional payment, the ratio was approximately 1.3x, above our onetime target and support our strong operating fundamentals. ","Moving to our 2012 outlook. We are now projecting year-end medical membership of 18.2 million members, reflecting growth of 300,000 members over the next 3 quarters. This is driven by projected midyear additions to our Commercial ASC membership and a significant ramp in Medicaid membership. We also project adding members in the latter part of the year in our Commercial insured and Medicare businesses.","In Commercial ASC, we are projecting momentum in the back half of the year. We project adding approximately 150,000 members. This includes 2 large ASC customer wins for July 1, one of which is the previously announced State of Maine account. In addition, we expect a network access client to add approximately 75,000 ASC members throughout the remainder of the year. ","In Medicaid, we see strong momentum and expect to add approximately 100,000 members through the end of the year. Our new Missouri contract is projected to add 50,000 members in 2012. Further, we expect to add 50,000 Medicaid members in 2012 due to ASC expansions in Florida, Texas and Virginia. ","We continue to project growth in our Commercial Insured business over the remainder of the year, and we also continue to project growth in our Medicare business as our group, individual and Medicare Supplement franchises build momentum. Our projected Commercial medical benefit ratio and Medicare medical benefit ratio guidance remains unchanged. ","Aetna's 2012 MBR projections reflect underlying medical cost trends that we expect to be 6.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, as compared to a 2011 trend, which remains below 5.5%. Higher utilization is the primary driver of the projected 2012 trend increase, and we are closely watching our trend yield spreads as they continue to develop. The projected components of 2012 trend remain unchanged.","We continue to project that our full year 2012 business segment operating expense ratio will be approximately 18.5% to 19%, reflecting productivity improvements but also continued in substantial investments. Accelerating efficiency gains from our expense initiatives, including our voluntary early retirement program, are projected to help reduce the impact of seasonal expense increases toward the back half of the year. ","For 2012, we are projecting net dividends from subsidiaries of approximately $1.7 billion and deployable capital of approximately $1.35 billion, including amounts deployed in the first quarter. Considering our first quarter repurchases and capital guidance, we have updated our share count guidance to a range of approximately 350 million to 353 million weighted average shares. ","As we look to the remainder of the year, we would expect that sequential operating earnings per share could be lower than what we reported for first quarter 2012, consistent with the pattern we reported in 2011. This is a function of the seasonal nature of our business where medical cost tend to the highest in the second and fourth quarters, and administrative spending increases to support open enrollment toward the end of the year. ","For the full year 2012, we are confident in our projection of a pretax operating margin of 8.5% to 9%, approximately $1.75 billion of operating earnings and operating earnings per share of approximately $5. The 2012 fundamentals of Aetna's business remain strong. Looking beyond 2012, we believe we have the winning strategy in the marketplace. Our core business is executing. The environment is stable, and we are well positioned for sustainable growth. Our emerging businesses continue to work to transform the network model, improve our cost structure and drive additional membership growth. ","Finally, our capital generation remain strong. Combined, we believe our core business, supplemented by emerging business growth and effective capital deployment will enable us to generate low double-digit operating earnings per share growth on average over time.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas F. Cowhey","Thank you, Joe. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I want to ask a question about what you're seeing in terms of you talked quite a bit about the cost trend side stabilizing in line with your expectations. On the pricing side for the Commercial fully insured business, in particular, what are you guys seeing because we've had some of the nonpublic and the public companies refer to markets where price competition is intensified and to some degree, pointing to the adaptation to health reform MLR rules as part of the driver?","Mark T. Bertolini","Matt, Mark. A couple of points. First, in the fourth quarter, given where we saw reserve development, and Joe will talk a bit about gross versus net development, we always report net development, we do not see trends decreasing anymore. And so a large part of our proprietary development in prior years is we do not see trends decreasing. For 2012, our guidance has been that our trend, our pricing trend, will be overall 6.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. And given that we have 1 month that's 85% developed and then the last month only 15% to 20% developed, quite frankly, we see nothing in utilization indicators one way or the other to predict that, that number is the wrong number. And those are our pricing trends. So in the marketplace, as a result of that, we do not see any abnormal competition other than what we normally see in sporadic markets around the country where competitors occasionally take more aggressive pricing stances, but we still see the market as largely rational. But everybody is sort of feeling for the bottom here where trends stop decelerating and starts to tick up, and quite frankly, we don't have enough information in the first quarter to come up with a prediction as to where that trend number is right now.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it . Just one follow up, if I could. Can you talk about your Ohio Medicaid contract win in the context of where you're going as the dual eligible opportunity may unfold more broadly, and you think about doing that organically versus maybe taking on a partner?","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, at this point in time, we like what we've seen in both Missouri and Ohio. The Ohio win was an important one for us. All 3 regions in Ohio, top scores in all 3 regions but more importantly, they're about to put out the RFP for the duals in the state and we believe we are ideally positioned. As you know, we have a big footprint in Ohio, including a large portion of the retiree, state of retiree population, so we like the Ohio opportunity. Again, we always are looking for opportunities in the Medicaid space, and depending on whether or not we believe it's appropriate for our shareholders, given our long run deal of margins and the opportunity in that market, and we continue to make a prudent decision as to whether or not to grow organically or inorganically.","Operator","Our next question will come from Josh Raskin with Barclays Capital.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, and I appreciate your comments earlier, Joe, around the lack of development. But I guess I'm just sort of struggling to think about the change. We've seen 9 consecutive quarters of pretty significant development, i.e. $100 million to $200 million per quarter. I guess, I'm just trying to understand what exactly has changed and was this impacted by your strategy, your pricing strategy, due to the minimum MLRs or is this just we're still assuming inflection in trend and we're not going to release reserves until we see definitive proof that, that did not happen? I guess just a lot of questions around what exactly was the difference this year versus last year, around the development?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Sure, Josh. The difference is quite simple actually. If you recall when we began the year, we guided to a medical cost trend of approximately 8%. We ended the year with a full annual trend of 5.5%, a 250 basis point reduction from our original projection. So all during the year, we are consistently reserving, pricing and forecasting into a declining trend environment, which expands margins and produces favorable prior period development. What you're really seeing right now is exactly what we called trend decelerating, the decelerating slowing, bottoming and then potentially upticking into 2012 as predicted to 6.5%. And so at some level, your trend assumption inside your reserves is going to be perfectly accurate and that's what you're seeing off of our fourth quarter 2011.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, Joe, I think of it as in 2011 you had $218 million of PPRD that's related to the prior year. In 2010, you had $175 million that related to the prior year. And now it looks like we've got none related to the prior year. So I understand that the inflection in trend and that causing you to say, Hey, we got it right. So should we think about relative to prior period -- or prior year prior period reserve development, that there was just slightly less conservatism or pad built into last year's number, is that a fair way to think about it?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No, I would say that the trend assumptions underlying the reserves were decelerating very, very quickly in the past 2 years. Very quickly. I mean 250 basis points from the beginning of the year to the end of the year in 2011 alone, that's dramatic. And if you're reserving into that, it's bound to produce material amounts of favorable prior period development. One other point I will make, and that's this whole gross versus net issue, if we were to produce the 10-Q, 10-K roll forward schedule at the end of the first quarter, we would still reflect $170 million of reserves rolling off of 2011 into '12. But because we only report to you the amount that impacts the P&L, net of the amount reestablished, that's what gives rise to no significant prior period development in the P&L in the quarter. But our reserve conservatism remains consistent. We take that same approach that we always have in the past, the difference is moderating trend versus significantly decelerating trend.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. The roll forward comment is extremely helpful. And then I guess I would take from that, you don't see any potential need today at this point, where you have to start adding to reserves to get back to a specific level of modestly adverse conditions?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","I'll  point to 2 statistics that support our reserve levels for the quarter. Obviously, reserves have to include our best estimates, but our reserves are up nearly 6%, in premiums we're up only 4%, and our days claims payable of 44 suggests that there's a solid balance sheet supporting our financial results for the quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charles Boorady with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'd like to get more granularity on medical trend and market response to Matt's question on pricing, you talked a little bit about trend and it's early to get a read on the 1Q trend. I had a data point, just major joint replacements given that 83% of the U.S. market has reported now. And what they're saying is that it looks like the year-over-year growth has ticked up quite a bit sequentially when you put that data together from all the sellers of hips and knees, it looks like the year-over-year growth ticked up quite a bit sequentially in the first quarter even when excluding the leap year effect. And I'm just curious, what percent of procedures do you get prior notification or require prior approval on, and whether you're seeing a pickup in procedure volumes, or do you think what the manufacturers are giving us is maybe false indicator, maybe there's inventories of hips and knees being built in the channel and not really a pickup in that procedure volume? Can you give us a sense for what kind of read you have on that?","Mark T. Bertolini","On the specific implants and medical devices piece, there's been a lot of discussion lately about inventory buildups and restocking because -- for the last year or so, because utilization was dropping so fast, hospitals weren't restocking some of their inventory. So I think there's a bit of an inventory impact to some of the device stuff you're seeing in the numbers. The way we look at it is that in our 2012 trend estimates, we see the outpatient arena going from mid- to high-single digits to high-single digits. And we see the physician piece going from low- to mid-single digits to mid-single units. Those are the 2 biggest changes that we see this year, year-over-year.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And Mark, in terms of the headset, you said it's a little early to get the full first quarter read. Can you give us a sense for your dashboard on medical trend, like how much of the procedure volume to actually get a prior notification or prior approval for versus what you find out about sort of x post?","Mark T. Bertolini","I've met -- most of joint replacement procedures are going to get a prior approval. So from both personal experience and other experience, I know that we get that kind of prior approval. So we have really good dashboards on that. I mean we have down to outpatient, a vertebral repair numbers in our statistics. So our statistics go very, very deep, much deeper than they did as a result of our 2009 as we have very good visibility on where the market is going. And from a utilization standpoint, we don't see anything that's alarming in the marketplace, but we have to watch trend develop through the quarter because what we're feeling for is bottom of the deceleration of the trend environment. Not saying that it's accelerating, if we projected that in our pricing, but so far we can't say it's continued to decelerate, so we think that we may be a bottom and we're feeling for that and that's part of our caution here in the first quarter.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The destocking we saw in ICDs, did you also think that was happening with hips, knees?","Mark T. Bertolini","Hospitals are doing it across the device environment, at least the hospital people I talk to. Now my data point is as good as your 1 data point, so I think you'd have to talk to the manufacturers themselves.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So just following up again on the prior development and, Joe, you talked about the $170 million that sounds like you've just put back into your balance sheet. Is that net of medical loss ratio rebates and when you actually did your filings, did this come in line with your expectations or was there anything either favorable or unfavorable on the Small Group definition provider capitation, international, that made it deviant from what you had originally anticipated?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No. The number I gave you on the gross development, had we prepared the roll forward schedule, is unaffected by any rebate estimates.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So that is net of rebate, is what you're saying then?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No. It's unaffected by any rebate.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Unaffected altogether, all right. Then also just going forward into the loss ratio story, I think we had talked about potentially there being still some headroom in certain geographies and where you may be able to adapt a pricing strategy that could still allow you to optimize your margins. As you filed your statutory reports, how does that look for you going forward, are you pricing now pretty much 2 floors?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","The first thing I would say about the exhibit we filed with the NAIC is that it was a prescriptive form. We followed the prescriptive form to the letter. It may or may not accurately reflect rebate amounts that ultimately will be paid. And I would caution you there's some major definitional differences between that form and what will ultimately be used to calculate the rebate. So I caution you on using that information to infer anything about the results. We continue to have a very disciplined and rigorous approach to rebate pool management. As you know, we can hit target margins in many of our products operating above the minimum, which means there is room for favorability in our financial results. We don't disclose the amount, but since many of the pools operate above the minimum, improved performance can fall to the bottom line this year, as well as last year.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And just finally, if I could sneak one in. On the trend, on the 6.5%, you have headwind that you're projecting on utilization. You talked about unit cost improvement, are those built into that, and are you seeing those develop out the way you'd anticipated?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Well, as Mark said, it's early in the year, and so we see nothing in the early data, as incomplete as it is, to suggest that our forecast of the 6.5% plus or minus 50 basis points is inaccurate. We're pricing to that level. We're forecasting at that level. And as experience emerges in the second quarter, we'll update you as to where that experience is going. But we're pricing to that level right now and nothing in the early data suggests that we're wrong.","Mark T. Bertolini","In 2012, Ana, 30% of our trend is based on utilization, 70% on unit cost. And we have, as demonstrated by our emerging success in National Accounts, been effective at getting better pricing out of our provider contracts.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I want to turn to SG&A. Understanding the first quarter was in your guidance range, but if I look at the 2011, your admin ratio over the course of the year rises several hundred basis points, or couple of hundred basis points. And so I wanted to get some perspective on how much is seasonal, how much was acquisition influenced, and as I think about 2012, what kind of perhaps acquisition synergies and other efficiency initiatives might keep that in a tighter range as we progress through the year?","Mark T. Bertolini","Thanks, David. Mark Bertolini. I would offer just the summary comments and then Joe can give you some of the details behind them. We are very much focused on productivity, both through our operating leverage as we begin to grow in 2012 but more importantly, in getting ready for exchanges and having an affordable price point  in the marketplace. So we have a number of programs going on. And I can have Joe describe for you the details in our projections for 2012.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","So Dave, let me give you some details. I'll remind you that in our original guidance, last year, we produced a 19.8% SG&A ratio and if you want to conduct -- or construct a simple bridge between that and the midpoint of our guidance range this year, we have 40 basis points of inflation; 40 basis points reduction due to revenue mix, mostly Medicare; the impact of acquisitions, as you suggested, is 30 basis point increase since most of our acquisitions were service-based businesses. All of that offset by 140 basis point decrease due to productivity. We're working very hard at a productivity line. Now in terms of what to expect for the balance of the year. Last year you saw a natural progression in our SG&A ratio from the beginning to the end of the year, an increase due to the normal seasonal pattern of our spending, which is back-end loaded due to IT spending late in the year and spending on open enrollment. This year, that natural seasonal progression will be muted by the increasing productivity gains, which build over the year, which will flatten the SG&A ratio from the beginning of the year, Q1, to the end of the year, Q4. You'll see a flat SG&A ratio.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So okay, so I was going to get you on that last -- so flattish, can you give us a basic range of what you think beginning to ending of the year, top to bottom would be on that range?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No. I Would just tell you that each quarter can be anywhere from 10 to 30 basis points, above or below the quarter before. But think of it as flattish for the balance of the year, again putting a point  on the seasonal pattern of our spending hasn't changed, it's just that productivity gains increased from the beginning to the end of the year flattening that curve.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just to explore that SG&A question a little bit further. Can you give us some confidence that you're going to get to that 140 basis points of improvement in productivity gains on your SG&A, considering your SG&A is actually up as a percent of revenues this year, year-over-year, this quarter year-over-year?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","I have high confidence in the number. We generally do not forecast SG&A and productivity savings until they are scored, which means there is a detailed plan in place for, let's say, an IT enhancement that may help us reduce headcount. Clearly, the voluntary retirement program we put in place is already baked. So that's just a run rate that is waiting to emerge in the financial results. You can bank that one. And so we have a high degree of probability and confidence in the SG&A number we've given.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So how is it that it's not already improving a little bit this quarter?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Year-over-year, you have the impact of acquisitions and you have some artifacts in the numbers. But I would just look at the full year result, and 140 basis points is a good number.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Was there something onetime or something that changed significantly this first quarter?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Not to my knowledge, no.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you tell us what pension expense did to your earnings this year over last will do to your earnings this year over last year?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","A minor impact year-over-year since the financing component of our pension spend is, basically, is being amortized over a very long period of time and there hasn't been much movement in the surplus or deficit in the pension plan.","Operator","The next question will come from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just to beat this trend message to death one last time. So you commented about in 2011 the trend decelerated over the course of the year fairly rapidly. Then we come in to 2012 and I think you're trying to say, if I understand it, that at this point it's just too early to tell, and that you're not sure one way or another whether there's been a material change versus sort of the fourth quarter run rate. Is that fair?","Mark T. Bertolini","Let me be very clear on this. We do not see trend decelerating any further. We picked the number at 5.5% for the end of the year. For the full year, we do not see it decelerating any further. And that could be for a number of reasons. That's what we see right now. That could be because the fourth quarter we've blown through the deductibles and people are spending more in the fourth quarter. But what we see in the reserve development is that there isn't any further trend deceleration. What we don't know yet is what's happening in the first quarter because we have priced at 6.5 plus or minus 50 basis points and because almost half of our reserve picks for the quarter are still estimates, we have no reason to believe it's higher or lower than that number.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of the Medicaid business normalizing for the PPD, that was sort of the outlier in terms of pressure there. Can you just give us a little more color what you're seeing at this point?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","In the Medicaid business for the quarter, the loss ratio was a little higher than we'd like to see for 2 reasons. 2 plans in particular had some isolated large claim activity. We actually believe that those large claims may be partially recovered by reinsurance, but we did not take account of that in the quarter. And the other thing you're seeing is the increased mix of our Illinois ABD program, which has a higher medical loss ratio than the core book of business. Those 2 impacts created the loss ratio uptick in the quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Doug Simpson with Morgan Stanley.","Douglas Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So maybe just to try to put all these comments together. It sounds like you feel good about 2012, where you are at this thus far into the year. But Q1 came in a little bit light at least relative to Street numbers and you didn't take up the outlook. So it seems like there's some confusion just around the quarter and the message, and I appreciate the comments on trend in G&A spending, but maybe just to pull together, could you characterize for us your level of confidence in your outlook? Should we think about the numbers that you put out there as -- are these reach, are these what you see as most reasonable, do you still think there's -- could these prove conservative? I think we're just struggling a little because you sound confident in the general trends but the first quarter did come in a little bit light where some of the peers have been beating numbers? And then maybe the seasonality was a little bit different than it should have been, we're just trying to understand those dynamics.","Mark T. Bertolini","So Doug, the first quarter came in light because so many people projected prior period development in their estimates. That's why the first quarter came in light. And what we're seeing about prior period development is that we had $170 million worth of gross rebate -- or gross reserves that we put back up based on the fact that we don't have enough visibility in the first quarter this year to understand whether or not that 6.5 plus or minus 50 basis points is good. And by the way, we're projecting growth through the remainder of the year of 300,000 lives as it rolls through the year. So we believe it is prudent at this point in time since we believe we're near bottom of trend deceleration to find out where we believe trend is headed before we start predicting things better than what we projected in our current outlook, which we are very confident of.","Douglas Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a different direction, taking a little bit different direction. As we think about the Medicaid opportunity and the exchanges, obviously for the Pakistans in 2014. Can you just update us on your interest in potentially thinking about bulking up or adding selected assets through M&A over the next, call it, 12 to 18 months? How much of a priority is this? And how do you think about what are sort of the push points on whether or not you would pull the trigger on something?","Mark T. Bertolini","I think on any acquisition, and I'll let Joe comment in a moment here on Medicaid specifically, on any acquisition it has to make sense for our shareholders. There has to be a willing buyer and a willing seller at a price point that makes sense for us financially. And at this point in time, we haven't seen anything in that space from a price point that makes sense for us on the large national players. Joe, if you have any more comments.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Sure, Doug. Certainly, Missouri and Ohio give us renewed confidence in our ability to grow organically in an open bidding process against intense competition and scoring very highly. So we do have renewed confidence in our organic strategy. And the second point I would make is we look at the components that one needs to configure in order to serve the dual eligible and high-acuity populations, pharmacy, product, a behavioral product and the ability to serve high-acuity populations, medical management being one of the hallmarks of Aetna, we actually believe we have the core capabilities to configure in a way that can meet the needs of this high-acuity population. That doesn't mean we may see the need to acquire something later. But we believe we could serve the frail elderly, the severely mentally ill and those types of populations with the assets we currently own. But it doesn't preclude us acquiring some capability later if we believe it serves the shareholders and our membership well.","Operator","Our next question will come from Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I'm still struggling with the reported trends on Commercial. If I look, year-over-year, we had a 300 basis point deterioration in the MLR on an underlying basis because you had a lot of PPD, second quarter related to first. You were saying throughout last year that you expect the trend to accelerate. Your payables grew in excess of your premiums, which suggest that you reserved assuming trend acceleration. So a couple of questions. One, prior period development, for it to be 0 is pretty rare, was it slightly positive or slightly negative? And if your premiums -- if your payables rose in excess of your premiums, why was the prior period development 0?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","A lot of questions in there. I think I'll answer the last one first. The numbers I gave you were the 3\/31 reserves. We're suggesting that our reserve picks for the first quarter at 3\/31. We grew, the reserves grew in excess of the premium growth sequentially. So it had nothing to do with the 12\/31 estimates. It had to do with the 3\/31 estimates.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Right. If your payables grew in excess of your premiums the fourth quarter, shouldn't there have been positive development? I mean, throughout all of last year your payables grew faster than premiums. So the trend didn't re-accelerate in the fourth quarter, then you should have had positive development first quarter related to fourth, as you have in the last 2 years. So question, was prior period development slightly positive or slightly negative?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No, we said it's not significant. It's not significant enough to report.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","But was it slightly positive or slightly negative?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","I mean, it was just insignificant to the result, breakeven.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So exactly 0?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Insignificant to the result. I mean, I can't comment further on that.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Why was stock comp accruals down year-over-year?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Why was -- can you repeat, please?","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Your stock compensation accruals was down year-over-year, could you help me understand why that would be?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","I'd have to take a look at that, and we'll have Tom Cowhey call you offline. I'm not aware that it was. But I don't know what you're looking at, but we'll take a look at it.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess I'm still confused about if your conference calls late last year assumed trend would accelerate and your reserve suggest that you reserved to an accelerating trend, I still don't get why there wasn't positive development first quarter related to fourth?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","I think what you're highlighting is at some point it has to turn. It decelerates, it bottoms and stalls, and then it grows. And we did say, I want to be very clear on this, and Mark made the point, we are calling for an increase, particularly in utilization trend, '12 over '11. So at some point it has to start turning up. And so catching the turn is really the trick here, and what we're suggesting is that the reserve pick was spot on as trend decelerated. We caught the bottom and now it's upticking and we are reserving into an increasing trend environment because that's our forecast.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So let me just say what I think what happened. It looks like we had a seasonal uptick in medical trend fourth quarter. But we're not sure whether it's just seasonal or secular but it didn't come out great relative to what you reserved for and we're waiting to see whether it was seasonal or secular with respect to the uptick fourth quarter. Is that reasonable?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No.","Mark T. Bertolini","No. We believe our trend was spot on for the fourth quarter. I would say a couple of things that I think you need to think a little differently about here, Christine, is that while we were projecting higher trend than we actually ended up seeing when we settled reserves each quarter, that increase in expected utilization was put into our pricing. And that should show up in our results, not necessarily in our reserves.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You're not reserving to a higher trend, you were just pricing to a higher trend.","Mark T. Bertolini","We are pricing to a higher trend and we were reserving and selling our reserves based on the trend pick we had picked for the quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Somewhat related to the last question. My understanding is reserves established at the end of the year were set assuming higher trends than the 5.5% or just slightly less than 5.5% that you've seen for the year. Is that not true, or where did you reserve -- the reserves that you established at the end of the year, what kind of a trend assumption were you factoring into that?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","The annual trend assumption that underlined our year end reserve calculation was 5.5%.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So you weren't assuming the trend pickup then?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Not -- because reserves are accounting for the past, not the future.","Mark T. Bertolini","The future trend pick goes into our pricing. Now if you look at gross reserves, you could see some of that in the gross reserves because we set up in the gross reserves, up a cushion to pick up for turns in trends, but we reset that up. Took the gross reserves down, put them back up in the quarter, or the first quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to go back to your comment, Mark, earlier about the maintaining the correct balance between margins and growth. Was that meant to be an SG&A comment, a MLR comment, how should we be thinking about that because I guess in one reading it could be we're addressing SG&A for growth in 2013 and margins kind of will adjust to that, another one could be we are cutting pricing to maintain membership. I just want to see what that balance is.","Mark T. Bertolini","It's our target margin, including both the medical cost and the SG&A. And our target margins, our margins in the first quarter were 9.4%, which is high single-digits and higher than our current estimate for 2012 in total. And so as a result, we believe we are managing to an appropriate high single-digit target margin. We continue to invest to get our SG&A to a price point where, when the reserve -- when the exchanges come up, we are -- have an affordable product out on the exchange.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess last year, you gave some pretty good commentary about the rebate status of the different pools. Can you give us an update of where you are right now and where you expect to be in 2012?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Our results include estimates of rebates in the pools that they're incurred. As we said many times, in 2012, our rebates will probably be lower than they were in '11. Since in 2011, our products were priced in into the market before the rules were actually known. But we're not parsing that out as part of our results. I would focus on the MBR because rebate accrual itself is not relevant. It's really the achievement of your MBR. You're either going to put the money in the price of your product and get it on the street immediately or you're going to pay in a rebate. So I would focus people on the quality of our MBR, which is at 79.9% was an excellent result for the quarter.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So when you say that the MLR -- I'm sorry, the rebate, would be down in 2012 versus 2011 just because you now know the rules a little bit better, is it safe to say that your pricing strategies around rebates has been maintained from those 2 years, or is there any change in the pricing strategy that would adjust that?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No change in the strategy, but we were in a position late in 2010 to tell our field organization to price the products and get them into the market as if the rebates didn't exist because we didn't know how they'd work. That gave rise to a handful of pools that actually had a significant rebate status. Those pools this year would be actually pricing closer to the mean, not at the mean, but we'd be pricing a lot closer to effectively get that money into the price of the product in the hands of our customers immediately who have been waiting for a rebate. So the strategy hasn't changed but the timing and the reaction to the pools, clearly we have better insights now having a year's worth of experience.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then United indicated they had some benefits, some regulatory clarification, did you see any of that?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","I think you're referring to an announcement of perhaps an accounting adjustment. Obviously, every quarter, we true up our estimates, experience moves around, so the pools move up and down. And we would've taken account of that in our quarterly results. But not significant enough to report.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The first question just on the first quarter estimate of trend in the context of that full year guidance of 6% to 7% and in terms of what you established as your reserve pick for the end of the quarter. Where specifically would you say your view of trend in the first quarter was, was it right in the middle of that full year range or more towards the 6% moving up from the 5.5% in the fourth quarter?","Mark T. Bertolini","So a way to think about this, Scott, is that in the first month of the year, we're about 85% developed. And the second month, we're about 70%, 65%, 70%. In the third month it's about 20% developed across our book of business. The rest are estimates. And so each month has a little different estimate based on the completion of that month in the actual results we're seeing through -- through our claims payments or reserves. So there isn't a number. We still believe that at this time, the 6.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, is a reasonable estimate of full year trend.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So if we blend that, that would be just somewhere in the middle of that range, just sort of blending out those 3 months or bias towards the lower or higher end of that 6% to 7% range?","Mark T. Bertolini","It's too early to tell.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Scott, we don't report our -- we report our annual estimate of trend. We don't report how it emerges quarterly. So you have to stay tuned for more information on that as the year progresses.","Thomas F.

Mr. Cowhey, please go ahead.","Thomas F. Cowhey","Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Call and Webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna. And with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark Bertolini; and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Following their prepared remarks, we will respond to your questions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC, including our 2011 Form 10-K, our 2012 Form 10-Qs and our 2012 Form 10-K when filed.","We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company's performance that are non-GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2012 financial supplement and our 2013 guidance summary.

So we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini","Good morning. Thank you, Tom. And thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $0.94 and full year operating earnings per share of $5.13. These results bring to a close another solid year for the company, our customers and our shareholders.","Looking back on 2012, Aetna continued to price with discipline and execute across our core business. Our improved National Accounts selling season, our dual eligible contract wins and our successful Medicare selling season, including the TRS conversion, all position us well for 2013.","We continue to advance our efforts to transform the network model with our Accountable Care Solutions business. And we announced our agreement to acquire Coventry Health Care, creating a company with over $50 billion in pro forma revenue, over $4 billion in EBITDA and over $2 billion in parent level cash flow in 2012.","Aetna's fourth quarter and full year financial results are a testimony to the power of our diversified portfolio and its ability to deliver sustainable results. Underlying these results, we ended the year with over 18.2 million medical members, reflecting strong and continued growth across multiple products, and its full year Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.1%, at the low end of our initial guidance range for 2012.","Aetna's business segment operating expense ratio was below 19% for the year, as we continue to focus on expense management while investing in our business for the future. Pretax operating margins were 8.7% last year, at the high end of our high single-digit operating margin target and among the highest operating margins of any of our diversified managed care peers.","Finally, 2012 was another strong year of excess cash generation, enabling us to meaningfully increase our dividend and repurchase 32.3 million shares or over 9% of our shares outstanding.","Aetna's solid finish to 2012 and strong positioning as we enter 2013 gives us increased confidence as we reaffirm our 2013 operating earnings per share guidance of at least $5.40.","Before I turn the call over to Joe to discuss our results and guidance in greater detail, I would like to discuss Aetna's growth outlook, how we are realigning our business to drive growth and briefly comment on the macro environment.","At our Investor Conference in December, we outlined 6 critical components of the Aetna growth story: Aetna's diversified portfolio businesses can grow predictably; our Large Group Commercial business can grow profitably; Aetna's government franchise is a growth engine; Small Group and Individual are modest contributors to our consolidated earnings and represent an opportunity for future growth; Accountable Care Solutions is gaining traction and enhancing our core business; and Coventry is a strategically and financially attractive acquisition.","This morning, as part of our continuing commitment to drive improved execution on these growth initiatives, we announced on organizational realignment. While many of our customers are national, the delivery of health care is local. Our realigned structure will allow us to support decision-making deeper in the organization and close to the people who know our customers best, whether they are national or local customers.","After 6 years as Aetna's Chief Financial Officer, Joe Zubretsky will assume broader operating responsibilities in executing our strategic priorities, becoming head of Aetna's national businesses. Joe has been an exceptional CFO, managing through a difficult period in the industry and the economy, while maintaining a relentless drive to increase shareholder value through advanced capital management. Joe's in-depth understanding of our core business makes him uniquely qualified for this new role, as he assumes responsibility for a broader portfolio of businesses.","This portfolio will now include Aetna's flagship National Accounts franchise, representing nearly half of our medical membership; our network and medical management operations; and our Pharmacy Benefit Management and Behavioral Health businesses.","These new responsibilities are in addition to Joe's continuing leadership of our Strategy and Corporate Development teams and our emerging businesses, including Health Information Technology businesses and Accountable Care Solutions.","This realignment not only places a strong leader at the helm of some of our largest businesses, but reinforces our commitment to transform the network model by aligning provider and payer incentives to achieve improved outcomes and lower costs.","Shawn Guertin will become Aetna's Chief Financial Officer effective February 25. Shawn has been an integral part of the finance team over the last 2 years and was a critical resource during our evaluation of Coventry, where he was previously CFO for approximately 5 years. Shawn will be a key member of our executive leadership team at Aetna, reporting directly to me.","Karen Rohan, who has become an increasingly valuable member of my senior team since joining Aetna last year, will also assume additional responsibilities, becoming head of Aetna's local and regional businesses. Karen's responsibilities will include leadership for the company's Individual, Small Group and Middle Market businesses; the company's field organization and local infrastructure; and Aetna's Group businesses.","These businesses represented over $20 billion of revenue in 2012 and would approach almost $30 billion of revenue pro forma for the Coventry acquisition. Aligning these important businesses under one leader will help facilitate our integration with Coventry, which Karen is responsible for executing.","Finally, after 27 years in the industry and almost 2 decades at Aetna, Frank McCauley will be retiring from Aetna later this year. Frank has been a distinguished leader at Aetna, beginning his career in our Medicare business and moving on to successfully lead a wide variety of regional and national businesses to profitable growth. Most recently, Frank served as a member of our executive committee and led Aetna's Commercial businesses, including National Accounts, Individual, Small Group and Middle Markets. Until his retirement later this year, Frank will continue to work with me on a number of initiatives, including preparing the company for health care reform. We wish him the best in his future endeavors.","We believe these changes will ensure that we have Aetna's strongest leaders in place to drive the execution of our growth strategy and better align our leadership as we look to close the Coventry acquisition later this year.","Let me highlight some of the areas in our growth strategy where we have demonstrated recent success. Our diversified book of business is producing membership growth again, having grown in each of the last 3 consecutive quarters, and we now project that we will grow medical membership again in the first quarter of 2013 to approximately 18.3 million members.","In our large group Commercial business, despite a challenging economy and labor market, we are pleased to report that in the first quarter of 2013, we project that our underlying Commercial ASC membership will grow by approximately 25,000 members after adjusting for the TRS Medicare Advantage conversion. This result is due to continued improvement in our National Accounts outlook, including a strong open enrollment season and continued growth in our network access products. After 2 consecutive years of membership losses in our Commercial ASC business, we are very pleased with this projected result.","In our Large Group Commercial Insured business, we continue to project that membership will decline in the first quarter of 2013. After the first quarter, we expect modest membership growth over the remainder of the year, partially driven by our Accountable Care Solutions relationships.","Importantly, we believe we can continue to generate revenue and profit growth in 2013 in this business, as we price to medical cost trend and manage to our target margin. We remain committed to our disciplined pricing model, and when faced with a choice, we will continue to favor achieving target margins over membership growth.","Moving to our Government businesses. We just completed a successful Medicare selling season. Based on the strength of our January 1 enrollment, we now project that our Medicare Advantage membership will increase by approximately 175,000 members in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of 45,000 members over our previous guidance. This growth is driven by the TRS conversion, which will add 100,000 members and approximately $1.2 billion in incremental revenue in 2013; continued sales success with other Group Medicare Advantage accounts, which will add another 50,000 members; and a successful open enrollment season for Individual Medicare Advantage, resulting in growth of approximately 25,000 members.","Additionally, our Medicare Supplement business continues to perform well, having grown membership by 46% in 2012 and exhibiting strong momentum in the first quarter of 2013, with growth projected of an additional 45,000 members.","These successes are a testament to the strength of our Medicare products, relationships and distribution, and speak to the value we continue to offer our customers while maintaining our target margins.","I would also like to touch on our Small Group and Individual businesses. As we discussed at our recent Investor Conference, our overall earnings exposure to these businesses is modest. Further, the proposed Coventry acquisition will enhance our capabilities in these businesses without meaningfully changing our overall earnings exposure.","Our exchange strategy will be defined by a measured approach, as we explore whether we can reasonably earn our cost of capital in these marketplaces. We continue to believe that if exchanges are successful and profitable, they will represent an upside opportunity for Aetna in 2014.","We are also making great progress in executing on our strategy of transforming the network model, and in turn, making health care more accessible and affordable. Aetna continues to be a leader in enabling providers to change their business model from episodic acute care management to population management, which allows them to convert their volume-based reimbursement to value-based reimbursement.","Aetna's strategy is designed to obtain the most competitive cost structure in the marketplace, which we then package into higher-quality, lower-cost insured and self-insured products, which already have and will continue to drive membership growth.","To date, Aetna has signed 17 accountable care collaboration agreements, with 32 letters of intent in place and a pipeline of over 200 opportunities. In the fourth quarter, Aetna signed 5 new accountable care agreements, as we align our interest with marquis partners and drive growth in our core business.","Our recently announced agreement with Memorial Hermann continues to advance this strategy and includes: a more coordinated personalized experience for patients with cost savings for members who use providers in the Memorial Hermann accountable care network; a new payment model to reward physicians for meeting quality, efficiency and patient satisfaction measures; and a Medicare provider collaboration arrangement for Medicare Advantage members, including our TRS membership.","I am very pleased with the progress we have made in our Accountable Care Solutions business to date, and we remain confident in our ability to grow to 30 ASC partnerships in 2013, encompassing approximately 375,000 members and $1.5 billion in revenues.","Before I conclude and pass the call on to Joe, I wanted to say a word about the fiscal cliff and ongoing deficit reduction debates. As you know, I am an advocate for a long-term plan in Washington that will secure the fiscal health of our nation and provide certainty to the business community. As both the President and members of Congress have acknowledged, entitlement reform is the key to solving our nation's fiscal crisis. And the largest of these entitlement programs relate to health care.","As solutions are negotiated to address these fiscal issues, changes to government-sponsored programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are likely, and we continue to believe that Managed Care Organizations can provide solutions that help address these challenges.","In particular, I would highlight that Medicare Advantage, which has growing bipartisan support, can act as a viable solution to reform the Medicare program, providing enhanced quality, benefits and access for seniors, while reducing costs and achieving superior outcomes.","We believe Aetna's strong Medicare and Medicaid portfolios, enhanced by both the proposed Coventry acquisition and our Accountable Care Solutions strategy, position us well to succeed in this period of change.","In summary, as we begin 2013, I am confident in our strategic direction and particularly, our execution, our ability to manage through the legislative and regulatory changes associated with health care reform, our ability to maintain our pricing discipline and grow membership over the course of 2013 and our 2013 operating EPS projection of at least $5.40.","I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Joe to provide insight into our fourth quarter results and our 2013 outlook. Joe?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, Aetna reported full year 2012 operating earnings per share of $5.13. Aetna's 2012 full year results demonstrate our focus on operational and financial execution across all aspects of our business, as we grew revenue by approximately 6% over 2011. We improved our full year business segment operating expense ratio by nearly 100 basis points, due to operating leverage from growth and continued discipline in controlling costs.","We continued to focus on capital management, raising our quarterly dividend by over 14% and repurchasing $1.4 billion of Aetna shares. We announced the proposed acquisition of Coventry, which will enhance our core businesses, increase our exposure to government programs, create synergy value and provide earnings accretion. We advanced our ACO strategy by launching over 100 products in 2012, leading to approximately 130,000 members under our Accountable Care Solutions arrangements at year end.","We delivered on our goal to begin converting 1.2 million Medicare-eligible members to Medicare Advantage with the TRS win, and we were awarded both dual eligible opportunities for which we did.","For 2012, operating earnings were just under $1.8 billion, and we realized a pretax operating margin of 8.7%, reflecting strong performance across all of our product lines, disciplined execution of our pricing and medical cost strategies and unit cost controls. Once again, we achieved our high single-digit operating margin target and produced a return on capital of over 12% and a return on equity of nearly 16%, both significantly in excess of our cost of capital.","Moving on to some of the key metrics highlighting our fourth quarter performance. We ended 2012 with over 18.2 million medical members, an increase of 64,000 members during the quarter, including growth of 48,000 Commercial ASC members and 37,000 Medicare Supplement members.","Fourth quarter 2012 revenue increased year-over-year by 5% to $9 billion, primarily due to higher Commercial Health Care premium and growth in our Medicare business. Our increase in Health Care premium included a net increase in Commercial premiums of approximately 3% into a 4.5% increase in premium yields, partially offset by volume declining by 1.5%. The increase in premium yields was a function of a 5.5% increase in rates, offset by a 1% decrease from mix. Health Care premium also reflected a 10% increase in the Medicare premium, primarily driven by membership growth in Medicare Advantage.","We also posted a 13% increase in Medicaid premium, due primarily to our in-state expansions.","Our fourth quarter total medical benefit ratio was 84.1%, including the impact of approximately $81 million before tax, a favorable prior period reserve development. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves, as we experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the fourth quarter across all of our businesses, primarily related to third quarter dates of service.","Additionally, our days claims payable were 45 days at the end of the quarter, down sequentially primarily due to changes in processing time and up 1 day from the fourth quarter of 2011.","There were 2 medical cost impacts in the fourth quarter of 2012 that deserve specific mention. Given our membership in areas affected by storm Sandy, we experienced lower-than-expected utilization in those geographies. Partially offsetting this impact were increased flu cost in the fourth quarter, as the flu season began earlier and was more severe than normal. Incorporating both of those impacts and based on our fourth quarter experience to date, Commercial medical cost trend projections for 2012 remain at 6.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points.","We continue to invest in innovation to improve health care delivery for our members and customers, to capitalize on opportunities for profitable growth and to improve productivity. Our fourth quarter 2012 business segment operating expense ratio was 19.7%, reflecting typical seasonal spending on open enrollment activities and the timing of certain investments, which we discussed on our third quarter call.","There were also other items reported in the fourth quarter, which were excluded from our operating results. These items totaled approximately $147 million after tax and included the previously announced proposed litigation settlement, Coventry-related transaction and integration cost and a loss on the early extinguishment of long-term debt.","The other items also included a severance charge related to job actions, the majority of which have already been completed as we naturally align our resources to areas of projected growth and appropriately size our business to best meet the needs of our customers. Additional information about these other items can be found in our fourth quarter 2012 press release and financial supplement.","The final area of our 2012 financial performance I will comment on relates to our investment portfolio, management of capital and cash flow generation. Aetna has a disciplined approach to managing our investment portfolio, focused on total return and preservation of capital. Fourth quarter net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $155 million.","As we continue to match the duration of our investments to expected liabilities in our portfolios, the current low interest rate environment puts downward pressure on portfolio yields and earnings. We expect this dynamic to persist throughout 2013.","Our capital generation was very strong in the quarter. We started the quarter with $450 million of liquidity at the parent. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $499 million. We repurchased 11 million shares for $493 million. We paid down outstanding commercial paper by $70 million. We raised $2 billion in long-term financing at attractive rates to fund the proposed Coventry transaction.","After other net uses, including our shareholder dividend and retirement of long-term debt, we ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and investments at the parent. Of this amount, $100 million represents core liquidity, with the remainder held to fund the Coventry acquisition.","Our basic share count was 327.6 million at December 31.","Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At December 31, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 38%, consistent with our guidance. Prior to the closing of the Coventry acquisition, we continue to target a risk-based capital ratio of approximately 300% of company action level.","Operating cash flow generation in the fourth quarter was excellent, as Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow was approximately 2x operating earnings. For the full year, operating cash flow was approximately 1.2x operating earnings, consistent with our projections.","Our 2012 results, combined with a solid start to 2013, give us increased confidence in our 2013 operating earnings per share guidance of at least $5.40 per share.","Our 2013 guidance is influenced by the following drivers: We are projecting first quarter total medical membership of approximately 18.3 million members, driven by growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement, partially offset by declines in Commercial ASC and Insured. The TRS Medicare Advantage conversion is projected to account for approximately 100,000 of the decline in Commercial ASC membership in the first quarter. Adjusting for this conversion, we now project Commercial ASC membership will grow by approximately 25,000 members in the first quarter of 2013.","Aetna's full year 2013 membership guidance remains unchanged at approximately 18.4 million medical members.","We remain confident in our projected revenue growth of approximately 9% in 2013. Any outperformance from our early Medicare wins may be offset by the potential for delays in our dual eligible contracts and the pending divestiture of Missouri Care.","We project that our full year Commercial medical benefit ratio will increase modestly in 2013 to 81.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Aetna's 2013 Commercial medical cost trend projections remain unchanged at 6.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points.","The Medicare medical benefit ratio is projected to increase from the mid-80s in 2012 to the mid- to high-80s in 2013. It is important to note, this increase in MBR is driven primarily by Aetna's Group Medicare Advantage business where we have credited favorable experience back to customers through the renewal process.","We project our operating expenses in 2013 to increase in dollar terms, as we continue to grow and invest in our businesses. However, we project the growth rate in total revenue to exceed the growth rate in operating expenses as we continue to focus on cost control measures. For 2013, our operating expense ratio is projected to be 18% to 18.5%, an improvement over 2012.","Aetna's pretax operating margin is projected to be 8%, plus or minus 25 basis points, consistent with our high single-digit target. As discussed at our Investor Conference, the projected downward pressure on our pretax operating margin is driven by mix shift in the crediting of favorable experience to our Large Group Insured customers, partially offset by operating expense leverage.","Finally, we project operating earnings in 2013 will approximate $1.75 billion, roughly flat with 2012.","In contrast to prior years, as we examine the quarterly progression of our 2013 forecast, it is worth noting that we project that operating earnings per share in the second half of the year will exceed operating earnings per share in the first half of the year. This pattern is partially a function of the timing of recovery of health insurance fees and taxes, which will ramp over the course of the year.","In addition, we currently project that our investment spending in 2013 will be more evenly spread over the year, in contrast to our heavy investment spending in the back half of 2012.","For 2013, we continue to project net dividends from subsidiaries of approximately $1.1 billion and deployable capital of approximately $500 million. An important driver of lower dividends from subsidiaries in 2013 is the strong top line growth that we are projecting and the statutory capital required to fund that growth.","We also recently competed our fourth Vitality Reinsurance arrangement at attractive pricing and with a 4-year duration. This new arrangement will replace a portion of our coverage that expires in December 2013. And therefore, we have not adjusted our subsidiary dividend guidance for this transaction.","Aetna's share count projections for 2013 also remain unchanged.","Before I conclude, I wanted to briefly discuss our pending acquisition of Coventry Health Care. We continued to work diligently with the Department of Justice and with state regulators towards final approvals of the transaction and continue to advance our integration readiness plans. We are pleased with our progress. As of today, we have obtained 18 of the 21 state approvals that are required to close the transaction.","We also recently announced that we have agreed to sell our Missouri Medicaid business called Missouri Care to WellCare. We expect the sale of Missouri Care to close in the next 90 days. And this sale represents another important milestone as we progress towards closing the Coventry transaction.","We remain on-track to close the transaction in mid-2013, and our integration teams stand ready if we are able to close at an earlier date.","I am pleased that a strong year such as 2012 will delineate my transition from Chief Financial Officer of Aetna. Shawn Guertin has been an exemplary leader on my finance team for the last 2 years, and I am confident I am leaving the financial management of the company in highly capable hands as I enter into the next stage of my career at Aetna.","Looking to 2013 and beyond, we believe we have the winning strategy in the marketplace. Our core business is executing well, and we are well positioned for sustainable growth. Our emerging businesses continue to work to transform the network model, improve our cost structure and drive additional membership growth. Following closing, the acquisition of Coventry will only serve to strengthen our current positions in the Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid businesses and add to earnings growth in the years to come. Finally, our capital generation remains strong and will only be stronger after the closing of the Coventry transaction. We believe our core business, supplemented by emerging business growth and effective capital deployment, will enable us to generate low double-digit operating earnings per share growth on average over time.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas F. Cowhey","Thank you, Joe. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Question just relates to the Commercial MLR increase. Consistent with what you guys have been saying and expected, but I'm just curious if you could break out how much was flu, what the positive impact, I guess, was -- of Sandy was. If there's any way to understand sort of the mix impact. And then maybe, were there any sort of true-up or thoughts around the rebates relative to what you paid last year?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Josh, with respect to the Commercial MBR, it was a pretty straightforward quarter with respect to items. As we said during our Investor Day in December that we are guiding to the lower end of the range of 81 to 81.5, and we came in at 81.1 for the year, which means the fourth quarter, in our estimation, was pretty much on what we expected. There was a little bit of uplift from the lack of utilization due to the storm-affected areas. And that was mostly offset by increase in early wave of the flu. But for the most part, the Commercial MBR we posted in the quarter of 83.4 was spot on our internal projections.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And no change in rebate relative to the previous year?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No. It would be -- as I said, out of period items and adjustments and true-ups had no impact on the MBR. Those are the 2 items that you should track.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then -- I'm sorry, just to sneak in one more. The return on equity you guys are posting about 16% for the full year, I'm just curious, as you think about the returns going forward, and maybe if you could think more pro forma with Coventry included, as your segments change around a little bit, would you expect pressure on those returns?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","I'm not sure I follow your question. Returns -- with respect to returns on capital?","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. You guys give sort of an ROE of 16% and a return on capital of, say, 12% or so this year. Would you expect those numbers to be sustainable going forward based on the change in your business mix?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Okay, now I understand the question. When we announced the Coventry acquisition, we had given you forward guidance that the Coventry acquisition itself had a high-teens ROE, which means if we're in the mid-teens today, there is ROE accretion due to the transaction. And one of the reasons is you're taking a well-margined company and financing 2\/3 of it with 2% money. So the ROE expands dramatically due to the leverage, the earnings accretion and the synergy value, that then gets harvested over time.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you, got you, okay. And then -- but the change in business mix to lower-margin business, though, in terms of your internal growth, you don't think that's enough to offset that?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No. The change in government mix from 20% to 30% has a small impact on margin mix, but not significant.","Mark T. Bertolini","And the Small Group and Individual business does not change our exposure to that market either.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, just let me follow up on Josh's question here around the fourth quarter results. So it looked like there was a fair amount more seasonality in 2012 in the fourth quarter than we had seen in 2011. By my math, it's about 200 basis points from third quarter to fourth quarter, the increase. I'm just wondering if you can talk about the drivers of the seasonality there and just reiterate your level of comfort in terms of what you're seeing on price cost break [ph] going into '13.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","We saw nothing in the fourth quarter from a yield perspective or a medical cost perspective that changes our outlook for 2013. In fact, it gives us more confidence that the trend yield spread we project for 2013 will be achieved. As I said, the only 2 items that caused noise in the quarter were the lack of utilization from Sandy and increased flu. But other than that, the quarter was pretty much as planned. And the seasonality, again, the back-ended utilization due to the increased -- the preponderance of consumer-driven health plans, the increase in deductibles, that continues to have a sloping effect that every single year, that slope increases. And so, it's nothing more than that.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then my last question is just, as you think about 2014, I know it's pretty early in '13, but your peers have been increasingly optimistic around their ability to grow earnings next year. And I wonder if you could share your early view on 2014 and walk us through some of what you think kind of the key headwinds and tailwinds by business segment, if you can.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Sure, Justin. And it is early, and we're not going to really give anymore guidance than we already gave you at our Investor Day. But if you recall what we said, very clearly, we gave a long-term earnings per share growth view of at least double-digit earnings per share growth. And we said that was over a 5-year period, including any impact from headwinds in 2014. And so, if you look at those items, there's a lot of speculation about the ability of the industry to collect the taxes and fees due to health care reform. Early on, we see our ability to include those in rates and get them accepted as being favorable. But it's way too early to call exactly what the success will be in collecting that from customers. We feel good that the minimum MLRs in the Medicare business will be a non-event for the industry. And don't forget, as we integrate Coventry, in the first full year of integration, we'll have $0.45 of accretion, which is expected to be 2014, and $0.90 of accretion in 2015. And those numbers were not included in our base projection of double-digit earnings per share growth. So we do have confidence in that long-term projection we gave you, but we're not giving specific guidance on the 2014 year itself.","Mark T. Bertolini","And nor was Coventry included in our forward guidance either.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. So if I -- just if I can put together some quick math, I mean, this year, you're growing about 6% EPS from $5.10 to $5.40. And you're going to hit a 5-year CAGR, which I think you said at the Investor Day of 10% over 5 years through '17? You're going 6% this year. Could earnings be much worse than flat next year x Coventry and still get to that 10% over a 5-year period?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Well, again, we're not giving any particular guidance on 2014. But I will say, if you go back and look at our track record of deploying capital, the excess cash flow generation of the business, particularly as combined with Coventry, which will produce pro forma $2 billion of parent company cash flow, you can get the majority of that growth rate through deployment of capital. And therefore, you only have to grow operating earnings at a modest rate to hit the double-digit growth rate.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Carl McDonald with Citi.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Interested in the time line that you typically see on new products. So when you design a product and submit it to regulators, how long does that generally take to get approved, and obviously thinking about context of 2014 and exchange products and the time line that we're looking at to get everything up and running?","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, Carl, I think it depends on a couple of factors. Number one, the state within which you are trying to seek that approval; and number two, the number of other plans trying to seek approval at the same time. We find it varies from state to state depending on the workload they have and the number of people that they resource to handle this. So we've been very careful to get into the front of the queue quickly with our view of the products we need in the marketplace. But generally, we can get them approved in a quarter over -- usually, within 90 days. But again, there's going to be a crush of product filings as we get near health care reform and particularly, October 1. And so, I think that could slow things down.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then second question is you've been vocal about Individual premiums increasing in 2014. At the same time, you've also been active building narrow networks, expanding ACOs. So as you net those 2 together, I'd be interested in sort of how you think that translates to overall premium increase in the Individual market in '14.","Mark T. Bertolini","We don't want to tip our hand on where we are going to be from a price point standpoint, particularly against our competitors. So we've been pretty straightforward about what we think the effects of the Affordable Care Act are on premiums. Obviously, as you can see from our ACO business and our narrow network business that we're getting substantive discounts from the providers with which we're contracting. We believe that offsets a portion of that increase, but not all of it. Secondly, in the Medicare space, we view having half of our Medicare Individual enrollment in ACOs or Medicare collaboration pilots in 2014.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When you talked about 20% to 30% average increases potentially in 2014, is that on a same product basis?","Mark T. Bertolini","No. That's -- it's definitely not on a same product basis because one of the key drivers of the increase is moving from a below 60% actuarial benefit to that 60%. So it isn't on a same product basis, definitely not.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess maybe I asked the question the wrong way. Just meaning, when you say 20% to 30%, that doesn't factor in any meaningful provider savings, or that does include something in the...","Mark T. Bertolini","No, the 20% to 30% we've been talking about has been largely on the basis of the effects of the Affordable Care Act.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe I could ask a question about on your Medicare Supplemental business. So you had 46% growth in 2012, which is huge. And sorry, I haven't calculated the growth rate that you expect from the 45,000 you're adding in the first quarter. But can you just comment on the dynamic there in the sense that you're growing a lot faster on Med Sup than on the retail Individual MA side? It's not meant as a criticism, just curious what trends you think were contributing to that.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Matt, sure, I'll comment on that. The Medicare Supplement business of Genworth was pretty much languishing when we bought it. Under that corporate umbrella, they had a hard time with new sales. Persistency was an issue. And the halo effect of the Aetna ownership has been fantastic from an agent retention, attraction and particularly, from a persistency rate point of view. So it's not only new business, but an improvement in the persistency rate that's allowing us to grow membership. Keep in mind, it's off a small base, and we still haven't yet begun the process of making our full suite of Medicare products available to those agents. And that should bode well for Part D growth through that channel, as well as future Supplement growth. So I would just say, it was an asset that was pretty much languishing under former ownership, and it's really come alive under Aetna ownership and management.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fantastic. If I could ask a follow-up on a different topic. And I know it's early, but as you are no doubt in discussions with -- at least, with large employers about 2014 and small ones as well, any more observations you can make on whether you think some of the large employers may strategically drop coverage going into 2014 ahead of the exchanges or if that will be very limited, and then also on the Small Group side?","Mark T. Bertolini","On the large group side, we don't see a whole lot of activity about dropping coverage. What we will see are the emergence of private exchanges, but that will get slow -- that will be a slow start in 2014. And so, we think that's actually opportunities we discussed on the last call, as large employers will get private exchanges as a way of converting ASO membership into fully insured membership. We think it gives their employees more choice, but also gives them an opportunity to lock in their health care cost over a longer period of time. So we think that's what's going to happen in the large market. In the small group market, we don't see a whole lot of impetus for small groups to drop coverage and push their people into the exchanges unless those employees are getting a lot of subsidy. And so -- or I'm sorry, for them to go into shop exchanges because those employees are going to get -- if they have a lot of subsidy. So we don't see small group exchanges growing quickly. We do see some potential for small groups to drop coverage and move their employees in. We're also seeing a lot of discussion around reducing hours on employees, below 30 hours, to avoid having to provide health care coverage at all.","Operator","Our next question is from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys help us understand the factors you're thinking about as you look forward to 2014? I think you said that you expect to be in 15 exchange markets. You're in 20 individual states now, and then Coventry has theirs. So it looks like there are some states you're thinking about sitting out. Should I be thinking of the 15 exchanges as 15 states, or are you thinking of 2 exchanges per state? And then again, what factors could change your enthusiasm towards or away from these exchanges?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Sure, Christine. Yes, we said we're going to be in 15 markets. That represents pretty much our entire footprint. There will be some states that we haven't made public yet that will not be participating. And we've chosen those states based on the franchise and brand recognition we have in those states, the density we have, the provider relationships and contracts and regulatory environments that are amenable to making sure that the entire cost of the product can be loaded into rates. We also believe that the 3Rs will help mitigate the risks of adverse selection. But given all that, we're still approaching the exchanges with a great deal of caution, step into them lightly, allocate capital very deliberately and cautiously. And when and if we can prove that a sustainable margin that produces an adequate return on capital can be achieved, then we might turn on the spigot more aggressively. But a very cautious approach, and we believe our new colleagues or potential colleagues at Coventry sort of feel the same way.","Mark T. Bertolini","We see, Christine, the off exchange market in the Individual segment being about 20% of the population, so we will be in places where we are not on exchange but still in the Individual market.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then Texas RS market, the $1.2 billion in revenue, you've upped your expectation there, I think from $800 million originally. So it looks like you got good take up there. How is that developing in terms of early trend experience since it's such a large account?","Mark T. Bertolini","We'd -- I mean, we took care of that population in the self-funded market for a lot of years, so we have a good understanding of the trend within the self-funded product that they offered. It's just way too early. I mean, we're in the first 3 weeks of January here, still trying to figure out all of the -- all the various revenue lines we have, let alone, from what the experience is in any of the groups. But we are obviously going to keep a close eye on it.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Did you get the members you thought you'd get? And is the profile of the membership what you thought, and the drug trend looking pretty good?","Mark T. Bertolini","The membership is what we thought we got, plus some more. So we've got some membership than we thought we were going to get. The open enrollment period was good, and it's along the lines we expected.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, just a question on the Commercial risk guidance for the remainder of the year to generate some modest growth. And just wondering if you're including any assumptions around some attrition in the Individual business in the back half of the year in that forecast ahead of exchange implementation in 2014.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Scott, our membership forecast for 2013, first of all, we've only said that we're going to end the first quarter with 18.3 and then 100,000. We really haven't given any guidance about where the 100,000 comes from for the balance of the year, but it's pretty much spread across all products. We're not looking for dramatic growth in Small Group and Individual for the balance of the year. That's not where it's going to come from.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So it'd be biased a bit more towards some modest growth in the Large Group side, potentially offset by some slower growth dynamics in ISG?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Yes.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up question, just on the percentage of pools or premiums in rebate status. Last year, I know you had given us an update that you had around 20% of the pools and 25% of the premiums in rebate status. And just now that the year's wrapped up, just interested if you can update those figures, just given that you did have around a 320 basis point increase in the Commercial MLR this year.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Scott, we probably won't talk about the actual number until it becomes public information. But suffice it to say that rebates, rebate accruals, true-ups to rebates were just not a significant item in this year's financial outcome, including the quarterly progression. Obviously, the rebates are a lot less than they were initially because if you recall, in the second year, we at least had the ability to price closer to the minimum and not pay a rebate. So a lot less of an impact this year than in the first year the rebates were in vogue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you remind us again the pacing of your Individual and Small Group Commercial renewals throughout the year? And do you actually see any potential to early renew some of the -- your typical 1-1 business in late 2013 ahead of Reform taking effect?","Mark T. Bertolini","I didn't catch your last part of your question. You broke up, Melissa.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Oh, sorry. I just said -- to repeat the whole thing. Can you remind us again the pacing of your Individual and Small Group renewals throughout the year? And then, do you see any potential to early renew some of your typical 1-1 Small Group business in late 2013 before Reform takes effect?","Mark T. Bertolini","Melissa, Individual and Small Group is pretty flat throughout the year, and that's by -- just by nature of the way they buy. And we are seeing some of that activity about early renewal, as we think about how we relate the fees and taxes going into their rates. And so, we will be anticipating some of that behavior, and we'll be engaging where our clients are interested in moving ahead in that way. So we've got that into our pricing models, as well as some of our competitors.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then, kind of a different topic. You sound really confident in some of your commentary about 2014 or pretty confident that you can price for the tax in your Commercial book. How are you feeling about absorption of the industry tax on your government books, particularly like Medicaid and Medicare? I guess, for Medicaid, do you think the states are leaning towards building that into rates? And then on Medicare Advantage, do you think there's enough excess benefit over Medicare to absorb that into benefit design changes?","Mark T. Bertolini","So, yes, I think on the Medicaid front, Melissa, we are not going to get the fees and taxes out of the state governments unless we have a very robust recovery in the economy and the states feel flushed with their budgets. So I would expect that to be a tough discussion and a tough fight moving forward. On the Medicare side, we believe, as with a whole host of other impacts that will impact Medicare revenue through the next few years, that we have the opportunity through medical management; through benefit design; through our provider re-contracting, particularly ACOs and narrow networks; our Medicare collaborations where we expect 50% of our Individual membership to be in those groups; and through the star ratings, that we can absorb some of those fees. Now we'll obviously have some opportunity in the SG&A line as we further automate to offset some of those. But we believe that we're going to -- our approach right now is to absorb those.","Operator","Next question is Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","You've had some great success with the National Accounts segment in '13, and I was wondering what's changed so far as far as messaging to consultants on this product, maybe in terms of discounts. This time last year, you were saying that you were within about 200 basis points of the market leader in 24 of your 30 top markets. So maybe if you could talk about how you're doing in comparison to that and thinking about the mix of incoming opportunities versus outgoing compared to last year.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Sure, Sarah. We are projecting to be within 2 discount points of the leader in 26 of the top 30 markets in 2012. And that covers -- those 30 markets cover over 80% of the National Account membership. And that should just get better. And so, we decided to play the discount game because sometimes those optics are important to customers, so we're working hard at narrowing that gap. But in the meantime, we continue to invest heavily in total effective net cost that it's really what you end up paying, not a unit price discount that matters. And I think the turn in our membership trajectory here in 2013 and hopefully '14 recognizes the fact that customers that were very financially stressed during the economic downturn now see the long-term investments paying off. Many of those customers left to get Blues base discount and have now returned because their trend increased beyond what was expected. And now they're returning to the total med effective cost model. So we're working down both tracks. We're going to narrow that gap as we already have, and we continue to invest it heavily in total effect of net cost.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great, so much more stable pricing. That's very helpful. And last question here is, when I think about the timing of heading towards the exchanges, I know one of the things that companies are still working on is setting up what your unit cost bases will look like as far as provider contracting. So how do you think about the timing of when you'll know what your provider contracting costs look like versus when you would have to submit bids for exchanges?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","That's a great question. Our company philosophy and our strategy is to always make sure you know what your unit cost of goods sold is before you file rates. And now the timing is going to get pushed here, right, because we have to start filing and the exchanges are going to be open in October. But we are furiously at contracting with providers, segregating the exchange contracts out from the base Commercial contract. We're not going to talk about what rates we're trying to obtain, but we believe that the majority of the unit cost discounts we need to have contracted will be contracted before we file rates.","Operator","Our next question is Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, first question, can you just help us maybe break out the favorable development by product line in terms of Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid, or at least directionally?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","All product lines were positive during the quarter. The majority of the development was from the Commercial line of business.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, just wanted to go back to the commentary around the industry tax for Medicaid specifically. Maybe I'm misremembering, I thought historically, the working assumption was that states would sort of incorporate the tax into rates. Did I just sort of not hear that right? Is there sort of a change in sort of your opinion on that? Just general commentary there.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","To be clear, the attempt will be made, as we said early on, to collect every dollar of tax from every dollar of premium that serves as the base on which we incur the tax. What Mark was referring to, given the stressed state budgets, that's going to be a real difficult negotiation. And we're not projecting that we're going to recover 100% of the taxes from our Medicaid customers. The intent is there. I assure you, the taxes will show up on every rate proposal we submit, but then the negotiations will be difficult.","Operator","Our next question is Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I don't know if Shawn is on the line or not, but Mark, you kind of highlighted that he has been very active on the capital deployment. So I wanted to see if Shawn had any different views about how to maximize the capital structure, or if there's anything else that he really thinks about as being his primary focus as being the CFO.","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, Shawn won't be joining us for this call. We're going to let Joe close things up, and we'll have Shawn available on the next call as we move forward. But I can assure you, Shawn and Joe have worked very closely together on our capital deployment strategies. And they've worked together in coming up with those strategies and implementing those strategies. And I'm sure Shawn, as he -- as bright as he is, as he comes up with new ideas, working with all of us, we'll make sure that we're on the leading edge of capital deployment as a company.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Then I guess a couple of quick follow-ups then. You've mentioned that G&A is going to be more evenly spread throughout the year. I would think you're going to have a whole new open enrollment period now on the Commercial side. What -- I guess, how do you think about those extra costs? I would think that would kind of lean towards another year of back-end loading on that front.","Mark T. Bertolini","I think we will have some back-end loading. But I think the way to think about our G&A structure for the remainder of the year is we're going to be prepared early for exchanges, but more importantly -- and those start October 1, but more importantly, the second half of our year is going to be devoted to integrating Coventry effectively. That is, if we do that really well, that does more for us than anything else, we'll invest in the last half of the year. That would be a below-the-line expense, so it won't show up in our SG&A ratio next year -- for this year.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just to go back to the point about the Medicaid difficulty in passing through the industry fee, do you think -- are you still able to earn the rate of return that you want if you're not able to pass through the entire industry fee? Does that make you think differently about the Medicaid business? Or do you think about it as subsidizing that with maybe more profits on the Medicare or the Medicaid -- Commercial side of things?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No, we really don't believe in cost subsidy of product profitability, but I would say, and you can look at the industry results, Medicaid margins today are at the lower end of the range, just barely in excess of the cost of capital. But with all of the unmanaged lives going managed and all of the unmanaged dual lives going managed, we believe that expanding footprint today at barely above cost of capital is a prudent growth investment and only gives us upside in the future to expand those margins into the mid-single digits from the low single digits.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So your view is that absent this fee, you might have been able to expand margins in the business as you gain density and leverage G&A. Instead, you think that the industry fee is going to kind of keep margins more stable with where they've been historically.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Yes, our projection is that the margins will still produce returns in excess of the cost of capital. And yes, the fees will put pressure on that.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then one last really quick question. I thought you said that -- at the TSR conversion, I think you said it's 100,000 lives. Was it -- is that up from where it was before? Was that 85,000 lives last time? And what's the delta there?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Yes, your memory is good. That's correct.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So what's the delta there?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Just more uptake into the new product.","Operator","Our next question is Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A couple questions on the Medicaid side. I guess, if I think about Medicaid margins, typically in the 2 to 3, 1 to 4, however you want to describe them, I mean, it doesn't seem like if you load in the industry tax on a pro rata basis that, that's going to -- it will be barely profitable. So I guess, am I thinking about it -- is there something incorrect in the way I'm thinking about the math on the Medicaid side?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No, I think you're right. I think the pre-health care reform tax returns are in the low single digits. But we plan to either offset the impact of the taxes with medical cost savings or SG&A savings and make sure that in the near term, we can get that book of business to earn its cost of capital. Again, you're not going to grow a very profitable and attractive dual-eligible population without the TANF footprint. And so, think of barely earning your cost of capital as the price to pay to expand your footprint to get access to the high-acuity populations. We think it's a really, really good investment.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe this is a question for Mark. But I guess, when you're in D.C. -- I mean, is there a realization at the federal level that obviously there's a circular impact here? And I guess, I would -- if you're comfortable, I'd love to get your odds on this actually getting carved out on the Medicaid side.","Mark T. Bertolini","I think both Medicare and Medicaid will come front and center as we have those 2 programs and Social Security is the only thing left on the table to solve our nation's deficit. Now the question will be, and the big driver of Medicaid is dual eligibles, can we do a more formal program for dual eligibles across the country? But getting the fee carved out as an issue, I know it's on the table, but it's not going to be one of the top priority items to solve relative to the fiscal cliff.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then one more, if I could, just on the Sandy impact. I know sometimes you see events like this on the facility side, and it's normally just a delay in the procedures. And I guess, I would love to get your sense as to how confident you are that you didn't just see people delay, at least the electorate procedures, for 1 month or 2 and that you haven't -- just based on the lag in the claims data that, that's not going to hit up later in the quarter and we'll see that in Q1.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","In our accounting for the fourth quarter, we fully contemplated the potential for a rebound or a boomerang effect from the forward utilization rather than forgone utilization. So it's a good comment, but we fully contemplated that book in the fourth quarter result.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm going to take it back to where we started, on the Commercial medical loss ratio. You wouldn't have been forecasting the favorable prior-period development in the quarter. And then if I look sequentially, especially if I take out the PPD, because it was very big in third quarter of 2011, your seasonal pattern seems to have gotten much worse. And even if the MLR was where you expected it to be, it looks like the seasonal pattern got worse in the fourth quarter. Can you talk to that, and give us more comfort as to why your MLR looks much worse sequentially and year-over-year relative to the way it looked in the third quarter and compared to the fact that you had PPD in the quarter?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Well first of all, I think it was unusually good in the third quarter, number one. And number two, again, we fully contemplated the seasonality impact of high-deductible plans and deductibles and projecting the result. And we're very comfortable that we hit our internal forecast, which produced that 81.1% for the year, which is exactly what we expected.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So should we expect the seasonal pattern to increase again next year the way it increased this year?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","We have internal forecast and that -- we haven't made those public yet. But we are -- we will soon give you guidance on what the seasonal pattern might look like for next year, maybe at one of our upcoming conferences.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I believe you said you had 45,000 more Medicare Advantage members than you'd originally thought you'd have at the beginning of the year, yet you didn't take your guidance up for 2013 for that incremental -- fairly large amount of membership, and can you explain why?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Sure. We did not take our revenue forecast up from the 9% year-over-year increase in spite of the fact that we have a higher Medicare membership. We also believe that there is high potential for delay in the 2 dual eligible contracts that we sold for Ohio and Illinois, and of course, the sale of Missouri Care, which will take place and was never in our forecast. That's why we're keeping our revenue forecast the same as original, and therefore, not increasing our earnings guidance.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And the earnings side of that, you think the Medicare business would be more profitable than some of the dual stuff that you would have otherwise picked up?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Yes, I mean, in addition to that, I mean, it's just way too early to start forecasting pennies here and pennies there. We're very confident in our outlook for the year. Everything we learned in the fourth quarter validates the data points on which our 2013 is projected, and it just gives us increased confidence that we're going to achieve those numbers.","Thomas F.

And with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC, including our 2012 Form 10-K, our first quarter 2013 Form 10-Q and our second quarter 2013 Form 10-Q when filed. We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company's performance that are non-GAAP measures in our second quarter 2013 financial supplement and our 2013 guidance summary.

Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in nonpublic forums is limited, so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini","Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported second quarter results that included approximately 2 months of performance from the Coventry acquisition. Bolstered by the acquisition and strong underlying performance in our Commercial business, Aetna achieved medical membership of 22 million, quarterly operating revenue of $11.6 billion and quarterly adjusted operating earnings of $583 million. Each of these metrics represent historic highs for our organization and a strong foundation to continue to expand our franchise to best meet the needs of both our customers and our shareholders.","Our diversified business model produced another solid quarter. Operating earnings per share of $1.52, a 16% increase over the second quarter of 2012. Pretax operating margins were 8.4%, consistent with our long-term targets. And we continued to generate substantial parent cash flow that we deployed to complete the Coventry acquisition, pay our shareholder dividend and repurchase 7.2 million shares in the quarter.","Our first half results give us increased confidence in our full year performance. And this morning, we raised our 2013 operating earnings guidance to $5.80 to $5.90 per share. At its midpoint, our revised 2013 guidance would represent 14% operating EPS growth in 2013 and 17% compound annual growth from 2010 through 2013, a 3-year growth rate that is well in excess of our diversified managed care peers.","At our investor conference in December, we outlined 6 critical tenets that support the overall Aetna growth story. Aetna's diversified portfolio of businesses can grow predictably. Our Large Group Commercial business can grow profitably. Aetna's Government franchise is a growth engine. Small Group and Individual are modest contributors to our consolidated earnings and represent an opportunity for future growth. Accountable Care Solutions is gaining traction and enhancing our core business. And Coventry is a strategically and financially attractive acquisition, which can accelerate growth across multiple lines of business.","I will now discuss some of the successes we had during the quarter that demonstrate the execution of our growth strategy. Aetna's second quarter again exemplifies the strength of a diversified portfolio of businesses. Strong performance in our Commercial Insured and Medicaid businesses allow us to absorb the impacts of sequestration, as well as some isolated pressure in our Medicare business, and still raise our operating EPS guidance range for the third time this year. As I mentioned, the second quarter benefited from strong performance in our Commercial Insured business with strong premium growth and medical cost trends that continued to develop favorably. While structural changes in the health system may be playing a modest role in the low-cost trend we are experiencing, we continue to believe that this low utilization is largely driven by the weak economy. This view is validated by a recent Kaiser Family Foundation study, which concluded that over 75% of the decline in recent health spending trends can be attributed to broader changes in the economy. We continue to price our products with a bias toward margins over membership and with a view that utilization will begin to rebound from the current low levels.","During the quarter, we also completed the largest transaction in the company's history with the acquisition of Coventry Health Care. The Coventry acquisition builds upon Aetna's existing capabilities, expanding our local presence and shifting our mix of business toward higher-growth government programs. The combination positions Aetna to generate over $50 billion in operating revenue and $4.4 billion in EBITDA annually while providing services to an estimated 44 million people in nearly every country around the world. While we are still in the very early days of integration, we are pleased with our progress. Our integration teams are engaged and hard at work. Many of Coventry's employees have taken on key leadership roles in the combined organization.","Coventry's performance and our synergy realization are on track. And we now project that Coventry's contribution to 2013 operating EPS will be towards the high end of our $0.20 to $0.25 guidance range. While it is too early to give projections and guidance on 2014 performance and as we examine the specific challenges and opportunities we expect to see next year, in particular, our progress with the Coventry integration, we are increasingly confident that we will grow both operating earnings and operating EPS in 2014. Many uncertainties remain, but we believe we have the right strategic positioning to generate a positive result.","Moving on to our Government businesses. In Medicare, Aetna now serves over 3 million Medicare members as the third-largest national Medicare Advantage provider and the fifth-largest PDP provider. As we look to continue to profitably grow our Medicare Advantage membership, we are preparing to operate at parity with fee-for-service while maintaining our targeted returns on capital. As you know, Medicare Advantage rate pressures in 2014 will represent a meaningful challenge for the program.","In advance of submitting our 2014 Medicare Advantage bids in early June, we worked diligently to adjust our cost structures, processes and products by: reviewing our contractual arrangements with providers; evaluating the impact of enhanced care management and medical management, including our ACO initiatives and provider collaborations; examining our administrative costs; and where necessary, making changes to benefit plan design and premiums. Guided by our bias to protect margin over membership, we factored in our most recent views of our 2013 experience, our projected cost structure improvements and our targeted positioning into the 2014 Medicare bids we submitted in early June. On the whole, we believe that our 2014 bids, including those of Coventry, strike an appropriate balance in support of our members, the Medicare Advantage program and our shareholders.","I would also like to spend a few minutes discussing our strategy for exchanges, which we think about across 3 dimensions: first, public exchanges; second, multiparty private exchanges; and third, proprietary private exchanges. Let me begin with the public exchanges. We continue to take a cautious approach to our participation in the public exchanges as we evaluate the longer-term viability of these marketplaces. We hope to gain sufficient exposure through our early exchange experience to position ourselves to capture profitable membership in the initial years of the program. We have taken a prudent risk-based approach to both our overall exposure and exposure within a given marketplace. As we have stated previously, our strategy is to participate on the public exchanges on a limited basis. We are continuing to evaluate where Aetna and Coventry have submitted bids and are in the process of rationalizing our combined exchange participation. We continue to believe that public exchanges can represent a longer-term upside opportunity.","Aetna is also moving forward with participation in many of the multiparty private exchanges that are emerging today. While many existing private exchanges are self-funded, we believe over time these exchanges will provide a vehicle for employers to provide a defined contribution health benefit through a fully insured product. Aetna expects to participate in approximately 15 private exchanges in 2014.","In addition to participating in multiparty private exchanges, we are also developing our own proprietary exchange. Aetna's proprietary private exchange model will go beyond simple aggregation and focus on true population management. These tailored private exchanges can offer unique network configurations and medical management, which will make them particularly attractive to industry verticals. With Aetna proprietary exchanges, we will also be able to offer a rich, guided selling experience, where consumers will be able to select products and services that offer the highest value based on their individual needs. We believe it is these Aetna proprietary exchange models which may offer both consumers and employers the most value over the years to come.","Aetna continues to believe that provider collaboration is the vehicle for transformative change in the health care marketplace. We continue to view this value-based contracting across a spectrum, ranging from simple provider collaborations that include embedded case managers and some elements of pay-for-performance, to more advanced forms of collaboration that include integrated technology and case management, aligned incentives and true risk sharing. At our investor conference in December, we simplified these broad-based efforts into 3 categories and have continued to make progress across each of these dimensions. Our basic Medicare provider collaborations have grown by over 15% year-to-date and we now have 75 of these relationships nationally. Combined with our single-payer and multipayer Patient-Centered Medical Homes have grown by over 50%. And in the past quarter alone, Aetna signed 7 new accountable care agreements, bringing our total signed collaborations to 27. With 35 letters of intent and over 200 additional opportunities in the pipeline, we are now on track to exceed our goal of 30 ACO arrangements by year-end 2013.","It is important to remember that Aetna's Accountable Care Solutions, powered by Healthagen technologies, represent an advanced form of provider collaboration and risk sharing. As evidenced on our advanced capabilities, early this month, KLAS, an independent research of technology and solutions in the health care provider market, said that Aetna is having the most transformational accountable care relationships as compared to other payers. Additionally, one of our marquee Accountable Care Solution partners, Banner Health, just announced the results of their first year participating in the Medicare Pioneer ACO program. Through coordinated care with providers, advanced population health technology and supportive case management, the Banner Health Network achieved over $13 million of savings, which made them a top performer when compared to other pioneer organizations nationally.","Approximately 15% of an Aetna's standalone medical spend is paid through some form of value-based contract. And our goal is to more than triple that percentage by the end of 2017. We are proud of our efforts and achievements to date and remain convinced that we have the winning platforms and technology to transform the network model and bend the cost curve.","In summary, we are pleased with our progress and execution. Our Commercial Insured business is performing well, benefiting from lower-than-projected medical cost trends. Coventry is performing at the high end of our projections, giving us increased confidence in our 2013 and 2014 performance. Our initiatives to transform the network model are on track to exceed our projections for 2013. Our capital generation is strong, enhancing our flexibility to execute upon our strategic vision and return cash to shareholders. And we are able to raise our operating EPS guidance again today to range of $5.80 to $5.90 per share, projected results that would drive our 3-year compound annual growth rate well in excess of our long-term guidance.","I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide insight into our second quarter results and our updated 2013 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2013 operating earnings of $549 million and operating earnings per share of $1.52, a 16% increase over the second quarter of 2012. These strong operating results continue to be supported by solid revenue growth and operating margins. I'll begin with some comments on overall performance.","From a top line perspective, we are growing. During the second quarter, operating revenue increased by nearly 31% from the second quarter of 2012, primarily from the addition of Coventry. Organically, we grew operating revenue by over 7%, driven by Medicare membership increases and premium yield growth. We also grew medical membership by 3.7 million members with the acquisition of Coventry. Organically, membership was down slightly as Medicare membership growth was more than offset by the loss of one large ASC account and continued Commercial Insured membership losses.","From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our second quarter total medical benefit ratio was 82.5%, stable when compared to the prior year quarter, driven by strong performance in our Commercial business and improved performance in our Medicaid business. Our operating revenue growth, disciplined focus on costs and the initial realization of Coventry synergies have driven 100 basis points of year-over-year improvement in our operating expense ratio. And our pretax operating margin was 8.4% for the quarter, consistent with our target operating margin range.","From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. After adjusting for the timing of the Coventry acquisition, our days claims payable were 45 days at the end of the quarter, stable sequentially and up nearly 1 day from the second quarter of 2012. In addition, we experienced favorable prior-period reserved development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to 2013 performance. Our year-to-date favorable prior year's development is now $370 million. This figure includes not only the prior year's development on the Aetna book but also the prior year's development experienced on the Coventry book since the acquisition.","Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows in the second quarter were pressured by 2 tax payments, as well as items related to the Coventry acquisition, including: transaction and integration costs; the timing of certain Medicaid premium payments, which were subsequently received in early July; and some additional timing issues as a result of the mid-quarter close. Year-to-date on an adjusted basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow were almost 1x operating earnings. We continue to project that full year 2013 operating cash flows will be in excess of operating earnings. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing approximately 7.2 million shares in the quarter for $440 million and dispersing another $65 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. Year-to-date, Aetna has returned over $750 million of capital to our shareholders through these 2 programs. In short, we are pleased with our second quarter results, which we believe demonstrate the successful execution of Aetna's growth story and the value of a diversified portfolio.","I will now discuss the key drivers of second quarter performance in greater detail. The main driver of our strong operating performance this quarter and year-to-date is our Commercial Insured business. This is evident in both the Aetna and Coventry blocks of business. Our combined Commercial Insured business, which represents over 50% of our projected 2013 operating revenue, continue to post year-over-year revenue and underwriting margin growth despite continued underlying membership pressures. As before and especially as we look forward to the changes in 2014, we remain committed to fair and financially responsible pricing, where we favor margin over membership and price to underlying medical cost trends.","Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 79.1% for the quarter, an excellent result as medical trends continue to develop lower than our previous projections. Based on our updated experience, we now project that Aetna's standalone Commercial medical cost trends will be 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points, in 2013. Further, Coventry's Commercial medical cost trends are also developing favorably. As a result, we now project that our combined full year 2013 Commercial medical benefit ratio will be between 80% and 81%. Another important growth lever is our Government franchise. Both the Aetna and Coventry Medicare books of business continued to demonstrate growth in the second quarter. In total, our Medicare revenue increased 79% over the second quarter of 2012, a result of the Coventry acquisition as well as strong membership growth in Aetna's underlying Medicare business.","Our Medicare medical benefit ratio was 89.1% in the quarter, an increase of 130 basis points sequentially. This result reflects pressure from sequestration, as well as from 2 specific product offerings, largely driven by new member claim experience. The substantial majority of our Medicare business is performing quite well and consistent with our projections and we continue to project full year Medicare MBRs well within our guidance range but more towards the middle to upper end of our previously projected range. Importantly, the pressure in these 2 product offerings was known as we evaluated our 2014 Medicare bids.","Finally, in our Medicaid business, medical membership increased by 900,000 members in the quarter and premiums more than doubled on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the inclusion of Coventry. The underlying performance of the business was very good in the second quarter. Our Medicaid medical benefit ratio was 85.9%, an improvement from last year's second quarter. We also saw continued improvements in Kentucky this quarter. Our first half results put us on track to achieve the low end of our high 80s Medicaid MBR guidance range for the full year.","In regard to Kentucky Medicaid, in early July, Centene exited the program and their remaining membership was split between Aetna and one other participant in that program. Aetna was auto-assigned approximately 65,000 members from this transition. We currently project, based on Aetna's Kentucky Medicaid rate structure, that this new membership will be approximately breakeven in 2013. Financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of just under 40%. With the Coventry acquisition now closed, our risk-based capital ratio is approximately 285% of company action level in our regulated subsidiaries.","Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $2.6 billion. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $875 million. Net of incremental paydown, we issued $450 million of commercial paper. Using proceeds from our debt offerings and cash on hand, including approximately $900 million from Coventry, we spent approximately $4 billion to purchase Coventry's equity and pay transaction-related expenses. We repurchased 7.2 million shares for $440 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $65 million. After other uses, we ended the quarter with $200 million of cash at the parent representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 372.1 million at June 30.","Based on our year-to-date performance, this morning we raised our guidance range and we now project 2013 operating earnings of $5.80 to $5.90 per share. This increased guidance, which would represent growth of 14% over 2012 at the midpoint, reflects continued strong performance in our Commercial Insured business and improved performance in our Medicaid business, partially offset by the performance in our Medicare business. Aetna's adjusted operating EPS guidance range has also been updated to approximately $6.20 to $6.30 per share.","Additional elements of our 2013 guidance include the following. We are now projecting full year medical membership of over 22.1 million members. This projection represents growth of more than 150,000 members over the remainder of the year, driven primarily by Commercial ASC, Kentucky Medicaid and Medicare Supplement. We continue to project full year operating revenue to be approximately $47 billion. We now project that our full year Commercial medical benefit ratio will be between 80% and 81%, continuing to reflect both our pricing discipline and a favorable medical cost trend environment.","We continue to project our Medicare medical benefit ratio to be in the mid- to high 80s, consistent with our previous guidance range but with projected performance towards the mid- to upper end of that range. We continue to project that our 2013 operating expense ratio will be approximately 18%, representing nearly 100 basis points of improvement from 2012. This year-over-year improvement is the result of higher revenues and changes in business mix, as well as anticipated cost synergies. Aetna's pretax operating margin projection remains at 8%, plus or minus 25 basis points. We would note that as we examine our quarterly forecast for the remainder of the year and as we consider the timing of recovery of health insurance fees and taxes, which will ramp over the course of the year, we expect operating earnings per share to be more evenly distributed between the third and fourth quarters of 2013 than in prior years.","Finally, we continue to project operating earnings in 2013 will be approximately $2.1 billion. We currently project net dividends from subsidiaries of approximately $1.9 billion. After debt paydown, shareholder dividends and other uses, this is projected to result in approximately $1.1 billion of excess parent cash in 2013 available for share repurchases or other corporate uses. Approximately $625 million of this excess parent cash has already been deployed towards share repurchase in the first half of 2013. Based on our year-to-date repurchases and projected repurchase activity over the remainder of the year, we now project our full year weighted average diluted share count will be between 360 million and 361 million shares.","We believe that these results demonstrate our ability to execute on the growth strategy we shared with you in December. Our Commercial Insured business is delivering strong performance. The substantial majority of our Medicare business, including our leading Group Medicare Advantage franchise is performing consistent with our projections. Medicaid is performing better than our projections. Coventry is on track to deliver the high end of our projected operating EPS accretion and our capital generation continues to be robust as we deploy capital to generate value for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas F. Cowhey","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","That will come from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My questions are on Medicare Advantage. First, can you give us more color or specifics on the products that drove the issues in Medicare Advantage this quarter and what you did with 2014 bids to remediate?","Shawn M. Guertin","Sure, Justin. Before I delve into the specifics, I want to make sure that we keep 3 things here in context. Overall, obviously, as you heard, our diversified portfolio of businesses are doing quite well, including Coventry. The majority of our Medicare business, say, 80% or so, is performing quite well and consistent with our previous expectations. And as you mentioned and alluded to, we had full awareness of what I'm going to talk about as we evaluated our bids for 2014. So more specifically, the pressure that I referenced was observed in 2 really unrelated pockets of our business. One was some of our Aetna Individual Medicare Advantage offerings and the other was a single Coventry PDP plan offering. Both of these pockets of business experienced strong membership growth in 2013, particularly the PDP offering that I mentioned, which grew 40% or so. In a nutshell, the experience on the new members in these products was higher than we had previously projected. As you know, experiencing higher costs on first year members, especially in MA, isn't atypical as we generally have to ramp up medical management, revenue enhancement, and things like that can take time. But having said that, they were still higher than we had previously projected. So in terms of -- as I mentioned, in terms of the bids, obviously, we recognize that. And in particular for these products, we took very tangible and measurable action around premium levels, benefit plan design, formulary changes and things of that sort to sort of address the issues. The one point I would make as well here is when you think about the statement that we just made that we now expect Coventry to end up at the higher end of our accretion range, that is inclusive of this issue on the PDP that I mentioned and I think it's a testament actually to how well that business is performing overall.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And can you give us an idea of the size of these offerings in terms of how many Medicare Advantage members are affected, as well as Coventry PDP members?","Shawn M. Guertin","Well, again these 2 issues, as I mentioned, represent in total 20% at the most of our Medicare revenue. As I mentioned, the Individual MA that I mentioned is really isolated in Aetna's book. That book in total was only about 160,000 members.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then if I could just ask a follow-up on Medicare Advantage, any early thoughts on '14 membership growth? And as you look at your employer group business, can you tell us whether these employers are expected to still have enough value to want to stay with the program, given the next 2 years of reimbursement pressure? And that's it for me.","Mark T. Bertolini","Sure, Justin. As we look at 2014 Medicare and 2015, quite frankly, they're going to be a couple of tough years relative to how rates are going to move, how the Stars Program is going to be implemented. But that's against the backdrop where we have 100,000 people retiring on a daily basis and more and more people coming into the program. So we see it happening -- I'm sorry, on a weekly basis. We see it happening that there will be overall growth in the marketplace and we think we can continue to grow Medicare. Not as quickly as we have in the past would be the major headline there. On the employer side, we see more interest in Medicare exchanges. We see them continue to be interested. And I actually think there's more momentum for them to move their employees to a Medicare Advantage program, so we think that bodes well for our group business.","Operator","Up next is Scott Fidel from Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wondering if you could just give us an early look at how the membership trends appear to be shaping up for you in the national accounts market and Commercial ASO. And then just on -- if you can talk a bit about whether you're seeing any changes in the competitive environment in the ASO business, particularly as it relates to the Blues just given that one of the large Blue competitors did guide to add significant membership in ASO in 2014.","Mark T. Bertolini","Yes. I think, first of all, Scott, that guide also included a very large data count of over 600,000 lives. So I don't know that it was all national accounts membership. I think they were talking about ASC membership. As we look at the ASC market, we think it's too early to tell in large part because of private exchanges becoming much more part of the conversation. So we think there are going to be delays in making decisions this year. However, we think that private exchanges, particularly those that move self-funded clients to fully insured, bodes well for us given that 4 to 5x the revenue of margin on a dollar basis is associated with each of those accounts. So too early to tell. We think that we are in the mix where we want to be. We believe we will hold our own, come 2014. But we see revenue shift occurring as more large employers consider private exchanges as a model.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So Mark, overall, for -- when thinking about the Blues, is it fair to say that you're not really seeing a notable change in their competitive appetite on fees for 2014?","Mark T. Bertolini","We don't see anything notable or anything irrational. Of course, there's always pockets of irrationality. But I'm not sure if that's our view or a competitor's distinct advantage in a given market. So right now, we view the market as remaining very rational, everybody's getting their fees, pricing to expectations in the exchanges. And we believe that this is still a rational market.","Operator","Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. I just wanted to ask a question on the Medicaid business and as it relates to seeking to recoup the industry fee on that side of your business and what sort of discussions you have and if you have an updated outlook on that front.","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, I think financial solvency is the notion we hold on to. And I'll call it a notion when we sit down with the states to discuss rates. We think this is probably the hardest sector to get a return on the full fee from the states because as you may guess, it's all fungible in the rate because it's an insured rate. So far so good for us. We don't see any unreasonable pressure, the conversations are tough. But as we have renewed some accounts, we feel that we are being treated fairly in that process. But again, we would note Medicaid as probably being the most difficult sector at the state level to get a return of the health insurance fee.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so with -- if I'm correct, so some of your accounts are incorporating the fee into your rate renewals for 2014. Did I understand you correctly?","Mark T. Bertolini","They are, but again it's all fungible. So all the factors that go into that pricing are for a matter of negotiation. So are we getting -- if we were just to take last year's factors and put them forward and put the fee on top of it, are we getting all of that? I would say that based on where utilization is, there are a whole bunch of different trends moving inside of rates. And so we expect that we're getting treated fairly in the process as we negotiate rates of the states.","Operator","Moving on to Christine Arnold from Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups. On the Medicare Advantage, can you size this issue? Because it seems like if we've resolved this in the bids, it could be a tailwind for next year. And then Texas TRS and other Medicare Advantage group accounts, are any of these kind of not up for renewal? In which case, how are you going to recoup what looks like a pretty tough Medicare payment outlook relative to kind of what you expected when you signed up these accounts?","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, let me answer the group, and I'll have Shawn give further commentary on the sizing and whether or not it's a tailwind. I would say, overall, Christine, that the group market remains robust and we are in active conversations. Private exchanges in the Medicare Advantage market place will be new. So there is one already, Extend Health, but there will be newer ones coming forward. We will participate in that and we feel good about where the group market is. We actually think there's more momentum in the group market to move into Medicare Advantage than there ever has been before. Let me have Shawn respond to your second-part question.","Shawn M. Guertin","Yes. So Christine, I would say in terms of the impact that these are having, in the quarter, if you rolled it forward from first quarter to second quarter, there's probably 100 to 150 basis points of pressure from these 2 products sort of in that roll-forward.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So 100 to 150 basis points, first half of the year. And then Texas TRS and any others that may not be up for renewal in '14, can you recoup the tough Medicare Advantage group -- Medicare Advantage payment outlook in renegotiating and opening those up? Or is that a risk factor for '14?","Shawn M. Guertin","We certainly have other avenues on these accounts, especially newer accounts like the one you mentioned, because the second year and later is when we see a lot of the medical management things really begin to kick in, as well as a lot of the revenue enhancement work that you can do once you have the customer onboard. Again, the majority of our business we have open for sort of a normal renewal cycle, and this is front and center in those discussions.","Operator","Carl McDonald from Citi.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the private exchanges, a couple of your competitors, like Health Net and WellPoint, have basically positioned them as no-risk propositions in '14. Essentially, that the downside is that there really isn't any downside. If you guys believe that to be true, I would expect you'd be in a lot more individual exchanges than you're going to be in next year. So I'd just be interested in your perspective on what you see as the risks of wider-scale participation in '14.","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, I think there's 2 questions in there, Carl. I think on the private exchange marketplace, we will probably participate in as many, if not more, private exchanges than we will on public exchanges, in large part because we can define in a number of ways the way we participate, including those exchanges that we build for our own clients through industry verticals. So we see that as a newer opportunity than the public exchange marketplace. And we think the Affordable Care Act has driven much more receptivity in the industry and across competitors, which actually fought these efforts back in 2009 and earlier as association health plans. But now I think we've gotten over that hurdle and now see the value of these in the marketplace. In the public exchanges, we continue to evaluate where Coventry came from and where we came from. And our strategy on assessing the public exchanges, I would tell you we remain very cautious, if not more cautious, given the readiness of exchanges and the current conversations we have going on around rates in the public exchanges and do not view them as a large opportunity in 2014. We view them as appropriate to be cautious. And with the exception of a very few number of states, we view our ability to participate in 2015 and 2016 as wide open, should these public exchanges take off.","Operator","We'll move on to Ana Gupte from Dowling & Partners.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","So looking at through the other earnings reports that came out, WellPoint and Assurant are showing some pressure on their top line from individual and small group. And then Mercer -- separately, Mercer and Aon are talking about a very robust pipeline for private exchanges. And then lastly, the final trend on self-insured, there seems to be at least nobody is missing on that. And in many cases, it seems like there is a leading indicator of mix shift to self-insured. So as you're looking at the 85 million to 90 million self-insured lives, the 60 million plus fully insured lives, the all group insured and 10 million individual and you're thinking about 2014 and '15 given how big this is for your book of business, where do you see this shaking out in the next couple of years?","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, I think, Ana, that we see very little big shifts -- very little small shifts in 2014 going forward. We don't see a whole lot of change going on. We see a lot of experimentation. And we will be participating in that experimentation. We'll be participating in 15 private exchanges currently, maybe even more as we launch our own proprietary private exchanges. So we see a lot of experimentation and we see a lot of experimentation on the part of employers trying it. I think the real, ultimate expression of private exchanges will be the result of employers being able to move to true defined contribution. And in order to do that, the stability, the rate stability of that private exchange must be predictable over time, so those employers won't be coming back to that -- those employees won't be coming back to that employer and saying, \"You didn't give me enough 2 years ago when you put me in a private exchange and you put me in defined contribution.\" So I think we'll see notional defined contribution, some shift to self-funding to fully insured. It will start slowly as experimentation in 2014. And whether or not these funds will be stable over time will define whether or not we see a wholesale shift. So I think it's very early to tell how we will look in 2015 or 2016.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","And then on the Small Group with sort of with WellPoint and Assurant and the mandate being delayed, do you think at the very small end of the market you'll see more jumping? Because it appears we're beginning to see that already.","Mark T. Bertolini","Yes. I think the administration is already saying that they're going to see 7 million-ish in the individual exchange. And I think in 2014, particularly with the extension of renewing early small employers through November of 2014, you're not going to see a whole lot of change. We do see over time, though, that the Small Group market will shrink by as much as 5 million through the next couple of years, 2016 being the date, as employers make the evaluation of, \"Should I put my employees in an exchange?\" That exchange could be a private exchange. It may not necessarily be public exchange.","Operator","Moving to Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Steve Baxter on for Kevin. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your exchange process. We saw in the news that Maryland is looking for some significant reductions. How similar is this or dissimilar to your normal rate renegotiation process? And also kind of how you're approaching states for both Coventry and Aetna bid?","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, Steve, we generally do not negotiate our rates with states in the paper. So I would argue that the current information that's in the public domain is in mid-process. We have not committed to the rates nor we will see ourselves committing to those rates anytime at this point. So there's a hearing to be held and we will have further conversations with the insurance commissioners as we move forward. Other states are in conversation as well, but they're not just in the public domain. And those are typical of our discussions with insurance commissioners as we submit rates with justification and the actuaries and the commissioners get involved in asking questions about credibility factors, trend factors, all the sorts of things that would drive our rating structure. So we're more than happy to have those conversations. We've been having them for years. We're used to them. And we believe that we'll come to the right place with rates in the markets where we believe we can be competitive. To the degree we can't, we will not participate. So that's our view.","Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. But I guess, could you possibly -- I know Coventry is also bidding in Maryland and several of the other states you're looking at participating. So how are you looking at the states where both plans have bid?","Mark T. Bertolini","So for the last 2 months, we have been working with the Coventry team and understanding their approach, understanding their rates. And we continue to rationalize our participation and now our participations through Coventry market-by-market. And we have -- it's a market-specific event, continues to move forward. And those won't all settle out until we have to commit in September. But we're looking at them as a group of portfolio of opportunities across the individual market.","Operator","Sarah James from Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I was just trying to reconcile guidance. It seems like Commercial MLR is down 100 basis points at the midpoint. SG&A is down. Medicaid MLR is at the lower end of the prior range. Medicare MLR is at the high end of the prior range, but that's only really 1\/4 of your revenue. So it just seems like with improvements on several material lines, the guidance EPS increase is modest. So just wondering if there's an offsetting cost increase that I'm missing or if we should think about current guidance as incrementally more conservative.","Shawn M. Guertin","No, Sarah. I think the point there might be the very first thing you mentioned, which is the Commercial MBR from guidance-to-guidance, that's probably more like 50 basis points better. The Medicaid MBR, probably of the same magnitude. When you put those 2 things together and you offset that by a bit higher outlook on our Medicare business, that nets back basically to our $0.075 midpoint increase in guidance. So I don't view it as overly conservative. In fact, that price kind of straight down the middle.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then how do you think about the relative attractiveness of Medicare Advantage when you deploy capital? Do you think that this is a segment that could be bigger in 2016 than it is today? So after you get through some of the lumpiness over the year or 2, is it...","Mark T. Bertolini","Yes, we think 2014 and 2015 will be difficult, but we think it's worth the investment. And that will give us ramp time to go after the issues that Shawn mentioned in his comments, looking at provider contracts, bolstering our Medicare case management and medical management programs, implementing ACOs, looking at our underlying cost structure and then ultimately, whatever's left impacting benefits and rates. And I think that is how we think about moving forward. We view leaving markets as the nuclear option, and we don't feel that, that's a sustainable proposition over time. So our view would be 2014 and 2015, very hard work. But we can see a line of sight, where in 2016, this is a good business and an important business for Aetna.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And by good and important, is it possible that it's larger than it is today?","Mark T. Bertolini","We would expect to grow, yes.","Operator","Your last question in the queue today will come from Dave Windley from Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","A couple. I was hoping that given your discussion and focus on ACOs, would you be able and willing to comment on, say, what proportion of your medical cost you expect to be running through these relationships, give us some sense of how much they would encompass?","Mark T. Bertolini","It's currently approximately 15%. We expect it to triple by 2017.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Triple by 2017. Okay. And on exchanges, a lot of discussion around the exchanges. Our understanding from talking to some consultants is that some of these private exchanges can be set up for the customers in an ASO funding style. I'd be curious, Mark, if you could talk about maybe some of the triggers there. And if it is -- if they are set up as an ASO arrangement, would you be equally motivated to participate? Or is it really only if you switch over to full risk that those become attractive?","Mark T. Bertolini","No. I think, Dave, I think the preponderance of private exchanges in the beginning will be self-funded. And again, that's based around the employers wanting to understand how sustainable the cost structure of these exchanges will be over time. So what they will create is notional defined contribution. They will give their employees budgets up to which they can spend and after which, they spend out of their own pocket. But if they don't spend it all, it goes back into the employer's pocket through a self-funded vehicle. When they see some sustainability of affordability and cost structure over time, the employers will feel ready and able to move forward to true defined contribution, where they're actually giving the employees the money to spend and the employees are buying insured products on the exchange. So I think that's the shift that we will see over time. Some employers will move very quickly, particularly employers who move their employees just less than 30 hours into our bank kind of accounting around benefits. But I would see, in the beginning, largely notional defined contribution in a self-funded environment moving to full defined contribution and an insured environment over time. So we believe we need to participate in all of those and we need to follow this evolution through the industry.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. And your thoughts on the evolution timeframe, is it 2 years, 3 years, 5 years?","Mark T. Bertolini","You pick your consultant, they'll give you a statistic. We think that private exchanges will eclipse public exchanges early on. And that depending on whether or not they're really affordable and sustainable, we could see a wholesale shift to private exchanges 2016 and thereafter. But again, it depends on whether or not there's an affordable proposition that allows employers to comfortably move the burden to their employees and that those employees won't be back knocking on the door, not only about wages but also the cost of their health benefits.","Thomas F.

Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported third quarter operating earnings of $1.90 per share delivering another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter results are a continuation of our momentum from the first half of the year, specifically, underwriting margin performance was strong as our total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio improved by 120 basis points year-over-year. Our Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio improved by 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by our group Commercial businesses. And the Government Medical Benefit Ratio improved by 240 basis points year-over-year driven by continued strong results in our Medicare business.","Pre-tax operating margins reached 8.4% in the quarter consistent with our high-single digit pre-tax operating margin targets and we generated nearly $1.3 billion in Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow.","Based on our strong third quarter results, we are raising our full-year 2015 operating EPS guidance to a range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share. This represents the fourth time we have increased our 2015 operating EPS projection. At the midpoint of our updated range, Aetna would now achieve 12% year-over-year operating EPS growth, a result that would be at the high end of our low-double digit operating EPS growth target.","In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results and improved outlook, but first, I am going to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights of the quarter.","Aetna's mission is to build a healthier world. In Humana, we believe we have found the ideal partner to complement and accelerate our efforts. Though the projected closing of the acquisition is still months away, our integration teams are working in earnest to ensure we achieve, if not exceed, our synergy and accretion goals. We are excited to welcome Rick Jelinek to our executive team as the leader of our integration efforts. We are confident his wealth of industry knowledge and experience will help deliver a smooth integration as we choose the best processes and talent from both organizations to create a stronger enterprise.","All material state regulatory filings have been made for the proposed transaction. And we have received our first state approval for the transaction. We continue to work diligently with the Department of Justice in a collaborative and constructive manner. Last week, the shareholders of both Humana and Aetna overwhelming voted to approve the transaction, another significant milestone as we progress on our journey to deal completion.","We remain confident that we are on track to achieve a successful close in the second half of 2016, and that Humana is the right cultural and strategic partner to create customer and shareholder value through the new Aetna.","Moving on to third quarter highlights. Our Government businesses continue to perform well. Specifically, the momentum in our Medicare businesses in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter. We increased Medicare medical membership by 40,000 members in the quarter, with growth across Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage. From a year-to-date perspective, we have grown our Medicare membership by 11%, including over 14% individual Medicare Advantage growth.","Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow our Medicare Advantage business in 2016 as program funding will increase for the first time in several years. We continue to expand our geographic footprint and will now offer products in 745 counties for 2016. Representing nearly half of the Medicare-eligible population and based on the recently published 2016 Medicare Advantage star ratings, 87% of our membership is in four-star or greater plans, the highest percentage as compared to our national peers.","Our Medicaid business also performed very well. We grew by 86,000 members in the quarter, primarily from additions in state programs related to ACA expansion. Despite continued slow growth in the duals programs and mid-year rate decreases in our Kentucky contract, we still delivered solid pre-tax operating margins in Medicaid. We remain focused on the opportunity to continue to grow this business and we look forward to serving new populations, including members in the recently awarded Michigan Medicaid contract and the Texas STAR Kids Program.","Shifting to our public exchange and consumer efforts, the individual business remains challenging, especially in light of the continued administrative changes for this new and developing membership pool. Despite these challenges, we continue to work constructively with CMS and the states to serve our 1.1 million individual members.","We've always said that Aetna would participate in this emerging opportunity in a prudent manner in geographies where we have the cost structure to offer attractive products to consumers and earn an appropriate return for our shareholders. In keeping with our strategy, Aetna will participate on individual exchanges in 15 states in 2016, as compared to 17 states in 2015. A footprint that we continue to believe can drive net membership growth.","Further, as part of our 2016 offerings, Aetna will launch new consumer-focused health solutions for individuals and families in four existing geographies. These innovative products will feature simplified benefit structures and an improved consumer experience. Central to these new products will be access to helpful digital tools with clear information about healthcare resources, coverage and costs. We intend to use our experience with these new products as preparation for a broader roll-out in the future as we continue our journey to help reshape the healthcare system.","Additionally, we are excited that Gary Loveman has joined the Aetna team to help lead the newly-expanded Healthagen, including our consumer businesses. Under his leadership, we are confident that we will make our consumer-centric healthcare vision a reality.","In summary, as we finish out the year and look toward 2016 and beyond, we are well positioned to crossing number of major growth opportunities, including Medicare, Medicaid and the public exchanges. We continue to work diligently on planning for the Humana integration and we are excited about the value that our combination will create for consumers and shareholders.","I am pleased with our results and I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong quarter for Aetna. I am confident we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing healthcare marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy, we will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, we can achieve our 2015 operating earnings per share projection of $7.45 to $7.55, and we can grow both operating earnings and operating EPS in 2016.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2015 outlook, and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2016. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.","Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2015 operating earnings of $669 million, and operating earnings per share of $1.90. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins. I'll begin with some comments on overall performance.","Our top-line performance was steady for the quarter. Medical membership declined to approximately 23.5 million members, as growth in Government membership was more than offset by declines in our group Commercial and individual businesses. Operating revenue was $15 billion, driven primarily by higher premium yields and membership growth in our Government business.","From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pre-tax operating margin was 8.4% for the quarter, a 60-basis point year-over-year improvement. Our third quarter total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio was 81.1%, a strong result that benefited from disciplined pricing, continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development.","Our operating expense ratio was 18.6%, a 40-basis point increase over the third quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and lower than projected operating revenue growth.","From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter 2015 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth. And days and claims payable were 54.3 days at the end of quarter, up 2.5 days sequentially, and 4.6 days on a year-over-year basis.","Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. On a year-to-date basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.4 times operating earnings. We continue to project that our full-year 2015 Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows will exceed our 2015 operating earnings. Our ability to repurchase shares was constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition, and we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. We did, however, distribute $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend.","In summary, we are quite pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail.","Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership declined by approximately 300,000 members during the quarter, largely driven by our group Commercial and individual businesses. This performance is consistent with recent membership trends in these blocks, our previously discussed pricing actions to improve performance in our group Commercial business and enrollment patterns in our individual business.","Our Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio was 80.7% for the quarter, a 30-basis point improvement over the same period last year. Our third quarter Commercial MBR was influenced by continued moderate medical cost trends and strong performance in our group Commercial business, partially offset by an updated view on 3R accruals in our ACA compliant businesses. Based on our year-to-date experience, we project that Aetna's 2015 Core Commercial medical cost trend will be approximately 6%.","We continue to drive growth in our Government business, where we grew by 126,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 13,000 members. Medicare Supplement grew by 27,000 members. And Medicaid membership also grew by 86,000 members.","Our third quarter 2015 Government premiums grew to $5.7 billion, a 6.6% increase over the prior-year quarter. Our Government Medical Benefit Ratio was 81.6% in the quarter, a 240-basis point improvement over the same period last year, driven primarily by continued momentum in our Medicare business.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure, and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At September 30, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 33%.","Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $385 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, including payment of transaction-related expenses, we ended the quarter with approximately $180 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was 348.7 million at September 30.","As a result of our third quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share. This represents the seventh quarter in a row we have raised our operating EPS guidance and the fourth time we have increased our projection this year.","Our updated 2015 guidance is influenced by the following drivers. Based on our third quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23.3 million members. Primarily based on lower membership and mix, we have revised our outlook on full-year 2015 operating revenue, which we now project to be approximately $60 billion. This top-line projection is a result of our continued stance to favor margin over membership particularly in our group Commercial blocks of business.","We now project our full-year total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio will be 81% plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to project that our full-year 2015 Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio will be essentially flat when compared to our 2014 Commercial MBR. This projection is generally consistent with current consensus estimates for this metric. Our current view is that our operating expense ratio will be approximately 19% for the full year, a result of lower than projected revenues and continued investment spending as we execute on our strategy.","We now project our pre-tax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high-single digit target with operating earnings between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. Finally, we now expect that net subsidiary dividends for the year will be up to $2.4 billion and Aetna's parent cash balance will be approximately $400 million at year-end. We continue to project that our 2015 weighted average diluted share count will be approximately 353 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition.","Moving on to 2016. We do not typically provide forward guidance on our third quarter call, however, as we will not be providing detailed 2016 guidance until early next year, I wanted to provide some directional commentary on Aetna's 2016 earnings outlook on a stand-alone basis. As you know, we do not, as a matter of course, include prior year's reserve development in our guidance. When we exclude prior year's reserve development and other items from our projected 2015 performance, we currently believe Aetna's 2015 baseline earnings power is approximately $7 per share. Our goal is to achieve at least low-double digit growth off this operating EPS baseline next year.","While uncertainties remain and we continue to work through our forecasting process, we are incorporating a number of challenges in our outlook, including the projected impact of known membership attrition in our Commercial ASC business and certain large insured customers that are projected to convert to alternative funding arrangements, the projected full-year impact of the rate reset in our Kentucky Medicaid contract, and the fact that our operating EPS outlook typically incorporates a benefit from share repurchases, which we are no longer projecting because of the pending Humana transaction.","We are also incorporating a number of opportunities in our outlook, including continued membership growth in our Medicare and Medicaid products. The opportunity to improve margins on our ACA-compliant and dual-eligible membership and fixed cost leverage as we continue to grow revenue and actively manage costs.","In summary, our goal is to grow our 2015 operating EPS baseline of $7 per share at low-double digit rates next year. This growth floor, which does not presume any prior year's reserve development, would be driven entirely by underlying operating earnings performance as share repurchases do not contribute to operating EPS growth in our 2016 outlook. Further, if medical cost trends were to develop below our projections similar to the last several years, we could see upside to our outlook.","As we enter the final quarter of 2015 and begin to look toward 2016, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remain strong and we are confident in our projected operating EPS range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share, and our ability to grow operating EPS at low-double digit rates over time.","The Humana acquisition will only serve to enhance our position as a leader in the transformation of the healthcare system, delivering more cost-effective products to customers and enhancing our ability to achieve and exceed our long-term growth objectives. We remain committed and confident that we can close the Humana transaction in the second half of 2016, and that we can achieve at least $11 of operating EPS in 2018 as a combined company.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas F. Cowhey - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. I appreciate the question. I guess I want to follow-up a little bit about 2016 and maybe even beyond that, and understanding that you guys are setting a floor at sort of low-double digit growth. You mentioned some headwinds and some opportunities as well. And I guess I'm just trying to figure out the exchange business, you talked about the ACA compliant plans, that being a margin \u2013 a good guy potential. And then I also want to understand, I guess, in the context of, do you really feel like you need to be there on those ACA-compliant plans? And then on the Government side, margins have been running a lot better than we had expected, I think others in the industry are seeing some similar trends. I can't imagine that was all caught in the 2016 bids in June, so should we expect those margins to be sustained in 2016, and maybe longer-term thoughts on Government margin?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me start off, Josh, with a couple of points. I think in the ACA-compliant plans and in the public exchanges, we view this as a long-term market potential. It's still early. We like the dynamics of the markets we're in. And I'll remind everybody that it was our view that we would go into markets where we had a cost structure that could develop an affordable product for people in those communities. And so our changes in this current year are related to our ability to do so. But we think it's way too early to call it quits on the ACA and on the exchanges, we view it still as a big opportunity for the company. I'll remind everybody it's just a little over 6% of our operating revenue, so we still view it as an opportunity to play.","In relationship to the Government margins, we believe that we will not have the same level of Government margins. But we will have some pressure on them going backwards in 2016. But our 2015 margins are healthy. We believe that is related to two things: our strong growth, our investment in scorable action items \u2013 and I would also add, our star ratings are having a material impact on growth in our plans, and also on our opportunity to generate a higher margin.","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah. So Josh, I'd just append a few comments, thinking about the margin. In the Government business, I think, to your point about how well it's been performed, we've gotten into our target mid-single digit margin range on Medicare this year, and I do think, given the strength of the performance and the factors Mark mentioned, we can continue to perform in that mid-single digit range next year. I think where we'll get a little bit of pressure on the margin is on Medicaid, and a lot of that is obviously just emanating from Kentucky, given how large a contract that is in our portfolio. Having said that, I still think the overall performance of the Government business will be very strong again in 2016.","The exchange business, in terms of margin improvement, I think this is a year where we knew a lot more about pricing at the beginning of this year than we knew a year ago. And while I don't think we'd ever think that we would achieve sort of a target pricing profitability, I think we have a lot more confidence that we can improve the profitability position on that business in 2016 versus 2015; again, as Mark mentioned, we've always known since day one this was a multi-year and sort of longer-term proposition in this market.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And Shawn, just a quick follow-up on that last one. Safe to assume you're not making money on the exchanges, including 3R accruals, et cetera, in 2015?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yes. Yes, that is safe to assume.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Just a broad question on 2016, I'm not sure I exactly heard your comments, Shawn, right, but it sounded like you were saying that your sort of preliminary growth target was reflective of a medical cost trend that, if you ended up back at where we were this year, that \u2013 that would be favorable to it. Can you give us a little more flavor, are you assuming, therefore, an increase in medical cost trend next year implicit in your comments, versus what we saw this year, and any flavor for what you're anticipating across buckets, if I could?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, so very similar to the assumptions and operating principles we've had the last few years. We are assuming a modest uptick in utilization trend in our forward pricing for 2016. And, again, to the extent, obviously, that that doesn't manifest itself, as it largely hasn't this year. That is a potential good guy. Obviously, I don't want to go there yet. That's the purpose of assuming the uptick. But we have continued to maintain, I think, a prudent position on our forward pricing particularly in the group Commercial business.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And maybe, also clarify comments you made about the full-year update on the guidance in the fourth quarter. Is there anything that happened in the third quarter that you were previously anticipating in the fourth quarter, was there any pull forward, seems like some of the other companies maybe had a little pull forward into third from fourth (25:39), is there anything like that?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","No, not anything that I think is meaningful. There's always very small, but, no, nothing that I would say sort of had any kind of meaningful impact on the Q3 results. The one thing I would comment on, though, in Q3 actually is the 3Rs. As I alluded to in my remarks, we've continued to take up our accruals on risk adjustment and adjust our accruals on the other elements including reinsurance. And that probably, in Q3, was worth about $65 million pre-tax worse than our previous sort of expectation. So that's about 90 bps on the Commercial MBR for the quarter and I think that actually speaks to how well \u2013 going back to your question, actually, how well our group Commercial business is actually performing and I'd like to think that part of that is, again, that we've taken a cautious position on sort of forward pricing on that business.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I guess kind of maybe staying on the Commercial, I guess, re-pricing that you were doing this year that impacted membership to some degree, is that done or should we think about that as continuing to be a headwind into next year?","Karen S. Lynch - President","Hi, Kevin, it's Karen. We will continue to favor pricing and margin over membership. We're continuing to look at our 50 to 100 (27:28) book where we, as you know, priced it at the end of 2014 and continue to price it through 2015, the results are reflected in third quarter and we feel good about it. We will continue to manage pricing in the small group business, so you can expect to see some volume attrition in 2016 as a reflection of our pricing actions.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks. And I guess, I don't know if you guys have any view into the Humana at all. I mean, obviously they reaffirmed guidance, is there anything that you took away from what they have said publicly or if you have any view about how the performance is going versus what you expected coming into Q3?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","We really don't have any comment. We don't have a whole lot of insight other than what we hear from them.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","The $65 million bad guy in the quarter, did you add that back when you started with your $7 run rate for this year? Or did you adjust for the 3Rs generally for the year into that run rate number?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","On the $65 million that you're talking about, specifically, no, because that's really more of a current-year item. Now, if you went back a couple of quarters, we did have some true-ups related to 2014, but we're probably talking about a dime, plus or minus. And so very simply, if you wanted to think about it with where our guidance is with a midpoint of $7.50. If you netted out PYD and any of that prior year related to 3Rs, you're probably in the neighborhood of $0.60, $0.50, in that zone, when you net those out. And that's sort of how we got to the $7. But, specifically, the $65 million that I mentioned is really an update to our estimates related to the 2015 performance, so we haven't taken those out.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. And then, I don't know if Gary Loveman's on the call here at all, but I'm wondering, if he is, or if you want to talk about how the plans are to use data in Healthagen to sort of increase your marketing and perhaps change sort of the dynamics of what you've got going on in the ACA compliant plans now?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Peter, I would say a couple of things. First, one of the things we did in bringing Gary on board was we combined both our new Commercial launches, the four markets that we alluded to during the conference call during the prepared remarks, into our Healthagen businesses to begin to create what we would call the new Aetna. So a set of provider relationships in local market, products and services that are driven at the local market level around a retail marketplace. So individual across any kind of payor. Actually, agnostic of any payor.","And so Gary's role is to help us think about how we do that. How we get to a very different customer experience. As you know, Gary has a background in applied mathematics. Professor in Applied Mathematics at Harvard. And so his whole role of understanding the consumer. He's written a book on understanding the consumer in a lot of industries, and demonstrated a bit of it in the gaming industry. But our view is that Gary's insights and ways of thinking about the future are an exciting opportunity for us to create a very different kind of result in the marketplace.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thank you. In the Government business, and particularly looking at MLR, you had expected in your guidance after 2Q for the Government MLR to rise in the back half. It feels like third quarter outperformed and now you're expecting fourth quarter to rise. I guess what I'm interested in is, is the back half progressing as you expected, or did it actually outperform in the third quarter? And what would be the factors that you would expect to cause Government MLR to rise in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah. So you're right, Dave, in the sense that probably the biggest area of favorable outperformance in Q3 continued to be the Government business. We have assumed that that biz \u2013 you're right, in that our guidance assumes that the MBR will go up in the fourth quarter for that business. We're, in essence, taking a little bit of the favorability that we've seen, but we're certainly not forecasting all of it as we've seen. We've tended to see sort of a bit of a seasonal increase on the Medicare MBR, as sort of the year wears on in the past. So you're correct. We have not forecast all of it, but we have forecast a little bit of it to finally show up in Q4.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, there. Could you speak to what you're expecting on the national account ASL book? You alluded to some changes in terms of the purchasing patterns of that population. And then you also alluded to some issues kind of driven by the administration of the public exchange business. Could you speak to what you think is happening there this year and why you're convinced that it will improve next year? Thanks.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll take the last part of that question, Christine, then I'll ask Karen to comment on the national accounts marketplace. I think what we've seen with the changes in the 3Rs, the risk corridors, a lot of the keep what you have. The game has sort of moved pretty steadily over the last two, three years. And our review is, is that when you start having impacts on significant inputs to pricing, there are mistakes made. And we're seeing that with the co-op failures that continue to happen and the shifting dynamic in the marketplace. And we look forward to getting the market more stable. And I think that's going to be something that is going to happen past this administration.","If you think about Medicare and everything that's done for Medicare every year, we are constantly tweaking the program and making it better. And I think the result has been a very favorable product for seniors particularly with one-third of them now on Medicare Advantage and a large population in the PDP program. We would like to see that kind of analysis and continued shaping of the program in the Affordable Care Act and the public exchanges but unfortunately the politics of it don't allow it to happen now. We think that that will change in the future and that will get a much more stable marketplace. Karen?","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Do you think there is an adverse risk pool developing there? It seems like everyone is pretty disappointed third quarter relative to second. Is that just \u2013 we've got more experience people have their card for nine months, or is the risk pool deteriorating?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say the risk pool is not nearly as balanced as everybody thought it would be as we got near the end of the 3Rs and that it continues to look like it did in the first year with the demographics and age categories pretty much the same. They got a little bit better in the second year. There is not a lot of hope or change expected for 2016. So our view is, is that this is a more adversely impacted population than we otherwise would have expected had we not made all the changes we made to the program.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Karen S. Lynch - President","Good morning, Christine. Relative to national accounts, first, I would just note for the 2016 selling cycle, we had one of our better-performing new sales year. However, some of that momentum is being masked by some of the impact of losing or accounts going to slice. So we had some large jumbo accounts that decided to offer more choice went into slice, and we had some terminations, so we expect to see notable decline in ASC membership as a result of those big jumbo cases, when we come into the first quarter of 2016. I would also note, relative to membership, one of our large ASC members up for assurance, as you know, has made the decision to exit the healthcare business, and so that will impact our membership in 2016 as well.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","How is the short (36:32) affecting your membership next year?","Karen S. Lynch - President","There was a customer in our network access business, so it was counted as membership, so that will affect our membership counts.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Are you quantifying that, or do I have to wait till next quarter?","Karen S. Lynch - President","Have to wait till next quarter.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, I just had a question on your individual Medicare Advantage book. I think you talked about your Government business overall being at your target margin level of mid-single digits. Albeit we don't have the details, but it would seem to me that maybe, for individual MA, your margin would be more in the high-single digits. I mean, given where your Government MCR is overall and thinking about Medicaid and thinking about an all-in operating cost ratio of maybe 10% in that business. Am I off there? And if I'm not off, what do you think is sustainable?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","No, we're not quite in that range yet, for a margin on that business. We still are in the mid-single digits. And I actually have thought, and continue to think, that mid-single digits is a sustainable margin for the individual product. You're right in the sense that one of the bigger improvements in 2015 versus 2014 is certainly the margin performance of the individual business, but we're still in that range. Part of the reason that we've done that is the investments that we continue to make in STARs, as an example, which obviously bring with it some SG&A expense.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say, Matt, we in the past have talked about us taking a few years to get to our target margins in individual. We got there earlier than we anticipated.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And on the same broad topic, as you look now at the open enrollment process underway, it's just started, but you have seen how your products stack up against competitors. Do you think that you can achieve a stronger result next year as the 14% growth in individual MA that you did for this year, which obviously included not only growth in the program, but market share gains as well?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As you said, it's really early, Matt, but I would say that we like what we see in the markets, and our relative position in the markets where we've entered. But we're still in the midst of finalizing our operating plan, so we're not locked down on what we think that growth will be yet.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","One last one, if I could sneak it in. Should we think about the PPD, as we bridge from 2015 to 2016, being in the range of maybe $0.30 to $0.35, or is that too much of a net number?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Well, again, we don't forecast that. So let me be clear that, if you looked at historical levels, that's probably in the ZIP code, maybe a little bit at the high end.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. I appreciate your color broadly on continuing to favor margins over membership. But thinking big picture, how would you define the competitiveness in the pricing environment? Will the failure of the co-ops give you an opportunity to gain share you might not have otherwise been expecting, including maybe in small group in some markets, how is pricing broadly? Thank you.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We still see pricing as largely rational. There are markets from time to time where we see a little bit of irrational pricing, but I'd like to caution everybody \u2013 from the point of view is that, I don't \u2013 I mean, it's always easy for us to point at a competitor and say, they're being irrational in their pricing. Maybe they have a better cost structure, and we don't have the best cost structure in every market.","So, I always raise an eyebrow when the team says, well, we've got irrational pricing in X market. I always say, well, have you looked at their cost structure and do you know how they have structured it? So I would say largely rational; we haven't seen any significant changes. I think what we saw with the co-ops was the immaturity of that model and the anticipation that they could, quote-unquote, somehow hold the big health plans honest by pricing at a level that captured a lot of membership, and we knew that that was going to be troublesome and unsustainable.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, switching gears here to your performance in the group business this quarter, as well as maybe a little bit on the large case. Pension was definitely below what we were expecting on a segment that gets that much attention. How should we think about performance in those businesses in 4Q and into next year; any trends there worth highlighting? Thanks.","Karen S. Lynch - President","Relative to the group business, it is performing where we expected. If you look at last year at this time, we had some outperformance in that business. We had a little pressure in the quarter on our life claims but, as you know, that's a very volatile business and life goes up and down on the quarters. Relative to next year, you can expect similar margin performance on that business as we think about 2016.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Just to get on the individual side, clearly, there's some macro dynamics going on, you guys and your peers are all talking about similar dynamics but I guess was there anything you felt you did wrong this year that's hurting you, and conversely, what do you feel you've done right? And then, Mark, big picture, you seem pretty confident that things will get better over time but if the enrollment sort of stays flattish, do you think that things will actually get better or could this actually begin to go in the wrong direction? Thanks.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think what we're seeing in a lot of the sectors of the healthcare industry particularly the hospital business is the fact that the membership is getting flattish and that's having an impact across the sectors. And so I would say that flattish membership in the exchanges is largely a function of our inability to update the products and services in a way that learn from all of the learnings that we have every year as Shawn mentioned earlier, we now have more information.","We have some really interesting deep insights on the businesses, it looks across metal categories and CSRs and everything else and we were anxious to \u2013 we're going to start sharing some of that with CMS as we begin to tell them how we could better manage the program, gain more enrollment but we were just pulling that data together now that we have a few quarters under our belt and we're able to see some real trends in how the market is used.","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, Chris, I think the thing when you think about performance this year, you have to go all the way back to the first and second quarter of last year when we actually had to establish the pricing. And at that point, we didn't have a single shred of data on risk adjustment. We still had people in a special enrollment period sort of with membership coming in. And so I'm not sure I would say that we did anything wrong, but we really didn't have the information, to Mark's point, that we have today to set forward pricing.","I would say, clearly, what we did right was, again, going back to what Mark talked about, was we had a lot of focus on making sure we had a cost structure and program in place to sustain a lot of the price positions that we had. And we actually limited where we played to those places, where we thought we had a winning game plan for cost structure. And I think we largely see that playing out today in a somewhat favorable way, in a number of markets, whether that's both from a volume or a margin perspective.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Just coming back to your comments on the guidance. Just wanted to understand that double-digits assumption year-over-year. Are you assuming a flat Commercial margin going into 2016, and how does the definition of small group to only under 50 (45:24), does that help you at all in terms of retention and price hardening?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, I'll let Karen talk about the small group definition. We're not providing detailed guidance at this juncture, but the one thing obviously that I did comment on was that we thought that we could improve the margin profile of the ACA compliant blocks, really being both individual and the small group ACA business. And so that would certainly create favorable margin dynamics within the Commercial risk business as we sit here today.","Karen S. Lynch - President","And, Ana, relative to the change from the pay sacked, we are quite pleased with that change. It allows us to continue to medically underwrite the business. As you know, we anticipated that to go to ACA 11-16. We were able to quickly pivot and start underwriting that book for next year. So it's a net positive for us.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","And then, also, on the Medicaid book for next year, are you assuming any pressure at all? One of your competitors yesterday was indicating that the rates and even outside of Kentucky, there could be some pressure. There's been concern generally around their comments?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't say \u2013 listen, there's always pressure on any kind of sort of Medicaid renewal rate, just given sort of state fiscal pressure. So we always sort of anticipate some of that, and we try to put plans in place in advance of that to be able to sort of accommodate that. Obviously, the most notable pressure is the one I commented on before, which is sort of the annualization, if you will, of what happened in Kentucky this year, in the middle of the year.","The one area that we're working to improve, though, obviously, is we're still in the early stages of our high acuity membership. The duals and the long-term support services. And that's something, obviously, that we'd be working on, improving the profitability over time, as expected.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","(47:34). Great. Thanks. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to get a real quick data question before the real question. Did you give us the actual sequential change in the ACA compliant individual plans?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Are you talking about the 3Rs?","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","No, no. Just what happened with your ACA compliant individual membership sequentially.","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Okay. Yeah, the individual membership is down about 100,000 members from the second quarter to the third quarter. Small group, in total, is down about 100,000 members as well, quarter-to-quarter. I can get you the \u2013 we can follow up with the specific ACA -","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Yeah, that's great. Thank you so much. And then, kind of the real question. I just wanted to clarify kind of the commentary on 2016. So this year, through nine months, you've got $769 million of favorable prior-year reserve development. What you're saying is, you're excluding the abnormal part of that in \u2013 there were two comments. One that seemed to indicate that may be $0.60 a share, and then another that said it was more like $0.30 to $0.40. So I just wanted to clarify that a little bit, please.","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah. So let me be very clear on this. So through the first half of the year, if you looked at the prior-year development, in some of that, we haven't got a net benefit from because we've had to put it up in minimum MLR accruals. At the end of the second quarter, that was worth about $0.50. That same math at the end of the third quarter now is worth about $0.60. So we're basically taking that out entirely. Just, again, this is how we provide our initial guidance. So if you took the $0.60 out of our guidance, you'd end up with sort of a base number, a baseline number of around $7 per share. And growing that at least at a low-double digit rate, that's the number that we're applying that to.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Great. Thank you so much.","Thomas F. Cowhey - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Brian. A transcript of the prepared portion of this call will be posted shortly on the Investor Information section of aetna.com where you can also find a copy of our updated guidance summary containing details of our guidance metrics, including those that were unchanged or not discussed on this call.","If you have any questions about matters discussed this morning, please feel free to call me or Joe Krocheski in the Investor Relations office.

My name is Rob and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I will like to welcome everyone to the Aetna Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Krocheski, you may begin.","Joseph Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call and Webcast. This is Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna. And with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared remarks, we will answer your questions. Karen Lynch, Aetna's President, will join us for the Q&A session.","As a reminder, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC.","We've also provided reconciliations for certain non-GAAP measures in our press release and guidance summary. These reconciliations are available on the Investor Information section of Aetna.com. We would also like to invite investors to mark their calendars for Aetna's 2017 Investor Conference, which will be held in New York City on December 14. Invitations for this limited-attendance event will be sent shortly, and for those unable to attend in person a webcast will be available. As you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited, so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call. We would like to remind you, however, that it is our policy not to comment on rumors or speculation in the media or otherwise.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you, Joe, and thank you all for joining us today. As you are all aware, there has been a lot of speculation in the media about Aetna. As Joe stated in his introduction, it is our policy not to comment on rumors or speculation.","Turning to our third quarter results, this morning Aetna reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $2.45 per share, an 18% increase over the third quarter of 2016.","Our third quarter results are a continuation of our momentum from the first half of the year. Specifically, underwriting margin performance was strong, disciplined pricing, a focus on high quality care management, and an overall moderate medical cost trend environment resulted in a total health medical benefit ratio of 81.9%, an improvement compared to the same period last year despite the suspension of the health insurer fee. And we achieved an adjusted pre-tax margin of 9.2% while continuing to make targeted investments in growth initiatives.","Our focus remains on helping our members achieve their personal health ambitions, and our third quarter results reflect our continued progress. Based on our continued strong results, today we increased our full year 2017 adjusted EPS projection to approximately $9.75 per share, up from our previous projection of $9.45 to $9.55 per share. Our updated projection represents a $0.25 per share improvement over the midpoint of our previous projection, and an 18% growth versus 2016, well above our targeted long-term growth range.","In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results and updated 2017 guidance, but first I would like to highlight some operational and strategic accomplishments in the quarter. From an operational perspective, our diversified portfolio of businesses continued to deliver strong underwriting results in the third quarter across Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, our Commercial results in the quarter featured continued improvement in our small group products as repositioning these products has continued to drive better results. And the performance of our Government products in the quarter reflect strong underwriting results in our Medicare products and our previously disclosed increased investment spending on growth initiatives.","From a top line perspective, our Medicare products continue to be the main growth driver for the company. We now serve over 2.2 million Medicare members across group, individual Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products. This represents year-to-date growth of over 150,000 members driven by 15% growth in individual Medicare Advantage membership. Our strong Stars positioning, attractive product designs and increasing geographic presence are all visible in our third quarter Medicare results. As we look to the annual election period which is currently underway, we believe we are well positioned to grow our Medicare Advantage membership in 2018. Our Stars positioning remains strong. Our planned expansion into 128 new counties for 2018 is expected to increase our geographic footprint to cover approximately 62% of the individual Medicare-eligible population, up from 56% in 2017.","We are launching innovative products, including a portable Medicare Advantage option, to address the needs of mobile seniors and we are launching new Medicare Advantage products in Virginia built on our Innovation Health joint venture. Combined with the successful renewal in selling season in group Medicare Advantage, we remain confident in our ability to grow our 2018 MA membership in excess of industry growth rates.","Looking forward, our business model will be increasingly driven by data and the application of advanced analytics to enhance our understanding of each of our members. Interpreting the data in a way that makes it actionable to impact member behavior and help improve their health will further position Aetna as the partner of choice for people seeking to achieve their personal health ambition. Acting on this information, we are focused on developing models that improve health outcomes, provide care closer to members' homes and local communities, and increasingly center on a deeper understanding of each individual's social determinants of health and reducing the barriers that prevent our members from improving their health.","To accomplish our goals, we will work with health care and other non-traditional providers in local communities to source needed services for our members. Our collaboration announced in the third quarter with Meals on Wheels America speaks to the types of creative arrangements we will continue to develop. Together, we are launching a pilot program to create a best-in-class model for care coordination, integrating Meals on Wheels daily nutritious meals, social support and critical safety checks and the continuum of care required as people age.","This relationship will help us better connect with our members and their homes and communities and enable us to partner with them to address the many social determinants that influence their health. By combining advanced analytics, engaging digital consumer tools and innovative local care models, we will deliver on our brand promise by continuing to enhance our service levels, increase the quality of care our members receive, reduce the rate of medical cost trend, and help our members achieve their personal health ambition.","The recently-released 2018 Medicare Star Ratings continue to demonstrate our progress in delivering on our strategy. At 87%, Aetna has the highest percentage of membership in 4-Star or greater plans among publicly-traded companies for the third straight year. Based on our projected membership growth in 2018, we expect that percentage to rise and be relatively stable year-over-year. We often speak about our strong Star Ratings in financial or competitive terms. However, it is important to remember that the Star rating program serves as our report card to our Medicare members where we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver value across a variety of clinical and service metrics.","Our consistently high ratings further validate our commitment and execution in delivering high quality and affordable service to our members. In short, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date operating performance and strategic progress. In a few moments, Shawn will provide more detail on how to think about Aetna's growth prospects in 2018. But first I would like to provide some overall content.","At our investor update meeting earlier this year, we shared with you our growth model for Aetna in which we discussed our ability to drive mid to high single-digit profitable top line growth. To achieve this level of growth, we needed to rebalance our portfolio of businesses to point towards products that have better prospects for profitable top line growth. We began this process with our ACA-compliant small group and individual Commercial products.","As you know, since late 2016, we have been repositioning our ACA-compliant small group products towards alternative funding products and reducing our exposure to individual Commercial products in 2017 and outright exiting for 2018. In addition, earlier this month, we announced the sale of our U.S. group life and disability businesses which will enable us to focus capital and management attention on achieving our broader strategic objectives and our company mission of building a healthier world.","Finally, a strong underwriting margin position across our core businesses has enabled us to make a number of investments that we believe will drive longer-term growth. While collectively these actions have created some near-term headwinds, they will better position us to achieve our targeted top line growth objectives beginning in 2019.","In summary, I am confident Aetna is positioned to achieve our long-term growth goals. We have the right vision to lead in a changing health care marketplace, that the investments we are making will position Aetna to succeed as the health partner of choice for the people we serve and we can achieve our updated 2017 adjusted EPS projection of approximately $9.75.","I want to thank all of our employees for their efforts in serving our members and delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Shawn who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results and our updated 2017 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $814 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.45, year-over-year growth of 11% and 18% respectively. Our third quarter results reflect strong core business fundamentals driven by disciplined pricing, moderate medical cost trend and continued capital deployment.","I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our medical membership of 22.2 million is in line with our expectations for the period. Adjusted revenue was $14.9 billion, a year-over-year decrease driven by a planned reduction in Commercial ACA insured membership, the 2017 suspension of the health insurer fee and known Medicaid contract losses. These dynamics were partially offset by higher premium yields in our Commercial and Government businesses and membership growth in our Medicare products.","From an operating perspective, our businesses are performing well. Our adjusted pre-tax margin was 9.2%, a very strong result and at the high end of our target range. Our third quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 81.9%, an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the same period last year. Our third quarter results reflect strong underwriting performance that more than offset the approximately 200 basis point impact of the one-year suspension of the health insurer fee.","Our adjusted expense ratio was 17.5%, a 10 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2016, driven primarily by the suspension of the health insurer fee in 2017 and the continued execution of our expense management initiatives, partially offset by the targeted investment spending on growth initiatives discussed on prior earnings calls this year. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter 2017 dates of service and our days claims payable were stable sequentially at 54 days at the end of the quarter.","Turning to cash flow and capital, our year-to-date Health Care and Group Insurance cash flows were approximately 1.5 times net earnings. During the quarter, we distributed $166 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend and we repurchased $545 million of our shares. Year to date we have returned a total of approximately $4.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases in our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our strategy to become a more consumer-focused company.","I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter results in greater detail. Beginning with our Government business, we delivered another solid quarter, continuing our positive momentum from the first half of 2017. From a membership perspective, we grew by 23,000 Medicare members in the quarter, including growth of 11,000 in individual Medicare Advantage. Our Medicaid membership declined by approximately 218,000 members in the quarter, primarily driven by our June 30 exit of the Maryland ASC contract.","This membership decline was in line with our previous projection for the period. We grew our third quarter 2017 Government premiums, which represent over half of our total health care premiums, to $6.7 billion. Medicare premiums grew nearly 5% compared to the prior-year period, driven by strong premium growth of 12% in individual Medicare Advantage. Medicaid premiums declined year over year due to previously disclosed state contract exits. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 82.4%, a continuation of the strong results we achieved in this business during the first half of the year.","Shifting to our Commercial business, which also had a very strong third quarter from an operating margin perspective, we grew insured Commercial membership in the quarter by 177,000 members, reflecting international growth related to our acquisition of Bupa Group's Thailand business, partially offset by our continued repositioning in small group ACA-related products, which drove reduced small group insured membership. From a year-over-year perspective, total Commercial premiums were lower, largely the result of our reduced ACA-compliant individual and small group exposure and the suspension of the health insurer fee, partially offset by higher premium yields.","However, our large group Commercial premiums were modestly higher as compared to the third quarter of 2016 despite the impact of the suspension of the health insurer fee. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.4% for the quarter, a very good result and a 240 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2016 despite the negative influence of the suspension of the health insurer fee.","To better understand the year-over-year comparison let me discuss the drivers of our underwriting results by product group. Continuing the momentum from the first half of the year, we delivered another strong quarter of underwriting results in our large group Commercial insured products. Our third quarter results reflect continued pricing discipline and moderate medical cost trends. Based on our year-to-date 2017 results, we now expect our 2017 non-ACA core Commercial medical cost trends will be approximately 5.5%. We also had a strong quarter of underwriting results in our small group Commercial product as we continue to have success in repositioning these products to improve their profitability.","Moving to our ACA-compliant individual Commercial product, our third quarter results were largely in line with our expectations, with lower losses compared to the same period last year due in large part to our reduced membership. Based on our third quarter results and excluding prior-year items, we continue to project an underlying loss on 2017 ACA-compliant individual Commercial products.","Shifting to our fee-based group Commercial business, we grew Commercial ASC membership by 95,000 members in the third quarter. We now serve nearly 410,000 more Commercial ASC members compared to the same period last year. From a profitability perspective, our group Commercial fee-based business had another solid quarter, exceeding our previous expectations.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At September 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 39.5%, reflecting our decision in the quarter to pre-fund $1 billion of debt maturities that come due in the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect our year-end 2017 debt-to-total-capitalization ratio to come back down to be more in line with our targeted range.","Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with approximately $203 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $705 million. We issued $1 billion in debt in the quarter. We paid a shareholder dividend of $166 million. We used $545 million to repurchase shares. And we ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of cash at the parent, reflecting the previously discussed pre-funding of fourth quarter 2017 debt maturities. Our basic share count was approximately 326.1 million at September 30.","This morning, we increased our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to approximately $9.75 based on continued strong performance in the third quarter. Our updated 2017 projections are influenced by the following drivers. We now project our full year 2017 adjusted revenue to be approximately $60.5 billion, reflecting the divestiture of our U.S. group life and disability businesses. We now project that our full year total Health Care medical benefit ratio will be approximately 82.3%. This improved outlook is driven by continued moderate medical costs.","We now project our adjusted pre-tax margin to be approximately 8.9%, consistent with our high single-digit target. We now project adjusted earnings will be nearly $3.3 billion. And we now project full year 2017 dividends from subsidiaries to be up to $3.2 billion excluding any dividends related to the cash consideration received for the sale of our U.S. group life and disability businesses. Excluding dividends related to the sale, we expect to end the year with approximately $400 million in parent cash, reflecting the repayment of $1 billion of debt maturities during the fourth quarter and additional capital deployment.","The balance of our 2017 guidance metrics remain unchanged and can be found on our guidance summary. As is our convention, we will not be providing any 2018 projections on today's call. However, I will provide some directional commentary to help investors better understand some of the larger moving items that we expect will impact 2018 adjusted revenue and adjusted earnings. As you know, as a matter of course we do not include prior-year's reserve development in our forward earnings projections.","Additionally, 2017 results benefited from the final assessment of 2016 risk adjustment and reinsurance for ACA-compliant products. Based on our updated 2017 adjusted EPS projection, and the combination of these two items, we believe Aetna's 2017 baseline adjusted earnings to be approximately $8.75 per share. While we are still working through our planning process, we have incorporated a number of challenges in our forward outlook. From an adjusted revenue perspective, these include the previously-disclosed sale of our U.S. group life and disability businesses, the previously disclosed Medicaid contract exits, our exit from individual Commercial products and our continued repositioning of our ACA-compliant small group Commercial products. We project these top line challenges will also pressure adjusted earnings in 2018.","In addition to these items we project adjusted earnings growth to be pressured by the reintroduction of the industry-wide non-deductible health insurer fee, creating a headwind of approximately $0.25 in 2018 due to the timing of revenue and expense recognition. We also expect this reintroduction to produce incremental experience rating pressure in our large group insured products.","For 2018, we do see a number of opportunities, including our projected above-industry growth in individual Medicare Advantage and strong growth in group Medicare Advantage products, the full year impact of 2017 capital deployment action, and the potential to deploy additional capital to improve adjusted EPS growth, the reduction of losses from exiting individual Commercial products in 2018 and our ability to achieve expense efficiencies as we continue to simplify our processes and drive for best-in-class business performance.","In closing, as we begin the final quarter of 2017 and continue to plan for 2018, we are encouraged by what has been a strong adjusted EPS growth year in 2017 despite some top line challenges. We also remain confident in our ability to drive long-term adjusted EPS growth over time.","I will now turn the call back over to Joe. Joe?","Joseph Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator? The first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research","Thank you. Good morning. I guess I want to talk about the top line a little bit more and maybe juxtapose that with some of the investment spending and so I guess I just want to get a better sense of the top line. I understand this repositioning, it sounds like 2018 won't be a growth year, but you're expecting that in 2019. So, I guess I just want to understand what are the major drivers? I'm assuming Medicare is in there, but how do you think about the rest of the book after you've pared everything back? And then maybe you can include what some of the investment spending has been? You've seen an acceleration of that spending through the income statement, and CapEx was actually up a lot in the quarter as well. So hopefully those are connected questions where you guys can talk a little bit about where the growth would come from?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. Josh, I think your overall characterization of 2018 and 2019 is correct. And when you think about a lot of the spending that we've been doing, especially in the second half of the year, a lot of that actually has been more pointed at 2019 growth, particularly in Medicare for example, with ongoing geographic expansion. A lot of the expenditures we're doing around analytics and technology and digital platform are also things that have a multi-year sort of growth dynamic to them. So I think when you think about 2019, we would largely think about Medicare continuing on that above-industry growth trajectory that it's been on. I would continue to think about our large group core business as sort of being in that mid single-digits, which they've largely been on.","And what will be a driver I think around 2019 actually will be Medicaid. And if we can get back on the low double-digit track of Medicaid earnings growth, then obviously we're making some investment there around sort of our procurement and re-procurement processes. But that I think will ultimately turn out to be the linchpin around sort of the degree of growth for 2019.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research","Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Great. Maybe just following up on that question then, I guess can you talk a little bit about the small group positioning? It's been a few years now in a row where you continue to talk about small group positioning where I guess the margins continue to perform well but the top line is not really growing. When do you think we'll see that inflection point?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Kevin, it's Karen. I think you'll continue to see a contraction in small group during 2018 as we continue to look at the ACA book and really have a tailored approach to that. As you know, we've been repositioning the book for self-insured that has been doing quite well for us in the market. So I think the 2019 year is where you should expect to see growth. You'll see continued \u2013 you should see growth there.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can I just follow up?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. Just recall, Kevin, that obviously there's a dynamic here of going on of the move to alternate funding, right, which sometimes we're saving some of those members but they're in a reduced revenue profile. The other thing I would say that I think has happened this year is when we look at that business, we've largely got that business back into a target margin range, and so I think the repositioning is more successful than just sort of the revenue line might indicate on the surface.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And how much of that ASO membership is coming from the small group conversion?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","A fair amount is coming. I mean, we're getting both. It's both large group and small group but there's a fair amount of strength in the underlying small group move into that market.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to stay on the top line for 2018. Did you say that you agree that 2018 would be a down year from a revenue perspective? And then Shawn, I know you've talked about exiting some of these businesses and the Medicaid losses booked on the SG&A line. Can you expand at all on how you expect that SG&A is deleveraging the impact to business and whether you feel like you can offset it with some other efficiency targets?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. So let me be clear about 2018. I think, in response to Josh's question, I was concurring that it wouldn't be a growth year. I don't think I said that it would be a down year. I do think it's important to \u2013 on these revenue issues, right, we have a good handle on what the revenue is. The individual exit is a little north of $1 billion. The Group Insurance divestiture is $2 billion. The Medicaid exits are probably approaching $2 billion. So there's a lot in this repositioning there to sort of hold flat.","I think, as we mentioned, some of what we did this year was to try to accelerate SG&A spending and spend it in lieu of maybe spending it in the future. We've done that. Some of the spending that we've ramped up this year won't recur. But to your point, I think in this business, when you're challenged on the top line, you just really need to take the action on the SG&A line through your productivity measures and elsewhere, and I think that will be part of sort of the roll forward for having a successful 2018 will be managing this deleveraging.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to ask you about your PBM contract, which is coming up at the end of 2019. You've talked about having an answer for us some time by the end of this year, but you'd also recently said you were hopeful of having that done before Anthem got their contract done in case CVS won it, and it appears they have won it. So can you talk about how you perceive your contract will go this year for 2019 or 2020?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Yes. Peter, this is Mark. So we have to make a decision at the latest, announce a decision at the latest in mid-2018 in order to make the transition operationally were we to move that contract. If you look at the details of the Anthem relationship, it's very much patterned after ours but with a very short exit to their own PBM operation. So we view this as not a problem for us. We believe that that will help in leveraging the buying that CVS does for drugs so we can continue to find a lower cost structure. So we're not at all concerned about that relationship. We think it's fine, and we think that we've got some time. We're talking to all the right people across all the relevant parties that could help us with a contract like this to get to a decision and announce a decision no later than mid-2018.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So is mid-2018 later than you'd originally thought? I thought you were hoping \u2013 hopeful for it by the end of this year.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","We will have our own internal decision-making process by the end of this year, but we will \u2013 it'll probably be mid-2018 before we figure out the logic of how we're going to communicate it and how we're going to transition it. Once you come to a decision, you have to build the execution path to move forward.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Most of my questions are answered. I just want to go back to Shawn on the HIF headwind for 2018. That $0.25 net impact you're talking about that, that would be both impact in terms of commercial timing and also any net impact on MA margins?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","What we've tried to do is actually characterize it as other people have characterized it in this cycle. So what I would say is it's a combination of sort of the accounting dynamic that exists this year and then the effect of this next year. As I've mentioned before, this is \u2013 money is fungible and so this is all about \u2013 you can put it 100% into pricing, but it's about whether you get your overall aggregate price at the end of the day. So this quantification was sort of intended to pick up both dynamics.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","In Medicare it's really a market-by-market determination based on where we are with the plan design, where we are with the rebate structure, how our underlying medical costs are going. So it's \u2013 it can't be looked at on average. I mean we'll give guidance toward that near the end or as we get to 2018 guidance, but from our perspective this is a market-by-market discussion.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","And I continue to, as we've talked to people as this has played out obviously, the group Commercial, the large group place is the space to sort of watch this, because I think the absolute level of rate increase matters. And we're having obviously a good year on Commercial, and so I think that is going to create some challenges in terms of sort of how much of that will flow back through the experience rating process.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I mean, are you saying that you're actually seeing some more aggressive pricing behavior in large group Commercial? Is that effectively what you're saying?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","No. No. No, no. Not at all. I'm just saying the absolute rate increase matters, and as we try to sort of manage that dynamic through the experience rating process, I think it creates pressure on the overall sort of renewal rating process.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Company","Hi. I'd like to follow up on the HIF. Given that you're exiting about $1 billion in revenue in individual and about $2 billion in Medicaid, are you able to cover the HIF related to that? Because the HIF is related on prior-year revenue. And how do we think about that headwind and your ability to offset that with rate increases to the rest of the book?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yes. So, Christine, when you start to recover this, you're always making provision for what is the estimated revenue base you're going to have to recover this from. And so in doing that we normally buy ourselves some breathing room and anticipate that we might have some of this. So that dynamic though is captured in the $0.25 when we look at it. I think we've done a pretty good job of positioning ourselves for sort of how this has played out.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to put a finer point on the SG&A spending bar estimate. Your increase in SG&A guidance this year is probably about $0.5 billion, maybe even a little more than that in terms of your expected spending versus the beginning of the year. And I wondered, Shawn, you alluded to some of those being pull-forward in an earlier comment. Could you be a little more specific or precise about how much you're able to dial that back? How much of that is nonrecurring? Things of that sort? Thanks.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. I probably can't be overly specific at this point on that. I think the number you have is a little bit high. We have been dragging a little bit on the top line this year, and that impacts that ratio as well going forward. So some of it, as I mentioned in a previous question, sort of managing that spend as well as other actions, that will be part of how we bridge from 2017 to 2018. So it will be a meaningful part of the equation, but that's \u2013 we're working through our planning process right now, so I really can't be more specific at this juncture.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to come back to the pricing environment. In cost trend once again in 2017 is going to be about 100 basis points below where you started the year. I just want to get your view, is there any building pressure or pushback in your minds coming on the pricing front? Do you think you're pretty much in a steady-state environment? Thanks.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Chris, this is Mark. I think we are in a pretty much steady-state environment. Of course, we always price for an expectation of an increase in the next year, and so we continue that practice as a conservative approach. But so far in the environment based on medical costs and, obviously, you all can see it by virtue of the reporting of for-profit hospitals and other health corporations that there is a definite slowdown in trend. And I think we will continue to see sort of a moderated trend environment and a conservative pricing environment.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah, and I think, Chris, the fact one of the cleanest places to sort of see this is when we talk about large group. And when you HIF-adjust sort of that revenue, we're right there in the mid single-digits for revenue growth. And I think that's a very good indicator of sort of the state of the market around this issue.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. You flagged an increased focus on analytics a couple of times today. And I've noticed Aetna popping up at more tech industry events like Strata as well as the spike in hiring for data scientists. So clearly it's a big focus right now. Can you speak in greater detail to what Aetna is doing on the analytics side? Then just to understand the data behind what's being analyzed are you able to pull in data from HSA balances from PayFlex or use any additional forces such as clinician and home health visit notes, or data from external services to understand the full picture of the member?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Thanks, Sarah. This is Mark. A couple of things. First let's start with the data itself. We are pulling from multiple sources. We are building what I would call reusable and disposable databases where we can pull data together and do analytics. We are using tools that are a lot less expensive than tools that were available five years ago or before. So all of that has allowed us to gear this up pretty aggressively from the standpoint of not only the data we're collecting and aggregating, but also the people we're employing, and getting excited about this.","As you know, in the data analytics world, these techie people love to get a hard problem to solve. And so we're really pushing after that, and that's a big part of the compensation associated with bringing teams together. So we've geared up pretty significantly in the numbers and types of people we've hired around that. We are now using these data analytics and these findings throughout the whole P&L. So at the revenue line, we're now looking at, on a daily basis, our branding spend and how we're approaching particularly Medicare enrollment, and how we change the marketing mix on a daily basis to move money to the best places to continue to drive growth. And even in the Commercial Group market, we're using it to better understand how we can approach employers in different market segments.","In the small group that Karen noted earlier, we're using bswift and a lot of interesting tools to go after groups that want a very different kind of product on a self-funded basis. And so on the revenue line, we're using a lot of data analytics. On the medical cost line, we're now able to detect fraud based on looking at charts and looking at claims as they come in, and looking for keywords and patterns of behavior that may give us insights on fraud, may give us insights on practice discontinuities.","Our relationship with Meals on Wheels is now using an app that really is crowd sourcing social determinants in the home as we pilot it in two markets, getting to roll that out nationally once we work out the bugs of meeting the demand that we find in that. And then of course as we look at SG&A, this obviously gives us a much cheaper set of insights to go after, both creating what I call an economic flywheel where we invest in the quality of the products and services to our members. We keep them longer. That drives more revenue and the bottom line really is an output. The result being now we're looking at lifetime value of members across the spectrum and across products and across markets as a way of determining where our best opportunities are. So there's a lot going on here. It's been a pretty big investment. It's come up pretty quickly and I think we're just scratching the surface.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just hoping you can reconcile the comments on the revenue headwind relative to sort of the earnings headwind. So I certainly appreciate HICs for instance losing money on the top \u2013 losing the revenue, but that is a money-losing business. Medicaid's obviously lower margin. Your group life disability has cash proceeds coming in to kind of offset some of the earnings pressure. So, I guess any help on small group, or maybe if you're willing to just give us sort of a net result of all those headwinds to kind of earnings similar to what you did on the revenue dollars. Thanks.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. So I think it's a very good point, Ralph, because a number of these revenue headwinds really don't have the corresponding earnings pressure that their size might make you think. As we mentioned in the announcement, the Group Insurance revenue side, $2 billion, but what we've said is that that will be slightly dilutive. And if you thought about $0.10, that would be about the right number for something like that. Obviously, the Individual Commercial exit is over $1 billion of revenue. But when I take out the prior-year items, we're still north of a $200-million loss on that business. So that will be better; so that will be a good guide and it's a question again of sort of managing sort of the fixed expense element around a product exit.","Medicaid, clearly that business was profitable, but it's lower profit than average for our overall book, so there's that side of it. So I think when you think about an adjusted base of $8.75 to grow off of, I think we feel good about sort of the forward prospects when we think about capital deployment, the Medicare growth that we're going after. And so I do think there's a good dynamic here that we need to keep in mind sort of between the top line and the bottom line, at least as it is for 2018.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes. Hi, and I'm sorry if I'm missing something out of context with this, but just looking back from your 2014 Investor Day when you talked about your targets for 2018, and I know you know the $80-plus billion in operating revenue was something that we talked about previously is not realistic given the circumstances of events since then, but I think you had said the $10 in EPS was still something that you expected to be achievable. I'm not trying to get \u2013 trying to ask this question, without getting at guidance, if you see what I might be missing in the intervening time period.","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Yeah. So we've had that target out there in the past. So let me be clear, because we're close enough to 2018. I'm not providing 2018 guidance. We're just too close to that for me to comment specifically, but what I would go back to is this adjusted baseline of $8.75 and think about the drivers forward off of that. And, again, I continue to think about capital deployment, because we will do a lot \u2013 we've done a lot of that this year. That will have an annualized benefit next year, plus we'll have next year's capital deployment. So that should be a meaningful number for next year in the overall equation. And we've talked about some of the challenges around experience rating and the health insurer fee and things like that, but, again, we do have some good opportunities on Medicare and the exiting of the individual business. So from that adjusted baseline going forward, and I think we're feeling pretty good right now.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Zack Sopcak - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I had a question on your Medicare Stars rating. Now that you've had three years at the top of your peer group, can you talk about how important that is to your strategy to grow on Medicare Advantage? And, conversely, when you think about seniors, how high is the rank on their list of importance to have that availability of 4-Star plan?","Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.","Hi. It's Karen. I think we've demonstrated that having top of the game performance in Stars is really helping us generate our overall Medicare growth. We talked a little bit about investments before, this is an area that we're squarely investing in to continue staying at the top of our Stars game here. I think that if you think about the seniors and how they select it's important to them, and I think we have demonstrated results in the past year showing that we're exceeding our membership, exceeding the market membership, and we expect to exceed market memberships next year as well. So it's clearly important to us.","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","I would add this is something that we have as a bottom-line investment every year regardless of what other things are in the budget. And as a result of what we think will happen in open enrollment this year, we will maintain a pretty level area of the percentage of members we have in these 4-Star plus plans. Our next opportunity though is 4.5-Star plans and 5-Star plans. And so part of our relationships, the Inova Innovation Health Plan relationship and unique products we're building there will give us an opportunity to start to drive a 5-star plan. Our relationship with Alina and a few others are all investments we're making and those kinds of relationships, they give us a better opportunity to do 4.5-Star and 5-Star plans.","Zack Sopcak - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, morning. I've got more of a strategic question for you. And what I was wondering is, what's your current vision and strategy with respect to the various forms of care delivery and entering those businesses and, in particular, in sort of alternate settings for care delivery? How important is it to own those assets as opposed to perhaps what you can do through partnership and integration in that space?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Thanks, Lance. Mark. We do view lower-cost venues of health care delivery, like in the home, like at retail and in our pharmacy relationships, as opportunities for us to provide a higher-quality, more convenient version of care at a better price point and a lower cost structure, particularly given that 41% of the health care spend now is coming out of people's pockets on average. And so it's our view that this is the next big arbitrage. We don't need to own it but we need to find the right economics to make the relationship work for both parties, the deliverer of the care as well as for us in insuring that care. So as we move ahead, we continue to look for things like the Meals on Wheels partnership, other relationships to do home infusion, getting lower cost DME and closer to the home. All those sorts of things are really big opportunities over the long run to change the sort of arc of the curve of health care expenditures and trend.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And, Mark, how big of an opportunity do you see this as? What I'm thinking of is, obviously, you're not going to move surgeries into the home or something like that. But if you're talking about the various categories of spend, do you think it'd be diverted from higher-cost settings, so emergency room or hospital imaging or things like that? Roughly speaking, is that 5% of medical costs? Is that 25% of medical costs? Like how big of an opportunity is this?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Well, I think you have to sort of widen the lens on what you consider to being provided. So it's not about taking what's happening in what I call the warranty card system from the home or from the institution into the home. It's actually doing things like our Meals on Wheels effort where we can crowdsource on social determinants that allow us to make investments in support of socialization, access, quality of life in the home that keeps people out of the emergency room, keeps people away from the surgery center, results in a better, longer-term quality of life and a better lifetime value of the member by making those investments early.","So I would not sort of think of it as purely arbitrage from taking somebody out of an ER and moving them into a mini-clinic. I think you have to think about keeping people away from the medical industrial complex by offering better services in the home, meeting social determinants, which are a big driver of health care expenditures today, much bigger than people understand, and then where we have an opportunity to do things like DME infusion, blood draws, imaging, discharge planning, we can do those closer to the home or in the home at a lower cost than we can do them today.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much. And just one follow-up is, as you're going through different strategic decisions right now, how do you take into account tax reform and different things like that, that could be altering your future earnings growth power? And what's your outlook for tax reform coming out of Congress?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Well, I think our whole view is that the best thing to do when you're going through hell is just to keep going. And so you just keep plowing through it and you will let all the other stuff happen the way it's going to happen. Our strategy is not impacted by tax reform. Things only get better for us in tax reform because we don't have the kind of tax expenditures other kinds of businesses have. Reform on the ACA, we're out, so when that gets right and stable, we'll look at reconsidering on how we get in. Medicaid is a state-by-state evaluation. Medicare is a program that works very well for seniors most importantly but also for the people who do the right thing, which is invest in the quality of life of the senior.","So I would say all of this other noise, the best way to handle it is just to keep going, focus on your strategy, deliver on it, knowing that these exogenies might actually have some impact, but know which ones are positive and which ones could take your feet out from underneath you. And right now, I don't see any of those taking our feet out from underneath us.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks a lot. Mark, I was wondering if there would be any interest in addressing the need for skinny health plans? Obviously, I know it's a bit of a gray area now. Are you looking for a more definitive response to the government before you get back into individual?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","We are actually looking at reenergizing a program we had prior to the ACA but in a more on a focus of short-term, one-year kind of plan, or transition plan, versus just the skinny benefit, which leaves a lot of people at some moral harm at some point. And so we have to think about what kind of plan it would look like and offer it as a transitionary plan over a year. And so we're already all over that. As soon as the executive order came out, we were on top of it.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Would you be one of the first to kind of offer an actuarial value to that so at least consumers can start to compare? And I understand that notion might be a little bit confusing, but at least some baseline for people to begin to shop and compare a little bit better than what they've had historically?","Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.","Regulation matters on that, right? So we have to get the executive order to regulation before we can understand what the rules are. But we will be prepared when we have the opportunity to act.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just a question regarding MA, I was wondering if you could provide a bit more color on some of the investments you're making in MA, specifically related to your PBM business within MA and Part D? And any changes going on with that going forward?","Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.","Well, let me talk to you about the general investments in MA, and then we'll address the PBM one. First, it's about geographic expansion. So we have really good same-store growth. We need more stores. And so it is our intention to get into the 80%, mid 80%s coverage over the next few years. And we're on a ramp. Part of the \u2013 one of the biggest parts of our investment is ramping the ability to build out networks. And we're actually using very interesting data analytics to figure that out as well, using the Medicare database. And so this whole idea of expanding more markets is going to generate future growth.","Now the other is that we've got 30% of the people that retire every day, 11,000-ish that only take Medicare Advantage, 70% don't. In large part that 70% is related to network coverage and portability. So for 1\/1\/2018 we will have launched a portable Medicare Advantage product across our current network, which is approximately 62% coverage, where we will test out some of the aspects in certain markets of having this kind of coverage and learn more so that when we get ramped up to that mid 80%, we will have an ability to offer a nationally portable Medicare Advantage product. And that, we'll go after that 70%. Star ratings getting to 4.5-Stars, 5-Stars with some of our big ACL relationships is a big idea.","And then back on the PBM side, we continue to develop a relationship across our network. We have the ability to build our own network where we're getting the best cost structure we can get to provide an affordable product for seniors in the PDP and MAPD product.","Joseph Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Steve.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now turn the conference over to Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cowhey, you may begin.","Thomas F. Cowhey - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna's second quarter 2015 earnings call and webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna, and with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions. Karen Rohan, Aetna's President, will also join us for the Q&A session.","Before we begin, I would like to address some regulatory requirements. Today's presentation is neither an offering of securities, nor a solicitation of a proxy vote. The information discussed today is qualified in its entirety by the registration statement and joint proxy statement that Aetna and Humana will be filing in the future, and Aetna's and Humana's shareholders are urged to read those filings carefully.","In addition, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC.

So, we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported strong second quarter operating earnings of $2.05 per share, a 21% increase from last year's second quarter.","Underlying our second quarter results are sound operating fundamentals, as evidenced by: record quarterly operating revenue of over $15.1 billion; medical cost trends that remained moderate and drove a healthy level of reserve development in the quarter; a total medical benefit ratio that improved 200 basis points year-over-year; and pre-tax operating margins of 8.7%, an improvement of 110 basis points over last year's second quarter.","Based on our strong second quarter results, we are raising our full-year 2015 operating EPS guidance to at least $7.40 per share, eliminating the bottom end of our previous range, and recognizing the potential for meaningful upside in our full-year outlook, particularly as we contemplate our continuing prudent stance on accruing for the 3Rs.","This quarter is the sixth quarter in a row that we have increased our operating EPS projection. Even at the minimum performance level we are projecting, our updated guidance represents over 10% year-over-year operating EPS growth, consistent with our low double-digit long-term operating EPS growth target.","In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter results and improved outlook. But, first, I am going to re-emphasize the rationale behind our proposed acquisition of Humana and briefly discuss some of the operational highlights of the quarter.","In early July, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Humana. The combination will create one of the country's largest managed care companies, with strong membership positions across multiple lines of business. We believe this strategic acquisition is very compelling, will provide significant value to customers and deliver attractive returns for shareholders. Specifically, the acquisition will substantially accelerate our ability to grow in Medicare Advantage. Aetna's current Medicare Advantage footprint covers approximately 45% of the Medicare eligible population.","The combined companies serve 4.4 million Medicare Advantage members, representing 8% of today's 54 million Medicare beneficiaries, and will expand our geographic footprint to cover approximately 90% of the Medicare eligible population. This expanded reach will increase our ability to continue to offer high quality products to customers and capitalize on the projected growth in Medicare programs.","We believe there's an opportunity to improve the performance of Humana's Commercial and Medicaid businesses by deploying our strong capabilities in both these areas. The combination will reduce costs, which will enable the combined company to provide more cost-effective products to consumers.","Humana's significant investment in consumer engagement, as evidenced by their industry-leading net promoter score and Medicare Advantage star ratings, will enhance our own consumer engagement efforts. The combination brings together two companies with a shared vision of enabling providers to transition from episodic care to a population health model.","And, finally, the Humana acquisition adds a growing services business and reintroduces certain PBM capabilities to our portfolio, providing longer term optionality to create a high growth, high margin, non-regulated cash flow stream. All of these strategic benefits are accomplished in a transaction that is financially compelling and projected to be accretive not only to earnings per share, but to our operating EPS growth rate.","Moving on to second quarter highlights. Beginning with our Group Commercial business, operating results for our large group Commercial business was strong in the second quarter. We continue to favor margin over membership in this business, producing strong operating margins and predictable capital generation that enables the investments needed to drive our long-term growth strategy.","While the quarterly operating performance of our small group and individual businesses was impacted by the official CMS calculations on risk adjusters, we continue to be pleased with the underlying performance across these blocks of business and how they are positioned for 2016.","Moving on, our Government business had another standout quarter. Starting with Medicare, we increased Medicare medical membership by 24,000 members during the quarter, driven by Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage. We continue to believe that Medicare is one of the most attractive growth opportunities for our company and our industry. Year-to-date, Aetna's Medicare Advantage revenues have increased by 12% over the same period last year, and we are on track to achieve mid single-digit pre-tax operating margins in this business this year.","Our Medicaid business also delivered another strong quarter of results. We grew medical membership by 42,000 members across multiple state programs and delivered pre-tax operating margins near the high end of our targeted range for this business. While the ramp in the duals demonstration programs continues to lag our expectations, we believe in the long-term opportunity of the duals program, as well as the opportunity to serve other additional high acuity populations.","Finally, we continue to make progress in both our provider and consumer engagement efforts during the quarter. We remain on track to achieve our 2015 goals in these areas, and are excited by the opportunity to accelerate these efforts through the Humana acquisition.","I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong quarter for Aetna. I am confident we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing health care marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy, we will continue to be disciplined across all of our lines of business, we will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, and we can exceed $7.40 of operating earnings per share in 2015.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who'll provide additional insight into our second quarter results, our updated 2015 outlook, and the financial aspects of our proposed Humana acquisition. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $722 million, and operating earnings per share of $2.05. Aetna's operating results continued to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flow, and operating margins.","I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top line performance for the quarter was solid. Medical membership held steady at approximately 23.7 million members as growth in Commercial ASC and Government membership offset declines in our small group and middle market Commercial Insured businesses. We grew operating revenue to a record quarterly level of over $15.1 billion, driven by higher premium yields and year-over-year growth in medical membership.","From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pre-tax operating margin was 8.7% for the quarter, 110 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our second quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.1%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development.","Our operating expense ratio was 18.3%, a 70-basis point increase over the second quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and lower than projected operating revenue.","From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to first quarter 2015 dates of service.","Additionally, our days claims payable were approximately 52 days at the end of the quarter. While sequentially lower, this metric is at a healthy level and the expected decline is consistent with improved processing times and our insured membership growth profile in the second quarter. Note that our days claims payable has increased by over four days as compared to the prior-year quarter.","Turning to cash flow and capital, operating cash flows remain strong. On a year-to-date basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were over 1.2 times operating earnings. We continue to project that our full-year 2015 Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows will exceed our 2015 operating earnings.","Our share repurchases during the quarter were constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition. We did, however, repurchase over 900,000 shares in the quarter for $100 million and distributed another $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend.","As disclosed previously, our ability to repurchase shares prior to the closing of the Humana acquisition will be limited. In summary, we are quite pleased with our second quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. I will now discuss the key drivers of our second quarter performance in greater detail.","Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership declined by 61,000 members during the quarter, as declines in our Commercial Insured business more than offset gains in our Commercial ASC membership. The declines in Commercial Insured membership were largely driven by our small group and middle markets businesses, a direct result of the previously disclosed pricing actions to improve performance in this block.","Attrition in our individual business was consistent with our previously communicated projections. As we continue to monitor our Commercial membership base, we remain pleased with the indicators on membership attraction and selection as well as overall performance.","Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.8% for the quarter, a 120 basis point increase over the same period last year on a reported basis; however, it is important to note the year-over-year increase in our reported Commercial MBR is essentially a timing issue reflecting our updated view on ACA risk adjustment payables.","Simply stated, if we remove all 3R adjustments booked in the second quarter, but related to prior-periods, our second quarter 2015 Commercial MBR would have been essentially equivalent to our second quarter 2014 Commercial MBR. This underlying performance is consistent with our projections for the quarter and leaves us well-positioned in the Commercial business over the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. It is also worth noting that as of the end of Q2, we have not booked any receivable related to risk corridors for either 2014 or 2015.","Moving on from the 3Rs. Medical cost trends continue to be moderate, and based on year-to-date experience, we now project that Aetna's 2015 core Commercial medical cost trend will be at the low-end of our projected range of 6% to 7%.","Another important growth lever is our Government business, which grew by 66,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 5,000 members. Medicare Supplement grew by 19,000 members, and Medicaid membership also grew by 42,000 members. Of note, Medicaid membership is now up 4% year-over-year, despite the exit from the Delaware Medicaid contract at the end of last year.","Our second quarter 2015 Government premiums were $5.7 billion, and our Government medical benefit ratio was 80.3% in the quarter, a 620 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Drivers of this excellent result include excellent performance in Medicare; a demonstration of operating improvements in our individual Medicare Advantage business, including strong revenue performance and continued favorable medical cost trends as our initiatives to lower costs continue to exceed our projections; continued strong performance in our group Medicare Advantage business; as well as improved margins in our PDP businesses as our product redesign and network re-contracting efforts improved margins versus the prior-year quarter. Additionally, we saw continued strong performance in Medicaid, driven by favorable prior-period reserve development and continued improvement in a select number of our Medicaid contracts.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure, and liquidity, all continue to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 34%.","Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $576 million. We reduced outstanding debt by approximately $300 million. We repurchased over 900,000 shares for $100 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $100 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was 349 million at June 30.","As a result of our second quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to at least $7.40 per share. This is the sixth consecutive quarter where we have met or exceeded consensus in increased guidance. This guidance increase also speaks to the strength of the underlying business, as we are overcoming headwinds related to an updated view of ACA risk adjuster payments, a larger than projected rate decrease in Kentucky, and a higher weighted average share count than contemplated in our previous projections.","Further, our updated guidance formulation where we have provided a minimum projected performance level acknowledges that there could be meaningful upside opportunities to our projections over the remainder of the year, including accrual of 2014 and 2015 risk corridor receivables, our current estimates indicate that we could be owed well in excess of $100 million related to 2014 alone. We expect we will have some additional clarity on this program in mid-August.","Actions taken to better understand the health of our ACA compliant populations, which could lower our projected 2015 risk adjuster payables and continued performance across our Government blocks of business that is better than our projections. Potentially offsetting these opportunities is the ever present risk that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected.","Our updated 2015 guidance is also influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our second quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be between 23.4 million and 23.5 million members, down approximately 250,000 members from our last projection.","For the remainder of the year, we now project that growth in Government membership will be more than offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including in our individual, small group and student health businesses.","Primarily, based on lower membership and mix, we have revised our outlook on full-year 2015 operating revenue, which we now project to be in the range of $60 billion to $61 billion. Based on our strong second quarter results, we now project our full-year total medical benefit ratio will be 81.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points, and that our full-year 2015 Commercial MBR will be essentially flat when compared to the 2014 Commercial MBR of 80.2%.","Primarily, as a result of our updated revenue projections and continued investment spending on our strategic initiatives, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be in the range of 18.5% to 19% for the full-year. We now project our pre-tax operating margin to be at least 7.9%, consistent with our high single-digit target, with operating earnings of at least $2.6 billion.","Finally, in light of the pending Humana transaction, we now expect that we will use free cash flow this year to eliminate any projected commercial paper borrowings, which will leave us with a parent cash balance of approximately $200 million at year-end. Our 2015 share count is now projected to be approximately 353 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition.","I'd like to finish with a few words on the proposed acquisition of Humana. Mark outlined the strategic merits of the acquisition at the outset this morning, and I'd like to spend a moment on the projected financial benefits. Humana has deep experience in Medicare Advantage, a business that we think can continue to grow membership at mid to high single-digit rates with sustainable margins in the mid-single-digit range. We remain confident that we are purchasing a premier provider in this growing business.","Humana's Commercial and Medicaid businesses will substantially benefit from Aetna's expertise and we are confident in our ability to improve performance in these businesses. There is substantial synergy value that will be unlocked through this transaction that we are confident we can achieve and will enable us to deliver more cost-effective products for consumers.","And, finally, we have not included any revenue or health care services synergies in our outlook, which should ultimately provide upside to our projections and enhance our growth profile over the longer term.","Our experience in successfully integrating the Coventry acquisition and the strength of our management team gives us great confidence that we have the right people and processes to manage the Humana integration to a successful outcome. We are building a dedicated team with experienced executives and operators to manage each step of the integration and have great confidence in our ability to execute our plans. We look forward to moving this process to a successful closing in the second half of 2016, so that we may begin to realize the value proposition for our customers, members, and shareholders.","As we look to the balance of 2015, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remain strong and we are confident in our operating EPS projection of at least $7.40 per share. The Humana acquisition will only serve to enhance our position as a leader in the transformation of the health care system, delivering more cost-effective products to customers, and our ability to achieve and exceed our long-term growth objectives.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas F. Cowhey - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question, so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on the MBR. Could you comment on the sustainability of MBR on the Government side? Shawn, you mentioned the headwind from Kentucky rates. I'm wondering if there are other factors that we should consider?","And then on the Commercial side of the MBR, is the membership mix that you are seeing, the departures in membership, are you seeing that be favorable to your margin profile in the Commercial side of the business? Thanks.","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yep, thanks, David. Let me start with the second one, because clearly the answer is yes. As we mentioned, we've pushed price, we're seeing a little bit of volume pressure, but because of the way this is shaking out, we're doing fine from a margin dollars perspective, so that's going the right way.","On the Government business, I think it's worth commenting on, really, why it's performing so well and then talk a little bit about the outlook. I would say, first, that both Medicare and Medicaid are performing very well. The way this is showing up, has been another quarter of very strong prior-period development. Obviously, leading the pack on Medicaid is Kentucky, that continues to perform very well, and as you alluded to, we will have a rate reset in the third quarter.","Medicare is really firing on all cylinders, as I mentioned. The individual MA business, the group MA business are performing very well, and I think that's the result of investments that we made even more than a year ago, but looking at making sure that we're doing as good a job as we can on revenue and medical management. I also mentioned the PDP margins, the actions we took to re-contract the network and do some product redesign have really taken hold, and that business is performing better.","I think the thing I don't want to get lost here, obviously, is the fact that the Medicare business is running so much meaningfully better and very well in the second quarter. I think that's a nice thing to be taking into 2016 when you think about the bids that we submitted during the second quarter.","You know, in terms of our outlook, we are not projecting that this same very favorable level will show up in the second half of the year. Part of this is we do want to be careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves and we're not making any assumption in terms of these ongoing very strong levels of PPD, for instance.","You mentioned the Kentucky rate reset. That is certainly a meaningful item in the second half of the year, and also there tends to be a little bit of seasonal pressure on the Medicare MBR in the second half of the year, just related to the risk scores in the population.","So, I do think, we still will have a very good result. In fact, our forecast for these businesses, certainly, has them squarely in the target margin range for the full-year. I do expect that the second half performance will not be as good as the first half; but again, these businesses are still performing exceptionally well.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everybody. Thanks. First of all, just of the 3R accrual, I appreciate the commentary of how the new information has affected your 2014 assumptions and accruals. How is that reflected in your 2015 accruals? Have you made any changes to what you're doing for 2015 as a result of the information on 2014?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, absolutely. So, to your point, when the data came out on June 30, we recognized that we needed to increase the risk adjustment accrual related to 2014 by about $60 million.","The next logical question is, what does that data tell you about your 2015 accrual? And we have largely assumed that in our guidance, and what we booked for the second quarter, that the 2015 risk adjustment payables will be more or less at the same PMPM rate as the 2014 payable, despite the fact that we are making substantially more investment spending to improve that result and the potential for risk pool improvement in 2015.","So, I think it speaks, again, to the strength of the underlying businesses. Not only do we have the prior-period sort of catch up adjustments we've discussed, but the very fact that we're in essence sort of on plan and flat year-over-year, that's being done, in essence, in the face of a higher outlook for 2015 which, again, I think speaks directly to how well the underlying Commercial business is performing.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And maybe as my follow-up question, I'm going to take a shot at this, I think the two questions that we've generally gotten since you guys have announced the Humana deal are around how can we get confident in your anticipated accretion, given the volatility in Humana's results, and how can we get comfortable around the regulatory path we're going through? I guess, since you announced the deal, there's been the announcement of Humana's second quarter results and there's also been, obviously, another deal announced so that we now know we've got two big deals before the DOJ. Any update or any words that you would offer to try to add to comfort around either of those issues?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","A.J., Mark. On the regulatory approach, we've already filed our HSR. We're starting to file in a number of states. We need 20 state approvals for Form As. We'll file our S4 in the next couple of weeks. And so all of that, since the process is underway, we've engaged in conversations with insurance commissioners, with governors, with Washington, and we are most concerned about staying on our strategy, our point of view.","We're doing deep analysis, even deeper than we did before the deal on a number of competitors by market the plans offered, the opportunity to divest. I think if you all do your homework like you have been on all of the competitors in each market and look at the markets where we may need to consider divestiture, there are plenty of competitors left in the market.","And so, I think our comfort is in the actual analysis at the end of the day, we will still be 8% of the overall Medicare market on a combined basis. We will be big in some markets where we may be have to divest. There will be plenty of competitors in each market.","And quite frankly, I think the bigger issue at the market level, where this analysis will occur, is the level of market share that the blues hold, which is really the dominant competitor in each market. I'll turn it over to Shawn for comments on Humana's performance today.","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yes. So, on the accretion, I would say, there's really three things that certainly give me comfort, that are all wrapped in the wrapper of, I think, we have a very reasonable and achievable financial case for them.","First, we're not assuming overly rosy growth rates or margin rates for their business, so we have a very reasonable, I think, and achievable projection for sort of the base case. I think our synergy assumption is a very achievable assumption and we certainly have proven that we can deliver and exceed, based on Coventry. But, I think we have a very relevant base case assumption around synergies.","And finally, we do have, I think, we've also made a reasonable provision for any disruption that might occur in a large acquisition. So, I think the accretion really is premised on a case that we want to be able to have a high degree of confidence that we can deliver to you. And we would have every intention to try to not only achieve that but sort of beat that case in terms of what we end up producing.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Sticking with Medicare, I guess, you talk about a mid-single-digit margin. So, I'm just curious, what you think the long-term sustainable margin is for that business?","And then how does scale play into that? Are there benefits? Are there national benefits? Are there things that you can do with PBM capabilities to capture more of that margin? Or is MA really a business we should think about as mid-single-digit in each and every county that you guys bid?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Josh, I believe that mid-single-digit will continue to be, and we view as possible for the Medicare business going forward, we believe that's an appropriate return. And we can price well into that.","I think the real issue is at the local market level, what our presence is and our ability to partner with providers on keeping medical costs under control going forward, and our ability to get the information necessary to drive star ratings and risk adjusters.","If we get paid for the risk that we're assuming, then we can manage the population more effectively. And so, the model really is shifting on underwriting in Medicare from one of creating balanced risk pools to one of getting paid for the risk we're assuming. And so, that really depends at the local market level.","I think what you're seeing in our performance so far this year, is all the work that we've done underlying those provider relationships and those collaborations we've been talking about for a number of years. In addition to all the work we've been doing on the star ratings, we literally double our presence in the markets with the Humana acquisition to make that work, and at that level, market penetration is going to make a difference.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just, Shawn, I don't know if there's an easy way to do this, but is there a way to figure out sort of, what is the core within that $7.40 guidance this year, what's the core, sort of, ongoing EPS growth or EPS total for the year, if we sort of exclude some of the out of period 3Rs and that sort of stuff, is there a way to sort of think about what core EPS is?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Well, I mean, the most direct out of period, is, if you look at what we did this quarter, for example, on the 3Rs, the amount that's going back to 2014 is roughly $80 million. So, that's about a $0.14 bad guide that's going back to that. But, I want to be really clear that we actually \u2013 our guidance presumes that, even including that, we can get back to sort of, in essence, a flat Commercial MBR. And when you look at where we are year-to-date and you adjust for these things, you can see that that's in essence where we are. But, as it pertains to the 3Rs, that's really the magnitude of the adjustment that goes back to 2014.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And there's no sort of other extraordinary favorable development or anything like that that we should think of as not really run rate for this year?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Well, we always talked about the prior-year development. But no, there's nothing extraordinary on a year-over-year basis that I would call out.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning. So, just maybe, first, on cost trend, you're now down into the low-end versus maybe previously the lower half. Maybe discuss what you're seeing related to cost trend and what are the actual moving parts that are driving it towards that low-end versus your initial expectations? Thanks.","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, so Andy, as you'll recall, and I alluded to, we had assumed that we would have an uptick in utilization trend this year, we had included that in our forward pricing. And in the first \u2013 at least in the first half of the year, thus far, we're really not seeing that.","In our forecasting, we had assumed that we would see that more on the outpatient side and while an outpatient trend is still positive we're not seeing any of the acceleration that we would have put into pricing. So, really what we're seeing is a stable continuation, sort of the trend trajectory we've been on. And, again, in the first half of the year, not seeing that uptick that we had put into pricing going forward.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Maybe just somewhat related to that you did implement pricing actions related to your middle market and small group, which seems to be driving the desired outcomes for your margin expansion maybe at the expense of membership. It sounds like that membership pressure will continue in the second half of the year; but clearly, you're doing quite well on margins, so how should we think about that business going forward? Maybe heading into next year, maybe a little anniversarying of this year's losses, but are you at a place where you're comfortable with the margins, especially given the lower cost trend where you think you can maybe price a return to membership growth? Or is the market still competitive in those areas?","Karen S. Rohan - President","Hi, it's Karen. Relative to your question, first I would say that the underlying performance of this business is performing exactly where we thought it would be. And you're right, we have had that volume pressure.","We expect to see in our forecast reflects continued pressure in the second half of the year. We are at the point though that we expect to be \u2013 the market remains competitive, but we expect to continue to price for margin over membership; but we expect to, in 2016, to start performing better on this business and start showing better growth. There's a lot of churn in the 2 to 50 and the 51 to 100, and we have the ability to underwrite that 51 to 100 business through keep what you have activities and we are looking to maintain that and grow that into 2016.","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah. And so, Andy, again, I would say this is about as clear a case as there is, of sort of the evidence of favoring margin over membership, and there would be no fundamental change in that philosophy going forward. These things tend to work through the rate correction cycle and have these sort of volume impacts, but tend to stabilize more once you get through a full annual cycle of the re-pricing.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to understand around the 3Rs, you said you're taking actions to better understand the health of your businesses. Is it basically like a coding initiative? What exactly are you doing to get in here and to better understand that population? And is there any way to kind of frame or quantify what you think the benefits could be?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","So, in general, Kevin, you're on the right track, what we're talking about there are the kinds of things you do to ensure that you're getting fair and complete payment for the risk profile of your membership.","We're investing more energy into that end money in 2015 than we did last year. But again, the fact that this is a sort of zero-sum game amongst participants, I want to be a little bit careful that despite the investment how much we can really bank on, in terms of getting net improvement.","So, I'd hesitate to speculate on an amount right now, and I'd go back to what we have largely assumed in our 2015 forecast is that the same level or the same rate at which we saw payables end up at 2014, we've largely assumed the continuation of that rate in 2015 with no real improvement from any of this incremental investment and no real improvement from the potential for the risk pool that this is all settled up and to get better. Obviously, that's a bit speculative, so I would never bank on that. But, we have largely assumed the run rate we just observed in 2014.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the investment theme. You mentioned a few times, G&A investments for growth. Could you just give a little more color as to what exactly you're spending on and what businesses that refers to?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Kevin, what we're investing in is in our consumer business, which we will launch six new products in four different markets in 2016, for 1\/1\/2016, on the public exchange and off the public exchange for the individual market. We'll also be launching a private exchange version for small group in a number of markets throughout 2016. We continue to invest in our footprint on Medicare, but we're evaluating that as we consider the integration issues around Humana and the opportunities that reside there, and we will continue to invest in our provider relationships as we build out more joint ventures and ACOs, a la the Innovation Health Plan model.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. First just a clarification, on the 3R guidance and your overall earnings guidance for the year, you have not included anything for risk corridors in your guidance. If you were to be paid the $100 million, or roughly $0.20 in earnings, that would be on top of the $7.40 earnings guidance you have?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","That is correct.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then the second question about next year, looking at next year, the Part D bids declined on average 7.9% or 5.7% after normalization. Can you tell us why you think those bids declined so much on average and if you think that that's something that was expected, or should have been expected, based on the performance of Part D this year?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","The one thing I would tell you is, there's a lot of mechanics behind that sort of national average bid process. And I think every year, we've seen people taking action around product design, network design, and whatnot, that have probably brought that national average bid in lower than maybe people would have thought at the beginning. That result came in largely where we had projected it was going to come in for our book of business, but it really is the ongoing actions of people to deliver a more cost-effective product to consumers.","Karen S. Rohan - President","Yeah. And I would just add that our bids were favorably positioned to the national average bid and that we were below the low income benchmark in 33 regions out of the 34 regions, and right in line with our expectations.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. This question is firstly about your Commercial MLR guidance that you've updated to 80.2%, and it's encouraging that it's flat year-over-year, but as you look back to when you were guiding at the beginning of this year, were you embedding or expecting any improvements firstly in the public exchange loss ratio from 2014 to 2015? I think you had expected or have baked in breakeven?","And then secondly, on the Commercial loss ratio, you had some issues on small group last year, you repriced the bulk, seemed very conservative. Is there any potential for MLR improvement and overall, is that 80.2% conservative? Not that it's a bad result, I'm just curious if there's any upside on that?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Well, like I said, there's always upside to any of these estimates. I guess as well, like I said, there's always the ever present risk of trend changing. But on the Commercial MLR, I think what I would say about that is, we have pushed the re-pricing in, and what we've done this year in terms of trying to position ourselves appropriately for the 3Rs is a pretty significant amount of money, and really the fact that we're coming in at initial guidance, again, speaks to the fact that the underlying business, both as a result of the pricing actions that we took last year and sort of what we're observing on trend is running at or better than expected in most instances.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","And then on the public exchanges, if it was breakeven last year, once you take all this 3R accounting and everything, what is being embedded right now into your full-year expectation for margin, and then -","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","When you look at 2015, even without the risk corridor, this business would be slightly profitable, even with this sort of higher risk adjustment payable outlook.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. So, with the $100 million and your $277 million, which seems like really conservative on payables, there's potential for low single-digit margin?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah. And again, honestly, I thought we were conservative on 2014, and so that, going back to Kevin's question, has sort of positioned our viewpoint and continuing to be cautious in this area and what we've accrued for 2015.","And on a program that's really, still, in some ways, in its infancy, I don't want to get too far ahead of myself in sort of predicting that there's conservatism in that risk adjustment accrual. Clearly, the risk corridor would be meaningful upside, if we were able to recognize a good part of that or all of it.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks, Shawn. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi there. You guys, I think, have already submitted a lot of your individual bids for 2016. Can you go back or do you need to go back, now that you have this revised outlook on the 3Rs and renegotiate kind of what the states or the Feds, with respect to your public exchange pricing?","Karen S. Rohan - President","Yeah. Christine, we have gone back to the states, where we could, and we have re-priced the \u2013 in a number of states, reflecting our risk adjuster. So, that has been done and we have now new prices in those states.","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah. And Christine, the thing I would add, is interestingly enough, the variance that we had for 2014 was actually more in small group than it was individual. So, as Karen mentioned, there's always moving parts in individual, but we're not as deep into that pricing process and in fact, it is concentrated in a few places. So, I'm comfortable that we can reflect this in our pricing and this will be fine for 2016.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. So, is it reasonable to assume that both individual and small group profitability can improve next year?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Yes. It would be reasonable to assume that.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then final question for me is, how do I think about the Kentucky drag with respect to margins there, as you absorb those rate cuts?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","What I would say is that what we forecast, sort of post-this rate cut, is still a profitable contract in Kentucky. I would say the margin profile going forward, though, looks a lot more like a typical Medicaid margin as compared to where we've been.","The drag in this year is probably plus or minus the $0.10 that we talked about, and that's obviously for half a year, but the contract is still a very good contract. It's just not going to be at the margin level that it's been at.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I'll just stay on the Kentucky topic for a minute. The $0.10 per quarter impact is a little bit larger than I expected, given the scale of this contract for your overall book of business. So, what range was the MLR running in, prior to the rate changes?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Well, we've talked about that, this has been, certainly, well below the mid-80%s in the past. But, let me be clear, and I apologize if I misspoke, the $0.10 is for the second half of 2015, so it actually represents two quarters.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And now that national account season is wrapping up, can you give us an update on how that's going for Aetna?","Karen S. Rohan - President","Yeah, let me just update you from the last time we talked. As I mentioned, the activity level was slightly better than last year. We are having one of our better sales years, with above average close rates. However, we had a large number of accounts that, as we talked about, have moved to slice business. But the real relevant metric here is on revenue. And we are seeing our private exchange growth revenue exceed the losses that we have on our ACO losses. So, we expect that \u2013 with that revenue growth to exceed the ACS losses.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","And how big is your private exchange book right now?","Karen S. Rohan - President","Right now...","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","We have about 190,000 private exchange members right now. And we can get the revenue number for you offline. A good chunk of that is insured and some of that is self-insured.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Good morning. Thank you. Sorry, let me just, on the last question, if I could, so what you're saying is that you're losing ASO enrollment on some of your slice contracts, but you expect that to be offset by growth in private exchange, so that you think you'll be flat in January, is that right?","Karen S. Rohan - President","On a revenue basis.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Karen S. Rohan - President","So, on a revenue basis, you have to look at fair and that net would be up on those two metrics.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Okay. Got it. On a separate topic, can you just comment on where you are relative to the minimum MLRs? I mean, we've talked about upside potential, when does that and where does that become a limiting factor either in Commercial, individual, small group, large group or Medicare Advantage? I'm not really asking for specific numbers there, just a directional sense?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think what we've learned over the last four years, Matt, is that when we price this properly into the business going forward, think of it as an option on risk that we can come very close and so our number is not meaningful at all. It's very insignificant on a MLR rebate.","I think the only place we had some concern was on the health insurance exchange business, but that all got factored into risk adjusters and all the 3Rs, that was a little bit of a concern as we were working through that. But again, the overall number across all the business, very insignificant.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But am I right, you're managing it so you're very close to those floors, is the way that you're pricing it?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Well, I think, Matt, the fact that the accruals are not all that significant right now would speak to the fact that there is breathing space...","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","...in a lot of places between sort of that accrual and where we are today. To your point, it's clearly a factor in the business going forward, but to Mark's point, we've been able to position ourselves really every year except the first year of this program for this to have a fairly modest impact around the business. So, it's certainly something that is relevant in the business, it's certainly something we think about, but we're really not right up against it right now.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","At a higher level, Matt, this has really created stability and pricing across a lot of markets, and we've seen that play out where there isn't as much buying share anymore because you can't price up in the next year to get it back.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Gary Paul Taylor - JPMorgan","Hi. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, I just wanted to ask one other question on the 3Rs. Per the slide, you're accruing the 2015 reinsurance recoverables at 65%, and I believe the initial CMS guidance is still 50%, unless I'm mistaken. And I know obviously 2014 ended up trending much better than the initial expectation. So, just my question was, on that 65%, do you have some guidance from CMS around that, is that an estimate based on what, could you help us understand that?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","So, we have gotten some direction is what I would say. One of the pieces of good news that was included in the June 30 release of the 2Rs was that in essence that the 2014 reinsurance program, there was a surplus of about $1.8 billion in that program. And they were quite explicit that any amounts that were not going to be used to make payments in 2014 would be used to make payments in the reinsurance year of 2015. And so, by looking at the magnitude of that and looking at the size of the, what we think the pool is, to your point, much akin to what we did in 2014 and looking at this issue, we concluded that this was sort of our best estimate of what would get paid out via that program.","Gary Paul Taylor - JPMorgan","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Thomas F. Cowhey - Vice President-Investor Relations","Worth noting, this is Tom, that most of that accrual happens in the back half rather than in the second quarter because of the way that the reinsurance timing works when you get the claims in.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Thanks. Good morning. Just with all the PPRD and the risks, 3R adjustments, is there a view on what the core earnings power for 2015 should be to move to model 2016 and beyond?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Well, like I said, I don't think we're sort of what we're talking about in the, at least $7.40 is all that far off sort of where we would think about a jump off point. Obviously, you know our conventions around forecasting prior-year development, so you'd have to sort of think that particular item through. We've talked a little bit about the 3Rs; but I wouldn't sort of direct you in a meaningful way either direction of that $7.40.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. And then, this might be helpful for all of us with regard to Humana. Could you at least kind of give us what you're thinking about for a starting point for their earnings in 2015?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Well, like we said...","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","When you're modeling your accretion...","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","the guidance that we provided for this year was certainly consistent with the diligence that we did going through that, so I think where they are, is as good a starting point as any.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","So, you're not taking any haircuts from that as the starting point?","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","Not at this point.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.","Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Thanks. Just on the 3Rs again and really just on reinsurance. I guess, is there one area, in particular, within sort of medical costs that's driving that at this point, is it pharmacy or something else? And then, a big picture question related to that, I guess we're sort of one year away, we've got 2016 left with all 3Rs, but when I look at a reinsurance recoverable this year north of $500 million, I guess, do we, at this point, is there a functioning ACA marketplace without the 3Rs, or rather two of them, in your opinion? Thanks.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As it relates to the reinsurance drivers, it is just high cost cases and some of that indeed is pharmacy, but they're just really people that go over that threshold, there are a whole host of different cases, it's normal to the course of business that we run on a day-in, day-out basis. We always have high cost cases.","We generally price those into the premium across the total population. So, what happens when the reinsurance recoveries come out of a separate category, a separate way of accruing, they have to go into pricing. And so, we'll see how that plays out as we get ready for the next pricing period, but that will be the overall impact, is that you'll see every \u2013 so risk corridors and reinsurance recoveries will have to get priced into rates.","Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer","And I think, Brian (sic) [Chris], you certainly saw that one of the sort of reconciling items, if you will, in terms of rate increases from 2014 to 2015 was the change in the reinsurance program. That is, again, to Mark's point, contemplated again in 2015 to 2016 pricing. And, for the most part, that is what the market is doing. So, I think ultimately the answer to your question is, yes, based on the fact that this is largely got into sort of the sustainable pricing in the markets, I think it's reasonable to assume that the marketplace will function post-reinsurance.","Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Thomas F. Cowhey - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Chris. A transcript of the prepared portion of this call will be posted shortly on the Investor Information section of aetna.com, where you can also find a copy of our updated guidance summary, containing details of our guidance metrics, including those that were unchanged or not discussed on this call.","If you have any questions about matters discussed this morning, please feel free to call me or Joe Krocheski in the Investor Relations office.

[Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cowhey, please go ahead.","Thomas F. Cowhey","Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call and Webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna. And with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark Bertolini, and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Following their prepared remarks, we will respond to your questions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC, including our 2011 Form 10-K and our 2012 Form 10-Qs. We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company's performance that are non-GAAP measures in our third quarter 2012 financial supplement and our 2012 guidance summary. These reconciliations are available on the Investor Information section of aetna.com. Also, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited. So we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini","Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today.","This morning, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1.55, another strong performance. Aetna's third quarter result reinforces the value of our diversified business model, demonstrates our margin discipline and exemplifies the rigor with which we manage our operations. Underlying our third quarter results, Aetna grew Health Care premiums by 7% over the prior year quarter, with growth across multiple lines of business. We reported pretax operating margins of 10.2%, driven by excellent Commercial underwriting margins, and with the help of our midyear wins, we grew by almost 150,000 members in the quarter, achieving our full year guidance of 18.2 million medical members. We are pleased with our membership traction and continue to focus on striking a disciplined balance between margin and growth.","As we look to the fourth quarter of 2012, we continue to expect top line growth and strong operating performance. Based on our year-to-date results, we are raising our full year 2012 operating EPS guidance to approximately $5.10 per share from our previously stated range of $5 to $5.10. While we continue to project modest growth across certain businesses throughout the remainder of the year, we are maintaining our year-end guidance of 18.2 million medical members.","As we look to 2013, we remain focused on continuing to execute our strategy across multiple dimensions, including accelerating our efforts to transform the network model and engage consumers, preparing our enterprise for health care reform, including investing for exchanges in 2014 and appropriately pricing for the various health reform-related taxes and closing and successfully integrating our proposed acquisition of Coventry Health Care.","In a few moments, Joe will review our detailed results and outlook. But first, I am going to reemphasize the rationale behind our proposed acquisition of Coventry, provide some insight into our strategic initiatives and comment briefly on the political environment and its implications for our industry.","In August, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Coventry Health Care. The acquisition will strengthen our core business, enhance our capabilities, promote greater operational efficiencies and create better value for our customers, provider partners and shareholders. This strategic acquisition is expected to add nearly 4 million medical members and 1.5 million prescription drug plan members at a growing Individual Medicare Advantage business, substantially increase our Medicaid footprint, improve our positioning in consumer baselines of business as we prepare for 2014 and beyond, and add a low-cost product set built on value-based provider networks. In addition to these many strategic benefits, the transaction is projected to be financially attractive for Aetna shareholders and generate excellent returns on capital. We have commenced the regulatory approval process for the transaction and have already launched our integration planning teams. We have filed all material applications required for regulatory approval of the transaction and are on target for a mid-2013 closing. Joe is the executive responsible for the integration and will speak more about that process in his remarks.","In regard to transforming the network model, we have been investing in the capabilities required to collaborate with providers. By sharing common platforms and goals, we believe that we can help providers shift from episodic acute care management to patient population management, which in turn converts volume-based reimbursement into value-based reimbursement. Provider groups, in collaboration with Aetna, can then drive unnecessary utilization out of the system, improving quality of care and lowering costs. We believe Aetna has a unique platform in the marketplace to enable providers to share and manage the risks associated with patient population management. Our solution combines Aetna's leading-technology stack, including Medicity, Active Health and iTriage, with Aetna's intellectual property, including our care management, underwriting and product expertise.","Our significant investments in technology as well as risk management systems and processes allow Aetna's collaborative agreements to transcend simple pay-per-performance measures and align incentives toward superior outcomes. These powerful tools and services are truly enabling a revolution among health care delivery systems. For Aetna, this transformation results in high-margin, unregulated fee revenues but, more importantly, results in an improved network medical cost position, which we then package into more competitively priced products. In our signed ACO contracts, we have achieved improved unit cost that at times have been 10% below our nearest competitor. It is on this basis that we have launched Individual and Small Group products with partners such as Banner or small and midsize employer products with Aurora.","Our technologies and relationships have also enabled growth in Medicare with partners such as Emory and Banner and then Medicaid with Carilion. These products drive member volume into our health plans but also drive patient volume to our provider partners. To date, Aetna has 11 signed Accountable Care Solutions partnerships, with 26 letters of intent and over 200 prospects in the pipeline. Further, our ACS capabilities have been instrumental in several significant wins, such as Teachers Retirement System of Texas and the state of Maine. We believe that our efforts can transform the network model and expect continued success in attracting and signing up new provider partners. We plan to provide additional detail on our membership projections associated with these relationships at our December Investor Conference.","Another key part of Aetna's growth strategy is to profitably increase our participation in government programs. In particular, Medicare has been an important strategic growth area for Aetna, where we continue to demonstrate progress across all our product lines.","In Group Medicare Advantage, we continue to see traction in both securing new accounts but also converting the 1.2 million Medicare-eligible lives within our Commercial book to these products. The Teacher Retirement System of Texas award is but one example of this momentum, which alone is projected to generate over $800 million of incremental premiums in 2013.","In Individual Medicare Advantage, we have made great strides in realigning our products to capture our fair share of this growth opportunity. For 2013, Aetna will provide beneficiaries with consistent premiums and enriched benefits and services. To achieve these goals and maintain our target of financial returns, we have spent substantial time and effort adjusting our benefits and copayments, augmenting our medical management programs, improving our contracting and increasing the number of members who participate in one of our provider collaborations. Our goal is to have roughly half of our Individual Medicare Advantage membership in one of our Medicare provider collaborations or Accountable Care Solutions relationships by the end of 2013.","In Medicare Supplement, our Genworth acquisition continues to generate substantial growth. Since closing this acquisition in October of 2011, Medicare Supplement membership has increased by almost 40,000 members or over 20%.","In PDP, we are optimistic about our prospects for continued growth and are pleased to report that CMS recently reinstated our ability to receive auto-assigned membership. We expect to begin receiving auto-assigns as early as November of this year and project continued growth in the first quarter of 2013.","As we look across our balanced spectrum of products, Aetna's Medicare franchise has good momentum. We expect 2013 to be a much stronger year and are optimistic about our prospects for continued top line growth.","Finally, as we look to the elections in the coming weeks, we remain focused on our core business and on implementing the health care reform legislation enacted in 2010. We are preparing for competition on the exchanges in 2014, the impact of fees and taxes and the expansion of Medicaid eligibility. While the elections or deficit reduction actions may impact the Affordable Care Act between now and 2014, we believe that we can provide a market-based response to any change. We continue to believe that the private sector is the engine for innovation for our health care system as we focus on improving quality, increasing access and lowering costs.","In summary, I am pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance and expect continued strong performance in the final quarter of 2012. We are seeing good momentum in the following businesses: National Accounts, where we continue to improve our value proposition through targeted contracting efforts; Medicare, as we look to grow membership in the group and individual marketplaces; Medicaid, where we see growth in our existing markets and are gaining access to new markets; and Accountable Care Solutions, where we are driving innovative change and have a robust pipeline of opportunities. Further, I am confident in:  our strategic direction and our ability to continue to execute on our business fundamentals, our ability to close and successfully integrate the proposed Coventry transaction, our ability to manage through the legislative and regulatory changes associated with health care reform, our 2012 medical cost trend outlook and our 2012 operating EPS projection of approximately $5.10.","I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsky to provide insight into our third quarter results and our outlook. Joe?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported operating earnings per share of $1.55 for the third quarter, highlighted by revenue growth of 6% balanced by volume growth and attractive yields; our Commercial medical benefit ratio, which was 79.6% in the quarter, as medical costs continue to develop consistent with our expectations; and pretax operating margins of 10.2% in the quarter, keeping us on track to achieve our targeted high-single-digit operating margin this year. We continue to price with discipline, actively manage medical cost for superior quality and cost outcomes and strive for administrative efficiencies to deliver profitable growth for our shareholders.","At the end of the third quarter, we had 18.2 million medical members, an increase of 149,000 members sequentially. Commercial ASC membership increased by 102,000 in the quarter, due primarily to continued strong growth in our network access products and the previously disclosed state of Maine account. Commercial Insured membership declined by 42,000 in the quarter, driven largely by a decline in Student Health membership, a low revenue per member product, partially offset by gains in International. Medicare membership increased by 24,000 in the quarter, with strong gains in our Medicare Supplement product. And Medicaid membership increased by 65,000 in the quarter as a result of the increased insured membership from our Missouri expansion.","Third quarter 2012 revenue generation was strong, increasing by 6% year-over-year to $8.9 billion, largely due to a 7% increase in Health Care premiums. The increase in Health Care premium included a net increase in Commercial premium of approximately 4% due to a 5% increase in premium yields, partially offset by a 1% decline in volume. The increase in premium yields was driven by a 4.5% increase from rates and 0.5% increase in mix. Health Care premium also reflected a 14.4% increase in Medicare premium as a result of the inclusion of Genworth's Medicare Supplement business and Medicare Advantage membership growth. We also posted a 23.4% increase in Medicaid premium due to our in-state expansion.","Fees and other revenue also increased by 1% year-over-year as lower volumes in our Commercial ASC business were offset by the inclusion of PayFlex and modest increases in yields. Note that the impact of the Prodigy acquisition is now included in the prior year quarter, lowering the reported growth rates in this line item.","Our third quarter total medical benefit ratio was 80.7%, including the impact of approximately $96 million before tax of favorable prior-period reserve development. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves as we experienced favorable reserve development in each of our businesses, primarily related to the second quarter, with the majority emerging from our Commercial business. Additionally, our days claims payable were 46.3 days at the end of the quarter, up 1.9 days sequentially, partially due to the timing of claim processing cycles.","We continue to invest in opportunities for profitable growth and to improve productivity. Our third quarter 2012 business segment operating expense ratio was 18.3% due to continued execution on our expense initiatives. Our operating expense ratio for our insured Health Care business was 11.3% in the quarter, a decrease of 100 basis points year-over-year due to our continued operating expense management.","Third quarter net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $136 million as declining yields continued to create downward pressure on earnings. At September 30, the continuing business portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of approximately $1.4 billion before tax and is well positioned from a risk perspective.","Our capital generation was strong in the quarter. We started the quarter with $400 million in liquidity at the parent. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent and commercial paper issuances resulted in $450 million of additional cash flow. Due to the pending Coventry transaction, we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. After other net uses, including our shareholder dividend, working capital changes and retirement of certain long-term debt, we ended the quarter with $450 million in liquidity at the parent. Our basic share count was 334.5 million at September 30. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. We are on track to execute our financing plans for the Coventry transaction and expect to issue long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Turning now to the proposed Coventry acquisition. We remain confident that the transaction will deliver substantial benefits to our shareholders. Shorter term, we continue to project that the transaction will be modestly accretive to our pre-transaction 2013 \"operating earnings per share\" baseline, excluding transaction and integration costs. Longer term, we project $0.45 of operating earnings per share accretion in 2014 and $0.90 in 2015, again excluding transaction and integration costs.","Our synergy value is projected to build over time and reach $400 million pretax in 2015, derived from the following sources: 1\/3 is the elimination of duplicate corporate overhead; approximately another 1\/3 comes from fixed cost operating expense leverage due to the increased medical membership; 20% is driven by streamlining our combined $1.5 billion of information technology spending; and finally, the remaining synergies are a result of provider network, medical management and pharmacy benefit management synergies.","The combined cash flows of the pro forma entity are also strong. With $2.3 billion of pro forma combined parent cash flows in 2012 plus synergy values, we project that we could repurchase approximately $1 billion of shares in each of the next 3 years while still meeting our deleveraging commitments.","As we prepare for the projected closing of the Coventry transaction, we have already assembled an integration team, for which I am the executive sponsor. We are pleased to announce that Karen Rohan, who recently joined Aetna as an Executive Vice President and a member of our Executive Committee, will lead the Coventry integration. Karen is an accomplished executive with deep health plan experience. We are committed to ensuring a smooth transition and achieving the financial projections and the attractive returns we previously articulated.","Moving to our 2012 outlook. We are increasing our operating earnings per share guidance to approximately $5.10 from our previous guidance range of $5 to $5.10. The net increase is a result of improved operating performance and higher underwriting margins. This improved operating performance is partially offset by expected seasonal medical expenses in the fourth quarter that are higher than previously projected, slightly higher projected investment spending in the fourth quarter on health care reform and ACO initiatives and a \"higher than previously projected\" share count due to the impact of the Coventry acquisition. Our implied operating earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 is approximately $0.92. This projection is consistent with Aetna's recent quarterly earnings progression.","Our projected Commercial medical benefit ratio and Medicare medical benefit ratio guidance remains unchanged. However, we now expect that Aetna's full year Commercial medical benefit ratio will fall in the lower half of our 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis point range. Aetna's 2012 Commercial MBR projections reflect underlying medical cost trend at 6.5% plus or minus 50 basis points, consistent with our prior guidance. The components of projected trend remain unchanged.","We now project that our full year 2012 business segment operating expense ratio will be approximately 19%. The implied fourth quarter operating expense ratio is approximately 20% and is driven by the normal seasonal pattern of our expenses, which tend to be higher toward the end of the year; the timing of certain programs and expenses shifting to the fourth quarter; and a higher projected level of investment.","For 2012, we now project net dividends from subsidiaries of approximately $1.9 billion and deployable capital of approximately $1,550,000,000 as a result of disciplined capital management. Our share count guidance range continues to be approximately 344 million to 347 million weighted average shares. Note that through the date of the Coventry stockholder vote, we will not be repurchasing our shares. Following that vote currently scheduled for November 21, we will be able to repurchase our shares, subject to customary considerations and restrictions.","As we head into the end of the year, I would like to provide some color on the factors that impact our outlook for 2013. We continue to prepare for the upcoming changes from health care reform and expect to maintain increased spending on new capabilities particularly related to exchanges. Additionally, we will continue to advance our readiness plans to recover the health insurance fee and the reinsurance contribution in 2014.","In 2013, we should see some favorable earnings lift as a result of Government revenues. Aetna expects to grow revenues in both Medicare and Medicaid in 2013, including at least $800 million in projected incremental premiums from the TRS Medicare conversion.","Share repurchases. While more limited than it would have been absent the Coventry announcement, the full year impact of share repurchases in 2012 and 2013 will enhance operating earnings per share.","2011 acquisitions. In 2013, we project additional accretion from our 2011 acquisitions as synergies are realized and integration costs subside and positive fixed cost leverage as we continue to grow the revenue line.","As we look to 2013, there will also be some challenges to earnings growth, including experience-rated margin pressure. Aetna's 2012 operating margins are currently near the high end of our target range. The experience-rated nature of our large account businesses, including Group Medicare, will pressure our earnings growth in 2013 as favorable 2012 results are credited back to customers.","Commercial Insured growth. Commercial Insured membership growth opportunities may be limited by the lack of employment growth. We will not attempt to aggressively increase market share and put at risk the maintenance of our margin profile. When faced with the choice, Aetna will always choose margins over membership.","Net investment income. Net investment income will again decline due to the low-yield environment. We project that retained net investment income could decline by over $65 million pretax in 2013.","Commercial ASC growth. As the 2013 selling season draws to a close, our latest projections suggest that National Accounts membership will decline slightly in the first quarter of next year. When combined with the conversion of TRS members into a Medicare Advantage product, we project that total Commercial ASC membership will be lower in the first quarter of 2013. This projected result remains a substantial improvement over our 2011 and 2012 selling seasons. We remain confident about our prospects in this business due to our increasing sales momentum, the positive fee yields and enhanced cross-sells we achieved for 2013 and the large Medicare Advantage conversion opportunity.","The fundamentals of Aetna's business remain strong, and we are confident in our operating earnings per share projection of approximately $5.10. We believe we have the winning strategy in the marketplace. Our core business is performing, and we are well positioned for growth. Our emerging businesses continue to work to transform the network model, improve our cost structure and drive additional membership. The acquisition of Coventry will only serve to strengthen our current positions in Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. And the projected accretion will add to earnings growth in the years to come. Finally, our capital generation remains strong and will be further strengthened by the Coventry transaction.","We look forward to discussing our long-term strategies in greater detail at our Investor Conference in December.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Question-and-Answer Session","Thomas F. Cowhey","Thank you, Joe. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions.

Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one quick clarification point on the cash flow this quarter, I guess just relative to net income, a little bit weaker. And I know year-to-date, it's actually below net income. So I'm just curious if there's been some timing issues and what the expectation around cash flow from ops in 4Q.","Mark T. Bertolini","Josh, the cash flows for this quarter were lower than net income due to the timing of CMS payments. Year-to-date, they are in excess of net income. And for the full year, we still project they'll be at approximately 120% of net income, all due to the timing of CMS payments, which had a very strange pattern this year.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I just want to see if I'm sort of reading into things too much, but you talked about headwinds and tailwinds for 2013, and it's difficult, I guess, without the quantification of those to understand which one is bigger. But you've said multiple times, and Mark's said it as well, around position for growth beyond 2012. Is it fair to say that when you said much improved that you would expect earnings, core operating earnings, to be up on a year-over-year basis before sort of changes in share count and below-the-line stuff?","Mark T. Bertolini","I missed the last part of that, Josh.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess it's not looking at the EPS line, per se, but just at operating earnings, maybe an EBIT number or a pretax number, would you expect earnings in '13 to be higher or lower or about the same?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Josh, at this point in time, we're saying that our earnings per share will -- is projected to definitely increase for next year over 2012, but we're not commenting on operating earnings at this point in time. We will give you a full briefing on that at our Investor Day in December.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, then, I'm sorry, maybe I could ask a different question, then. Just the Commercial risk lives in 2Q were up and then down in 3Q.  Is it just sort of some pluses and minuses? Or was there anything to read in terms of change in the environment?","Mark T. Bertolini","Josh, it was actually a large student health group, with fairly low premium that came out. Otherwise, we had some growth in the quarter, but it was puts and takes. But it was largely driven by student health.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Following up on your headwinds, tailwinds, you talked about risk membership potentially showing pressure, margin over membership. Can you tell us, given that you're talking about pricing in the excise tax load on a staged basis from February, what the blended underwriting spread is likely to be over the course of the full year, given 50% is renewed in January? And then have you an idea of what the load will be starting with the 2014?  Given it's $8 billion for the industry, what is your share of that?","Mark T. Bertolini","So Ana, I think you're correct in stating that we are always going to price with margin over membership, particularly in a down economy. Our ability to maintain the high-single-digit margins that people have always asked whether or not we'd be able to maintain in this economy are important, particularly as we turn the economy, hopefully, with the fix-the-debt campaign here soon rolling into that new economy. I think our pricing model will include capturing some -- will include capturing our health insurance fees and taxes. And we already have 70% of our book priced and into the marketplace already. I'll let Joe talk about some of the details associated with that. Joe?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Ana consistent with what some of our competitors have already spoken about publicly, we are pricing in 2013 the reinsurance contribution in the health insurance fee. Our -- as we stated many times, our strategy is to collect a portion of those taxes in every member month that earned in 2014, which means you have to start that process in accounts that renew in February of '13. On balance, it's different by books of business, but similar to what other industry players are speaking about, the reinsurance contribution is approximately $6 per member per month. And the health insurance fee on a full annualized basis is approximately 2.5% of premium.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And other publics are talking about pricing or loading this in. What is the posture that you're seeing from your not-for-profit blue [ph] competitors in this regard?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","The rate filings that we've pulled from various states suggest that most industry participants, including the non-for-profits, are attempting to price for the fees in 2013 in advance of '14.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And finally, just related to that, again, the 6.5% plus or minus 50 that you had as your medical cost trend outlook, you did not lower it for full year. One of your competitors, United, did. As you're looking forward into 2013, are you baking in an uptick in your expectation and pricing accordingly?","Mark T. Bertolini","A couple of things, Ana. We're sticking with 6.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. Two, because we saw lower buydowns this year, we are seeing people buy through their deductibles and co-pays. So we'll see more consumer-directed health plan and high-deductible plan utilization beyond deductibles in the fourth quarter. So we've anticipated that in our fourth quarter. And as we look into 2014, we're not giving any guidance yet, but we see utilization going up in 2013 by 50 basis points. But that's not total trend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citi.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just another point of clarification on the last question, I want to make clear, so you are assuming that cost trends will be up?  So basically what you're saying is there will be a cushion in your pricing for 2013 relative to the cost trend you're seeing today?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Well, we wouldn't call it a cushion. We are actually expecting utilization trend to increase by 50 basis points in '13 over '12 as compared to '12 over '11. If it doesn't happen, it obviously would be a spread that would emerge in our P&L. But right now, that is our full expectation that utilization, even though it's higher this year than it was last, is still at all-time-low levels.","Mark T. Bertolini","But what we haven't included, Carl, in that are the buydowns and all the nets that come out of coming to a net trend number year-over-year. And we won't do that until we get to our Investor Conference in 2012. We're finalizing our plan as we speak.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. In terms of the utilization, anything specific that you're pointing to in 2013? Or is this sort of the historical view of, \"It's low. We don't think it's going to stay that way. So we're just assuming it's going to be higher\"?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","It's the latter.  It's the reversion to the mean, back to pre-distressed economy levels.","Operator","We'll go next to Justin Lake, JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question just again on the cost trend side. So you had strong development in the second quarter, indicating that your trends were below with your expectation there. And then the third quarter, you saw your days claims payable, or at least we saw your days claims payable, up a couple of days, which indicates you didn't project that cost trend improvement in the second quarter continuing. I'm just wondering what did you see in the second quarter there and the concerted view into the third quarter. Can you give us a little bit of color around how the second quarter compared to what your expectations were and what you saw would be better there?","Mark T. Bertolini","Most of the prior period development that we reported was second quarter 2012 prior-period development, Justin.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","And with respect to reserve positions, obviously, the days claims payable is an important metric. It's up mostly due to the timing of claim processing cycles. We would point to you the 2 statistics that we look at, and that is the comparison of how the increase in reserves compares to premium. Reserves were up this quarter sequentially by 2%, while premiums were up 1%. And quarter-over-quarter to prior year, reserves were up 17% compared to a 7% increase in premium. So we're very confident in the strength of our reserve position.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. What did you see in the second quarter that was -- that resulted in all that prior-period development? Was it lower utilization? And why don't you think it's going to continue?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Generally speaking, because our cost trends are locked in, we have very good visibility into unit cost. Any variation from our expectation is utilization. And so obviously, utilization was a little lower than we expected.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Then why don't you expect that to continue? Is there anything you see in the third quarter that leads you to believe that you needed those -- that conservatism on reserves and to leave your cost trend where it is?","Mark T. Bertolini","In the -- as I mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we expect to see more people spending through their deductibles and their funds and coming into backwards [ph] on our nickel, more or less. And so we're seeing that trend more than we saw last year, where utilization was unusually low. And also, there were not as many benefit buydowns this year. So the spend-through is not as significant -- it's not as significant to spend through and get into -- get back into our paying 80% or more of the -- or the bill.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to go into the SG&A commentary around Q4. I think this year, you'd indicated that SG&A was going to start off a little bit higher and then remain stable during the year as the normal seasonality in cost was going to be offset by the cost save that you had put in place. Now it sounds like Q4 is going to be higher or maybe more normal, seasonally-wise. I guess, can you talk a little bit about why that is? And then you mentioned some shifting of cost. I'm not sure what that was referring to. And then I know that you mentioned as far as 2013 goes that you're going to be investing for exchanges, but I wasn't sure whether that was going to net be a headwind to earnings in 2013 or whether that's just kind of going to be a neutral or a positive? Can you talk about that?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Certainly. There were 2 factors that affected the progression of our SG&A ratios this year. One is an absolute increase as we do plan to ramp up investment spending in advance of '13 and '14, particularly related to our Accountable Care Solutions business and certain health care reform activities. From a seasonality perspective, there was also a \"third to fourth quarter\" swing as certain expenditures that were anticipated to be made in the third quarter related to things like our implementation of our CVS Caremark relationship are going to shift to the fourth quarter. So there's a little bit of shift and an absolute increase that are putting pressure on that ratio, but all with the outlook of creating future growth.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So that makes sense. So that explains part of the reason why this quarter was very good and -- but you're not raising the guidance by as much as the beat this quarter. There is some shift on the G&A side into Q4, but -- okay. But then I guess as far as the Accountable Care Solutions investment, should that -- I mean, how do we think about those? You talked about in the context of growth. I kind of think about an investment SG&A and ACS would be leading to better medical costs next year. Is that not the way to think about it? Or is the way to think about membership, I guess?","Mark T. Bertolini","I mean, it's both. So we are seeing growth in the ACS networks themselves from the standpoint of membership, both for us and for the provider, because it's not necessarily all Aetna membership. And we're also seeing impact on medical costs, some of which we're using in the market for pricing.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just last question on the -- to wrap up this topic. The net, if you're spending a little bit more now and in front of 2013, 2014, do you think that the investments next year are going to be a headwind or that you now ramped it up so that it's not going to create a year-over-year drag into earnings next year?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","There most likely will be higher spending on our ACS initiative next year compared to this year as we're ramping up significantly.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And the exchanges, I assume, as well?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","That is correct.","Operator","We'll hear next from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just help me to quantify a little bit more about the cost shift from Q3 into Q4 on SG&A. Also just what incremental spending, if you can quantify the incremental spend in SG&A in Q4 that you didn't plan on before? And then lastly, in terms of the seasonal medical shift, it's still a little vague on why you would lower your view of utilization in the second quarter so you have the prior-period development that you booked this quarter and then not see that carrying into the fourth quarter. What exactly did you see in terms of utilization that drives you to expect that to go higher in the fourth quarter?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Peter, let me answer the last question first. The fourth quarter is the most difficult quarter to forecast your medical cost. For each of the last 2 years, we had increasing deductibles and increasing level of penetration to our consumer-driven health plans. As Mark stated before, you got the deductible leverage effect and the benefit buydown effect. And so that's our best estimate at this time, but the fourth quarter is very, very difficult to forecast.","Mark T. Bertolini","Peter, just one more point on that. It's not utilization. It's just higher cost on our nickel, because people are now spent through their deductibles and out-of-pockets, and we're now paying. So it's not an increase in underlying utilization. It's an increase of what we are responsible for versus the member.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, though you'd think that if utilization was lower already, there would fewer people spending through at this point, not more spending through. I'm a little confused by that. Are we more conservative on the fourth quarter?","Mark T. Bertolini","We have lower -- we had lower buydowns this year, and so deductibles didn't raise. So we had some trend leverage in those. And so we believe it's prudent to project that it's going into the fourth quarter of the year.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you quantify the SG&A component a little bit more for us so we can understand how much of the fourth quarter issue is in the G&A side versus in the medical side?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Well, I think it's safe to say. I'll quantify the bridge from -- the annual guidance bridge. I think that's the easiest way to think about -- I actually just think that there was a phasing issue with consensus. We beat our internal forecast in the third quarter, but by not by as much as we beat consensus. So I think there is just an artifact in the way the street had the third and fourth quarter phased. But with respect to the full annual guidance, if you take the midpoint of the $5.05 range, $0.18 operating performance, including the prior-period development, offset by $0.08 of the higher seasonal medical expense and increased operating expenses, offset by another $0.05 of the lack of share repurchases due to the Coventry transaction, all of which gets you from the midpoint of $5.05 to $5.10. That's the way we think about the way we projected the full year. And as I said with respect to the third and fourth quarter, I think it was just a question of consensus versus our own internal forecasting.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just going back to the trend for next year, you talked about utilization being -- utilization trend being higher by 50 basis points from this year's trend. This year, you talked about unit price being no more than it was the prior year, sort of 4.5% to 5%, where last year, I think it was at 5%. Can you talk about your view on unit price this year? Did you get to the 4.5%? Or were you more still at the 5%?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","We haven't parsed that range for you, but we're still saying that it's 4.5% to 5%. And because we're only projecting utilization increase next year, the implication is that we're holding firm with the 4.5% to 5% into '13 trend as well. So we're still operating within that range.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And are you more at the low end of that or more at the higher end?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","I mean, we haven't given that specific guidance.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups. One, I'm trying to understand your Medicare guidance.  It sounds like you're saying you have consistent premiums and enriched benefits for Medicare Advantage in 2013, but then you expect half of your arrangements to be in the collaborative ACOs by the end of 2013. As we think about the Medicare Advantage kind of loss ratio, is that a wash in that we've got pretty consistent loss ratio there, recognizing that the Texas Teachers is probably going to be a higher loss ratio. What's your message there on the Medicare Advantage?","Mark T. Bertolini","We're making no message about 2013 on the margins on Medicare Advantage, Christine. I think we've got more work to do. We'll lay that out in our 2012 Investor Conference. Our commentary is directly related to we believe that the Medicare margins are sustainable in this business and that we are preparing and pulling all levers to make sure that we continue to sustain those margins.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the ACO enrollment, my sense was that you were expecting to grown National Account membership, and there is the optics of the Texas Teachers transitioning from ASC or ASO to risk. Is that all that's happening there? Or are you changing your National Account enrollment expectations?","Mark T. Bertolini","Our enrollment expectations are slightly down. We are not done with open enrollment yet. So we have to go through that, so a final accounting of that, we'll have a better idea of that as we get near the end of the year.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, given start-up costs for the Ohio dual [ph] and preparation performance [ph] in 2014 exchanges and investment spending, you said that you expect your ASP investment spending to increase '13 versus '12. It's probably reasonable to think also that you're reform and dual spending would increase. Are you willing to put any parameters around that?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Not at this early stage. Again, we'll update you on our outlook for 2013 at the Investor Day.","Mark T. Bertolini","We do continue to work on expenses, and we're down 100 basis points this year. So that's still -- we see a lot of operating leverage in our fixed costs, and so we continue to work on that.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But no kind of net expectations on that.","Mark T. Bertolini","Not at this point in time.","Operator","We'll hear next from Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe just another question on unit cost effort or thinking about your unit cost trajectory going forward. Can you provide any color? As you've been rolling out more of these provider partnerships, what percentage of your medical expenses today sort of sits in more of the value base or pay-for-performance type contract arrangements? And what that could maybe track to over time?","Mark T. Bertolini","Melissa, we're going to give you a full accounting of that and how to think about it going forward at our Investor Conference, where we'll talk about the amount of membership we have in these arrangements, the level of impact they're having on medical costs and how to think about it going forward. We're just not prepared to do that yet.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe one more thing, on the provider partnership arrangements. I was interested on your commentary to get half of your Medicare membership into these provider partnership arrangements by year-end '13. Relative to a traditional HMO, how much more limited is the network for one of these partnership products? And based on your experience, do you believe seniors are really willing to transition to a tighter network overall in order to get these richer benefits?","Mark T. Bertolini","Melissa, it's not about transitioning Medicare members. It's about putting the Medicare members you have into different arrangements. And so our whole relationship with providers around Medicare in these partnerships is built on the fact that we get risk-adjusted revenue for sicker patients and they don't in their DRGs. And then if we work together, the people they do currently have on their programs, we have an opportunity to get more of their Medicare patients that come to their institution, get them on a capitated like arrangement that's associated with that risk-adjusted revenue and have them participate in doing good things in improving quality and reducing costs. So it's not about displacement at all. It's about converting what they have in fee for service today.","Operator","We'll hear next from Ralph Giacobbe from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","There's been a lot of talk about the push or shift from inpatient to outpatient. I guess is that disproportionate driver of lower cost trend? And then maybe if you can break out that trend, inpatient, outpatient, from what you're -- what you've seen.  Maybe how much more is left there.  And then your commentary of increased utilization into next year, is that more on the inpatient side?","Mark T. Bertolini","Ralph, inpatient utilization has been going down for at least the last decade, and we continue to see it happening. So I think that is just better technology, the ability to do more outpatient. And so our trends relative to inpatient are as expected. I think where we've seen the different changes is in just across the broader outpatient and position arena, not as high as we thought they were going to be. Joe, any other comments?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Ralph, our guidance for all the medical cost categories remains unchanged, but we do track very carefully the impact of our care management programs, what we call site of service. And the fact that we can drive services from an inpatient to an outpatient setting, an ambulatory setting, and from an ambulatory setting to a physician's office might put pressure on the utilization statistics. But from an overall net effective cost perspective, it's a win for the customers and the shareholders. So we track that very carefully and we're pleased to say that we've been very successful at driving cost to lower-cost settings, and that pervades the statistics that you see.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on a separate topic, can you give us what percentage of your hospital contracts are negotiated for 2014 and maybe the conversation you're having with providers in terms of your pricing on exchanges? Will that just be a separate, carved-out negotiation in price or rolled into a product that's already been negotiated?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Did you say 2014 or 2013?","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No -- yes, 2014.","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Very few, if any.","Mark T. Bertolini","Well, we have rolling contracts that are 3 years, but we have like 2% left this year and 29% left for next year. So think of it in that kind of rolling effect. So I would say the ones that open up in 2014, none of them, but that's not all the contracts, because we have multi-year contracts.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But in terms of your conversations with providers, I mean, when exchanges sort of come up, is that just something that's going to be, in your opinion, sort of something that's carved out? Or priced into a current product that you already have?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","We are contemplating running a separate network for the on-exchange business. That is correct.  And that is currently -- our network management program is currently deploying that.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just my last one. There's been sort of a recent sort of, I guess, re-emergence or interest in private exchanges. I guess just your overall view strategy here, opinion on uptake of this approach by more employers.","Mark T. Bertolini","Private exchanges, we will definitely participate in private exchanges, Ralph. We do see some employers that are interested in it. It's not a groundswell, but we think it's something that will emerge over time. It is our intention to be involved in that as well as the public exchanges.","Operator","And our final question this morning will come from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First, I just wanted to follow up on the industry tax, and you gave some good detail on how your pricing that in for Commercial. Maybe can you talk about how you're approaching this for the government lines. And specifically for Medicare, do you think CMS will be looking to build that into the rates? Or do you think this will be more of where the industry will need to adjust pricing and benefits to reflect the tax in 2014?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","Scott, at this point in time, we are anticipating having to pull the levers one needs to pull to maintain an appropriate margin in that business in order to offset the impact of the tax. We're not anticipating that CMS will allow it to be built into raise. Should that be the case, obviously, it will be something that would be easier to deal with. But right now, we're anticipating adjusting benefits and premiums to offset its impact.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question, just on the Group Insurance results. It looked like those were down pretty significantly year-over-year. If you can talk about the key factors that drove that. And was there any reserve strengthening in there? Or do you expect that this is sort of the new run rate for Group Insurance margins?","Joseph M. Zubretsky","No, it is not the new run rate. We actually had 1 month during the quarter with unusually high claim activity, jumbo claim activity, in the group life business. We think that was a statistical anomaly and the business is going to hit its plan for the year.","Thomas F. Cowhey","Thanks, Scott. A transcript of the prepared portion of this call will be posted shortly on the Investor Information section at aetna.com, where you can also find a copy of our updated guide and summary containing details of our guidance metrics, including those that were unchanged and not discussed on this call. If you have any questions about matters discussed this morning, please feel free to call me or one of my colleagues in the Investor Relations office. Thank you for joining us this morning.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Aetna second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to turn the conference over to Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cowhey, please go ahead.","Thomas Cowhey","Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna's second quarter 2014 earnings call and webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna. And with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K. We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company's performance that are non-GAAP measures in our second quarter 2014 Financial Supplement and our updated 2014 Guidance Summary. These reconciliations are available on the Investor Information section of Aetna.com. Please note that the inclusion of Coventry's results in the middle of the second quarter of 2013 impacts both the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comparisons.","Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited. So we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark Bertolini","Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported second quarter operating EPS of $1.69 per share, a result that speaks to the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses and our ability to succeed across many fronts.","Underlying our second quarter result; we grew medical membership by 385,000 members in the quarter, achieving a record 23.1 million members. We grew quarterly operating revenue to a record $14.5 billion, a 25% increase from the prior year, driven by strong organic growth and the Coventry acquisition.","We achieved solid underwriting results, driven by medical cost trends that remain moderate. We offset the impact of ACA mandated fees on our operating expense ratio through fixed cost leverage from growth, the realization of Coventry synergies and disciplined expense management. And finally, we continued to generate substantial free cash flow and aggressively deploy excess capital.","As we look to the remainder of 2014, we continue to project strong top line growth and solid operating performance. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our targeted high-single digit operating margin again in 2014, as our pricing remains disciplined and commercial medical cost trend remains moderate.","Based on our second quarter results, today we are raising our full year 2014 operating EPS guidance to a range of $6.45 to $6.60 per share from our previous projection of $6.35 to $6.55 per share. At the midpoint, this guidance represents 5% year-over-year operating EPS growth and a 14% CAGR since 2010, well in excess of both our diversified managed care peers and our low-double digit long-term operating EPS growth target.","At our Investor Conference in December, we highlighted the following elements of our growth model, built on the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses. Specifically, we project that: Aetna's large group Commercial business can grow profitably; Aetna's Government business can be a growth engine; small group and individual represent an opportunity for future growth; next generation networks enhance the core business; and Coventry is highly accretive, enhances topline growth and strengthens our capital position.","I will now provide a brief update on how we are executing against some of these growth levers. Aetna's second quarter again exemplifies the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses. Meaningful progress towards achieving our Coventry synergy goals as well as strong performance in our Group segment, allowed us to raise our operating EPS guidance range for the second time this year.","Beginning with our progress on the Coventry integration, we have discussed on previous calls that one of our primary goals this year is to accelerate more of the Coventry synergies into 2014 and achieve our targets early. Based on our progress to date and our current projections of operating expense savings, today we are raising our 2014 Coventry accretion projection by $0.05 to $0.10 per share to a range of $0.55 to $0.60 per share.","We continue to project $0.90 per share of accretion in 2015. This represents second increase to our 2014 accretion projection since closing the transaction, and is a testament to our focus and the strong execution of the Coventry integration team. I am pleased with the progress we have made, and we remain committed to achieving or exceeding our overall synergy targets.","Our large group commercial business has also had a strong start this year. Year-to-date, we have grown our large group commercial ASC membership by over 270,000 members, and we expect that large group commercial ASC growth will exceed 650,000 members by yearend.","Commercial ASC membership growth has been our historic yardstick for progress in this business. However, the continued conversion of self-funded membership into fully-insured private exchange membership is changing that equation, and making revenue growth a more meaningful metric.","At this early stage, as we look forward to the 2015 selling season for large accounts, we project that our large group commercial ASC membership will be fairly stable in the first quarter of 2015. However, we project continued fully-insured private exchange conversions will increase operating revenues from this important membership base next year.","We remain encouraged by plan sponsor interest in fully-insured private exchanges, and believe that more companies will evaluate alternatives to traditional employer-sponsored insurance, particularly as they address the continued implementation of the Affordable Care Act.","Additionally, we continue to work to develop our own proprietary exchange called, the Aetna Marketplace, which we believe will offer an attractive alternative to existing multi-carrier exchanges and the current defined benefit model for health benefits.","Moving on to our Government business. We grew membership in the quarter by over 100,000 members across both our Medicare and Medicaid platforms. On a year-to-date basis, we have grown our Government membership by over 230,000 members. This strong membership growth, combined with the inclusion of Coventry results, drove a 44% year-over-year increase in the quarterly Government premium revenue.","A key driver of the growth in our Government business has been our Medicare Advantage products, where we organically grew our membership by 17% from the same period last year. While 2014 and 2015 rate pressures present a meaningful challenge, we remain committed to the Medicare Advantage program, and we are executing on our plans to solve this funding gap in order to continue to offer value to our customers.","11,000 baby boomers become eligible for Medicare each day and Medicare spending is projected to exceed $1 trillion in 2020. We believe we must move boldly to bring managed care to traditional Medicare, applying new care management models that bring together doctors, data, payment and incentives for better and more cost-effective care.","This is the core purpose of our Accountable Care Solutions initiative. And we continue to believe that over time, we can: operate profitably with rates at parity with fee for service; enable better quality care at an improved cost; and help to solve one of our nation's most pressing fiscal issues.","Continuing with the Government business, our Medicaid franchise continued to perform well, producing strong operating results and growing by 79,000 members during the quarter, of which 45,000 were related to ACA expansion.","Additionally, we added approximately 17,000 dual-eligible members through our participation in the Ohio and Illinois demonstration projects. We are pleased to have the opportunity to serve this population and continue to project that dual-eligible members will contribute approximately $500 million to our operating revenues in 2014.","Shifting to the public exchanges. Last year when we discussed our public exchange strategy, we stated that our objective was to gain sufficient exposure to better understand how this population would behave and whether we could earn an appropriate return on capital over the long-term. We also stated that we would actively manage our exposure to this business, as we furthered our understanding of this new market opportunity.","We believe we achieved these goals, as we ended the quarter with nearly 600,000 public exchange members. As open enrollment is now closed, we project that we will end the year with just over 500,000 public exchange members, which will represent about 2% of Aetna's projected yearend 2014 medical membership.","It is worth reminding investors that nearly two-thirds of our public exchange membership had April or May effective dates. As a result, our medical cost experience for this population is not yet mature enough to draw conclusions about its profitability. At this time we continue to project that our total individual business will be a modest headwind to 2014 operating earnings.","Looking forward to 2015, we have chosen to approach the second year of this program with a continued focus on geographies, where we believe we can drive a highly competitive cost structure and provide the best value to our customers. Following our strategy, we have chosen to enter into one new state in 2015, the state of Georgia.","And otherwise our footprint will remain similar to what it was in 2014. We continue to believe this footprint and approach will allow us to manage risk in the near-term, while positioning us favorably over the long-term.","Moving on to our ACO and next generation network strategy. We continue to execute on our strategy of collaborating with our provider partners to transform the network model from one of episodic acute care to patient-centric population health management. By aligning incentives with providers, we are leading the way toward improved health for our members and a lower overall cost of care.","Our collaboration with Banner Health speaks directly to these successes. In 2013, the second full year of our Aetna Whole Health product collaboration, we saw: an improvement in cancer screening rates, including cervical and colorectal cancer screening; a reduction in the percent of diabetic members with poorly controlled blood sugar levels; a reduction in radiology services of approximately 9%; an increase in the generic prescribing rate by almost 4%; and a reduction in avoidable admissions by approximately 9%.","Collectively, these actions drove a 5% decline in costs for Aetna Whole Health members served by Banner Health Network. By partnering with providers like Banner Health Network, we are building a simpler, more integrated system that enables true population health management, creating healthier communities and a healthier world.","Finally, I would like to make a few comments about our long-term growth outlook. At our Investor Conference in December, we articulated our goal of doubling our operating revenues by the end of the decade, backed by the strength of our diversified portfolio.","Based on our updated guidance, we are now projecting we will grow operating revenue in 2014 by over $10 billion. This projected growth is driven by our strong organic membership growth in public and private exchanges, Medicare Advantage, our dual-eligible contracts, and Medicaid expansion, and continued trend leverage as well as the inclusion of Coventry.","We have already made excellent progress toward reaching our goal of $100 billion of operating revenues by the end of the decade. As we continue to execute and drive transformation in the Health Care marketplace, we are focused on making this goal a reality.","In summary, I am pleased with our results year-to-date, and I am confident in: our strategic direction and our ability to execute; our ability to achieve Coventry synergies and our accretion goals; the power of our diversified portfolio to drive growth; and our 2014 operating EPS projection of $6.45 to $6.60 per share.","I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers, and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our second quarter results and our updated 2014 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn Guertin","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we reported second quarter 2014 operating earnings of $610 million and operating earnings per share of $1.69. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong operating revenue growth and cash flow as well as solid operating margins, a result of prudent pricing, moderate medical cost trend and a disciplined focus on operating expenses.","I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our topline performance continues to be very strong. We grew operating revenue by 25% over the prior-year quarter to a record quarterly level of $14.5 billion, driven by strong organic growth as well as the Coventry acquisition.","We also grew medical membership to a record 23.1 million members, adding 385,000 new members during the quarter, with growth in our Commercial and Government businesses, as well as the inclusion of membership from the InterGlobal acquisition. The second quarter of 2014 represents Aetna's ninth consecutive quarter of medical membership growth.","From an operating margin perspective our businesses are performing quite well. Our second quarter total Medical Benefit Ratio was 83.1%, bringing our year-to-date total Medical Benefit Ratio to 81.8%, a very good overall result.","Our operating expense ratio improved from the same period last year to 17.6%, despite the inclusion of ACA fees. This outstanding result was driven by fixed cost leverage from growth, Coventry synergies and disciplined expense management.","Our pre-tax operating margin was 7.6%, consistent with our target operating margin range, putting Aetna on track to achieve high-single digit operating margins in 2014. This result would represent Aetna's fifth consecutive year of achieving or exceeding this goal, despite an increasing mix of lower margin Government business.","From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to first quarter 2014 dates of service.","Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days claims payable were 47 days at the end of the quarter, stable sequentially and higher by two days year-over-year. Similar to the first quarter, our elevated level of days claims payable in the second quarter was driven by membership growth, primarily in public exchanges. We project this metric to return to a level more consistent with our recent historical experience over the balance of the year.","Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.7x operating earnings year-to-date, driven by higher premium receipts from pricing actions designed to recover ACA mandated fees and taxes, and the effect of growth in insured membership.","As we consider the remainder of 2014, it is worth noting that the September payment of Aetna's portion of the health insurer fee, estimated at approximately $600 million, will pressure our third quarter 2014 cash flow metrics. We continue to project that our full year 2014 Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows will exceed our 2014 operating earnings.","We also continued to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing over 3 million shares in the quarter for $255 million and distributing over $80 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend.","In short, we are quite pleased with our second quarter results, which we believe demonstrate the execution of Aetna's growth strategy, the success of the Coventry integration and the value of our diversified portfolio. I will now discuss the key drivers of our second quarter performance in greater detail.","Beginning with our Commercial business. Our commercial membership grew by nearly 280,000 members during the quarter, driven primarily by public exchange membership growth of approximately 360,000 members, partially offset by the previously disclosed departure of a large self-insured customer.","Absent the growth in public exchange members, our commercial insured membership was roughly flat sequentially, a result that continues to speak to our commitment to fair and financially responsible pricing, where we favor margin over membership and price to underlying medical cost trends.","As a result of our prudent pricing posture and moderate medical cost trends, our commercial insured business has continued to generate high-single digit pre-tax operating margins this year. Our Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio was 80.6% for the quarter, and 78.9% year-to-date, a modest improvement over the first half of 2013 that we believe positions us to achieve the lower half of our projected Commercial MBR range of 79% to 80% in 2014.","Medical cost trends continue to be moderate and emerge consistent with our previous range of projections, despite pressure from new Hepatitis C treatments. We remain vigilant in examining our experience for evidence of an unexpected uptick in medical cost trends, and based on our year-to-date experience, we project that Aetna's standalone 2014 commercial medical cost trend will be in the lower half of our 6% to 7% range.","Also, with respect to our public exchange business, we would note that we have not accrued any specific payables or receivables for the federal risk adjustment or risk corridor programs. While we have more data on this new membership than we did at the end of the first quarter, we still have little data with respect to the April and May cohorts, which represent nearly two-thirds of our public exchange membership.","We have conducted various scenario analyses using available data, and we remain comfortable projecting that the earnings impact of our total individual business will be a modest headwind to our operating earnings in 2014. With respect to the federal reinsurance program, our receivable based on known claims was approximately $50 million at the end of the quarter.","Another important growth lever is our government franchise. Our f grew by over 100,000 members in the quarter, consisting of: Medicare Advantage growth of 12,000 members; Medicare Supplement growth of 17,000 members; and Medicaid growth of nearly 80,000 members primarily from ACA related expansion and approximately 17,000 dual eligible members related to our participation in the Ohio and Illinois demonstration projects.","The Coventry acquisition, combined with strong organic membership growth, drove total second quarter 2014 government premiums to a record $5.2 billion, a 44% increase over the prior-year period. Our Government Medical Benefit Ratio was 86.5% in the quarter, an excellent result and a year-over-year improvement of 180 basis points. Drivers of this year-over-year improvement include actions impacting revenue and medical costs designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap, including the health insurer fee.","Finally, I would like to comment on our Group segment. Group operating earnings increased both sequentially and year-over-year due to higher underwriting margins reflecting improved experience in our life and disability products. As we look to the remainder of the year for this business, we project that underwriting margins will return to a level more consistent with recent historical experience.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure, and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At June 30th, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of 36%.","Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $643 million. We repurchased over 3 million shares for $255 million and paid a shareholder dividend of over $80 million. After other uses, including settlement of short-term financing obligations, we ended the quarter with $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 354.6 million at June 30th.","As a result of our second quarter performance, we are increasing our full year 2014 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $6.45 to $6.60 per share, from our previous projection of $6.35 to $6.55 per share.","This increased guidance range reflects aggregate performance across our diversified portfolio of businesses that is generally consistent with our previous range of projections and gives us a higher level of confidence in our full year outlook; supplemented by an additional $0.05 to $0.10 of projected operating expense synergies from the Coventry acquisition.","Our updated 2014 guidance is also influenced by the following additional drivers. We now project that our yearend medical membership will be approximately 23.4 million members, an increase of 300,000 members over the remainder of the year. Drivers of this projected increase include the previously disclosed TRS commercial ASC win that we expect to add over 400,000 members in September 2014 and continued growth in government membership, partially offset by declining individual membership.","Based on our full year membership projections and year-to-date results, we now project that our full year 2014 operating revenue will be at least $57 billion. We continue to project our full year Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio will be 79% to 80% and our full year Government Medical Benefit Ratio will be 85% to 87%, noting that our year-to-date performance points towards the lower half of those projected ranges.","We continue to project our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18.5%, noting that our updated Coventry synergy guidance implies relative improvement as compared to our previous projections. We now project our pre-tax operating margin to be approximately 7.5%, consistent with our high-single digit target. We now project operating earnings to be at least $2.3 billion.","Based on our updated operating revenue projection, we now project net dividends from subsidiaries will be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, approximately $100 million to $200 million lower than our prior projection, as additional capital to support premium growth is held at our regulated subsidiaries.","Correspondingly, we now project excess cash flow to the parent to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Despite this change in projected excess cash flow to the parent, we continue to project that our full year 2014 weighted average share count will be in the range of 359 million to 360 million shares.","In closing, we are pleased with the strength of our second quarter results and our improved 2014 outlook, which at the mid-point, represents 5% operating EPS growth, in spite of the many challenges facing our industry in 2014.","As we look to the rest of the year, we remain focused on delivering on our plans to offset the Medicare Advantage rate pressures, integrating Coventry as we continue to invest to achieve or exceed our updated 2014 synergy targets, collecting or solving for the ACA mandated fees and taxes, and executing on our exchange strategies, both public and private.","As we continue to execute on these key focus areas during this challenging time for our industry, we are increasingly confident that we can achieve our 2014 projections.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas Cowhey","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question, so that many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Josh Raskin - Barclays","Just a question on the commercial book. I'm just trying to parse out the MLR on the commercial book on a year-over-year basis deteriorate a little bit relative to the first quarter. And I guess I'm just trying to figure out what some of the drivers were there. It looks like maybe the exchange membership came in a little bit stronger than you thought. So it might be helpful to sort of give us a ballpark of what are the exchange MLRs that you're seeing?","And then, if you could give us a sense as to the total lives and you're just sort of rolling that forward in 2015. Similar footprint would you expect, plus Georgia, maybe slight growth in public exchanges or what are the thoughts on that book in 2015?","Mark Bertolini","I'll give you the high points, and then I'll have Shawn talk to some of the details in the Commercial business. But first and foremost, the core Commercial business is behaving as we expected and doing well. We see rational pricing in the marketplace and as we mentioned both in the Commercial MBR and in the trend, we expect to be in the lower half of our ranges.","And when you look at that trend number, it will be in the lower half of 6% to 7%, where we ended last year 5.5% to 6% is at the lower end of our raise that we saw or expected in our pricing for 2014, of which we've now priced 95% of our business. And so we believe that our margins are great and that we have some ins and outs in the diversified portfolio, and I'll let Shawn speak for those issues.","Shawn Guertin","Yes, you're right, Josh. Obviously, the MBR is up year-over-year. It is important to keep in mind that there are various items that can affect the comparability of the Commercial MBR in any particular quarter. And I think, first, as Mark alluded to, the most important thing is to look at this from a fundamental perspective. And we're actually quite pleased with our year-to-date performance and the trajectory that puts us on for the full year.","Inside that number, the majority of our Commercial MBR is obviously our core employer commercial groups business. And that business had a very good quarter, and in fact the MBR on this actually down from the second quarter of 2013. So when you look to the bridge from Q2 2013 to Q2 2014, there is a few things that are worth mentioning.","As noted in the press release, there was less prior-period development this quarter than the prior-year quarter. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, overall prior-period development was quite healthy and favorable. So this isn't something that we're particularly concerned about.","As you alluded to in your question, given the late growth that we saw in public exchanges, we've continued to accrue results for our individual business cautiously. In addition, the way the GAAP dictates that we accrue for the reinsurance program, which is based on known claims only, that create some front half of the year MBR pressure. All else being equal, we'd expect to see these results improve in the back half, as more cases reach the individual reinsurance detachment point. Clearly, Sovaldi continues to be a pressure item.","And finally, I would say, we did see some variation in the quarterly MBRs in some of our smaller commercial businesses such as international and student health, which can happen from quarter-to-quarter. We expect the results from these business to improve in the second half the year, as a result of actions that we've already begun to take in the second quarter and we'll be taking in the third quarter. So at the end of the day, we still feel very good about what we're seeing on core medical trend year-to-date and our ability to come in the lower half of our full year guidance range of 79% to 80%.","Josh Raskin - Barclays","And you didn't mentioned it, so I've assumed there is nothing material to talk about, but anything on the impatient trend side? Are you seeing any change in terms of admissions or bed days or anything like that?","Mark Bertolini","Bed days are stable, but down. And so we don't see any shift there in trend year-over-year, as a matter of fact behaving very well. And our expectation for the year is that we move from mid-to-high single-digit increases in outpatient and are seeing that, as more business moves from impatient to outpatient. But the impatient admissions days are stable-to-down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","First, I just want to follow-up on Josh's question, around the Commercial MLR. Shawn, you gave some color around, and look what's down like seasonality in the exchange business. So can you give us a little more detail there just in terms of what are the exchange MLRs going to look like for the year and how are they being booked in the second quarter versus how they're going to roll for the third quarter to fourth quarter that might explain some seasonality? It sounds like it might be somewhat similar to part A?","Shawn Guertin","There is an aspect of this, again, related particularly to reinsurance. What I would say is we've continued to book that cautiously here at the beginning of the year for a number of reasons. We would continue to project for the full year that this business would be a modest headwind to earnings, really a by product at the MBR that we open that we book.","But to the point of your question, all other things being equal, some of the mechanics around sort of the booking of this reinsurance based on known claims would create a back half MBR for the health insurance exchange business, that's lower than what we've booked in the first half.","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","Could you give us any order of magnitude, Shawn, where it's going to be? I think the questions coming up, because it looks like the first half of the year the MBR was approximately flat, you're looking for it to improve back half of the year on a year-over-year basis, which is typically not the seasonality we've seen, but in terms of just the typical commercial book seasonality. So I think there is some confusion around that. And if you could help us kind of map through, how this is going to impact the overall MBR trend, it might be helpful?","Shawn Guertin","So this reinsurance mechanic, if you sort of compare it to this GAAP, it carried away a booking based on known claims too. If you just booked a pro forma sort of full year estimate each month, that is straining the MBR in the first half of the year versus that other basis, 800 basis points, 900 basis points, maybe even up to a 1,000 basis points, depending on how you want to look at it. So in essence, we've sort of taken that strain at the beginning of the year, and that will sort of work back to sort of what we expect for the full year by the end of the year.","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","So 800 basis points to a 1,000 basis points essentially higher MBR on just the exchanges in the first half and why not in the second half, and that will explain some of that seasonality difference.","Shawn Guertin","That's correct. And that's, again, that's all other things being equal. And that's just the reinsurance sort of reversing itself.","Operator","We'll go next to Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs","Maybe sort of continuing on the same thing here, just trying to understand your outlook now really on the operating cost side. So am I correct in the math that if you're going to do 18.5% for the full year on the operating cost ratio that it's going to be at or above 19% in the back half of the year. Can you just address that, if that's correct and what's driving that?","Shawn Guertin","I think mathematically that has to be correct. And again, there is some, we talked about this last quarter, some of the investment spending that we're electing to make behind our Medicare business and our consumer businesses. And typically, we certainly see sort of the back half pressure on the SG&A ratio, whether it's related to open enrollment activities or getting ready for membership the next year.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs","So is that going to be weighted towards the fourth quarter than what we should expect?","Shawn Guertin","They typically march upwards from third quarter to fourth quarter. That's right.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs","And then, I guess lastly on the ratios, is it also correct in thinking about the government ratio below 85% in the back half of the year is that really driven in large part by the Drug Plan seasonality or other factors?","Shawn Guertin","We certainly will get the PDP seasonality, but I think the Government MBR in the first half of the year is actually fairly similar to the second half of the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just want to make sure I had understand, I guess to go into the guidance. Here it looks like you guys raised the revenue outlook, you took down the MLR for both commercial and Medicare, you kept you G&A ratio the same and you're only raising the guidance for the Coventry synergies being accelerated. Can you talk about, I guess, what else the delta is there? Why the raises more than just the acceleration of the synergies?","Mark Bertolini","I think it's just too early in the year, with all the moving parts we have around public exchanges, finishing or finalizing the funding gap in Medicare related to the Medicare Advantage rates. It's too early in the year to get aggressive there.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is there something just mathematically that that's the plug in there that you're taking it more conservative, because you're taking the commercial MLR down, so it feels like you're not necessarily factoring in higher MLR on the exchanges per se?","Mark Bertolini","Part of what we saw in the second quarter of the year was better results in group, largely around life, which last year was a headwind for us. And so we're not projecting life to remain as positive through the remainder of year.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You made a comment earlier that you expected the Group business to be more similar to historical profitability. Wasn't sure, if that meant that 2013 was usually low, when you thought '14 to be better than that, or you were saying that for the rest of the year Group will be less than as we look over last year.","Shawn Guertin","Kevin, clearly, we had some stream last year in a couple of quarters related to our Group business. So what I would say is a more historically consistent level of performance would produce a better result in '14 than '13 than our Group business. So the commentary again was, the output, we're just not assuming that the outperformance that we saw in the second quarter is going to replicate itself in third and fourth quarters.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","There is nothing specifically that you're highlighting as an issue for that beyond just it's early and you want to be conservative?","Shawn Guertin","Absolutely not. Absolutely not. That business is performing very well.","Operator","We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse","Just harp on I guess the Commercial MLR. You mentioned I think Shawn that the core MLR was down. Is that right? And when you say core is that just less the PPRD, that's sort of accruing other reinsurance and Hep C. I am just trying to understand that what's sort of the definition of the core, what are you stripping out?","Shawn Guertin","So let me go back, and I will sort of amplify a little bit on what Justin was asking about. I mentioned three specific businesses that, for lack of a better term, that I will call non-core. And when I am thinking about our core, I'm really thinking about our core group employer baked business. When you look at that business sort of by itself, without these three businesses that I'll mention, the MBR is down.","We do have three businesses, the public exchange business, I mentioned international and student health that had some variation here in the front half of the year and it's actually improvements in all of those businesses that are accruing to what we're seeing or what we're forecasting for the second half of the year.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse","And then just wanted to ask about the National Accounts selling season and maybe how that's progressing. You've seen any greater uptick in RFP activity, I guess into 2015? And would you expect to see greater disruption in the commercial market next year or do you see most employer sort of staying put?","Mark Bertolini","We see a lot of activity, particularly in looking at private exchanges. We saw a lot of looking, but no buying and a lot of employer standing pat as they evaluate whether or not it's worth making changes with carriers for 2015. We will continue to see some conversion from self-funded administered business, two fully insured private exchanges, but not necessarily on the scale we saw last year.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank","First question, just Shawn, just back on the Commercial MLR again. Do you have an estimate of how much the lower reserve development impacted the Commercial MLR year-over-year in terms of the comps? And then just my follow-up question is just on the small group market, and Mark, maybe interested, if you can give us an update on how you think you see the pricing environment there heading into 2015. It looks like that some of the rate filings have been coming out over this summer that, we have some of the non-profits with pretty low proposed rate increases in small group for 2015, and just interested on how you guys are thinking about that next?","Shawn Guertin","Scott, so I'll take the first one and then turn it to Mark on the Commercial MBR. Again, the mathematical impact of sort of the accounting value of prior-period development year-over-year is about a 150 basis points even of itself. But I want to be really clear, we had very healthy PPD this year and in fact the aggregate PPD is very similar year-over-year, it's just a little bit different, as it's distributed by product, so it was a little bit less on commercial this year. So overall PPD, again, looks fine. It really is sort of this accounting timing issue across quarters.","Mark Bertolini","And to relate to small group, Scott, we are seeing still a rational pricing environment. We are not seeing a lot of dumping yet, as some people have predicted. I think people want to see whether or not the public exchanges work. We did see a 2 percentage decrease year-over-year of small groups, offering insurance to their employees from 44% to 42%, and that has been a normal trend.","So we haven't seen any over dumping in the public exchanges and having employees plan their own coverage. We do see small group moving into a private exchange model over the next couple of years, and will be actively engaged. We have launched an Aetna Marketplace for small group already in the 2014.","Operator","We'll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners","Just following up on the previous question and your response, Mark, on dumping. So on early renewals, to what extent are you seeing competitors willing to adjust pricing down just to get a slightly better margin than they would to discourage these employers from dumping? And might that place any pressure on pricing going forward?","Mark Bertolini","Again, we see a very rational pricing environment, Ana, but of course it depends by market and what trends are in local markets. But as far as we can see at this point in time, not a whole lot of pressure in small group. As a matter of fact, we've had a pretty reasonable year from a pricing standpoint and our Commercial MBR standpoint in small group. So we believe that it's a very stable market at this point in time. But we do not see it sustainable over the long-term, as small group employers stop offering coverage. And so we're evaluating alternatives to driving more private exchange membership in that segment.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners","And in addition to dumping in private exchanges, one of your competitors is talking about accelerating self-insured even in the down market, are you seeing that? And related to that, any pressure again to my previous question from newer entrants, co-ops, hospital systems that are coming in with insurance licenses both for '15 and then going forward?","Mark Bertolini","I think on the first part of self funding, we do offer that product. We don't see a whole lot of takers in that marketplace and we don't see it as a macro trend for our industry. As a matter of fact, if I am a small group employer, particularly in the sizes we deal with, which are in the 10 to 20 and even under range, figuring out whether or not I should do spec or agg reinsurance in any given year relative to my employee population, while I'm running my donut shop, doesn't make a whole lot of sense. And I don't want to have to make that decision each year.","And if I can find an alternative to offer my employees, a better product over time, I will do that. So I just don't think that that is a sustainable macro trend. I see it quite opposite, moving to private exchanges as long as private exchanges offer a stable and affordable experience over time. So that's how we would see that market shifting. And the second part of your question?","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners","The second was on new entrants. So do you think that exchanges are encouraging competition from new entrants? Firstly into the exchange market and because risk is pooled, by definition they also move into an adjacency into small group or is that not happening at all?","Mark Bertolini","I think we will see new entrants. I think we will see hospital systems that are more willing to take risk, we're engaged in those. We see more joint ventures. Our innovation health plan with Inova, where we are doing joint ventures around risk and risk alone, not necessarily owning delivery assets or them owning risk asset.","So we do see that as an emerging trend and we have a lot of those conversations going on. As it relates to co-ops and smaller entrants, I think only time will tell as to whether or not they're able to generate sufficient cash flow and to generate enough risk-based capital to maintain their business over time.","Operator","And we'll go next to Carl McDonald with Citi.","Carl McDonald - Citi","On the core commercial risk loss ratio being down year-over-year, the industry fee alone should have dropped the loss ratio in maybe something between 200 basis points and 250 basis points or is it safe to assume that x the industry fee impact the core risk loss ratio would have been up pretty meaningfully year-over-year?","Shawn Guertin","Well, again mathematically, yes. But keep in mind that in that core commercial block, we had already expected, because of experienced rating for the MBR to first sort of reset that to a normal point, and then sort of have the health insurer fee collection in there. So, yes, sort of in isolation to your question, but I think you have to remember there is multiple moving pieces going on in that block, especially in the large group business.","Carl McDonald - Citi","And then on the exchange assumptions, how much do you worry that you should actually be booking a payable for risk adjustment? And sort of the root of the question is, across the industry you guys are an exception, but I look at a lot of companies booking receivables for risk adjustment. I don't see a lot of companies booking payables for risk adjustments. It seems like across the industry somebody is going to have an unexpected big deal in the second half of the year, and just be interested in your thoughts?","Shawn Guertin","As I mentioned in the remarks, we looked at and did a number of sort of scenario analyses. And certainly a number of those scenarios were scenarios where we would potentially have a risk adjuster payable, and sort of tested that again to sort of the conservative posture or the prudent posture rather that was taken in booking that. So we have contemplated that in sort of where we landed for the second quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","I had a question about cost for next year in your expectations. Where do you expect Hepatitis C cost to be next year relative to this year? And then on hospital cost with hospitals showing declining bad debt, where you expect pricing for hospitals to be for you guys?","Mark Bertolini","Well, I think it's too early to tell on the hospital pricing, Peter, as we evaluate our plans for next year, but we always push on the pricing increases with hospitals. We've been aggressive over the last four years, five years in keeping it in very low single-digits, and have been successful in negotiating that, which usually generates a conversation about how do we share risk and how do we move into more value-based contracts, which we see in acceleration. So I think too early to tell there, but we will again be pushing pretty hard to maintain very low price increases.","The second part of your question, really where we see our cost for Sovaldi or any other of the Hep C drug is up. I mean we are already pricing for 2015. We are 20% into the pricing cycle. And we continue to see that as a cost driver, and now that we have a pretty good handle on what we've seen for the first two quarters and what we expect for the rest of the year. We've incorporated a healthy amount for that into our 2015 pricing.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","Can you say how much you've incorporated? How much of a ramp up do you expect when these drugs become all oral?","Mark Bertolini","We're not prepared to give 2015 trend guidance.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","And just maybe if one more shot at the way Kevin was asking the question before. You sort of changed your view on operating margin to be about or pre-tax operating margin to be about 7.5%, that's from previous, where it was at least 7.5%. So you sort of lowered that in every other statistic, the operating statistics seems to be improved in terms of your guidance. Why the lower guidance on pre-tax operating margin?","Shawn Guertin","Well, certainly, one of the things that's pushing that is, we continue to see increased revenue, a great deal of that revenue. If you think about things like duals and health insurance exchange membership is not in our guidance, making a great deal of money. And in fact some of it as I mentioned is in there creating a modest headwind thus creating a little bit of downward pressure on the op margin.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna International Group.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna International Group","I actually wanted to step back and ask a big picture question here. Just in terms of, given the success of Coventry, do you think Aetna is kind of back at the point where they could get back into the deal market, and when you think about where the company could benefit most by M&A, whether it's commercial, Medicare, Medicaid or maybe some IT-oriented stuff. Could you give us a sense, where you think you're at and just some color as to where you could possibly benefit the most?","Mark Bertolini","We have not been out of the deal market. So we've been still active, particularly in international and the technology space, and we continue to pursue assets that we believe are important to our portfolio in enhancing our capabilities to meet both the consumer market and the ACO market. So we haven't been out.","I think if you're thinking about big M&A, we continue to want to meet our needs relative to Coventry. We have to finish the integration, which we are close to getting to. Our goal is to get to $0.90 per share as quickly as we can and declare victory and move on with running our business.","As you might guess, our integration is over, we're now in migration. And as you get into the migration part of the business, it's kind of hard to keep track of the different class. And we've seen some synergies in our analysis come out of the Aetna side of the business and little on the Coventry side of the business.","As it relates to sort of what we're interested in, it's definitely technology. And we believe that as we build a better engine around managing medical costs, we believe there is some more opportunity in commercial over time. And we have said and even when we did the Coventry acquisition, we said we thought that was going to be the last really big deal until we clear 2014 anywhere in the industry, and that's pretty much held true.","As we think about specialty businesses, as you think about for example, Medicaid, we believe we have all the capabilities we need in Medicaid. And we believe that purchasing any Medicaid plan at this point in time only buys us contracts and geographies that are temporal and short-term in their nature with their own inherent risks. And given current price earnings multiples, we believe that they are heavy prices to pay for the opportunity to try and keep a contract.","Operator","We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen","A competitor indicated they had some Medicare advantage and Medicaid true-ups in the quarter. You didn't mention that. I'm assuming that didn't happen for you?","Shawn Guertin","I think what they were mentioning on that call had to do with revenue true-ups and typically during any given calendar year we would be refining our estimate of risk adjusted revenue base as we complete the submission to CMS. So we certainly had some positive favorability this year as we typically do in that space. But again, I think that's sort of par for the course in terms of how we proceed on that front.","Christine Arnold - Cowen","So it wasn't outsized relative to what we saw last year?","Shawn Guertin","Again, it's a little different than last year, because of Coventry being in this year. So we're working with a bigger base.","Christine Arnold - Cowen","And then, if you look forward to '15, it sounds like we're seeing stability in small group, your pricing at large groups seems like its pretty stable of public exchange next year. First of all, you've got some experience from first quarter, I know its not mature from second quarter new membership, but as we look at the public exchange membership, if it comes in worse than you expect this year, do you think you can book risk quarters. And since you've already bid on public exchange enrollment, how do we think about your options as things come in different than you expect in terms of '15?","Mark Bertolini","Sure. I think first of all, two-thirds of our membership came in April and May. So there isn't a whole lot of experience that we have. We did price into the market based on books of business, and all the credibility or uncredibility factors that we had based on each market, the size of the market, what we saw on the way of cost trends, and so our pricing on health insurance exchanges and the public exchanges is anywhere from flat up to over 20%, with an average somewhere in the mid-teens. So we believe we have it adequately covered. We won't know enough experience until the end of the third quarter, and I would expect by the end of the third quarter we've had some view on risk quarters and risk adjustors.","Christine Arnold - Cowen","Can you exit if you see something that makes you kind of scared with respect to maturity? When can you say I'm out for next year?","Shawn Guertin","Until September, the end of September, that the sign on the dotted line to be engaged in any markets.","Christine Arnold - Cowen","And do you think you could book a risk quarter? Things don't look like you hope they did?","Shawn Guertin","To the degree we have adequate enough information. It has to be known and quantifiable in order to book it. And right now, we don't have enough data to do that. But if we believe we do, we would expect by the end of the third quarter to have a better view on that.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Windley with Jefferies.","Dave Windley - Jefferies","On membership, just checking the roll forward here. I have that you expect about 300,000 lives over the balance of the second half. I believe you're bringing in TRS at over 400,000 in Medicaid expansion and enrollment there should add some. So your kind of gross adds exceed that 300,000. Are the reductions related to your comments in the individual market, is that it, or are there other puts and takes there?","Mark Bertolini","So I think we will see some attrition in the health insurance fee exchanges for sure. We're already seeing it. And we expect that to continue through the end of the year. And then we're also seeing it in the large group, as large groups lay off employees, particularly on the financial services sector, we've seen some in group attrition in large groups and jumbo groups.","Dave Windley - Jefferies","And then on Medicare Advantage and some of the reinvestment in that business, I apologize if you've already mentioned this, but could you elaborate on kind of the specific targets for that investment and maybe what you're expectations are for stars movement in back half of this year.","Mark Bertolini","I would highlight to, first, we know what our funding gap is for 2015, so we got started early on it. And so we've made investments there to solve for that. And I would remind everybody that over the two years, '14 and '15, we expect that to be high-single digits funding gap. This year it was 800 basis points, so then that is probably what we would expect for '15.","And then secondly, it's definitely in stars ratings. We're gathering all the information and engaging with the provider community in ways that we need to do that. But we expect that our star ratings will improve year-over-year, the four-plus star ratings. This year we were at 62%.","Operator","We'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush","Does your $500 million in 2014 dual revenue include any MA revenue in Ohio? I think the passive enrollment on MA doesn't start until 2015. So just wondering what's included in that number?","Shawn Guertin","I think what you should be aware of is that we do have passive enrollment going on, and what you should be aware of is that we get, and when you're looking at the reports coming out of the states, we get a revenue number from the states, and then we have to enroll those individuals into Medicare Advantage, and that comes another number. It won't come all together until 2015.","Sarah James - Wedbush","So the $500 million doesn't assume a full allocation, but assumes some MA revenue?","Shawn Guertin","It assumes a full allocation, but as you're looking at the numbers and the reports coming out of the states, the way we get it is from both the state itself through Medicaid and then we apply in and enroll these people in Medicaid Advantage at the federal level.","Sarah James - Wedbush","And what do you assume for opt out on duals, for the amount of duals that are opting out of the MA portion and going with the Medicaid fee-for-service.","Shawn Guertin","I don't have the specific assumption. I know we talked actually about that concept recently. And I think, so far it's been behaving more or less consistent with what we expected to see, but we can certainly follow-up with a specific number on that.","Sarah James - Wedbush","Last clarification, just looking at your press release, it looked like you had $536 million in prior-period development in the Health Care segment in the first quarter, and then $532 million for the half. So just wondering, if you could reconcile those numbers?","Shawn Guertin","Yes. I mean, it isn't anymore complicated than we've had a small amounts of negative development, just going back to the last year, when it will be crystal clear. Overall in the quarter, we had favorable prior-period development. But when you look specifically at prior-year, we had a little bit of a negative, and again that's not atypical when large claims come in late and things like that.","Sarah James - Wedbush","Any clarity on what segment that was in?","Shawn Guertin","It wasn't particularly meaningful in any one segment. It's obviously, it's a fairly small number.","Operator","And we'll go on to our next question from A.J. Rice of UBS.","A.J. Rice- UBS","Just maybe real quick, slip a couple of things in. On the Medicare Advantage business, I know you're talking about the future and how you're trying to address the funding gap in the current year. Year-to-date the growth of membership has been more than you thought. I think you're up 17% or something. Can you just comment on, has that come in, in line with expectations? How has the MLR trend been on that?","Mark Bertolini","Well, we expected the risk scores to look like we expected them. They were in markets where we wanted that growth to occur. 80% of the growth were in markets where we had four-plus star rating. So we feel good about that membership. We do expect them to have higher MLRs in the first year, because we have a number of medical management actions we need to put in place to, number one, get more risk adjusted revenue information, but also to impact their care, improve the quality and lower the cost.","A.J. Rice - UBS","And just on your comments on private exchanges. It sounds like, maybe I'm reading too much into, and I know you guys have been one of the more optimistic ones about the long-term prospects for private exchanges. It sounds like maybe looking into next year, you're thinking maybe the growth moderates a little. It sounded like that. I just want to make sure I'm hearing it right. And then on your Aetna specific product, is that a full risk product or is that some other hybrid type of product?","Mark Bertolini","Well, the first comments around the expectations for next year were largely around the large Group National Accounts space. So I haven't commented about middle market or small group. And as we look at our own private exchange models, we will participate in some self-funded, but largely our exchange models are full risk.","Operator","We'll go next to Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley","Just real quick here. Thinking, a lot of questions here about the exchanges, and you obviously talked about your pricing, 0% to 20%. In light of that pricing range, how should we be thinking about this product maybe in '15 and then still larger term? Obviously you're entering a new market. Is '15 the year where it's likely to swing to a positive earnings contributor? Or is it really going to be maybe flat for the first few years here and then longer term move more towards long-term earnings profitability?","Shawn Guertin","I think it's still to be determined. We need to obviously get '14 under our belt, get all of our rates approved, and sort of understand where we stack up competitively, and obviously what the enrollment looks like. So I think it's premature to sort of form any extreme conclusion about sort of 2015 at this stage.","Mark Bertolini","But I would say, we have price to margins that would generate an appropriate return on capital and continue to do so over time. So it's really what are the results show us and how do we need to adjust.","Operator","And we'll go to Tom Carroll with Stifel.","Tom Carroll - Stifel","So good discussion of MLR moving parts here today, thanks for that. I wonder if you could just further reconcile the idea of two-thirds of your exchange enrollment, right starting in the April, May, timeframe. So somewhat information flow delay relative to what we normally see, and the fact that you're pretty confident in your view about it, declining back half MLR. So I don't know, it sounds like to me that you might be a bit more comfortable with your exchange outlook than your tone or perhaps guidance suggests, I mean is that fair to assume?","Shawn Guertin","Yes. And Tom, I would say that what we can see feels okay, vis-\u00e0-vis sort of our pricing expectations, acknowledging what you said about the limited visibility. So I think sort of directionally, again, that's a true statement. But again, it is important to state that we still do have some degree of limited visibility given that growth. I want to back up on this, just this framework, just to make sure that I have been very clear on the year-over-year bridge and that you have a sense for what each of these pieces is doing.","When you think about the health insurance exchange business mixing in, and I'm now thinking about second quarter '14 versus second quarter '13, that's probably worth 50 basis points, plus or minus, by itself, and that's just the business and where it's being booked this year. And the other two smaller ancillary commercial businesses, student health and international are also worth about 50 basis points plus or minus year-over-year.","We talked about the other moving parts, which were sort of the PPD, Sovaldi and then the health insurer fee as a recovery item. So I just want to make sure that I have been clear about the magnitude. But I would go back again to your question, and say, that on the margins we certainly feel a little bit better than we did a quarter ago, but we still really need more information to form a firm conclusion.","Tom Carroll - Stifel","And then as a follow-up, and I realize it's very early on this, but any read on cost trends in the new Florida Medicaid program?","Mark Bertolini","Any new program, we always take the posture of booking that at a more cautious MBR than say our typical book we run at. So we've done that. And so we don't see anything that's particularly alarming yet, but keep in mind that's a relatively small piece frankly of our Medicaid business, but certainly a small piece of the whole company.","Operator","And our last question in queue will come from Brian Wright with Sterne, Agee.","Brian Wright - Sterne, Agee","Could you size the reinsurance payments you expect to receive in '14 for the public exchanges?","Shawn Guertin","We've currently booked $50 million based on what we know and what we have in experience.","Brian Wright - Sterne, Agee","And then that accelerates in the second half?","Shawn Guertin","Definitely.","Mark Bertolini","That should more than double in the second half that if you just think about the way this operates.","Thomas Cowhey","A transcript of the prepared portion of this call will be posted shortly on the Investor Information section of aetna.com, where you can also find a copy of our updated guidance summary containing details of our guidance metrics, including those that were unchanged and not discussed on this call.","If you have any questions about matters discussed this morning, please feel free to call me or Joe Zubretsky in the Investor Relations office.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Krocheski, you may begin.","Joseph Krocheski - Vice President, Investor Relations, Aetna, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call and Webcast. This is Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna, and with me this morning are Aetna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions. Karen Lynch, Aetna's President, will also join us for the Q&A session.","As a reminder, during this call we will make forward-looking statements, risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we file with The SEC.","We have also provided reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures in our financial supplement and guidance summary. These reconciliations are available on the Investor Information section of aetna.com. Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Thank you, Joe, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning Aetna reported first quarter operating earnings of $2.30 per share, a good start to the year and a continuation of the strong momentum from 2015, where we generated record annual operating revenue and operating earnings.","Underlying our first quarter performance, we exceeded our previous membership projections, ending the quarter with approximately 23 million medical members. We grew operating revenue to a quarterly record of $15.7 billion. We achieved pre-tax operating margins at the high end of our targeted range and we generated approximately $1.8 billion in operating cash flow.","Given our strong start to 2016, today we made several adjustments to our full year 2016 guidance. We established a year-end medical membership projection of approximately 23 million members. We now project we will generate up to $63 billion of operating revenue, up from our previous projection of approximately $62 billion, and we increased our operating EPS projection to a range of $7.90 to $8.10 per share, up from our previous projection of at least $7.75.","In a few moments, Shawn will discuss our first quarter results and updated 2016 guidance in greater detail. But first, I would like to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights for the quarter.","Beginning with the Humana acquisition, our integration teams are thoughtfully planning for a combined organization that delivers on our synergy and accretion goals and maximizes the transformational nature of this combination. We continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice and work with state regulators, and now have approvals in six states remaining. Based on our progress to date, we believe we remain on track to close in the second half of 2016.","Moving on to first quarter operational highlights. We had another strong quarter of growth in our Medicare business, with membership growth across all products. Our compelling product design and industry-leading STAR ratings continue to resonate with Medicare consumers, as evidenced by our 9% sequential individual MA membership growth, which once again exceeded overall Medicare Advantage program growth. In total, including Medicare Supplement, we have grown to serve 127,000 additional Medicare medical members in the first quarter, capping another strong annual election period for the company.","Medicare Advantage remains an important growth lever for Aetna and we are encouraged by the relative stability and funding for the 2017 plan year. However, we are concerned with a few of the changes outlined in the 2017 final rate notice, including the rate cuts to the employer group waiver program and the potential disruption in benefits for the millions of beneficiaries who rely on this important program.","This is particularly concerning in 2018, when the rate cuts are fully phased in. We will continue to work with CMS to refine the employer group payment methodology for 2018 to appropriately reflect the differences between employer group and individual plans. Additionally, CMS changes to the MA STAR ratings program and risk adjustment mechanism for dual eligible beneficiaries add unnecessary complexity to STAR ratings and instability in the risk adjustment program. Despite the challenges posed by the group MA payment changes, we remain committed to providing value to our employer customers by delivering high quality, affordable options for their retirees.","Continuing on with our Government business, our Medicaid franchise delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth and underwriting margin performance. Aetna now serves over 2.3 million Medicaid members, an increase of nearly 230,000 from the same period a year ago. This steady growth has been driven by a combination of new contract wins, county expansions in existing states and ACA-related expansion membership. Looking to the future, we are confident that Aetna is well-positioned to take advantage of the strong growth dynamics of the Medicaid business as more states seek to partner with the private sector to manage the health of their Medicaid beneficiaries.","Let me take a moment to discuss public exchanges and our individual business. From a regulatory perspective, we welcome the efforts of CMS to work with the industry to stabilize the individual public exchange program. While we are encouraged by these regulatory efforts, there is still much work to be done to ensure the long-term future of this program. As we enter the third year of the public exchange program, we are committed to working constructively with the administration and lawmakers to find solutions that can improve this program, stabilize the risk pool and expand product flexibility, all with the goal of creating a sustainable program that makes health care more affordable and accessible for all consumers.","Turning to our first quarter individual commercial results. We ended the first quarter with approximately 1.2 million total individual members, exceeding our previous membership projection. The overall demographic composition of our membership is largely consistent with last year and our expectations. While it is still early, we are encouraged by our year-to-date performance and believe we remain on track to achieve our 2016 operating margin improvement goals in these products.","Finally, our stated mission is to create a healthier world. Our strategy to achieve this mission in part involves working to transform the health care system model to one in which hospitals and doctors are rewarded for delivering real value to patients and consumers. Our differentiated approach focuses on meeting providers where they are in terms of their readiness for varying levels of coordinated care and risk. We are applying our proven framework to support the advancement of value-based care models and move providers up the continuum from simple pay-for-performance models to ACOs and even joint ventures.","We've made good progress in the first quarter and now have 77 ACO agreements and approximately 40% of our claims payments running through some form of value-based care model. Based on our progress to date, we believe we remain on track to achieve our 2020 goal of 75% of claims in value-based care models and our broad mission of creating a healthier world.","In summary, we are off to a good start to 2016. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders. With the momentum from the first quarter, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in a changing health care marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy, we will successfully close and integrate the proposed Humana acquisition and we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10.","I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who'll provide additional insight into our first quarter results and our updated 2016 outlook. Shawn?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we reported first quarter 2016 operating earnings of $811 million and operating earnings per share of $2.30. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins.","I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our Medical membership of 23 million is approximately 200,000 higher than the top end of our previously projected range, driven by lower ASC losses and higher individual membership growth. We grew operating revenue by 4% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of $15.7 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership declines in our group commercial insured products.","From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pre-tax operating margin was 9.5%, a very strong result and consistent with the high end of our target operating margin range. Our first quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 80.5%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable prior years reserve developments. Our operating expense ratio was 18%, a 40 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2015 and a good start to achieving our operating cost goals for the year.","From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior years reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to fourth quarter 2015 dates of service.","Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days claims payable were 57 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of approximately two days. The increase in days claims payable was primarily a result of increased processing times, which we expect will normalize over the remainder of the year.","Turning to cash flow and capital, operating cash flows in the first quarter were strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were approximately 2.3 times operating earnings, driven by strong operating results and the timing of certain ACA-related payments in the quarter. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter due to the proposed Humana acquisition. However, we did return $87 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. I will now discuss the key drivers of our first quarter performance in greater detail.","Beginning with our commercial business, our commercial ASC membership declined by approximately 660,000 members during the quarter, a disappointing result in absolute terms but an improvement relative to our previous projections. This improvement was driven by increased sales and higher retention rates, a testament to the actions taken to mitigate known customer losses.","From an operating earnings perspective, first quarter Commercial ASC results were a continuation of the strong momentum from 2015, primarily due to strong fee yields. In our Commercial Insured business, we grew membership modestly in the quarter, largely the result of higher individual membership, partially offset by lower small group and international membership.","Our Commercial Medical benefit ratio was 77.8% for the quarter, a good result that benefited from moderate medical cost trends and favorable prior year's reserve development. Based on first quarter results, we continue to project that our 2016 core Commercial Medical cost trends will be in the range of 6% to 7%.","With respect to our Individual Commercial business, we are off to a solid start to the year. At 1.2 million members, our first quarter medical membership exceeded our previous projections, primarily related to on-exchange membership growth. And underwriting margins were largely consistent with our expectations, driven by favorable reserve development and stable estimates of 3R accruals.","Looking ahead to the balance of 2016, we expect that our first quarter will mark the high for our individual membership as we project material attrition through the remainder of the year and a lower level of special election period enrollment compared to prior years.","Based on our first quarter results, including updated reconciliation estimates for ACA programs, we believe we are on track to achieve our projected 2016 margin improvement goals for these products.","Shifting to our Government business, which continues to be a key source of growth for the company. We grew medical membership by nearly 150,000 members in the quarter, including growth of 81,000 in Medicare Advantage; 46,000 in Medicare Supplement; and 22,000 in Medicaid members. Additionally, we grew Medicare PDP membership sequentially by over 470,000 members. As a result of this strong medical membership growth, we grew our first quarter 2016 Government premiums by over 13% compared to the prior-year period, achieving a record $6.5 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total healthcare premiums. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 83.4%, a continuation of the outstanding results achieved in this business in 2015 and a very good start to the year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At March 31, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 32% as we continue to build cash ahead of closing the Humana acquisition. Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with approximately $420 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $715 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. And after other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $970 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was approximately 351 million at March 31.","As a result of our first quarter performance, we are increasing our 2016 operating earnings-per-share guidance to a range of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. The top end of this range represents a $0.35 increase relative to our previous projection of at least $7.75 per share and reflects our favorable first quarter operating performance, including the effect of favorable prior years reserve development and improved results in our fee-based businesses.","However, certain risks remain that temper our outlook at this point in the calendar, including the ever-present concern that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected, and low visibility at this juncture of the year into our ability to achieve our margin improvement goals in our ACA-compliant products, particularly the uncertainty related to accruals associated with the 3Rs.","Our updated 2016 guidance is influence by the following additional drivers. Based on our first quarter membership results, we project that our year-end Medical membership will be approximately 23 million members as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including attrition in our Individual products.","As we consider the stronger than projected start to the year, and our current membership view, we are increasing our operating revenue projection for the year and now project that we will deliver up to $63 billion dollars in 2016 operating revenue. We continue to project that our full year total medical benefit ratio will be in the range of 81.6% plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to project that our operating expense ratio will be less than 18.5% for the full year. We now project pre-tax operating margin to be 8% to 8.5%, consistent with our high single-digit target. We now project operating earnings of approximately $2.8 billion dollars and we now project excess cash flow to the parent of up to $2.4 billion dollars, reflecting our Vitality Re VII reinsurance transaction partially offset by increased capital requirements as a result of our higher premium growth projections.","Finally, as we consider the progression of earnings for the remainder of the year, we expect our operating EPS to be more evenly balanced between the first and second half of the year as compared to 2015.","In closing, we are encouraged by the strength of our first quarter results and our improved 2016 outlook, particularly at this early stage in the year. Further, we continue to believe we are on track to close the Humana acquisition in the second half of 2016 and achieve our 2018 combined company operating EPS goal of at least $11.","I will now turn the call back over to Joe. Joe?","Joseph Krocheski - Vice President, Investor Relations, Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions.","Operator, the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just want to delve into cost trends. There seems to be a little bit of a debate brewing. We're seeing pretty good numbers from some of the facility companies and med tech companies, et cetera. And it sounded like everything you said was favorable development, cost trends remain modest, confirming the full year. So it doesn't seem like you're seeing it. What do you think's causing some of that disconnect? Is it simply leap year and weather? Where do you stand on this sort of utilization? Is there really any fundamental increase going on?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Josh, we're not seeing an increase on the facility side at all. As a matter of fact, we continue to see a trend downward in facility day usage. And so our view would be that this is probably related to a few instances, most likely related to flu. And maybe leap year. I mean, leap year is always a mystical thing for me. One day actually makes a difference, but it does. But we're not seeing it at all in our numbers.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, Josh, and I would add the real issue here is what did we assume in pricing versus what we actually experienced. And for example, last year trend was up but we had assumed that in our forward pricing and so we were okay. We came into this year with a 50 basis point increase in our forward pricing, so that's in the system. We've booked first quarter consistent with that as well. So, again, I think this does come back to the match between your pricing assumption and what you see in the marketplace because certainly over the last year or two, trend has been going up and I would emphasize Mark's point about it sounds funny sometimes to talk about leap year, but it is a real phenomenon when you do have an extra weekday in a quarter. It obviously does make enough of a difference to show up.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Is that 80 basis points on the MLR seem like a reasonable leap year estimate?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, I mean our internal estimates are a little bit lower than that, but it's all about whether this is weekday-driven or calendar day-driven in terms of the range that you'd look at this.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then just a quick follow up. Shawn, your last comment on first half versus second half EPS. I think you're implying it's sort of a mid-point of guidance, something around $1.70 in EPS for the second quarter if it's really 50-50. What's causing this additional seasonality? Why is more of the earnings back-end loaded this year?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","I'm glad you asked because the first half will definitely be over 50% as it has been in the year. My commentary there was just to indicate that, as a percentage, first half will be down a little bit from the first half last year based on our internal forecast.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So a percent or two, not necessarily a 50-50 split now?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Exactly.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question come from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Maybe just to ask about your Government business. The MLR in the quarter was up and you're pointing to lower prior-year development. I guess there's also the fact that your Part D business grew dramatically and my understanding is that could be a drag in the first quarter that then turns to a positive as the year progresses and you also have leap year on the government side. Were those less of a factor than what happened in prior-year development? And maybe while we're on it, my sort of follow up would be on the Government side. You guys are doing very well in the MA enrollment so far, but the overall market's been a little bit soft. Any thoughts on what's happening in the broader markets out there in MA?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","I'll let Mark talk about the MA outlook for the industry. But, you're right. You've really sort of canvassed the multiple factors that are impacting the government MBR, specifically on PYD. We had talked last year and actually the year before that that a lot of the higher than typical PYD we've gotten has been showing up in the Government business and we did expect that to reset to more normal levels this year, and, indeed, that is what we've seen. Again on Medicaid specifically, we've been talking about the Kentucky rate reset, which has an MBR perspective, and you talked about both leap year and Part D. So we did expect this to go up, and again, I think at 83 4%, I'd say it's a very good result and one very consistent with our expectations.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, A.J., as it relates to the MA outlook, I think what we continue to see is that in the retiring population \u2013 11,000 Americans a day, still 68% of the population is electing for Medicare fee-for-service. And a large part about that is, network construction, but most importantly mobility. And we see that as an opportunity as we get to closing the Humana acquisition where we have the opportunity to create a nationally portable product as we will be able to touch a much larger swath of the Medicare-eligible population across the United States.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just a few quick ones. The first, could you give us the actual on-exchange Individual enrollment for the first quarter?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","It's 911,000.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, Shawn, just wanted to think a little bit more about the prior year development. Obviously you disclosed the gross impact of that, but over the course of the quarters of 2015 you were also giving some color on kind of the net impact, and I think we had estimated maybe roughly $0.40 of net benefit in the first quarter of 2015. Would you comment on 2016 and would you alter my first quarter 2015 thought in any way?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","That's in the neighborhood of being correct. For first quarter 2016, it's between $0.30 and $0.35. And probably closer to $0.30. And so the thing that we net against that obviously is the amount of any PYD that goes right back up in minimum loss ratio accruals. That was a little higher this year just in terms of how the PYD fell, but you can think about $0.30 to $0.35 as a range for this year.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And is it fair to say Commercial PYD may be developed better than your expectation? I know you had anticipated PYD would be less of a net benefit in 2016. You talked about there was a little bit less on the Government side but overall, this is fairly similar. So it sounds like maybe Commercial actually ended up a little better?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Commercial's just a little bit better, sort of an aggregate PYD year-over-year, but it's in the same neighborhood in a typical neighborhood. The decrease really is really in the Government business.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. My last question. On Medicaid, with the Pennsylvania reprocurement out yesterday, it looks like you've lost some regions and we're kind of sizing roughly $1 billion revenue impact for 2017. Is that in the ballpark?","Karen S. Lynch - President","As you know, they came out. We are disappointed in the bid and that is approximately the revenue for Pennsylvania. So that's pretty close.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I'm wondering if you can help us understand how value-based contracting is changing some of the dynamics around what we see as normalized trend and what you might see as normalized cost trend, and if it varies by the different business categories, Commercial, Medicare or Medicaid?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Peter, I would say if you've seen one value-based contract, you've seen one value-based contract. I think it's a pretty general definition, and so they go everywhere from contracts that pay for better performance without any downside risk all the way to contracts where we're actually sharing risk top and bottom with providers. And I would say the closer we get to the latter kind of structure, the more impact we have on utilization. And so in our relationships where we have that, we see definite impacts on underlying trend and utilization where the provider actually wins by providing a more focused quality of care and generates margin out of the contract based on that.","Now also I would also give another vector, which is between Commercial and Government. The numbers obviously in Government are much larger from the standpoint of premiums, so there's more to share there. And so therefore you have a lot more opportunity in the Government sector; so we always like to lead with Medicare. Medicaid duals is still sort of a fuzzy area we're still working through and understanding what the dynamics are there. And Commercial is generally lower on the totem pole from the standpoint of risk share opportunity as you move into those contracts.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And would you say it's causing some of your utilization to become more concentrated with certain providers that perhaps do these contracts? Like perhaps some of the more publicly traded companies on the provider side that we see?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Not quite yet. I don't think we have that much of an impact yet. I think still what we're seeing in trend moderation is the impacts on the economy on individuals and their out-of-pocket spend. $400 out of the average American to cover for services is a lot of money.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that all callers limit themselves to one question so that others may also ask their question. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Hi. Good morning. I was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit more detail on your individual book and the exchange lives. I heard you say 911,000 on exchange. I apologize just off my fingertips I don't have the year-end number for 2015. But also 1.2 million for your overall individual book versus I think about 1 million at year end. So is it about 200,000? And where do the new members, where do you think they're coming from geographically and plan-wise, and what's giving you comfort that you're going to be able to reach your break-even margin target?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","I'll turn it to Karen to talk about the dynamics of some of the marketplaces, but so you're right, Matt. We're up about 200,000, a little bit less than that, sequentially. Year-over-year, we're actually down a little bit. We were at 1.275 million, I think, in the first quarter of last year. So we're at a similar level at the end of the first quarter. But it is up about 200,000.","Karen S. Lynch - President","Relative to the markets, we are seeing the growth in the markets where we have very good cost structure, particularly in the Southeast. So Florida was a big growth for us, now Georgia and North Carolina as well. We saw about 55% coming in from new business and, generally speaking, we have 75% of our membership in our top five states.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And on the margin outlook, with this influx of new membership in light of the instability of financial results on the exchanges, how are you getting or seeking to get comfortable on that front?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Well, Matt, what we do know is the demographics of the new entrants look very similar to the demographics that we've had, so that doesn't look like a change. Again, I think I'll remind everyone our goal was to get this to approximately breakeven this year, so we're not trying to get this all the way up to a target margin level. And in terms of what we saw in the first quarter, what I would say is as we looked at 2015 continue to develop, whether that be prior year reserve development, risk adjuster estimates and things like that, all of those estimates look good and either have held or improved a little bit. So that makes me feel good about the baseline that we're taking into 2016.","And as Karen mentioned, we're getting the growth in some concentrated markets where we know we have a good solid cost structure, and it would be silly of me to declare victory for the year sort of after the first quarter, but I think the markers that we can see on that business make us feel pretty good about the goal that we set for ourselves for this year.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Thanks. Maybe just following up on MA and the growth you see and particularly thinking actually more about margins though. You got to your target margins a little early last year, and how do the changes in the outlook for 2017 impact that? Particularly the changes to EGWP? Can you continue to maintain or even grow margins while still growing the top line? How have initial conversations been with your commercial or employer clients on the changes to EGWP? Thank you.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So the overall impact to us, Andy, is less than 1% across the whole rating environment. Obviously more on the employer side. We continue to see strength in the employer pipeline on Medicare Advantage. So we haven't seen anybody dissuaded from considering given what the economic dynamics will be for 2017.","More importantly, to cover our contingency on that, we will be launching for 1-1-2017, our own Medicare individual exchange, which will allow employers to make a choice between continuing to offer coverage as a group or putting their employees into an individual product, and we have a lot of interest in that as well as we move into the year. And I'll note that we're on nine other individual Medicare exchanges, but we will be launching our own product 1-1-2017, with the bswift platform and we're excited about the opportunity there to cover our bases on the egg whip changes.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush. Please proceed with your question.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Your guidance implies up to 100 basis points uptick in cost trend and it sounded like hospital costs were in line to maybe a little bit light in some areas. So are you seeing so far this year an uptick in line with your guidance, or is that just expectations for the remainder of the year? And then you guided to pharmacy as a percentage of total going up from about 15% to 20%. So are you seeing that uptick in pharmacy spend so far?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","In terms of the first quarter, just to be clear, I think what we've priced in is about a 50 bp utilization increase in our forward pricing for trend. And again, in the first quarter of the year, we have largely booked consistent with that outlook. And, again, there's a lot of estimation always in this business and in the most recent quarter. So I think we've taken the approach of assuming that it is there in our booking.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","And on the pharmacy side? You guys had guided to an uptick. So if you could speak to if that's happening and what drug categories are driving it?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Well, I mean, the pharmacy trend has been double digits, and I wouldn't say there was anything particularly extraordinary in the first quarter on pharmacy trend that would make me move from that.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","All right. And last clarification. Was there any benefit from the new accounting guidance related to employee-based share payments and can you speak to what that might be once it's implemented?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","We did not implement that in the first quarter. We will obviously evaluate whether we will choose to adopt that early and it would have a fairly minor impact would be our estimate right now. But that remains \u2013 we still need to do the work on that.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.","Great. Thanks. You guys highlighted a couple areas of I guess potential concern or downside being trend and I guess ACA impacts, but just wanted to see if there was \u2013 you didn't highlight any areas of potential upside \u2013 I wasn't sure if there's anything you would highlight there as potential sources of upside or whether you kind of feel like the risk is somehow more skewed to the downside than the upside?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","I wouldn't necessarily say that. I mean, again, I think at this point in the year the pricing is pretty well baked. Your volume is pretty well baked. And so what tends to move these things around more is how does medical cost play out? We've assumed that we're seeing the increase that we've priced for in the first quarter. And how that plays out will ultimately determine sort of the sources of the upside and downside around that.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.","But I guess as far as trend goes and as far as some of the ACA reconciliation 3R type accruals, I mean, do you think there's as much chance that there's upside on those numbers as there is downside? Or is there a reason to say that there's less visibility one way or the other?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","I certainly \u2013 we've tried to be careful around risk adjustment. It's been by far the most difficult thing to estimate on the ACA business, and so I wouldn't ever get out in front of myself and say we're going to have upside there, but given the uncertainty around that estimate, that is certainly a possibility. But we're not banking that that's going to play out wildly in our favor or anything.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.","All right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, there. If you're willing to talk about Humana, could you give us a sense for what you're hoping to see this year, to give you comfort and to make you feel good about where they are?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Humana's still a competitor until we close. So we are engaged in integration conversations with them to the degree we can be without getting in front of the DOJ approvals and state approvals. They'll report next week and we'll let them get their information out. But we are in constant contact with them and continue to believe that our model for the acquisition is a reasonable model.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","With respect to small group, you were hoping to improve your margins there. Could you give us update on whether small group margin improvements on track? Thanks.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's too early.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, it's early. And I think the jury is still out on this and one of, again, to Kevin's question \u2013 the risk adjustment estimates around the ACA portion of this book are one of the swing factors that we still need to get improved clarity. So I certainly wouldn't declare victory at this point.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Wright - Sterne Agee Group Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. It looks like the reinsurance receivable from the 3Rs went down sequentially by about $100 million. Could you help us understand kind of what was driving that and did that have any impact on the quarter?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","The biggest impact of moving that receivable is we did receive an interim payment of a little over $100 million in the first quarter related to prior years. So that's the real reason that the reinsurance receivable went down. Obviously, given the timing, we don't accrue a lot of reinsurance at the beginning of the year in that business.","Brian Wright - Sterne Agee Group Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks. Appreciate you taking the questions. For the MLRs going into 2017, to your point around this is not just about the medical cost trend but it's about the underwriting spread, how are you seeing the pricing environment playing out into 2017 as far as your competitors, some of who are the Blues who are losing money on exchanges? And to what degree are employers likely to tolerate continued increases in pricing? As you say, trends have been going up for the last couple years. I mean if it gets to 7%, 8%, 9%, do you think that'll hold now that exchanges are yet not a viable marketplace?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think for 2017, we continue \u2013 I mean, we're early, obviously, in that cycle. We're still finishing 2016. But the market is rational and probably more rational than it has ever been given the impacts of the ACA on Blues' reserves and our competitors. So I think folks are being much more careful about pricing to trend and making sure that \u2013 and with the stark realization, quite frankly, Ana, that if you get behind on your pricing and you try and buy a share, you just can't catch up in any reasonable time. So I think people are being much more prudent about their pricing.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","And then just on the adjacency with the exchanges. You are getting to break even it sounds like on exchanges this year. So once the reinsurance goes away next year, do you think combined with the price increases from HHS and potentially some cost shifting to employers, that your blended commercial loss ratio should still remain where it is right now, which is a very good result?","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think let's talk about the pricing on the exchanges. With the 2Rs coming off this year, that's a six-point impact on top of trend. So that will have obviously an impact on the exchange enrollment in some way, shape or form and the subsidies coming out of the federal government. We do hope to get to breakeven this year. We're looking forward to the next administration to improve the product as we move ahead.","Let me just give you a different sort of basis to think about our participation in the exchanges. We have 911,000 members on the public exchanges Individual. We have 1.2 million members that are exchange or ACA-compliant. If we were to go out and buy those members, it would cost us somewhere around $1.2 billion to acquire them. If we were to build out 15 markets, it would cost us somewhere between $600 million to $750 million to enter those markets and build out the capabilities necessary to grow that membership.","So in the broad scheme of things, we are well, well below any of those numbers from the standpoint of losses we've incurred in the first two-and-a-half years of this program. And so we see this as a good investment, hoping that we have an administration and a Congress that will allow us to change the product like we change Medicare every year and we change Medicaid every year. But we haven't been able to touch this product because of the politics. But if we get to that point, we believe we are in a very good place to make this a sustainable program.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for the Color, Mark. Very helpful.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mm-hmm.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, there. So question on your Government business, which has been very good in recent years, especially with Fran Soistman at the helm. But Medicaid results, I think, have been spotty here recently with Pennsylvania yesterday being the most recent. And given that this is such a big revenue growth area, is this a stroke of bad luck for you guys? Or maybe something more structural within Aetna? Wonder if you could just give us more of a big-picture kind of discussion on what you guys are doing maybe to kind of either improve things or again maybe this is just a stroke of bad luck? Thanks.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll remind you that we're up 230,000 members year-over-year in the product.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yep.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In Medicaid particularly. I will also say that we win more than we lose. That this is a much more competitive market than it has been in the past. Incumbents have less of a lock on these contracts than they have in the past as state governments struggle to control the costs around Medicaid, looking for innovation. So this is one that we didn't get what we wanted. But we have gotten expansions in other states and expect to grow through the remainder of this year in Medicaid. So I think we're doing just fine. I don't think we need to buy anything. I don't think \u2013 we obviously will do the postmortem on this one and understand why we didn't get it. And we'll learn from that, I'm sure, and we'll make changes. But we're doing just fine in Medicaid.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, as a quick follow up, you guys provided a very helpful earnings waterfall on your last quarter in the slide deck you did for your fourth quarter call. I wonder if you could take the upside to guidance that you put out today and maybe spread it across those buckets? I mean, did the negatives like Kentucky get smaller and the ACA improvements get bigger? Or if you could give us some flavor to that?","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","The two biggest pieces that would make up the increase are the prior-year development, which was obviously excluded from our previous guidance and our improved performed in our fee-based businesses.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, Shawn.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Just actually wanted to follow up on small group, and just interested if you can talk about how the pricing environment is looking in the small group side. Anthem yesterday had cited some increased price competition from one of the nonprofits in California. So just interested if you think that's more sort of isolated and a one-off or if you're seeing any changes in the competitive pricing environment for small group?","Karen S. Lynch - President","Relative to the pricing environment, in California and Colorado and New York, as we had to convert to the ACA, particularly in 51 to 100, there was a lot of volatility in that book. So we saw some competitive pricing in those couple markets. But generally speaking, it's a pretty rational market. We particularly are very focused on our pricing discipline in the 2 to 50 ACA-compliant business, as I've talked about in the past. And as you know, you have to think about small group in kind of three buckets. The 2 to 50, keep what you have, that is a stable performing book for us, and then the 2 to 50 ACA-compliant book where we have been very disciplined around our pricing, and then the 51 to 100 book where the states that did move to the move to the PACE Act, we have been performing well, and that book has been a good performance book for us.","Shawn M. Guertin - CFO, Executive VP & Chief Enterprise Risk Officer","Yeah, Scott, and I would emphasize, the one piece of that book, the small-group ACA business, which we've talked a lot about, we have very consciously been careful about expanding into that space in advance of sort of keep what you have coming off. There is an awful lot of moving parts in there. So we've been very deliberate with our pricing to be as careful as we can in advance of that.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And just had a quick follow-up just on the exchanges and just relative to the markets where you're seeing the growth. North Carolina and Georgia have definitely been pretty tough markets for some of the competitors there, and BCBS North Carolina has put out some warnings they may consider exiting the exchange given the huge losses that they've generated. So just interested proactively maybe how you're trying to position given the growth in those two markets to protect against some of the potential loss dynamics that some of the competition have seen there.","Karen S. Lynch - President","We've been doing \u2013 obviously, we continue to evaluate and assess our network and our contracting efforts around those markets. The second thing that we've been doing is very deliberate medical management actions. And then the third thing that we are doing is making sure that we're focused on risk adjuster. And so we are in the middle of pricing for 2017 right now, so we're being very conscious of the dynamics in each of the marketplaces that we're playing in.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. I think your Commercial ASC membership was under some pressure because of some large accounts that moved to slicing, and wondered if those were one-off decisions or if you expect that trend to persist? And then on the lower end of, say, large group, are you continuing to see case sizes look at self-funding and convert from full risk to self-funding, and are you keeping those accounts when they do?","Karen S. Lynch - President","So on your second part of your question, yes, we are seeing interest. We are seeing accounts move to ASC, and we have been keeping them. Relative to your first question, I would say there's continued interest in the ASC book. We expect the market to continue to move that way in 2017 as well.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Towards slicing of jumbo accounts?","Karen S. Lynch - President","Towards slicing of jumbo accounts, yes.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question today will come from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to come back to some comments Mark had made a few minutes ago with regard to the need for some structural reforms with regard to the ACA exchanges and the membership there. I guess first question is, do you think these structural reforms could be done administratively without Congress? And then the follow up is if you don't get these structural reforms, if we look out a year or two, is the market sustainable? Thank you.","Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think the kinds of structural changes that we need to make, I think Secretary Burwell and her team at CMS and HHS have done a really good job of using the regulatory framework that they can to try and improve the program in the short term here. But there are bigger structural changes that need to made around product flexibility, rating flexibility, pooling. We need different pools, not one pool. Cross subsidizing at the premium level across a large swath of the population doesn't work. It needs to be multiple pools with specific products for each pool. All of that requires legislative response. And that's not going to happen in the near term here.","We will see the dynamics of the market get tougher as we go forward if we don't get those kinds of structural changes. How it affects us versus others, quite frankly, we've been very careful to choose the markets we're in, as Karen noted earlier. We look for the right cost structure, we offer the kinds of products that we believe people need, but at some point, unless we make these kind of changes, the market will be challenged.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thanks a lot.","Joseph Krocheski - Vice President, Investor Relations, Aetna, Inc.","Thank you, Chris. A transcript of the prepared portion of this call will be posted shortly on the Investor Information section of aetna.com, where you can also find a copy of our updated guidance summary containing details of our guidance metrics, including those that were unchanged or not discussed on this call.
