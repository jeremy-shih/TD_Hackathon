Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you, Richard and good morning, everyone. Before I get started on our third quarter results, I'd like to take the time to think and express my appreciation to our entire Oxy family in prevailing through Hurricane Harvey. We had hundreds of family members that were displaced due to the storm or experienced serious damage to their homes and personal possessions. Even in the face of this destruction, we were able to operate one of our assets safely and we have returned our business to normal operating rates. The teamwork across our organization was incredible.","Oxy employers that were need of assistance received help from all parts of our organization from the Permian and chemical sites throughout the U.S., through our international employees who provided assistance from the Middle East and Colombia. I have never seen such unity among all of the parts of our organization and from our retirees. This storm was devastating to our Texas Gulf Coast community, but our organization was prepared for the storm and its aftermath. The financial impact would have been weighted without our team's efforts to enact our business continuity plans and manage the business during and after the storm. Times like this made me really proud to be part of this organization.","I will now share some third quarter highlights on Slide 5, and then I'll provide an update on our progress towards our cash flow breakeven plan. Let's start with our most recent well result. While I don't want to steal this thunder from Jody, we've had some real exciting results in Southeast New Mexico. We attribute these new basin-leading well results through our value-based development approach. We're confident in our ability to sustain these results as well as in our ability to reach and surpass our breakeven growth targets of 80,000 BOE per day in Permian Resources. ","I'd also like to highlight the improvements we've made to our Seminole-San Andres CO2 unit. Since acquiring the asset in August, we've been able to increase our throughput capacity of the plant by 10%, which has enabled us to increase gross production by 2,300 BOE per day. We not only got a great asset, we got great people as well. Their integration into our plant and field operations teams has created the strong group that is already ahead of our plan. And I can assure you, the leaders of our field and plant teams don't set easy targets. Those teams are energized and performing at a very high level.","Despite the impact of Harvey, chemicals had a strong quarter, generating $200 million in segment income. We received our first dividend from the Ingleside Ethylene Cracker JV, and our team continues to capture additional margin along the chloro vinyl chain. We expect this trend to continue due to improving industry fundamentals as well as a tighter supply market in the near term due to Hurricane Harvey.","Turning to Slide 6. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, we will include this slide each quarter to update you on our progress towards our goal of cash flow neutrality at $40 WTI and breakeven at $50 WTI. This means we'll cover the dividend and the production sustaining capital within operating cash flow at $40 WTI, and at $50 WTI we'll be able to generate 5% to 8% production growth. ","As you might expect from Harvey negatively impacted our progress for the quarter. Even since so, all of our assets and teams showed progress towards their targets. Slide 7 illustrates this progress. We have included the annualized cash flow impact of $200 million for Harvey in the first gray column. This cash flow impact is a one-time event. And as I just mentioned, in the chemicals business, we received our first dividend payment of $55 million from our Ingleside Cracker JV. This included catchup for the prior quarter. We expect the ongoing quarterly dividend to average $30 million to $40 million.","The remainder of chemicals target will be able to achieve that after the 4CPe repurchase plan comes online in the fourth quarter of this year. ","In the midstream business, we benefited from a wider Midland to Gulf Coast spreads, averaging $2.61 per barrel during the quarter. This exceeded our expectations. The segment has achieved over $200 million in annualized cash flow improvement. Additional milestones to achieve our midstream target of $300 million included the Al Hosn expansion and maximizing throughput at our Ingleside Crude Terminal.","In the Permian Resources business, we grew 1,000 BOE pretty sequentially, net of the 4,200 BOE per day that we divested as of August 1. We expect our growth rate to increase substantially in the coming quarters as we have accelerated our activity. Jody will give additional guidance on the timing of new wells coming online. ","Finally, with respect to the improvements beyond our initial plan, the chemicals in the EOR businesses are experiencing operational end market improvements. Chemicals continue to capitalize on a strong pricing environment. Caustic soda prices, the primary profitability driver, have increased by approximately 14% since the first quarter of 2017. This price improvement equates to $120 million in annualized cash flow improvement. ","In the EOR business, we'll continue to improve the operations of the Seminole-San Andres CO2 unit, and expect to achieve the cost reductions of $5 to $10 per BOE that we previously mentioned. We are pleased with the progress we've made and we'll continue to communicate incremental progress towards our pathway to breakeven.","My final slide quantifies the liquidity we have available to fund the gap between cash flow from operations and the capital needed to achieve our goal. I'd like to remind you that our preliminary capital budget for 2018 is in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion as presented in Slide 8. ","At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.8 billion of cash as well as PAGP units with a market value of approximately $600 million. Since WTI has averaged closer to $50 during 2017, we added an additional bullet to this slide to how a smaller cash modems that of less than $2 billion.","We plan to manage our portfolio to contribute an additional $500 million to ensure we bridge the cash gap if prices average $40 through 2018. So to be clear, even with an average oil price of $40 versus 2018, we have sufficient cash and liquidity to cover sustaining capital and the dividend while also funding our path to our $50 breakeven at WTI price.","I'll now turn the call over to Cedric Burgher.","Cedric Burgher","Thanks, Vicki. Jody will cover our step-change in a in Permian well results, so I will address financial address updated guidance. We present our third quarter results on Slide 10, and I'd like to start recovering on a production results. ","Total reported an ongoing production was 600,000 BOEs per day, which came in at the low end of our guidance range. Reported production was impacted by Hurricane Harvey, also third-party downtime in Columbia in the Middle East and downtime at the Permian EOR plant. The Permian Resources production came in within our guidance range at 139,000 BOEs per day despite losing about 1,000 BOEs per day from the impacts of Hurricane Harvey. Permian and EOR production was 150,000 BOEs per day at the end -- at the high-end of our guidance range. Higher Permian EOR volumes sequentially reflect the successful integration of the Seminole-San Andres CO2 unit, and we expect to capture additional production volumes with the increased gas plant throughput. International production came in at 303,000 BOEs per day, which included the highest quarterly production rate at Al Hosn Gas of 76,000 BOEs per day.","Third quarter reported EPS was $0.25 per share and core EPS was $0.18. Quarterly EPS improved sequentially despite the impacts of Hurricane Harvey. Improvements in the oil and gas segment were mainly attributed to lower operating cost of $0.61 per BOE and to higher NGL prices by $1.83 per BOE. ","Domestic operating costs for the quarter were $13.23 per BOE versus $13.55 in the second quarter, and they continue to stream lower. Permian Resources operating costs have averaged 3% lower year-to-date versus the 2016 average, and we expect these cost to trend lower with our production ramp-up.","Operating cash flow improved sequentially as well to nearly $1.1 billion. The improvements to operating cash flow where maybe attributed to incorporation of the Seminole-San Andres CO2 unit in the Permian EOR as well as receipt for cash distributions from the ethylene cracker joint venture. ","We spent approximately $950 million our capital program during the third quarter, and we expect to spend roughly $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter with total year capital spend expected to be at all our $3.6 billion capital budget. Additionally, we expect to come in at the midpoint of our previously stated $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion capital range for the Permian Resources in 2017.","With respect to our effective tax rate, the lower Q3 rate was mostly driven by our international assets. There are 2 primary reasons here. First, in Qatar, we were able to reduce operating costs by approximately $20 million -- and our production sharing contract allowed us to take 100% of that savings to the bottom line without additional tax. Second, we are recovering an additional $11 million related to our former business in Iraq with no associated foreign tax. In addition to those items, there were some smaller domestic items, which had some benefit in the net benefit in the quarter.","OxyChem's third quarter earnings of $200 million were better-than-expected considering the $60 million impact of Hurricane Harvey. Favorable pricing and plan operations and lower raw material costs prior to the hurricane partially offset the negative impact the storm had on chloro vinyl production and plant maintenance. ","We have updated several slides on our chemicals business in the appendix, including additional information on the 4CPe plant which will come online during the fourth quarter. ","Midstream's third quarter came in within our guidance range excluding the impact of Hurricane Harvey and lower equity income from our investment in the planes pipeline. The business experienced exceptional performance during Harvey and achieved the highest monthly loading rates at our oil terminal in September. We included additional information on our Midstream business in the appendix as well, including a slide with our outlook for Midland to Gulf Coast spreads. ","On Slide 11, you can see that we continue to have ample liquidity to fund our breakeven plan with a cash balance of $1.8 billion. While our cash flow from operations is currently at a deficit to our capital expenditures and dividends, we expect this gap to narrow in the coming quarters and to be on balance by the end of 2018 at $50 WTI while our assets are generation -- generating production growth. ","Let me reiterate what Vicki said in regards to liquidity. We forecast our cash deficit to be less than $200 million through the completion of our plan, assuming average WTI prices of $50. ","Furthermore, our business is approximately 50% exposed to the Brent benchmark, which gives us additional support if that spread continues to hold at current levels. We have provided updated guidance on Slide 12. We have maintained the bottom end of our full year 2017 ongoing production guidance at 597,000 BOEs per day while lowering the top end of our guidance to 599,000 BOEs per day. Our updated full year guidance reflects actual third quarter production results and accounts for items particularly to the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we will carry out the Seminole-San Andres planned turnaround to further optimize operations, and EOR will be impacted by a planned third-party pipeline maintenance activity. Jody will cover our improved visibility on our fourth quarter ramp-up and exit rate with information on our new wells and drilling progress. ","Given the improved results in the Greater Sand Dunes development area, we are excited by the trajectory of production heading into 2018. Permian Resources total year production guidance has been narrowed to 141,000 to 144,000 BOEs per day. We expect fourth quarter production in Permian Resources to be approximately 30% higher than fourth quarter 2016. ","My final point on our oil and gas segment is that we have lowered our annual domestic OpEx guidance from approximately $14 per BOE to $13.50 per BOE as these costs are trending lower due to our highly -- productive wells.","Moving on to other areas of our business. Fourth quarter guidance for chemicals is $190 million, which accounts for the seasonality in the business, is due to lower construction activity. Midstream is expected to generate more income sequentially in the range of $60 million to $80 million. The business expects to benefit from wider Midland to Gulf Coast marketing spreads as well as wider Gulf Coast to Brent spreads, which enhances our export margins.","Lastly, I would like to remind you of our commitment to our returns-focused strategy. Last quarter, we told you that we will be increasing the amount of compensation that is tied to returns or return on capital employed metrics. Our minimum hurdle rates are 15% after-tax in the United States and 20% internationally, which we believe will result in leading full cycle returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Jody.","Joseph Elliott","Thank you, Cedric, and good morning, everyone. And thank you, Vicki for your restraint during your opening highlights on our well results in the Permian. Thanks to our team's efforts, we had some basin-leading well results to share with you. Across our domestic business, we're delivering more production with less cost to generate growth and value towards our breakeven plan. As Vicki mentioned, we attribute this success to our differentiated value-based development approach. Our Permian Resources New Mexico team delivered record-breaking well results across multiple benches in the Greater Sand Dunes area as shown on Slide 14. During the quarter, our team put on a total of 7 wells in the Greater Sand Dunes area with 30-day production rates that averaged approximately 3,750 BOE per day. 3 of these wells ranked in the top 15 all-time best wells in the Permian basin based on 30-day BOE per day. ","Our Cedar Canyon 23 24 Fed 32H achieved a peak rate of 6,497 barrels of oil equivalent which is the highest 24-hour peak rate recorded in the Permian Basin. These record results span to second Bone Spring, the third Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp X-Y, which makes the Greater Sand Dunes area extremely attractive from a full-cycle returns perspective. Our engineered approach gives us confidence in the repeatability of these results across the 2,000 remaining undeveloped locations in the Greater Sand Dunes area. We've not yet incorporated this improvement into our Permian Resources inventory counts, but we expect to breakevens to improve by $5 to $10 in the Greater Sand Dunes area.","While the focus of Slide 14 is our Greater Sand Dunes develop area, our Texas Delaware team also delivered Oxy record wells in the Wolfcamp B, and the second Bone Spring and our Greater Barilla Draw area, which are highlighted in our appendix on Slide 27. ","Our step-change and well performance as a result of ongoing subsurface characterization and customized well designs to maximize the potential of our plate-leading asset. In fact, our teams are studying results from surveillance to make additional improvements across the basin. In addition to these stellar productivity results, we saw improvements on the cost side. OpEx decreased 7% from a year ago to $7.61 per BOE during the quarter, and well costs continue to trend approximately flat as operating efficiencies and offset inflationary pressure from service and materials providers.","On Slide 15, we provide visibility on the timing of wells online for our production ramp over the next 3 quarters. As a reminder, we added 4 Permian Resources rigs very late in the second quarter. We'll begin to place the majority of the segmental wells online in the fourth quarter with peak rates reach late in the year and into the first quarter. We'll also shift more activity to Greater Sand Dunes, increasing wells online in the second quarter of '18 to 26 from the 7 in the current quarter. We'll ship 1 to 2 rigs to the Greater Sand Dunes area at the beginning of 2018, while maintaining a total of 11 operated rigs. ","Our Permian Resources production in the third quarter grew modestly due to divestitures and third-party impacts from Hurricane Harvey. We expect to see strong growth in the fourth quarter and into 2018 that will generate the cash flow that Oxy needs for the breakeven unit plan. ","As well results continue to improve and the number of new wells on production increase, we're extremely confident in our ability to deliver on Oxy's cash flow breakeven plan. The plan we have laid out will result in a growth rate above 30% in 2018. ","Finally, I'd like to speak to the immediate success we've had in capturing value from our EOR acquisition. We became operator of the Seminole-San Andres unit on September 1, and have applied our technical know-how to achieve operational improvements. By optimizing the CO2 throughput of the plant, our team increased the field's production by 2,300-gross BOEs per day. This was 1 component of our operating cost improvement plan, and we're confident in further improvements in our plan to achieve $5 to $10 per BOE and OpEx reduction. Our newly-integrated team is energized with innovative ideas to continue to improve the asset. ","I'll now turn the call back to Vicki.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you, Jody. Now I'd like to update you on a change we've made to our leadership team. Rob Peterson, who had served as President of OxyChem since August of 2014, was appointed Business Area Director in our Permian EOR business in mid-September this year. Rob did an exceptional job in Chemicals, but I'd know this I noticed that he also provided great input during our strategic meetings. So we felt that it will be beneficial for the company and for Rob to have them to spend some time in our EOR business. Rob was instrumental in OxyChem's success, and we anticipate to staying positive impact within EOR and oil and gas. Rob holds a Bachelor's Degree in the Chemical Engineering and an MBA in Corporate Finance from the University of Florida. ","Rob was replaced by BJ Hebert who is on the call with us today. BJ is now President of OxyChem. BJ joined OxyChem in 1991 from Vista Chemicals, and has 30-plus years of industry experience. He knows the chemicals business exceptionally well, and brings a wealth of strategic insight and passion for safety, environmental stewardship and success. BJ's most recent role was Senior Vice President of Basic Chemicals, and he was previously Vice President and General Manager of Oxley vinyls. BJ holds a Bachelors Degree in Chemical Engineering from Merkley State University, and an MBA from Southend Methodist University.","I'd like to close by reiterating the timeline for achieving our production growth targets. We expect to add the 80,000 BOE per day by the end of 2018. We are excited about the trajectory of production growth in the upcoming quarters, which will begin with a large rampup of Permian Resources well completions in the fourth quarter and the step-change in well results to materially derisk the timeline for achieving the 80,000 BOE per day.","Our teams are focused across our organization to meet and exceed our plan targets in the oil and gas, chemicals and midstream businesses. And finally, we ended the quarter with ample cash on the balance sheet and have liquidity to fully fund our plan while paying the growing dividend. ","We'll now open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","My first question is -- you planned to support the 5% to 8% growth at 50 and funded yield at 40 -- is well understood. How does the higher oil price factoring the model? Meaning, do you use excess cash flow to accelerate the timing to reach our model via permitting resources growth? Or do you return cash to shareholders or further bolster the cash bridge to the model? How does that -- if we could talk to those pieces, if you could.","Vicki Hollub","Yes. Specifically, the plan is for us in 2018 to lock into our capital plan of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. We plan to present the final numbers to our board in December and get approval for the plan for 2018. Then we'll update you on what those specifics are. So we'll be outspending cash flow again but as we said, we had the liquidity to get there. Once we achieved the milestone of breakeven at $50, any excess cash that we have a beyond that really depends on what the situation is. But our cash flow priorities are always to pay our maintenance capital first, followed by dividend. And in today's world, with the opportunities we have for organic growth -- the organic growth is our third priority. Beyond that, it would be acquisitions and the share repurchases. So we always, when we have excess cash, we want to make sure that we assess the situation and the opportunities to make the best decision to deliver value to the shareholders.","Evan Calio","And second, if I could, the Greater Sand Dunes' performance is really the highlight of the quarter. Could you maybe walk us through what specifically is driving the step-change improvement in well performance? And are there any costs associated with improvements, targeting and subsurface -- is there -- any color there would be helpful.","Joseph Elliott","Evan, good morning, this is Jody. You hit the high points there. It's really about improve subsurface characterization, which is leading us to better targeting wells to maximize kind of the value recovery from these assets. So it's a culmination of what we've been talking about for a long time -- value-based development, but that again leads to better targeting, better assimilation designs. And what's interesting in these well results is that the sand-loading for these wells is below what you probably find on average in the industry. So from a capital efficiency standpoint, I think that -- it argues even more how confident we are about this growth plan and how much cash we can contribute to the breakeven plan that Vicki has outlined.","Evan Calio","Maybe just as a follow-up, if I could. I mean how representative do expect these results are across your 2,000 locations -- while it might be early, any thoughts there?","Joseph Elliott","We think it's very representative. We continue to do appraisal work in other areas of Greater Sand Dunes. What's also exciting about this as is it's across 3 benches, not just 1 bench. I think the other color is -- this is done in an area that's more of a brownfield development, where there are legacy wells that we're having to manage -- offset wells and shut-in wells to avoid implications. As we move into 2018, we move into more of a greenfield area.","We're able to take advantage of the latest generation of our field development plan and we're really excited about that, because it includes the startup of Advent team, which will help drive more capital efficiency, rig rates, our legacy rig rates rollup in the market, the field development plan at Sand Dunes is -- and we've got a central tank battery facility with water recycle. Most of the fluids that are being handled there will be on pipe. It's 4-well pad and 6-well pad development -- that includes the ability for us to do simultaneous operations of drilled, complete and produced. And so we believe these well results extend across that inventory and that we're set up for even better capital efficiency with the new field development plan.","Operator","The next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Douglas Leggate","I guess the focus again is on Greater Sand Dunes well results. I wonder, Vicki, if you could help us understand what's changed as it relates to the timeline of your 80,000 BOE per day target? The wells are clearly substantially better than what you are expecting when you set that target, but you're still talking about a year end 2018 type of cadence. Are you just being conservative there, or is there reason why you're sticking with that timeline? And I've got a follow-up, please.","Vicki Hollub","No. We may achieve the 80,000 a day earlier than the end of 2018, but there are other drivers like our Al Hosn expansion, our export facility where we are trying to ensure that we're at the full capacity there -- those may take place later in the year. So the timeframe is really intended to capture the point of which all of our improvements are fully in place and to ensure sustainability that we have full margins and that those full margins are being realized for the entire quarter.","Douglas Leggate","And just to be clear on one of the slides Jody spoke to, you know I believe it is a repeatable, I guess you would never really given this as a tight curve but these results are repeatable across the 2,000 location?","Vicki Hollub","Yes, we definitely believe that. We just sat through over the last couple of days some reviews of how they're doing this technically. And it's very impressive work. There's no reason for us to believe that this is not sustainable. In fact -- the fact that we have 3D seismic and can take that seismic, tie to the performance that we're seeing -- and now we are deploying where we can predict what the wells will do end where we need to drill. So this is really a breakthrough for us, and I think we're all really excited about.","Douglas Leggate","We got to see the upclose and a few weeks ago in the field, so thanks, again for that, guys. My follow-up I guess is on portfolio management, Vicki, that -- just eyeballing the chart on the $40 breakeven, which obviously is under bear case, it still implies that you've got a couple of plus-billion dollars of assets sales planned. Does that happen regardless of the commodity backdrop? And if so, just quantify, quantify what you're thinking process the key parts of those -- of that monetization, and I'll leave it there.","Vicki Hollub","Yes. So we've always said or have said most recently that at some point we'll monetize the plains unit. We will do that at some point but we want to pick the appropriate time to do it. Secondly, whatever environment, it really makes sense for us to continue to optimize our portfolio. And because of this huge position that we have in the Permian Basin, what we want to do first -- our highest priority is to swap acreage because we've had a lot of success blocking the development areas that we have, and we're really happy with that we develop in areas. So the more trading that we can do rather than outright sales is preferred. However, there are some acreage at the tail end of our portfolio that in any environment, we would sell.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey","Vicki, if I could ask simply a follow-up so early in the call, but could you go back to the idea that Evan had -- what happens given the oil prices above $50, I think you really answer that in the context of 2018 CapEx kind of being at a relatively fixed level. Can you go beyond that and talk about -- I think the longer-term investment case for Oxy that maybe you go the dividend of 5% to 8% a year off the base that you've got now of about 4.6%, that would get even to double-digit returns and conceivably, that would be a $50 assuming you made your plan, at which seems to be making. Could you talk to that and whether or not you see that as that is the investment case for Oxy.","Vicki Hollub","I think that's a strong investment case for us. It is, as I mentioned -- the maintenance capital is the highest priority, but our second highest priority is the dividend and we continue to do that. We've come as you know, during this downturn, we haven't been able to return to what we were able to do historically, because over the past 15 years, we've more than doubled the S&P growth rates with our dividend growth rate. Going forward, we want to get that back to a meaningful growth and that will be consistent with our production growth.","Paul Sankey","And then the second follow-up is it sounds a few disposals in acquisitions are going to be pretty neutral to 0, because it will mostly be about swapping and that there's no major portfolio moves to be made -- again, thinking long term.","Vicki Hollub","There are no major ones, so just optimization of the tail-end.","Paul Sankey","Okay, I get that. And finally, this is a little bit of a negative, but on a trailing basis -- I know the near new results are great, do you still -- perhaps, a little bit behind the rest of the industry in terms of your Permian performance. Do you see that as having been may be a slow adoption in new technologies, that the history of the company in terms of being -- growth by M&A? Or is it something about your acreage which I know is very extensive? What would you characterize this way you've been and what language you achieve can see this rapid improvement in result?","Vicki Hollub","Well, it's certainly not the acreage. We have great acreage and -- I think part of it is that our team, we have over the past few years, we've changed our resources business significantly. And what we've been able to do is put the right people, the right leadership in place to approach this in the right way. And so now we're more value-based in terms of how we're doing our resources business, and we've made a breakthrough really taking all the acreage we have, all the information that we have from all of our offset -- operator wells, our outside operated, our offset competitors. ","We've taken all of that and we've started to apply not only data analytics, but we're applying a more sophisticated subsurface characterization than we have done in the past because honestly, for shale plays, some people initially in the early stages of shale plays thought they were statistical. But clearly, developing shale place in my view requires a lot more science than some of our conventional rest of us. And I think until you get to the point where you realize what you need to do and how you need to do it and what parameters really matter, I think that you can do struggle with that. But we're to the point now where we've done the work, the right work -- and that analytics had the help with that, but just the massive amount of data that we have, we've been able to achieve a breakthrough in terms of what parameters really matter the most, and that's going into our evaluations now.","And also the other thing that sets us apart, I believe, from some others is that we are taking our development plan, we're using integrated planning and doing field by field development plans so that we maximize its value. We don't go far, although you heard us talk about initial rates and third end the rates from a really 30-day rates, really that's not the target for us. We're just trying to give you a measure of how good these wells really are. But the target for us is to optimize the value of the full field development. And you really need to focus on initial rates from 30-day rates to do that. But what you need to do is focus on how you build your infrastructure out, how do you pace your development to ensure that you're maximizing the value of the reserves.","Operator","The next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.","Philip Gresh","My first question, I guess, would be a follow-up to Paul's -- maybe ask it at a slightly different way. On Slide 6, where you break out your dividends, your sustaining capital, your growth capital, with all the improvement you've been talking about here in well results. I guess I'm wondering if the underlying required capital from sustaining basis or from a growth basis to hit the 5% to 8%, on longer-term basis, do you think that has a possibility of changing?","Vicki Hollub","I think the more we learn about what we have and the more efficient we get, I think there is a possibility that, that could come down.","Philip Gresh","Right, okay. My second question would be -- if I go into your appendix, Slide 48, where you're talking about the chemicals cash flows, you are implying that nearly -- the CFO can be nearly $1.5 billion on a normalized basis. And I guess I was a little surprised by that because I traditionally saw that pretax income for chemicals an annual basis to be maybe $1 billion, the tax effect that add back to the DD&A and you kind of get back to right around $1 billion. So is there something structurally different with the business? Or is there some other kind of cash flow effect there with respect to taxes or something else that drive the higher cash flow?","Cedric Burgher","Yes, Phil, this is Cedric. I'm going to take a part of that, and then I'm going to ask BJ to come in for the other part. But there is something I guess people caught by surprise and that is some of the nuances with our tax position. But the income generated in chemicals is taxable, of course, but because we are integrated with the other parts of the business, we have domestic losses that are able to offset that. So we have been enjoying a very low, basically no tax position for some time in the chemicals business. We anticipate this situation to continue for some time at the current commodity price levels.","So you've got a number of commodifies in play here, you've got the caustic soda prices obviously benefiting. The chemicals business as well as the oil and gas prices affecting the other parts of the business. So all that comes into play when you think about looking out and projecting your tax. But at the current levels, we think we've got sufficient tax losses to offset the chemicals income for the projected time period that we've given you. And then, BJ, do you want to address the other piece?","Unidentified Company Representative","Sure. Good morning, Phil. This is BJ of our picker talking about chemicals continues to be positive in the market. And from a cash flow standpoint, obviously, there are step-changes with both the cracker and the 4CPe plan that's going to come online. But just from a fundamental standpoint, they're very positive, especially for costs I think you talked about that caustic prices were up 14% since the first quarter to the third quarter. And that was being driven by the fundamentals well before Harvey, and even after Harvey, it's tightened a little bit further. But when you look for a globally, we think the fundamentals are pretty strong for us when you look at the main driver for caustic remain -- consumption for caustic is in the aluminium industry, which is growing 5% to 6% per year. You have capacity coming down in Europe. And so when you look at all that in total, it's pretty strong from a fundamentals standpoint. So that's really what's driving the earnings.","Cedric Burgher","This is Cedric again. And I want to mention one thing just because it's related. I really perhaps didn't give it due, in my prepared remarks, about our effective tax rate. But what was really cool about that this last quarter was in part, in large part, it was reflecting the operational improvements in cost reductions we've made in the international side of our business. And so Ken Dillon's with us -- and I feel like -- to ask him to just add a few comments about those cost reductions and the improvements we've made internationally.","Ken Dillon","Phil, this is really a strong story in capital. Field OpEx as at the 7-year low now and it's been driven down by 6% to 8% since 2013. We're the lowest cost operator in country with the best-in-class performance. With our partner QP, we have worked the expense. We've been collaborative in logistics, including shared services, for example, work boots, lift boats and helicopters. And then on the technical side, we upgraded compressive bundles dry gas sales systems, to state-of-the-art improved reliability, performance and costs. We've also rolled out obviously less bleeding to improvements in the ESP run life. And lastly, and not the least, our supply chain team have been very successful in negotiating reductions in contracts of up to 27% for next year. Overall, it's a really strong team monthly performance and a really great partnership.","Philip Gresh","And then just one last one, Cedric. On the foreign extreme tax rate, your guidance remains 55%, but you've been coming in well below that for the year-to-date, it's in the low 40s, at least on the foreign upstream side. So is that sustainable, or is there something you need to be going on there?","Cedric Burgher","Well, we haven't adjusted the guidance because there were some were some more or less one-time items via rock lifting, I mentioned in the call -- our prepared remarks -- excuse me, but so that obviously would it be something that we would expect to recur. But of course, we did that, that in the first quarter also. But I really don't see much upside there. But on the operational improvements, we hope and expect that it will continue to improve their but we've not baked that into our guidance so there is some upside there.","Operator","The next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons.","Guy Baber","So I wanted to start on the CapEx side, but with the visibility of delivering the cash flow piece of your breakeven plan improving here, maybe we can talk a little bit about the capital spending side. But you're highlighting the sustaining CapEx of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion going forward. I wanted to talk about how the capital intensity of your international upstream businesses is evolving in particular -- given the changes in your asset base over the last few years, given deflationary pressures and some of the cost reductions that you've highlighted in Qatar, for example, but just curious if you have an estimate of where your international SND might be trending and the degree towards that has improved over the last few years.","Vicki Hollub","We are seeing improvements. We have seen over the past couple of years continued improvements in what we're doing in the international operations and in particular, in the Middle East. What we're seeing there is as you may have remembered, we required 3D seismic all over our blocks 9 and 27, so we have one of the largest onshore 3D surveys in the world. And we're using that survey to successfully drill wells that they virgin pressure in the field that we discovered a long time ago, 30 -- 35 years ago. And that's really helping us because when you can drill wells in a field that already has infrastructure, that helps you to start to drive down your F&D. We have some other opportunities, and I'm going to throw it over to Ken to provide you more detail on what we're doing there.","Ken Dillon","Good morning. As you know, we've changed very much over the last few years instead of the large megaprojects or efforts this year, very much focused area similar to Permian. We've loves drilling program at Middle East and then Columbia. And we rolled out Oxy drilling dynamics across the whole region now. What we're seeing is, for example, in Oman North, we've seen a 12% improvement in foot per day, and an 11% reduction in cost per foot, which essentially drives lower F&D costs throughout the region. We just rolled out the same system in Qatar, and we've almost immediately seen a 6% improvement in dollars per foot, and a 7% improvement in feet per day. In terms of using the 3D seismic that we have across Oman, what we're seeing a similar results to Pearman, where our IPs are [indiscernible] than planned, 20% across the whole of international. Basically, we're drilling fewer wells, more productive wells for less capital.","Guy Baber","And then my follow-up is on the U.S., the 4Q production growth in Permian Resources trajectory into 2018 is obviously impressive. So with the meaningful increase in the number of resource flows as you're bringing online especially in New Mexico, given some of the tightness of the labor market we're hearing about, logistical issues, tightness with services we've seen from others. Can you -- just discuss the confidence and the timing of your planned ramp that you've laid out and how your mitigating some of those risks regarding the timing of the delivery there, given what we've heard from some other operators? And then may be specific comment on 4Q. The guidance range is wide there. Can you just maybe want to talk about what went to get to the lower end or the higher end of that guidance. What the sensitivities are there?","Joseph Elliott","Hey, Guy, this is Jody. I appreciate the question. This is strong guidance in the fourth quarter and there's kind of 2 catalysts there. Obviously one is the step-change in well results. There's been a significant improvement there. We're taking advantage of those development plans, utilizing 3D seismic, as Vicki outlined -- with respect to how we land the wells and how we stimulate them. The second part of this is the cadence of the wells also online. So as I said in my opening comments there, we added rigs late in the second quarter. We'll start seeing those wells come in and as we enter 4Q and go into the first quarter and as you can see on the chart there, that the well counts are also going up significantly.","So there's a couple of aspects there that drive why the range is wide. One is, where you're putting the 3,500 barrel-a-day wells. Those wells take some time to reach peak production, and so when you have that many wells with that kind of the spread and production rate, depending on how -- when the well comes on the 1st of December or the 15th of December can make a big difference in what that quietly production rate this. To me, it's about the trajectory -- the trajectory, fourth quarter, first quarter, second quarter that we have a lot of confidence in. The other aspect is pad drilling. Year-to-date, we're probably 80% pad drilling, but we anticipate that going -- up to about 95% as we end the year and go into 2018, as I spoke about the field development plants. So good well results, pad drilling, ramp-up of number one well online, those are all really positive but that makes guidance in a single quarter a little more difficult.","The second part of your question or one part of your question was around risk mitigation? So pad drilling, the way we do modular-based development. The well designs are very similar from module 1 to module 2. And so it's very repeatable. You have crews that get into a learning curve. Remember, we haven't ramped significantly. We're at a 11 operated rigs, we believe it's well within our headlights and the capability, we have for frac cores that continue to do work with us in repeatable activities. One of the risk mitigation techniques we employ is utilizing spudder rigs and rigs, right? Where you spud a rigs to set surface casing in many cases where it makes sense. And in other cases, we use batch rigs to set intermediate pipes.","So if you set all your intermediate casing strings before you do your laterals, it derisks, if you want to call it a train wreck or a problem in one of those wells, you've derisked that because you've taken it out of the critical path timeline. So that's one example. There's a number of things we're doing on the supply side, on the cost side. Our logistics hub in New Mexico comes online, and that derisk supply. So I appreciate the question, Guy.","Operator","Next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","When we look at the Slide 15, it's definitely noteworthy the increase in lateral length that you've achieved and are expected to achieve getting to 8,500 repeat on average in the first half of 2018 in the Permian. And I wonder if you could talk about the longevity of your inventory of 8,500-plus foot lateral length wells, and going into the earlier commentary on swaps here, swap there, at what point you would look for more meaningful opportunity or need to exit swap or add to your permanent position to bolster that continuity?","Joseph Elliott","Yes, Brian, we've had -- last year, I think in the past, we said we did about 10,000 acres of trade swaps in 2016. In the slides, you see we've done already 13,000 acres this year to continue to core up. There's energy in the industry to do that, people recognize the value of scale and being able to drill longer laterals. So we have a good inventory of wells that are in the low natural category. And again, I go back to the value-based development. It's part of that process. There's a subsurface process. ","There's a commercial process, there is an execution planning process, but there's also a land process that goes with that. You could go chase production, but if you're not set up to do the longer laterals and spend the time to work your land position hard, then it's going to be the potential risk to overcapitalize and not deliver the rates of returns, which will lead to the return on capital employed that we're were driving for. So it's all wrapped up into that process. But we've had a lot of good land trades this year, and that gives us confidence about continuing to be able to drill longer lateral.","Cedric Burgher","I guess to sum on this topic, when we would think about what needed for multiyear growth plans assuming $50 oil, and assume you've got to seminary piece, normal course land spud, would you have the inventory of 8,500-plus foot lateral length to support that ramp where we'd see these bars continue to go flat to go up to the right?","Joseph Elliott","Yes. I mean, we're confident of these core long land positions have long lateral inventory deep. But remember, that's just one piece of the value based development approach. We continue to lower cost, we continue to drive well efficiency. There are places that -- again, you can see what our lateral length has done down over time not just in the inventory but the actual results. now we updated our inventory last quarter. Our average inventory and this is in the less-than-$50 category more -- went from 8,400 to 8,600 feet. So all of these steps we take continue to drive better returns at the end of the day.","Brian Singer","And then shifting internationally can we have talk about some of the wells collective an impairment that you're seeing, I wondered to what degree that international is competing more per capital, or whether these productivity and the improvements or efficiency improvements just minute -- essentially repatriate have more capital available for us debt paydown or to shift to the U.S.?","Vicki Hollub","Well, we're definitely not opportunity-limited in what we're seeing in international. And it really will depend on what adds the most value. As we get to the point where we have cash above and beyond our 5% to 8% growth that we've set as a target, we'll look at the opportunities and see what we can do. But I'm really excited about what we're seeing internationally.","Operator","Our last question comes from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI.","Douglas Terreson","I had a capital management question as well and specifically, during the past year or so, several of your competitors, they changed their direction and in some cases, they extended production guidance -- just to demonstrate returns and value creation. And then they pledge to distribute increased cash flow to shareholders over the next five years and they were obviously awarded the stock market.","So while there was plenty of commentary on growth today, the obvious question is, why not more parameters or frames for return of capital? Meaning, Cedric was pretty clear about to the commitment to return, and I think Vicki was, too. But is there a reason that pathways that free cash for the return on capital are not provided for an extended period and I asked because he clearly, it looks like your economics are improving, so it appears return probably improving normalize to or you guys I think that the returns so far will take care of itself as increases. So I guess the question is -- I just want to get you guys to comment on how you think about the importance of returns and the balance between growth and return. So if you could do that, that would be appreciated.","Vicki Hollub","Okay, I do not want to say this in a negative way but our history points to the fact that return on capital employed has been a very important metric to us for the last 20 years. And we have a track record that shows that, that's -- we make investment decisions on that basis. The only reason we're struggling a little bit right now is that we certainly need to get to the point where we replace the cash flow that we loss from those lower returns and lower margins assets that we exited. That was really the main reason for that hold a strategic plan, was to get us back into a situation where every dollar we invest delivers the most -- the highest possible rate of return on capital employed. So we're really committed to that. We're going to execute this plan to get to our cash flow breakeven at $50 and beyond that, our return on capital employed will continue to go up.","Cedric Burgher","Good. Doug, this is Cedric I would just add a couple of things. One, it sounds like -- from the question, was a little bit reflective of what does our guidance to reflect and so on. And while we don't guide ROCE, because one thing that's wonderful about ROCE, and I'm sure you a big advocate of it, Doug, but -- it captures pretty much everything and it's fully-audited, it's full cycle, it's harder for the IR guys to get gaming and so on. So it really is a great metric and it's one we've been committed to for a long time, and of course, we will never do that here. But the -- it's a great metric, we've been committed to it, in various pieces for a long, long time, organizationally, as well as personally.","But if you get is reflective of that the really is difficult to do. And if you look at last year, we were in the top quartile of our peer group for ROCE. It was a tough year for anybody in the business just because of the downturn and historic cost on the books. As we work forward, every dollar be reinvested, as Vicki said, is going to very high return reinvestment returns where it won't get invested, and so that's our commitment to you and to our shareholders and we're finding a lot of success in progress in doing that. And so we believe that recipe will continue to give us industry or peer-leading ROCE metrics. So I know it's competitive environment but we were it's up quite a last year, and we intend to be that way over time year in and year out.","And that's our goal, and then we tied our -- increasingly tying compensation to it meant, that's something we put out last quarter in one of our slides. And so I'm not sure -- but guidance is something that we aren't probably going to do in terms of guiding gaining ROCE. We'll give you components that may be can help you get there.","Vicki Hollub","And Doug, I was going to add one more thing as well. As you know, we've also done share buybacks a lot in the past and we've done quite a bit of that and that's not something that we have gone away from being willing to do would the list but right now, with the opportunities that we have for organic development, it's not the highest priority or not the middle priority so -- but we would consider that in the future. That will be part of our value proposition. So just make sure you understand picker we're hoping to doing what we need to do to add value but appreciate the question.","So to close, I just like to say that we are very excited about where we are in our direction but realize that more needs to be done. We have the highest quality assets across our businesses that we've ever had. And our teams are continuing to find ways to make them even better. This gives our entire management team confidence in our ability to sustain our value proposition of dividend mongering production growth and were looking forward to where we're headed. So thank you, all, for joining our call today and hope you have a good day, and go after us.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Steve, please go ahead.","Steve Chazen","Thank you, Chris. We just finished a successful year meeting or exceeding many of the goals we set out for ourselves and are looking to continue our performance into 2014. Let me give you a brief overview of the key 2013 highlights. ","We grew our domestic oil production by 11,000 barrels per day over 2012 to 266,000 a day. We exceeded our capital efficiency goals reducing our drilling costs by 24% from the 2012 levels, reduced domestic operating costs by 17%. We added about 470 million barrels of reserves equivalents achieving overall replacement ratio of 169%. ","Our total costs incurred associated with those reserve adds were about $7.7 billion, resulting in repair and finding and development costs of under $17. We increased our return on capital employed from 10.3% in 2012 to 12.2% in 2013.","Turning now to some of the specifics of the key accomplishments of last year. As a result of our development program, we improved our capital efficiency by 24% domestically over 2012, which translates to about a $900 million reduction in capital for the wells drilled in 2013. Of this improvement, 50% came from the Permian basin, 25% from California and 25% from the rest of domestic assets. We accomplished these improvements while successfully completing our program by drilling approximately what we had planned.","We also reduced our domestic operating costs by 17%, or about $470 million compared to 2012. About 48% of this improvement was in the Permian basin, 46% was in California and the remainder was in their other domestic assets. While we focused on these efficiencies, we also grew our domestic oil production by 11,000 barrels a day.","With respect to reserves, we had a very successful year in growing the company\u2019s reserve base by adding substantially more reserves than we produced. Over 90% of which was added to our organic development program. We ended the year based on preliminary estimate with about 3.5 billion barrels of reserves which represent an all-time high for the company.","Our total company reserve replacement ratio from all categories before dispositions was about 169% or about 470 million barrels of new reserves, further [ph] 278 million barrels we produced during the year. In the United States, our reserve replacement ratio was 190%. Replacement ratios to California properties and the Permian non-CO2 properties were similar to the overall ratio.","Our reserve replacement ratio for liquids from all categories was 195% for the total company and 228% domestically. This reflects our emphasis on oil drilling instead of gas. Our total costs incurred related total reserve additions for the year on preliminary basis of about $7.7 billion. Over the last several years we have built a large portfolio of growth oriented assets in United States. In 2013 we spent larger than normal portion of our investment dollars in development of these assets. Our GReNeC reserve replacement for the year reflects the positive results of these development efforts. Our 2013 program, excluding acquisition, replaced 168% of our domestic production with about 291 million barrels of reserve adds. In addition we transferred a 115 million barrels of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed category domestically as a result of the program. Our acquisitions were at a multiyear low of $550 million, providing reserve adds of 32 million barrels.","At the end of the year we estimate that 73% of our total proved reserves were liquids, increasing from 72% in 2012. Of the other total reserves about 70% were proved developed compared to 73% last year; 2012, that is. Increasing the share of the proved undeveloped reserves compared to last year with all the reserves added of the Al Hosn Gas Project. We expect to move these reserves to proved developed category at the end of this year, once the initial production starts in the fourth quarter.","Through the success of our drilling program and capital efficiency initiative we lowered our finding and development cost over recent years, as a result we expect our DD&A expense to be around $17.40 a barrel only a small increase from the $17.10 in 2013. This is consistent with our expectation that DD&A rate of growth should flatten out as recent investment come online and finding and development cost come down. Because of our organic reserve additions and the efficiency we\u2019ve achieved in our operations demonstrates the significant progress we\u2019ve made in turning the company in a competitive domestic productive.","One of our long-term goals domestically has been achieved, a 50% pre-tax margin after finding and development and cash operating cost, so as to generate solid returns. We believe we\u2019re achieving that now and expect to continue to do so in the future.","Consistent with what we\u2019ve said, our focus in 2013 was to enhance the shareholder value through our results. For this goal, our program was heavily focused on growing our domestic oil production, improving our capital efficiency, that is, improving our finding and development cost and lowering our operating cost. We met or exceeded these goals in result have increased our return on capital to 12.2%, a significant improvement from the 10.3% of last year and a testament to the hard work and dedication of all of our employees. We expect to see further improvements in our returns in coming years as a result of the recent investments.","Turning to this year, our 2014 program is designed to improve on last year\u2019s strong performance. Let me highlight the key elements of the 2014 program, which I will discuss without reflecting any of the effects of our strategic review initiatives. We expect our 2014 program to be about $10.2 billion compared to the $8.8 billion we spent in 2013. The increase includes about $400 million of additional capital allocated to each of our Californian Permian operations largely for additional drilling, to accelerate their development plans and production growth. An additional $100 million will be spent in these and other domestic assets for facilities projects that were deferred from 2013. The domestic oil and gas capital program will continue to focus on growing oil production and the entire increase in capital will go to oil productions in California and in Permian Basin. We also expect to continue to find growth opportunities in our key international assets, mainly in Oman and Qatar and complete the Al Hosn Gas Project.","Our capital for 2014 for Oman and Qatar will increase by about $300 million over last year. Our exploration capital will increase by about $100 million; in part, due to spending that was deferred from last year. Our midstream capital increased by about $100 million as a result of spending on the BridgeTex Pipeline and two new terminals at Ingleside. Our chemical capital increased also by about $100 million; the Mexican joint venture we announced last year and we complete the new Johnsonville chlor-alkali facility.","Our success in improving our capital efficiency and operating cost structure has provided us with the ability to expand our development opportunities that met our financial return targets. The capital program production growth that I outlined, it reflects the benefit of our streamlined structure and our commitment to continue fuel growth by exploiting our large portfolio, primarily in California and in Permian Basin. We expect to our 2014, we expect our Company-wide production volumes to grow to between 780,000 and 790,000 barrel equivalents a day compared to 763,000 in 2013, with the fourth quarter exit rate of over 800,000 barrels a day excluding the planned Al Hosn production. This increase will come almost entirely from domestic oil production while we expect to see a continued modest drop in our domestic gas volumes. Our domestic oil production is expected to grow from 266,000 barrels a day in 2013 to between 280,000 and 295,000 barrels a day in 2014 or about a 9% increase. This growth will come fairly evenly from our California and Permian operations. Internationally, excluding Al Hosn, we expect production to grow slightly.","While the elements of the 2014 program that I discussed assumes no changes to Company structure or its mixed of assets. We do expect the Company will look significantly different by the end of the year. Strategic view we are undertaking will result in large changes to the Company\u2019s asset mix. Our capital program production expectation and other elements of 2014 program will be adjusted as the related transactions are concluded.","Finally, some of our longer lead investments we have been making over last couple of years will start contributing to our results this year, specifically the Al Hosn Gas Project we expect to start its initial production in the fourth quarter and start contributing to our cash flow. We expect the BridgeTex Pipeline to come online around the third quarter and to start contributing to our midstream earnings and cash flow. The new Johnsonville chlor-alkali plant is expected to come online early this year and will make a positive contribution to the operations for our chemical business.","With respect to the initiatives outlined in the first phase of the Company\u2019s strategic review announced last year, we completed a sale of a portion of Company\u2019s investment in the General Partner of Plains All-American Pipeline in October, resulting in pre-tax proceeds of about $1.4 billion. After this sale, we continue to own about a 25% interest in the Plains General Partner, which at current price should be valued at about $4 billion. We have made steady progress in our discussions with key partners in the countries where we operate, in the MENA region for the sale of our minority interest in our operations there. Due to the scale and complexities of potential transaction, we expect these discussions to continue through the first half of this year. We have made good progress in our pursuit of strategic alternatives to the select Midcon assets, we expect to provide further information on any transactions as they conclude, some around the end of the second quarter and we\u2019ll announce material developments as they occur.","In the fourth quarter, we used the Plains proceed to retire $625 million of debt, reducing our debt load by about 9% and to purchase almost $10 million shares of the Company stock of a cash outlay of $880 million. We ended the year with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 14%. At the February\u2019s Board Meeting we will review the Company\u2019s dividend policy, status of strategic alternatives and share repurchase authority.","Many of the steps we\u2019ve taken in 2013, including our success in improving our efficiency and the action that our board has authorized lay a ground work for stronger results for this year and beyond. The operational improvement we expect to achieve in 2014 coupled with the strategic action we expect to executive this year, should place the Company in a position to improve its returns while continue to grow and increase its dividends to maximize shareholder value.","Vicki Hollub will now provide a more detailed discussion of our California and Permian operations.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you, Steve. This morning I\u2019ll review two of our largest domestic operations: our Permian and California businesses \u2013 describing our 2014 plans as well as longer term growth opportunities.","In 2013, we implemented an important transition plan in both of these businesses. And the success we achieved built a solid foundation for long-term growth. In 2014, the specific goals of our operations are continue the development of our large anchor projects in each of our operating areas. Which will enable us to allocate a significant portion of our capital to projects with solid returns, low execution risk and long-term growth, further reduce our drilling and completion cost to improve our finding and development cost and our project economics.","Continue to optimize operating cost without affecting production to improve our current earnings and free cash flow. Build on our successful exploration efforts in each of our core areas. Evaluate data and test various new concepts in our pilot areas which will setup the anchor projects of the future.","We manage our Permian Basin operations through two business units. The Permian EOR business which combines CO2 and water floods and the Permian Resources business which is where our growth-oriented and unconventional opportunities are managed. I will refer to the CO2 water flood business as Permian EOR and the other business as Permian Resources. The Permian Basin designation will be for the combined operations.","In the Permian Basin we spent over $1.7 billion of capital in 2013 with 64% focused on our Permian Resources assets. In 2014, we plan to spend just under $2.2 billion overall in the basin. The entire $450 million increase will be spent on our Permian Resources assets representing about 70% of our total capital spend in the basin. We expect the Permian EOR business to offset this decline in 2014 and to actually grow 1.4%. The Permian Resources oil production is expected to grow faster in the range of 20% to 25% and its total production by 13% to 16%. On a combined basis for the Permian Basin, this should translate to oil production growth of over 6% in 2014 and total overall production growth of over 5% while generating $1.8 billion of cash flow after capital.","2013 was a pivotal year for our Permian Basin operations. First, we improved our capital efficiency by 25% and reduced our operating expenses by $3.22 a barrel or 17%. We also began transitioning to a horizontal drilling program. We drilled 49 horizontal wells with 47 completing and producing. The combination of improvements in well cost, our own results and those of neighboring operators have given us the opportunity to dramatically shift our program to more horizontal drilling in 2014. Our Permian Resources team will average running about 21 rigs of which 17 will be drilling horizontal wells. We plan to drill approximately 345 total wells or about 50% of which will be horizontal. This compares to 330 total wells drilled in 2013 around only 15% were horizontal.","We have two main goals for our Permian Resources business in 2014. First, we intend to continue the evaluation of the potential across our full acreage position and second, we plan to pilot various development strategies, including optimal lateral link, frac design and well spacing, both, laterally and vertically. We believe this will position us for accelerated development as we exit 2014 and go into 2015.","We believe we have one of the most promising and underexploited unconventional portfolios in the Basin. In 2013 we added 200,000 net prospective acres to our unconventional portfolio and now have about 1.9 million prospective acres. This is a prime position in the Permian Basin. Our acreage in the Midland Basin, Texas Delaware Basin and New Mexico give us exposure to all the unconventional plays, which is unique. This will give us flexibility to develop our most attractive opportunities first and to mitigate risk.","Based on the work we\u2019ve done to-date, we have identified approximately 4,500 drilling locations across our portfolio representing 1.2 billion net barrels of resource potential. We believe we\u2019ve made conservative assumptions regarding prospective acres, well spacing and expected ultimate recoveries, but expect these numbers will grow as we learn more. We see the largest near-term growth in the Midland Basin which represents about two-thirds of our currently assessed resource potential. However, our Delaware Basin prospective acreage is significantly larger and potentially there should be room to grow.","We believe our measured approach to our unconventional portfolio has worked to our advantage. Our Permian Resources production comes from about 9,500 gross wells of which 54% are operated by the producers. On a net basis we have approximately 4,400 wells of which 15% are non-operated. This has given us the opportunity to observe the results achieved by other operators in the basin, learn from those results and optimize our approach to maximize the opportunities on our acreage. The success of our capital and operating cost efficiency efforts in 2013 has enabled us to significantly improve our cost structure which has increased our opportunities there.","For example, a typical well in the coli [ph] area that had an IRR of 24% before our capital and operating cost reductions now yields IRR of 48% using the same product prices to achieve similar success in all of our most active areas across the business unit. Finally, we have established a multi-step methodical process for our unconventional acreage in the Permian Resources business that includes, step one, exploration to establish the presence of a commercial resource; step two, testing and data gathering to optimize well completion design; step three, pilot programs to assess variability of well performance to design and full field development plans; and step four, transition to manufacturing mode for full field development. This process is helping us prudently develop our acreage, maximizing cash flow and returns. As a result we are now prepared to accelerate our activities in the Permian Resources business where we believe the opportunity in front of us is one of the biggest in the basin.","Now, I\u2019ll review our program in more detail beginning with the Midland Basin. We\u2019ve been most active with our horizontal activity to-date in the Midland Basin where we\u2019ve drilled 16 wells. In 2014, we plan to spend $790 million to drill 147 wells, including 74 horizontals. We expect the average eight rigs in the area during this year. Our largest opportunity here is in the Wolfcamp Shale, where we have tested Wolfcamp A and B benches and plan to target our activity to test the remaining benches. ","One of our most successful pilot projects in this basin is South Curtis Ranch which has now gone into full field development mode. This is the property that we acquired in 2010. We have drilled 63 vertical and 6 horizontal wells to date and plan to drill over 200 additional wells on this acreage. Results so far have been as expected with initial 30-day production rates where the horizontal wells averaging approximately 800 boe per day. ","In the Midland basin, we also believe there is substantial potential in the Cline which is currently under evaluation. We have drilled 6 horizontal Cline wells so far and plan to drill another 5 to 10 in 2014. Preliminary results indicate we may have the opportunity to drill up to 450 Cline wells in the basin. ","Another pilot project is horizontal drilling in the Sprayberry where we plan to drill our first horizontal well in the first quarter and we will evaluate next steps with the results. In addition to the horizontal activity we also plan to continue our legacy vertical Wolfberry development. In the Texas Delaware basin, we plan to spend approximately $370 million in 2014 to drill 91 wells including 48 horizontals. We expect the average five rigs during the year. And our horizontal activity will be focused in the Wolfcamp where we believe the A, B, and C benches will prove to be the most prospective. ","We drilled and participated in three horizontal Wolfcamp wells in 2013 and we will increase that to 45 in 2014. Our activity is centered in Reeves County where we historically have drilled vertical Wolfbone Wells. Early horizontal results are proving to have better economics, but there are some plays where vertical development is still more efficient. ","In our Coli [ph] area, we plan to drill 43 vertical wells targeting the Bell and Cherry Canyon formation. This represents the continuation of the one-rig program we executed in 2013. And in Mexico, we plan to spend approximately $370 million to drill 97 wells including 50 horizontals. We expect the average four rigs during a year. The Bone Spring Formation in New Mexico is the second largest opportunity in our portfolio behind the Wolfcamp Shale. In 2013, we drilled 16 horizontal wells testing the first, second and third Bone Spring sand intervals. Our results were very encouraging and we expect to increase the program to drill 30 horizontal Bone Spring sand wells in 2014. ","Of the $2.2 billion to be spent in the Permian basin in 2014, $660 million will be allocated to our Permian EOR business. As I previously mentioned this business unit is a combination of CO2 and water floods. It is symbiotic to manage these assets together as they have similar development characteristics and ongoing monitoring and maintenance requirements. For the last couple of years we have actually spent more capital on water floods as we mature the next CO2 developments. In 2014, 25% of the $660 million will be spent on current water flood development and the remainder on CO2 floods. Further, we have 1.4 billion net barrels of oil equivalent and reserves and potential resources remaining to be developed in the Permian EOR business. ","We believe we are the efficiency leader in the basin in applying CO2 flood technology to develop this potential. We have the ability to accelerate growth in our EOR projects as more CO2 becomes available. As a result of our efficiency advantage, many projects that don\u2019t work for others work for us. Over the last several year, the focus of our Permian exploration program has been to identify unconventional opportunities which are then transitioned to full field development through the process I explained earlier. Our approach has been very successful giving us a large opportunity set that we are now working to fully develop. We continue to see the addition of new plays in the basin and see years of exploration drilling opportunities ahead in our 2 million prospective acre position. ","Now that I have gone through some of the specifics of the program for the Permian basin, I will explain our overall business strategy. We are approaching our development program with the multi-pronged strategy that first maximizes the field resource potential. Second, controls cost to optimize returns. Third, gives us a strategic advantage to improve our realizations. We are using targeted horizontal and vertical drilling as appropriate optimizing development completion plans from lateral length to frac efficiency, as well as lift strategies to maximize recovery. We are making heavier infrastructure investments like power, water handling and gas processing to pre-plan for field success. These strategies coupled with our successful exploration program accomplished the first of our objectives. ","We will continue to manage costs and take advantage of our progress along the learning curve with leading technologies and execution efficiencies to accomplish our second objective. And we are also investing in additional takeaway capacity including the completion of the BridgeTex Pipeline and build out of our gathering systems which will give our crude the strategic advantage to reach either the Houston Ship Channel or Corpus Christi Markets. ","Finally, I would like to comment on our plans for the Permian basin over the next several years. With the combined businesses, we have more than 2.5 billion barrels oil equivalent and reserves and potential resources. ","Within each business, we have the flexibility to shift capital among projects within that business, as well as, the flexibility to shift capital between the two businesses as needed. Our large and diverse portfolio creates opportunities for a variety of growth options. In the Permian resources business at our current pace, we believe we have over 15 years of development and growth opportunities. ","Given that the Permian EOR business is generating significant cash flow and we expect our opportunity set to continue to grow, we plan to double our rigs for the next three years to accelerate the development of the Permian resources units, growth opportunities. We expect this to result in the doubling of our resources units production from approximately 64,000 boe per day in 2013 to more than 1,20,000 in 2016. ","In Permian EOR while it is large with a somewhat slower growth curve, we have significant opportunities going forward with continued positive cash flow to fuel the growth of the resources unit. Combined with EOR growth opportunities, we expect our overall Permian basin production to grow by roughly 10% compounded annually growth rate through 2016. ","Now, we will shift to California. In 2013, we spent $1.5 billion of capital. Our main goals were to deliver a predictable outcome, advanced low-risk projects that contribute to long-term growth, reduce the cost structure, lower our base decline, create a more balanced portfolio and test exploration and development concepts. We achieved every one of these objectives. ","We produced 154,000 barrels oil equivalent per day, generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow after capital. We progressed the development of our steam floods and current front low field and started the redevelopment of our Huntington Beach Field. ","We improved our capital efficiency by 20% versus 2012 and also reduced the operating costs by $4.70 per BOE or 20%. Overall, in 2014, we intend to continue the capital strategy shift initiated last year, which was to focus the majority of our capital on low decline projects. Our goals for this year are to accelerate the rate of production growth and maintain our lower cost structure. We have also continued to advance several low risk, high return long-term growth projects and capitalize on our exploration successes. ","In 2014, we plan to spend $1.9 billion of capital of which 40% will be spent on water floods, 20% on steam flood and 40% and non-conventional and other developing plays. We expect to average about 27 rigs in California in 2014 compared to an average of 20 rigs in 2013. We plan to drill around 1,050 wells in 2014 compared to 770 in 2013. We expect this program to deliver around 11% oil production growth or over 4% total production growth while generating $1 billion of free cash flow after capital at current prices. ","We believe the rate of growth will further accelerate in 2015 and beyond as the number of the steam and water flood projects reach full production and the base decline is lower due to relatively less natural gas development, higher investment and lower decline in oil projects and a larger share of higher growth, lower decline projects in the asset mix. ","Let me now share some of the highlights of the program for this year beginning with the water floods. In the L.A. basin we plan to spend $500 million in the Wilmington and Huntington Beach Fields. Our Wilmington Field development in 2013 exceeded expectations. We drilled 135 wells and we will increase that by 7% to 145 wells in 2014. ","Our horizontal program was particularly strong and horizontal wells will represent an even greater percentage of wells in 2014. In our Huntington Beach redevelopment, we have successfully brought online our two new [indiscernible] for purpose drilling rigs and drilling completed our two wells in the project. In 2014, we plan to drill 30 wells and we will ultimately drill at least 128 wells. ","Our Heavy Oil business was the key focus area in 2013, it will be again in 2014. We plan to spend $315 million to drill about 420 wells compared to 324 wells in 2013. We will also continue a multiyear development of current front and loss field [ph] steam floods and we will pilot some new projects. ","I would also like to highlight that the business achieved record production in the fourth quarter producing 19,000 BOE per day which is an increase of 4000 barrels per day from the first quarter of 2013.","In Elk Hills, our key objective is to lower the high decline rate and we\u2019ve made significant progress toward this goal. In 2014 we plan to spend $600 million in capital to drill 325 wells which is an increase of $170 million over 2013. About 55% of Elk Hills capital would be targeting our shale reservoirs for our capital efficacy efforts in 2013 had a significant impact, we experienced an average of 23% decline in oil cost for these programs and 21% decline in operating costs, which dramatically improved the economics and increase the opportunity set. ","For example a typical well that generated 30% IRR prior to our efficiency initiatives now delivers 50% IRR using the same product prices. In 2014, we will drill around 130 shale wells at Elk Hills, an increase from 80 in 2013. The remaining Elk Hills capital will target continued development in the shallow oil zone in Stephen [ph] sand. ","Our California exploration program has delivered solid results for over five years. The 2014 California program will continue to explore both unconventional and conventional targets. The unconventional program target several prospects similar to the 2013 discovery. The conventional program will target prospects in and around our existing production in both the San Joaquin Valley and Ventura County. Our extensive proprietary 3D seismic surveys are yielding an exciting inventory of leads and prospects which will provide years of drilling opportunities. ","Lastly I would like to give you some perspectives on our development plans over the next several years in California. We expect to continue the capital strategy we initiated in 2013 to shift the lower decline and lower risk steam and water flood projects. We believe we can grow our California production from 154,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day currently to 190,000 in 2016 or roughly a 7.5% compounded annual growth rate. ","Our steam and water flood projects will contribute 80% of that growth. In fact, 90% will come from projects that are already online. We think this positions California as one of the lowest risk growth profiles in the industry. Further we are targeting primarily oil drilling which will make our portfolio more oily contributing to the solid margin expansion going forward. We expect to grow our oil volumes by roughly 15% compounded annual growth rate through 2016. Over the long term we expect our California growth prospects to benefit from changes in our asset mix. Elk Hills and THUMS while having the potential for years of continued production have lower growth prospects due to the mature state of both of these fields. ","On the other hand our water and steam floods as well as our unconventional opportunities should continue to give us double digit growth for years to come. The share of our production from Elk Hills and THUMS has shrunk from 64% in 2009 to 44% in 2013. This shift will continue going forward and the largest share of higher growth projects will further accelerate the growth rate in coming years. Other than the Permian basin, we are continuing to test new ideas and to further improve our drilling completion and development efficiency in all of our projects. ","We\u2019re also working diligently to comply with the new regulatory requirements created as the result of the passage of Senate Bill 4 in California. We have a dedicated team addressing the associated issues and currently we don\u2019t except significant delays in our development plans. ","As you can see, while the Permian basin and California stories are different, they are both very exciting. The hard work and dedication of our people have put both of these assets in a position for continued success and 2014 is the year that both of these businesses will begin to accelerate their growth as we have completed the transition to a focused growth oriented development program and we\u2019re set for long-term growth. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Chris Stavros.","Christopher Stavros","","Emily, can you please open the line for questions, we\u2019re ready to take questions thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question from Doug Terreson of ISI, please go ahead.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","","Good morning to everybody. Steve, Oxy\u2019s returns on capital rose last year by almost 20% which I think was the objective or the hope anyway but your capital spending looks like it's going to rise by another 16% or so this year. And so my question is how does management prevent capital misallocation and then retrenchment from occurring again as it did a couple of years ago? Meaning, have there been changes to the capital allocation process or in other areas of corporate planning that might enhance the result in the current scenario?","Steve Chazen","","Yeah, sure. Thank you, first remember that this number is for unchanged business.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","","All right.","Steve Chazen","","And that\u2019s really not going to happen so the actual spending will be some other number, a lower number because some other businesses won\u2019t be here by year-end.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Right.","Steve Chazen","","We\u2019re being \u2013 we\u2019ve changed the process, I think Vicki has pointed out that the change in the domestic business and how we\u2019re \u2013 what we\u2019re focusing on returns are lot better and we\u2019re not \u2013 I think it's basically a lower risk portfolio and will generate more certain returns. We expect the returns we\u2019re not actually excited about the 12% return on capital employed. I think we need to be closer to in excess of 15% and so our goal is to make sure that\u2019s right. ","We\u2019re -- it's like we\u2019re very great caution on my part that I\u2019ve allowed additional spending in Permian and California, they\u2019ve had to convince me that they\u2019re going to stay on the straight and narrow here. So I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re under control but if it turns out because we\u2019re going to watch this monthly because that\u2019s what we do now, we watch it monthly. It turns out and get off to the wagon and they\u2019ll \u2013 the beer will be turned off.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Okay, one more questions you guys also were.","Steve Chazen","","Or the fine wine whatever they\u2019re drinking you know.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","","So you guys were obviously very successfully with your cost program that helped the result last year and so most of the complete is there more work to do there on the cost product program?","","Steve Chazen","","For sure, while I\u2019m \u2013 I think we exceeded our goals.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Right.","Steve Chazen","","We\u2019ll set new goals. I think my main focus just so we were real clear, the long-term business depends on low F&D, operating costs are fine but they affect the current year but we have to develop a long-term low F&D rate and go back to what we said forever. If we have the F&D and the operating cost and local taxes we need to be below the 50% of the selling price of the product. And if you\u2019re going to do that you have pre-tax margins of 50% and you\u2019ll generate good returns and that\u2019s really the objective and so we need to continue to drive as the reservoirs become more challenging, need to cost or cost need to be watched very carefully. I think you know we\u2019ve used this year 2013 at this to really horn our ability to control costs and I think we\u2019re there. ","We\u2019ve gone through a multiyear transition of the company from you know from a very good international producer and you know an okay domestic one to a much stronger domestic business and this has been a not an easy or quick transition but I think at this point we have the people in place to accomplish those goals going forward. We\u2019re giving them more money this year but I hold myself and them responsible, unlike football teams the coach gets fired not the assistant coaches in this.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","","Well if you guys can make 15% returns on capital that\u2019d be fantastic. Thanks a lot.","Steve Chazen","","I think we\u2019ll be there.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Nice thanks.","Operator","","Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","I have a couple also if I may. Telefonia [ph] has I guess been judged to some extent as not been able to execute because of lack of visibility, so do you believe that\u2019s in targets this morning obviously that suggests the step\u2013up in activity but what comfort can you give that you have got the permitting, you have got the rig count. And I\u2019m just curious as to where you\u2019re headed in terms of how \u2013 whether or not separating California still a viable option and one that you think would benefit the balance of the portfolio?","Steve Chazen","Yes, I\u2019ll answer the last question first and then we\u2019ll let Vicki, assistant coach here, get ready to answer, how certain she is. At California and the Permian and the rest of the company are quite in some ways different businesses. California can benefit a lot I think. My higher capital spending will generate more growth. We established a base with we might call boring if you want, steam flood and those kind of projects, so they will have enough cash flow to go ahead. ","I think it could be managed differently than we would and I think it has good prospects, I think the issue that we need to have a team together that is more aggressive growers, maybe less concerned about dividends and more like E&P, small E&P. No one will lever -- three producers or 85% of the production in California and that isn\u2019t going to change. And so, there is never going to be a comp and make people to believe and for the management of that business to deliver, it's probable, but they should be separate. Is that clear enough?","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. That is clear enough. ","Vicki Hollub","With respect to our efficiencies, I feel like in California certainly we have a lot of potential as we outlined in detail in the earnings call a couple times ago. So we have the resources available. We have now put together a team out there that's structured in a way, that gives them the best opportunity of success. We have great people, we have very experienced people who are -- who know a lot about operating in California, who know a lot about the types of projects that we're developing, that's our core business. We know water floods, we know steam floods and that's the bulk of what we're doing.","So our team understands quite clearly how to do that and they are among the best in the industry. And so, we're accomplishing what we've said we would do and what we're doing going forward that with this increase in capital is we're being very disciplined about how we evaluate and design our projects and implement our projects. So I'm quite certain that we're not going to lose our efficiency around execution and with the resources that we have, I feel confident that we're going to continue to see the same results that achieved in 2013 going forward.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Given that you have been fairly clear about how this could play out, Telephone [ph] has not been spending its cash flow up until now. So as a standalone company would there be an intangible drilling cost uplift to the operating cash flow in your estimates? And I guess if I could lay on it, very quickly, latest stuff thoughts on the scale of a potential Dutch tender buyback if that's still in your thinking and I'll leave it here. Thanks.","Steve Chazen","","Obviously, California would spend more money and drill more wells until they could generate a lot of tax shelter, if that's the question.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Yeah.","Steve Chazen","","A separate business who competes with \u2013 a separate oil company that competes with other medium size or whatever you want to call on producers, obviously is a business that would generate, you basically burn, you use its cash flow. California has the flexibility however so that it could cut back its capital and use money to repurchase shares or something like that, if the right sort of environment came down. ","Unlike some other things, it's a pretty complete business that has -- fair amount of gas opportunity when that's available. It has all saves [ph], long term oil and has some exciting oil things to do too. So I think it's a fairly complete business and it\u2019s a business where, if things get bad for regulator regions or price or whatever, it can cut its capital back, still do well, doesn't get caught on a cred mill of higher decline, could even buy back shares. I don't think it's going to be a big dividend producer but I think I think on share repurchase, it could do that if conditions warrant, but if conditions don\u2019t warrant, I am sure they will spend all that money.","The process of repurchasing the shares from whatever we do, it just depends on the situation at the time. When we have the money we'll figure it out, when we have the money in the hand, we'll figure out exactly what the process will be. But I\u2019d point out that we repurchased around 10 million shares in the fourth quarter, we wouldn't have done that with the shareholders\u2019 money if we thought that, all this wasn't going to happen. So I think the process of doing it remains to be seen, because you might have -- one oil, one stock price you might do one thing and another you might do something else. But, there\u2019s no other place to put it. I mean, it\u2019s either some kind of share repurchase or \u2013 you know, there isn\u2019t really any debt that we can do much with. So, I think we\u2019ve taken down the debt. I think the next maturity is in 2016 and I\u2019m not up for, you know, some kind of windfall for bond holders.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I\u2019ll let someone else jump on. Thank you.","Steve Chazen","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah. I mean, I guess I got a bigger picture question just on Permian and then some follow-ups on California. So, those two question and just on your Permian, I mean how do you think you\u2019re going to get a fair price for the light oil that you\u2019re producing in Permian? What is Oxy going to do about it over and above what you\u2019ve already announced, you know, with the BridgeTex Pipeline extension? Thanks.","Steve Chazen","We\u2019re going to let Willy answer that since he\u2019s the expert in oil.","Willie Chiang","Yeah, Ed. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen a lot of disruptions in pricing between regions and we\u2019re seeing a lot of infrastructure getting built in and when we look at our production of roughly 15 million barrels a year or 150,000 barrels a day out of the Permian, between the BridgeTex Pipeline which goes from essentially Midland or Permian directly to the Gulf Coast as well as taking capacity on other pipelines down to Corpus we essentially go from a two market business, Midland and Cushing to ultimately getting to Houston Ship Channel as well Corpus and then we also get the ability to go to U.S. East Coast and lots of different places. So, I think the infrastructure is going to help us tremendously in that area.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","As a follow-on. I guess, people are concerned that when the crude goes down to the Gulf it\u2019s still going to be impact. Any thoughts around that, what work you\u2019ve done on that?","Willie Chiang","Well, the thing everyone looks at is the Brent\/TI. And as I think about it, Brent\u2019s really tied to world prices and I think what you\u2019re going to see is all the grade as well TI kind of come to transportation parity.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. So, no major discounts in your thoughts for the crude once it gets down to the Gulf other than quality and logistics?","Willie Chiang","No, I think prices fix the price issues.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. So, just \u2013","Steve Chazen","I\u2019ll also point out that ","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","I thought you might.","Steve Chazen","Yeah. That, you know, $97 is probably okay for us. I mean, this isn\u2019t some bargain basement price. So, yeah, we feel pretty comfortable that we could be reasonably profitable at $97 and much lower, so. You know, sometimes you lose sight of the absolute price in all this talk about differential.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah, it\u2019s a good point. Just on California then. I mean, you gave us sort of some initial resource estimates for the Permian, would you be willing to give us the resource estimates for California? I know people are obviously trying to have confidence and resource numbers from yourselves would obviously help their confidence.","Steve Chazen","I think what I prefer to do is leave that for another day and another kind of announcement.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Well, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Just another follow-up on California where you have a nice growth trajectory here. It sounds like the greater confidence and it is there is a bit of a mix here where some of the stuff that\u2019s declined is now smaller and you\u2019re shifting more to water and steam floods which you\u2019ve historically been very good at and maybe less reliance on the unconventional, at least in the scope of the years presented here, is that accurate? And, I guess, if so where are you on the unconventional from the confidence standpoint? Thank you.","Steve Chazen","I\u2019ll let Vicky answer about the unconventional but just so you understand, I think you\u2019ve got it but, you know, we have the high decline and really no decline \u2013 high decline at Elk Hills and really no decline at THUMS, which was the bulk of the production of the Company and originally was nearly 100%. And so what\u2019s happened is that the little wedge has grown and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in improving the decline rate in Elk Hills, so we\u2019re not fighting as big a decline curve. And so what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re filling it in with things that are real certain so that the business has sufficient cash without being on a treadmill with the go forward. And I\u2019ll let Vicki talk about the unconventional here, since she\u2019s more knowledgeable than I am for sure.","Vicki Hollub","This year we\u2019re drilling 170 unconventional shale wells versus 111 that we drilled last year. So we increased the number that we are drilling this year and actually we had hoped to drill even more than we currently have on the schedule. But we felt like that from a regulatory standpoint, it was best to take a more conservative approach this year and be our best before. We do have some exciting unconventional projects that are in the permitting process and we expect to bring those on in 2015. So basically part of its permitting, just trying to get the permits in line and ready to go. The other part of it is that we are continuing with the strategy that we developed and that is to as we\u2019ve said lower our decline and build up a larger solid base of those types of projects. And that really helps prop us up for the unconventional development. ","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Is it a question Vicky of the scope of what you have there? You aren\u2019t sure you have enough running room between confidence in the resource and the ability to get permits, or are there still questions on all those points?","Vicki Hollub","","Yeah there are questions on all of them. We do have, as I said, unconventional plays that we feel very comfortable with the development of because there are things that we understand that we\u2019ve already started the process of development. So there is a portfolio that we feel like we could move forward at a fairly fast pace if we had the permitting in place. There is still some shales that we haven\u2019t really tested and evaluated yet and we\u2019re taking the same approach in California as we are in the Permian where we are doing a more measured approach to go out, drill a few wells, do some evaluation, then start some pilot projects and then from there progress to full field development. So we are trying to be very prudent in the way that we approach our shale plays that are outside where we\u2019re currently drilling. ","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Steve, maybe just a follow up on the MENA comments. I certainly appreciate the scale and complexity here and that\u2019s going to take some time. Can you comment that you have identified maybe a partner group which is a key group you are negotiating with and these things can still take time or is it earlier stage than that where there is still multiple parties that are involved here?","Steve Chazen","","No, there is a partner group.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s great. And then just a final one on the stock buyback. Should we think about this primarily as asset sale proceeds are used for stock buyback or your balance sheet is strong that it can be an ongoing program even without proceeds?","Steve Chazen","The business fundamentally, the overall business or whatever remains in the company is able to generate free cash. And so we should see a part \u2013 I think I said it at your conference, part of the program will continue to grow the dividends at a healthy pace. We\u2019ll have a little more share repurchase than we\u2019ve done historically. You will see share reductions from whatever happens in the asset sales or whatever dividends we might take from anything we separated from company. So I think you\u2019ll see the share count come down and therefore the dividend requirement, the dollar amount of dividend requirement come down. So I think you\u2019ll see a mix, but we\u2019re very \u2013 I\u2019m very focused on the value of the stock we\u2019re buying. It isn\u2019t just about buying shares for fun, certainly easier than drilling wells. But I think that we\u2019re \u2013 and you\u2019ll see us come and go as the stock price changes and of course there are periods when we can\u2019t buy where we have material information. So there may be periods when we can\u2019t buy. But generally you should expect to see a regular program at some level but also some fairly sizeable reductions over the next year I would expect.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you so much.","Steve Chazen","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you. Good morning. Steve, I was wondering if you could clarify some of the comments you had around return on capital employed. So are you saying that \u2013 and you guys have made a tremendous effort in getting return on capital employed up over the last 12 to 24 months. But I want to make sure I understand. So are you saying that with CapEx going up next year and with sort of the double end of the rig count in the Permian over the next few years and adding seven rigs on California, overall, you\u2019re seeing ROC should trend up over the next one to two years, all else being equal?","Steve Chazen","Product prices aside, yes.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, okay, fair enough. And then in terms of your comments on California, given that most of your growth in California is sort of longer life production and some of your growth in the Permian has sort of a higher decline rate, I mean doesn\u2019t it make more sense to kind of keep those assets together as a portfolio? What\u2019s the \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to understand like how you balance the cash flow and decline rate over the two portfolios over time.","Steve Chazen","Remember the Permian is respectively two businesses, there is the EOR business which generates large amounts of free cash flow. So the question really is how do you \u2013 and it has a potential to add this high growth stuff but still generate large amounts of free cash flow as a business, we can manage that reasonably well. ","California, the potential is currently managed to generate free cash flow and it will generate a base ultimately of these long lived projects, which basically the way answers to some extent your question about the returns because you could turn on a long live project your D&A rate will be relatively low and so your earnings will be better because you got a lot of reserves over long period. But \u2013 and so every business, a standalone business has to have a base of money to pay for itself, now I understand there is a whole bunch of companies out there that don\u2019t. But that\u2019s not the way to build the long term oil business. So California can spend more fairly I think easily and continue to grow. And in the Permian there is a lot of competition for rigs and people and so I think it\u2019s a little more challenging in the Permian. I think California, I have a map in my office from 1679 which shows California as an island and there is some proof to that.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Do you guys have an estimate for the return on capital employed for California at the end of the year?","Steve Chazen","I don\u2019t think so. I think we will leave those kinds of questions for some other announcement.","Operator","Our final question will come from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","You mentioned in the preview part the costs and the learning curve issues, have you done anything in particular to hire people out there or has it been learning by watching, learning by sharing info and data with some of your partners out there.","Steve Chazen","I think Vicki went through a long \u2013 we have got a lot of gross wells that \u2013 bulk of the production and outcome comes from our own net wells. So we see enormous exposure what other people are doing. We don\u2019t actually have to experiment or hire other people, we can actually see what they are going. We hire people all the time but we are not hiring people from radically different cultures. We need people who are trained in a return driven free cash flow kind of culture. And to hire somebody from some small company they really have a different kind of culture, they\u2019re more an IRR getting their money back quick and drilling more wells culture. So we don\u2019t want to destroy the notion that this is a business by generating money and generating returns and we are not going to spoil \u2013 we\u2019re not going to spoil the stew with a bunch of others [ph].","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","I guess as a follow up, even to those comments, if I remember correctly, we are in a new CEO search mode here. Is there any update you can provide on that front?","Steve Chazen","I think the board will have something to say about that next month. But I expect that I\u2019ll be doing significantly more earnings calls than I had planned.","Operator","In the interest of time this concludes our question and answer session, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Stavros for any closing remarks.","Christopher Stavros","Thanks everyone for joining us today and please call us with any follow up questions in New York.

Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.","Last quarter I told you our game plan for this year has been to address the things within our sphere of influence to ultimately not only survive but thrive in the current weak commodity price environment. To that end, we're on target to achieve the higher end of our production guidance for 2016 while keeping our capital program on budget at $3 billion.","We continue to make progress lowering our cost structure, which we know is critical to both short and long-term success. Our capital discipline and cost reduction efficiencies combined with improvement in new well productivity and better base production management have enabled us to further reduce our total spend per barrel of production this year compared to 2015.","In addition, our strategy around capital is to be prudent and remain focused on returns, as we expect the commodity price environment to stay challenging through the rest of this year and into 2017. At the same time, we'll maintain the flexibility necessary to maneuver through a range of price scenarios. Finally, due to the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our portfolio, we have raised our dividend for the 14th consecutive year.","Total company production for our ongoing operations increased to 609,000 BOE per day from 590,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. The increase was driven by Al Hosn gas in Abu Dhabi and a new gas project in Oman. The increase in average daily production of 26,000 BOE per day from Al Hosn versus the first quarter of 2016 is due mainly to lower production volumes in the first quarter caused by a scheduled warranty shutdown. However, 10% of the increase is due to improved plan efficiencies gained by the Al Hosn operations team. As you know, Al Hosn gas is a joint venture between ADNOC [Abu Dhabi National Oil Company] and Oxy in Abu Dhabi. The Al Hosn team has done an excellent job of optimizing deliverability through the plant.","An additional 7,000 BOE per day came from Block 62 in Oman, where a recently constructed gas plant was put online to process production from two newly developed gas fields. The plant was completed on time and on budget. This enabled us to achieve record production in Oman this quarter.","In addition, our Qatar team has worked to get production in the Idd El Shargi South Dome field, or ISSD, to its highest level in over 16 years. Completion design improvement in complex horizontal wells and enhanced base production management contributed to this production milestone.","Permian Resources production this quarter was 126,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 16%. As Jody will show, we're continuing to see improvements in well productivity in all areas. The increases in production from Al Hosn, Block 62, and ISSD, along with strong year-over-year production growth from Permian Resources will help us reach the higher end of our 4% to 6% production growth guidance for 2016.","Our capital spending in the second quarter declined modestly, as we shifted timing of spending for certain Chemicals and Midstream projects and slowed our drilling program in the Permian. This drilling program is consistent with the plans we put in place at the beginning of this year and with our strategy to remain conservative in this price environment. Continued improvements in project designs and capital execution have helped us to do more than expected with our $3 billion capital budget. These along with improved production performance in many areas of our operations are the reasons we expect to achieve the upper end of our production guidance for the year.","It's important to note that most of our cost reductions are due to our own efficiency gains, not service company unit cost reductions. In fact, approximately 80% of our drilling cost reductions are due to faster penetration rates achieved by the application of Oxy drilling dynamics, along with improved well construction design, lower cost of materials, and enhanced logistics.","In Permian Resources, the cost savings we have achieved due to improved efficiencies will be redeployed into drilling incremental wells in the latter part of the year, which will positively impact 2017 production. Additional capital will also be shifted to Colombia, where our teams have generated opportunities to deliver attractive returns at current prices. This activity will also support 2017 production.","The construction of the joint venture ethylene cracker at Ingleside by OxyChem is on budget and on schedule to be completed in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, the crude oil export terminal at Ingleside being constructed by Midstream is also on budget and on time to be completed by year end. The terminal will have a total oil storage capacity of 2 million barrels and throughput capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels of oil per day.","Although these activities will slightly increase our capital spending during third and fourth quarters, we don't expect to exceed our $3 billion budgeted spending for the full year. With the completion of the long-term projects in both our Chemical and Midstream segments, we expect to have increased flexibility with our capital program in 2017.","Our efforts to focus on efficiency are paying off, as we continue to lower our total spend per barrel of production. This metric includes our overhead, operating, and capital costs per barrel of production. Our organization is focused on this metric, and we have linked incentive compensation to it. The metric is designed to drive cost reductions, increase well productivity, optimize base production.","In 2014, our total spend per barrel averaged close to $62. We lowered this to about $40 in 2015 and have targeted $28.50 per barrel in 2016. In the first half of this year, we've beaten our target with average total spend of about $27 per barrel. We expect similar results during the second half of this year.","Despite the increase in oil prices and energy costs during the second quarter, we held our production costs flat on a sequential quarterly basis while achieving a year-over-year decline in production costs of approximately 19%.","Maintaining a conservative balance sheet continues to be a focus and a top priority. We ended the second quarter with $3.8 billion of cash on hand, an increase of $600 million from the first quarter. Our cash flow from operations exceeded our capital spending in the second quarter, and we collected the remaining $300 million of proceeds from our settlement with Ecuador.","Throughout this year, we have consistently said that we will prudently manage our activity levels to stay positioned for profitable growth in 2017 while maintaining the flexibility necessary to maneuver through the uncertainty and volatility of this price environment. The capital redeployed into Permian Resources will be used to add two rigs by the fourth quarter to support production growth in 2017.","The incremental capital for Colombia will be around $20 million. It will be directed to activities in La Cira-Infantas, where we have a successful partnership with Ecopetrol to develop low-decline water floods. The incremental production from this activity is also intended to support growth in 2017.","Given the short-cycle nature of our Permian Resources business and the flexibility we have in our Colombia operations, we can adjust our capital spending up or down relatively quickly, depending on the price environment.","On the M&A front, we also continue to look for ways to expand and further strengthen our position in the Permian through asset acquisitions, as we rarely purchase whole public companies. Our objective is to pursue opportunities in both enhanced oil recovery and our Resources business that provide meaningful synergies to enhance the value of our existing assets. Our goal in acquiring additional EOR assets is to blend development of long-life, low-decline production with our faster growth unconventional development.","While we continue to evaluate potential opportunities, we are staying returns focused and note that asset prices appear excessive when one considers the current product price environment.","At our board meeting in July, we announced a modest increase in our annual dividend rate from $3.00 to $3.04 per share. We have now increased our dividend every year for 14 consecutive years and a total of 15 times during that period. The dividend increase reflects our commitment to shareholders to grow the dividend annually, as is consistent with our longstanding capital priorities.","As a reminder, our top priority for use of cash flow is the safety and maintenance of our operations. Our second priority is to fund the dividend. With improved capital efficiency in our Permian Resources business, the startup of the ethylene cracker in Chemicals combined with long-life base production, and a portfolio of high-quality opportunities, we expect continued future dividend growth.","I'm pleased to note that our board of directors has elected a new director, Jack Moore. Jack most recently served as the Chairman and CEO for Cameron International. Prior to joining Cameron, he held various management positions at Baker Hughes and has nearly four decades of experience in the energy sector. His industry knowledge and management experience will be a great addition to our board.","Before I hand off to Chris, I'd like to summarize by pointing out that across all our upstream oil and gas operations and in OxyChem and in our Midstream business, our teams are executing efficiently and innovatively to achieve pinnacle and operational excellence in all of our areas.","Three things are driving this; First, the ability to focus on our core areas without the distraction from activities that are not core to us, thanks to the initiative Steve Chazen started in 2013. Second, we have excellent leadership at all levels throughout our organization. Third, our employees are performing at a very high level. They're engaged, motivated, and delivering exceptional results. While I'm happy about that and the direction we're headed, none of us are satisfied with where we are today, so we'll continue to aggressively and innovatively improve our performance.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results and detailed guidance.","Christopher G. Stavros - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll plan to talk about the following: some of the key changes that have occurred since the first quarter; our second quarter segment and financial results; and our third quarter and total year guidance for production and capital.","Index prices for WTI and Brent improved progressively each month and ended the second quarter with about a $12 per barrel increase compared to first quarter prices. Our income and cash flows benefited from a 35% increase in realized prices for both oil and NGLs. During the second quarter, we received a tax refund of $300 million for the NOL tax receivable booked at year-end 2015, and we collected the remaining payments of $330 million related to the Ecuador settlement.","Our core financial results for the second quarter of 2016 were a loss of $136 million or $0.18 per diluted share. This represents a sequential improvement from the loss of $426 million or $0.56 per diluted share during the first quarter.","Although commodity prices improved significantly from first quarter levels, they remain well below the prior-year second quarter. Second quarter 2016 reported results for GAAP purposes were also a loss of $0.18 per diluted share, as there were no material non-core items during the period.","Oil & Gas core pre-tax results for the second quarter of 2016 were a loss of $117 million compared to loss of $508 million in the first quarter of 2016 and income of $324 million from the same period last year.","The sequential improvement of $390 million is nearly all a result of higher commodity prices. Our second quarter 2016 worldwide realized oil price of $39.66 per barrel increased by over $10 a barrel or 35% compared to the first quarter.","Total company oil and gas production volumes from our ongoing operations averaged 609,000 BOE per day in the second quarter, an increase of 19,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarterly basis and 57,000 BOE per day higher than last year's second quarter. Quarterly production volumes were at the high end of our guidance range of 600,000 BOE to 610,000 BOE per day.","International production from ongoing operations was 307,000 BOE per day during the second quarter of 2016 and up 24,000 BOE per day compared to the first quarter, as the Al Hosn gas plant completed its scheduled first quarter warranty shutdown and Oman's Block 62 gas project continued to ramp up production.","Second quarter domestic production from ongoing operations of 302,000 BOE per day came in nearly 2% lower than the first quarter. The sequential decline was partially due to the drop in production from the absence of gas-directed drilling activity at our South Texas assets and unplanned plant outages at our non-operated Permian EOR operations.","Compared to the prior year's second quarter, our domestic production was up about 4,000 BOE per day, with Permian Resources growing by 17,000 BOE per day or 16%, partly offset by a decline in natural gas production at our South Texas properties.","Domestic Oil & Gas cash operating costs from ongoing operations of $11.80 per BOE in the second quarter of 2016 were roughly flat on a sequential basis. However, they declined by 13% compared to the full year 2015 cost of $13.58 per BOE. The reduction in cost compared to last year is mainly the result of improved efficiency around our surface operations, including water handling, as well as lower downhole maintenance and energy-related costs.","Overall Oil & Gas DD&A for the second quarter of 2016 was $15.00 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015. Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $1.12 per BOE for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.32 per BOE for the full year of 2015. Second quarter exploration expense was $27 million.","Chemical second quarter 2016 pre-tax core earnings were $88 million compared with first quarter earnings of $126 million. The sequential quarterly decline in core earnings reflected lower chlorovinyl production volumes, due primarily to scheduled plant outages, partially offset by more favorable vinyl margins.","Midstream pre-tax core results were a loss of $58 million for the second of quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $95 million in the first quarter. The sequential improvement reflected better Oil & Gas marketing margins and stronger domestic gas processing results due to higher NGL prices. Midstream also realized higher income from its domestic pipeline business as well as sequentially higher third-party foreign pipeline revenues, as the Dolphin gas plant was down for planned maintenance in the first quarter.","Looking at our cash flows for the second quarter, we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash. During the second quarter we generated $935 million of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes. Net working capital changes consumed $195 million of cash during the period, and we expect working capital changes to be much less burdensome to our cash flow during the second half of the year.","Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $660 million, bringing our year-to-date capital spending to $1.3 billion. As Vicki mentioned, our capital spending in the second half of the year will increase modestly, as certain project-related expenditures in both Chemicals and Midstream have been deferred to the latter part of the year. In addition, we plan to recycle some of the capital efficiency savings back into our Permian Resources drilling program and also take advantage of some project opportunities in Colombia. Despite the higher expected capital spending during the second half of the year, our 2016 total company capital program remains on track to be within our original budget of $3 billion.","During the second quarter, we also completed a $2.75 billion three-tranche senior notes offering with attractive coupon rates of 2.6%, 3.4%, and 4.4% on six-year, 10-year, and 30-year notes respectively, and extending the average life of our debt by about five years. The primary use of proceeds went to refinance the $750 million of notes that matured on June 1, 2016 and the early redemption of $1.25 billion of notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2017. In addition, we also paid $575 million in dividends and collected $330 million in payments, completing the settlement with Ecuador.","With respect to guidance and as Vicki mentioned, we now expect our full-year 2016 production growth from ongoing operations to come in at the high end of the 4% to 6% range. Better than expected production volumes achieved during the second quarter as well as improved confidence around Permian Resources and performance in the Middle East during the second half of the year allow us to narrow the estimated range of full-year 2016 production from 585,000 to 600,000 BOE per day to a new range of 590,000 to 600,000 BOE per day.","Turning to guidance for the third quarter, we expect our total Oil & Gas production pro forma for ongoing operations to be between 600,000 and 605,000 BOE per day. As I had mentioned during the first quarter call, we expect production in Permian Resources to decline during the second half of 2016. We anticipate production in Permian Resources to be approximately 116,000 BOE per day in the third quarter. Variability around the outcome will be a function of well performance as we capture further efficiency gains and our ability to manage the base production. Despite the anticipated decline this quarter, we expect our full-year 2016 production in Permian Resources to be approximately 121,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 10%.","Our plan is to remain disciplined with our capital within the current product price environment and to recycle some of the efficiency and productivity gains realized this year into greater activity during the second half of the year. We expect this additional activity to help support our Permian Resources production as we exit this year and provide a platform for growth into 2017. Jody will share some specifics on this during his prepared remarks.","We expect our total domestic production to decline about 10,000 BOE per day sequentially in the third quarter, largely due to lower volumes in Permian Resources and partially due to declining natural gas production. Internationally, third quarter production should increase by about 6,000 to 8,000 BOE per day, mainly driven by the continued ramp up of Oman's Block 62 production.","Our DD&A expense for Oil & Gas is expected to be approximately $15 per BOE during 2016. And depreciation of the Oil & Gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1 billion. The combined depreciation for the Chemical and Midstream segments should be approximately $655 million.","Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pre-tax for the third quarter. Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every dollar per barrel change in WTI. A swing of $0.50 per million BTU in domestic natural gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $45 million.","In Chemicals, we anticipate pre-tax earnings of about $130 million for the third quarter, as the business ramps back up from second quarter's planned maintenance outages at several of our chlorovinyl plants combined with improved caustic soda prices.","In Midstream, we expect the third quarter to generate a pre-tax loss of between $20 million and $40 million. While quarter-to-quarter changes can be volatile in this segment, the sequential improvement is anticipated due to higher foreign pipeline income and higher income from power generation as well as improvements in our crude oil supply commitments. These factors combined with better results for domestic gas processing should provide a noticeable improvement in our overall Midstream results during the second half of the year compared to the first six months' results.","The worldwide effective tax rate on our reported and core income was 41% for the second quarter of 2016. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 40%. Our international tax rate should be about 60%.","I will now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who will discuss activity around our Permian operations.","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today I will provide a review of our domestic operations during the second quarter and guidance on our program through the end of 2016.","As Vicki discussed earlier, we slowed our Permian Resources drilling program as planned due to severely depressed product prices in the beginning of 2016. We strategically increased capital spending in the EOR business, which will drive increased production in future quarters and years.","In order to prepare for growth in 2017, we plan to add two drilling rigs in our Resources business later this year. We will increase our operated rig count over the second half of the year to seven to eight drilling rigs in the Permian, five of these in Permian Resources. This is an increase from our previous guidance of four to five rigs. This incremental activity is a direct result of program savings from improved capital and operating efficiencies as well as improvements in base production management. Our team has performed extraordinarily well to capture these savings, which will be reinvested back into the business.","As stated last quarter, our Permian Resources operation is being managed to maximize the value of our workforce, enhance our operational capabilities, invest in areas with existing infrastructure, and gather critical appraisal information to drive better well productivity. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to prepare the business for profitable growth in 2017.","Turning to the performance of Permian Resources, in the second quarter we achieved daily production of 126,000 BOE per day, a 16% increase versus the prior year. Oil production decreased quarter over quarter by 5,000 barrels a day to 79,000 barrels per day. However, this was a 10% increase from a year ago. The decline was due to lower capital spending, with 14 wells put online versus 37 wells in the first quarter.","In addition to better performance of our wells, emphasis on production optimization has been central to reducing declines in the business, and we've exceeded our expectations versus our goals. As previously stated, we expect to increase our activity in the second half of 2016 and bring approximately 30 wells online.","Due to the slowdown in activity in the first half of the year due to depressed oil prices and a disciplined development strategy, we expect to see declines in the third and fourth quarter. Third quarter production should average 116,000 BOE per day. For the full year of 2016, we expect to produce 121,000 BOE per day, a 10% growth rate year over year. As our activity increases, we expect production decline to stabilize. And with higher oil prices, we will deliver production growth in 2017.","As we continue to increase our lateral lengths, we now compare and benchmark our well cost on a cost per thousand feet of lateral length basis. Slide 31 illustrates our demonstrated improvement in well costs, which have declined by roughly 30% from 2015. Similarly, our 1,000 foot of lateral per rig per quarter has also improved from 25.2 per rig in 2015 to 36.3 per rig in the second quarter. These metrics will be a primary focus as we continue our development plans. I would emphasize that we estimate 80% of these improvements in efficiency are not at risk of service price increases in a cyclical recovery.","Our Delaware Basin well performance continues to be strong despite reduced activity. We placed seven horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the second quarter. We continue to increase well productivity by increasing contact with the reservoir near the wellbore utilizing higher cluster density, higher proppant loading, and drilling longer laterals. For example, we placed three Buzzard State Unit wells online, with an average peak rate of 1,993 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,733 BOE per day. The HB Morrison B 15H well with a 5,000-foot lateral achieved a peak rate of 2,265 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,717 BOE per day.","As can be seen on the chart on slide 32, well productivity continues to improve across all production metrics year over year due to our successful efforts of applying geologic and reservoir parameters into our landing zones and completion designs.","In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500-foot well cost decreased by about 19% from the 2015 cost of $7.7 million to a first half 2016 cost of $6.2 million. We reduced our drilling time by six days from the average of 25 days in 2015 to 19 days, measured by rig release to rig release. We expect the cost and productivity improvements in drilling, completions, and facilities to continue as we progress our program.","In addition, we drilled a Second Bone Spring appraisal well in the Texas Delaware region, with encouraging results, which we believe will add additional bench potential to the long-term development plan in this area. We did not put any additional wells online during the second quarter in New Mexico, but we are actively drilling in the region. However, our Second Bone Spring 180-day cumulative production rates are among the best in the play. During the second half of the year, we plan to increase drilling and completion activity in the southern Eddy County area due to these improved results. We're targeting an average well cost of $5.5 million, and we continue to appraise and delineate multiple benches in the core areas of this region. And our initial results have indicated high-return multi-bench development potential.","In the East Midland Basin, we brought on the Waldron Eunice 1306WA well in the second quarter at a peak rate of 1,407 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,286 BOE per day. We also brought online the Merchant 1404A well at a peak rate of 1,222 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,061 BOE per day. Both wells are producing with high oil cuts.","In the West Midland Basin, eight new Lower Spraberry wells at South Curtis Ranch are producing results among the best in the play. Improved well results are due to an optimized landing zone target and stimulation redesign.","In the Midland Basin, we made similar improvements in well cost and drilling days in drilling the Wolfcamp A formation. We reduced the cost of these 7,500-foot horizontal wells by 10% from the 2015 cost of $7.1 million to a first half cost of $6.4 million, including the additional cost of increased frac size. We reduced our drilling time by three days from the 2015 average of 19 days to 16 days, measured by rig release to rig release.","In the Permian Resources as a whole, we achieved another quarter of lower quarter-over-quarter field operating expenses, due mainly to improved surface operations with optimized water handling, lower workover expenses, and better downhole performance. Since the second quarter of 2015, we've reduced our operating cost per barrel by 27%. We continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements.","As stated earlier, our focus on maximizing production from existing wells has been central to reducing declines in the business. We expect that our annual average uplift from our investment will be over 6,000 net BOE per day. This is another example of leveraging our decades of base management expertise in the EOR business to our Resources business.","In addition to the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin results, we drilled and completed two horizontal Wichita Albany appraisal wells on existing HBP acreage on the Central Basin Platform. We are encouraged by the early results of these lower decline rate wells and would anticipate drilling six to eight follow-up wells in the play in the next 12 to 18 months.","In Permian EOR, we continue to take advantage of lower drilling costs and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. Permian EOR had another quarter of free cash flow generation, driven by resilient base production and low capital requirements. Drilling costs are running 23% below our benchmark target, and we've lowered our cash operating expenses by 20% since the fourth quarter of 2014 and 7% year over year, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and injectant costs. In similar fashion to our Resources business, the capital savings achieved by the EOR team will be reinvested into additional wells and CO2 flood expansion.","As I mentioned in previous calls, the Residual Oil Zone development, or ROZ, is a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval. The ROZ underlies most of our major EOR properties and can be developed between $3 and $7 a barrel. Year to date, we have completed 74 well deepenings and recompletions along with 28 new wells in ROZ developments. We anticipate an additional 30 deepenings and recompletions and 22 new wells in ROZ developments in the second half of 2016. In addition, one of our horizontal rigs from Permian Resources drilled two deep CO2 source wells, which will help provide long-term supplies of CO2 and support our vast inventory of EOR development projects.","In summary, we are achieving better than expected results in both Permian businesses that will allow us to invest the savings into additional wells in each respective business. In the current environment, we believe this is a prudent investment philosophy that motivates our employees and works well with our total spend per barrel incentive metric. We're pleased with the strides that our teams have made in execution, performance, and safety thus far in 2016, which will afford us the ability to ramp up our activity should oil prices exhibit fundamental stability.","Thank you, and I will now hand it back to Chris Degner.","Christopher M. Degner - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Thank you. Jody. We will now open up the call for questions. And we would ask that you please limit your questions to just one and then a follow-up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks and good morning, everybody. Vicki, adding a couple of rigs to the Permian at the back end of this year, I'm just curious: When you talk about priorities for the use of cash, ultimately where do you see that activity going? Is there a maximum? You've talked in the past about the proportion of growth that you'd want from the Permian at least to be limited in terms of not impacting your dividend policy. But is there a run rate that you would expect to be a normalized run rate as you start to add activity back, given the deep inventory you have?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're talking about run rate with respect to rig activity?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, and capital expenditures. Is there a limit as to how much you would want to allocate there because obviously in a rising oil price environment, you guys have got a lot of levers you could pull?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Currently for at least next year and 2017, and it's hard to predict for 2018. But for 2017, we intend to stay pretty close to the capital allocation that we have for this year, and that's assuming that prices are as we expect. And I will say that we expected the prices to be in the neighborhood of where they are right now, and that's why we took a conservative approach to our capital this year.","We do expect some improvement next year but we're not sure how much that will be, so we're going to wait till toward the end of this year to determine exactly what our capital program for 2017 will be. But our expectation is that if things are as we expect them to be that we would be close to $3 billion. We might spend a little bit more than that if prices are a little bit better than we expect. But the run rate for our company going forward with the assets that we currently have would continue to be in the $3 billion to $3.5 billion, maybe a little bit more, but not a whole lot more than that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe just a quick follow-up to that. Perhaps a better way to ask the question, Vicki, is what's the operating capacity that you have in the Permian? Do you have a lot of headroom where you could add rigs without necessarily having to increase capability?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have the capacity to increase significantly. We will be more limited by our disciplined approach, but we certainly have kept the capability within our organization. We have the ability to put the infrastructure in in the Permian, so we have I would say significant ability. At one time, we were running over 25 rigs. And we could, if prices were in the range that would warrant that, we could get back to that. But bearing in mind now that back when we were running 25 rigs, we were not as efficient as we are today. We're significantly improved with our efficiencies, so we could get actually the same amount of productivity with half the number of rigs that we were at at that time.","So I don't see us going back to a 25 rig count in the Permian unless we expand our operations and our footprint. But we could easily go back to somewhere in the neighborhood of up to 15 rigs reasonably and still have the capacity to do it. I think we could get ahead of it with our infrastructure as well. And actually, Jody could talk a little bit more, if you'd like, about the infrastructure development and how we're trying to stay ahead of it. He's got teams working on development plans for our key areas that will put us we believe well ahead so that we could ramp up to levels of that activity without being encumbered by regulatory issues and\/or infrastructure issues.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. My follow-up, Vicki \u2013 I don't want to take up too much time \u2013 my follow-up is a bit of an obtuse question, and I apologize in advance. The use of cash, the priority for use of cash, acquisition is still at the bottom of that list. And your commentary and the slide deck again points to a fairly big bid\/ask spread as it relates to CO2. However, your currency is also quite valuable, so I'm just wondering. Should we be thinking a little bit out of the box in terms of whether Oxy would be prepared to use equity to make a CO2 add to the portfolio? And I'll leave it there, thanks.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll say that the way you should view the capital priorities right now is just the two that I mentioned. Certainly, maintenance of our operations is the highest priority. Dividends are second. But when you look at the other possibilities, whether it's organic growth or share repurchases or acquisitions, those three really depend on the situations that we're in, and so those three can vary over time or according to the environment that we're in. I would say that for today, as per my comments about M&A, we are certainly looking at acquiring and expanding \u2013 acquiring assets and expanding our position in the Permian. And we would be for the right project, for the right opportunity, certainly be willing to use our equity to do that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answer. Thanks, Vicki.","Operator","And the next question will come from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","The first question is just maybe following up on your commentary about capital spending for 2017. How would you tie that spending to what kind of growth you think you could achieve across the portfolio, factoring in that Permian Resources will be declining and leveling off in the fourth quarter? I'm thinking not only in Permian Resources, but also internationally when you think about the growth you're seeing out of Oman and what you talked about with Al Hosn.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say with the future the way we view it and what we expect to see in 2017, we're going to try to achieve within our range of growth targets, but possibly on the lower end if prices are still on the lower end and we don't see fundamentals driving prices up. So we're going to wait pretty much to the end of this year to make final decisions on it. But we do believe that in a price environment that's certainly better than where we are today is what we would need to continue to grow. But Permian Resources, we will grow Permian Resources next year. The question for us is whether or not we'll grow other areas within our company for next year, and that will all depend on what oil prices do.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just to clarify, the historical range that you're referring to?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The historical range is 4% to 6%.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, so you still think you could hit the low end of that range next year?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We do, in the price range that we would expect.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, okay. And of that $3 billion, I know you gave this number a couple quarters ago. But what do you think is your sustaining capital requirement at this point for the total company?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry, you cut out. Could you ask that question again?","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","What do you think the sustaining capital requirement is for the total company at this point? I know you gave that number a couple quarters ago in your slides. I'm curious if the view is the same or if that's changed at all.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","With the increased production that we have now, the capital that would be required to offset declines would be in the neighborhood of about $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay, thank you. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And next we have a question from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just I guess the first question is just on that production outlook for 2017, very helpful. Given the improvement in the D&C days and the well performance, I guess, and the investments in EOR, I would have expected 2017 to be perhaps a little bit stronger than that, so maybe just talk through. Is it timing of when you complete the wells, pad drilling type stuff?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's really a lot more around the uncertainty of the price environment, and it has a lot less to do with our capability to do it. What we want to do is ensure that we're conservative with our capital programs. We have the potential and the opportunities to certainly not only meet the upper end but exceed it, but we're really trying to be careful about what we forecast and what programs we set up for next year.","I can tell you that what we'll do is that we'll put the program together. We always do that at the end of this year, and we'll firm it up by first of next year. But what our teams have done during this downturn in this slower period is they've enabled us to have a lot more flexibility next year to be able to ramp up should we need to or should we have the opportunity to do so. And the ramp up could be not just in Permian Resources. As I mentioned earlier, the ramp up could be in Colombia as well. And in addition to that, we expect that because of the situation with Al Hosn, overall, Al Hosn will have a higher production rate in 2017 because it will have a full year of production versus the warranty turnaround that we had in Q1 of this year. In addition to that, we'll have Block 62 gas on for the full year, and that will be helpful.","So if you take those things, combine it with the flexibility that we have in both Permian Resources and Colombia, we'll start the year probably conservatively until we see fundamentals start to support prices, but we will have the ability to ramp up in multiple areas. And if prices and the fundamentals are such that we feel comfortable, we'll have the flexibility to actually increase our programs throughout the year if we see that that makes sense.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","My second question is on the Bone Springs chart that you've got in here on page 34, just with the new design, 4,500-foot lateral 180-day cumes over 200,000 BOE, and a decent oil cut, that actually looks a bit better than the chart you've got here on page 36 for a 10,000-foot lateral in the Lower Spraberry. So I guess the question is, is this \u2013 and I think I've asked this before \u2013 really a sweet spot in the Bone Springs geology? Or really maybe just give us some color as to how optimistic you feel about the Southeast New Mexico asset.","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","This is Jody, and good morning. It's more than a sweet spot. I think we're encouraged with Southeast New Mexico across the board, multiple bench development. These examples are over in our Cedar Canyon area. But further east of that area, there's acreage with even more benches that are prospective. So very encouraged with Southeast New Mexico, and the rig adds that we're talking about will likely be in the Delaware and in New Mexico.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thanks very much, well done.","Operator","And the next question comes from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks, maybe a couple. One, in regards to 2017 capital, can you talk about what you believe the year-on-year change in cash balance is driven by the Chemicals business? For example, how much capital do you see rolling off into 2017 relative to incremental cash flow from the startup of the cracker?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, for the Chemicals cash flow, we expect that capital this year is around $500 million. Next year it should drop to less than $400 million. The following year it would be back down to basically its maintenance levels of around $250 million. So we'll have around $300 million in cash flow from Chemicals this year and expect that by 2018 that would be up to around $900 million, potentially a little bit more than that depending on product prices in the Chemical business.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, so that should free up significant capital, I guess, in 2017. It would be, even at that $3 billion world, to be reinvested back into the organic upstream business.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct. We had about \u2013 total including the Chemicals and the Midstream business, we had this year $500 million of committed capital and almost $400 million of that's coming off for 2017. That will be redeployed into \u2013 most of that into the Permian Resources business.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect, thanks, and then maybe just one follow-up on portfolio rationalizations. At this point, you guys have been very active over the last 12 to 18 months. Is it all done? Is there anything left to be done in terms of streamlining the portfolio? I'm not sure if you mentioned this in the prior comments or if I missed it. Within that regard, PAGP [Plains GP Holdings, LP], what would you need to see to further monetize that?","Christopher G. Stavros - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Ryan, most of the rationalization in terms of Oil & Gas and certainly Middle East operations is largely behind us. We've done that over the last year or so. From a corporate asset perspective, we still have, as you point out, the Plains units. So there are about 80 million units of that, and they've just gone through their simplification process. So we'll let that close out here formally in the latter part of the year, fourth quarter with their plan. And then this is not a strategic investment on our part, so I would tell you that we don't look to hold on to that longer term. So that's an option in terms of liquidity that we've got, market value $800 million or thereabouts.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everybody. Thank you. Vicki, you keep talking about the oil price you're assuming. I assume that that's $50-ish. Previously, you had said that you would add rigs once you became confident that $50 would be sustained along the strip. I assume that you're maintaining the view that $50-plus is what we're going to see and hence you want to accelerate.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's pretty close to right. We do expect it to be $50 or above in 2017, but certainly we're not as bullish as some people. We're taking, as I said, a conservative view, but it would be fundamentally above $50.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","And hence the minor acceleration I guess we'll call it?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","On the Permian deal, I think you said very clearly you don't want to make a corporate acquisition. I think you need something material to make it worth your while. My sense is that the recent $1 billion type asset packages would not really be of a sufficient scale for you guys to really work the CO2 business in the way that you want to.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The way we view it is the Permian, as you know, is a huge place. There are lots of opportunities. We're looking at this as a goal and an objective in terms of our total expansion, and there are multiple ways to get there. We could get there with several different options, and what we've done is prioritized our options. And we're working pretty much a lot of things to try to ensure that we reach our goals. But we're happy...","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Can you specify \u2013 sorry. I was going to ask you. Can you just specify what the goals are?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The goals are to try to match what our growth profile could be in EOR with Resources. And we haven't really put what that means in terms of exact production volumes or anything like that out there because it's hard to do at this point with respect to the EOR business. But we're really in a position because of where our operations are with respect EOR in the Permian, we've got the ability in multiple areas to play a Pac-Man approach where we can acquire a lot of smaller assets that could total up to make a material difference to us as a cumulative acquisition. So we're not opposed to looking at a variety of smaller deals. And again, because of our position, we would have the capability to do that and make it still fit within our goals to try to make sure that these are synergistic with our current operations.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","And then on the CO2 side?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's actually what I'm talking about. We're going to do the same thing in both Resources and CO2 because we have the ability around the areas that we currently operate to add additional properties.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So what you're saying is on either side you could go smaller or larger basically in terms of adding assets?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Is that something \u2013 I think you're more or less saying that you feel it's necessary if you're going to maintain the scale of growth that you're aiming for.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, the scale of growth is much easier in the Resources business. In the EOR business, the issue that we have today is that we're constrained by some of our infrastructure. So we feel like some of the expanding to our footprint would enable us to also expand our infrastructure to support some growth, accelerated growth, with not only what we have but what we could potentially pick up.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. And I think just finally for me, just you are somewhat short, I think, if not short, depending on your growth plans, of CO2 itself?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Currently, we don't see an issue with the CO2 that we would need to accelerate growth. We're trying to look at options for where we get the CO2, but I don't see that being a bottleneck for us. I see the current bottleneck being just the fact that it doesn't make sense to accelerate some of our floods where our plants are sized more appropriately for a full field development. So that's really some of the bottleneck is the infrastructure around the existing plants.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you very much, Vicki.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","And next we have Guy Baber from Simmons.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start off with the Permian unconventional production trajectory. You referenced improved confidence in that business in the prepared remarks, but it looks like the guidance today calls for a bit bigger decline over the back half of the year than we would have expected, down 10,000 barrels a day 3Q. Can you talk a little bit more about the declines you're seeing there, how conservative that guidance might be, just how that's shaping up?","And then secondly in the Permian also, you talked about year-on-year growth for unconventional in 2017. Can you talk about the spending level necessary relative to your $700 million or so budget this year that would be required to deliver production north of 120,000 barrels a day, as indicated in the slides?","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","Guy, this is Jody. I appreciate the question. With regard to the decline, it's really a function of the activity set from this last quarter. One of the things I discussed, we moved a rig and drilled a couple of Wichita Albany wells. We drilled a couple of CO2 source wells. So the activity set in this quarter was fairly low for Resources, which is indicative in the forecast for the third quarter. But in the back half of the year, those rigs are back in Resources. We're going to add rigs. And so we will flatten that decline toward the end of the year and then set us up with the right trajectory for production growth into 2017.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay, great. And then did you have a spending estimate relative to the $700 million budget this year that would drive north of 120,000 barrels a day of production next year?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We expect that would probably be in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range. But with the way the teams are still improving efficiencies and the well productivities are getting better, we're not prepared to commit to that completely at this point. Every time we set a target for those guys, they meet or exceed it, so we're not sure that that's the exact number. We'll know better about that by the end of the year as we prepare our final plans and we get a little more information from our Southeast New Mexico developments.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","That's very helpful. And then I wanted to ask one on Al Hosn, with obviously very strong performance during the quarter, above nameplate capacity. Can you talk a little bit more about what drove that? Is that type of performance sustainable? And are you already finding ways to sustainably I guess debottleneck that production into next year?","Edward A. Lowe - President, Oil and Gas, International","Hey, Guy. This is Sandy Lowe, good question. As we do with other large facilities like this, when everything is stable, we tend to test individual components and processes within the plant. And we've been doing that during the summer, which is the toughest time and the most relevant proving because of the relatively high heat in the area. And we've been able to show our guidance of 60,000 barrels per day equivalent for Oxy's share, and we've been up in the high-60,000 barrels per day with the promise to get into the 70,000 barrels per day just by pushing individual processes pretty hard. The main reason for this is to assess what the expansion would look like and which components we'd need, either total addition or enhancement, or some that just might be able to take higher load.","So we think that out of this will come, if you like, a new baseline, which could be 110% or 112%, and then from that \u2013 or even a bit higher. And from there we would design an expansion to get up to a good number. It's the sweet spot for the investment profile and the production profile, of course, working with our bigger partner, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. So that's where we are with it. I think it will be \u2013 the fact that we did this during the summer is probably pretty good for year-round enhanced production.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we have a question from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning. I guess to jump into the Permian area, I was wondering. With some of the areas you've expanded into, specifically in Southeast New Mexico, and your discussion of additional benches, is part of the rig count increase reflective of any an HBP issue arising here, or is all the acreage fairly well secure and just simply reflects, like you said, the price outlook and budgetary expectations?","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","Roger, most of our acreage is HBP. We have some drilling clocks, 180-day drilling clocks. But the activity set is driven by the value proposition and the returns from these investments. We have very few remaining lease obligation drilling wells, if any at all.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And then I'm not sure if this is for you, Jody, or for Vicki, but the way to think about the drilling efficiencies that you have achieved, if we essentially quadruple from the drilling level we've been or double from the year-end exit rate, the 15 rigs that were mentioned, what would you think of budgetarily or operationally is the right way to think about those efficiencies that can continue to be realized, or do we see the curve bend the other way? And this is not specifically looking at you, but as we add that many rigs, we're going to get some less efficient crews potentially into the field, and I'm just trying to understand on a longer-term basis what that may mean for well costs breakeven, cash flow and all.","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","I think that's manageable as long as the ramp up from an industry perspective is fairly moderate. What encourages me, at least for us at Oxy, is that we continue to have new ideas coming forward for cost efficiency. We've mentioned before, last year we had this cost stand-down day in Resources alone that generated over 1,400 ideas. We've put in place about half of those, and we're still vetting the other half for opportunities. And again, that crosses OpEx, capital, SG&A. We have some other technology things we're working on, on the drilling side that we think can provide efficiency gains.","We know at some point that the price cycle will turn around on services, but I think we're getting well prepared to offset that with efficiency, not just for us but for the suppliers as well. In the areas of integrated planning and logistics, crew utilization, equipment utilization, bundling of services, there are just a number of things that we think can help offset the potential for either efficiency or cost pressure as we move forward. So I think we can hold those rates of return.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And if I could sneak in one more along those lines of efficiencies, when you think about the additional rigs in the fourth quarter, what's roughly the time from adding that rig, spud date to first oil production? It sounds like you're pretty far ahead on the infrastructure side, so I would think pretty quick tie-ins.","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","It's fairly quick. It's really more a function is it a single well or is it a multi-well pad where you want to drill all the wells and then complete all the wells, so your time to market for that package is a little bit longer. But again, we're drilling in areas mostly where we've got infrastructure, and so adding wells is fairly quick. There's not a long delay.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would add to that that the way they're doing the developments now is they're doing pad drilling. So as Jody mentioned, the pad drilling will result in lumpy production. That's why we're not expecting a production impact from the increased activity levels this year, but we do expect it to show up in early Q1. And that's why we set the program up that way. It was really a part of our plan to start getting ready for 2017 production, so that's when we'll see the incremental from the increased activity.","Operator","And the next question is from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Thanks. With your Permian acreage, what's the chance of you doing swaps? And then my other question is with Colombia. What would the response time be for the water floods once you get going?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll start with Colombia first and then we'll let Jody take the Permian question. In Colombia, what we've done, we entered into \u2013 we currently have a water flood going there now that's successful. We got some additional intervals within that same area to develop two other zones. And we've been studying and putting the water flood pilot plans together, so we'll be starting the pilot first. So that's why we're adding the $20 million there to Colombia is to do the pilot so that we can get some information from that before we start into full field development. So the full field development of those water floods will come after we complete the pilot.","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","And, John, with regard to Permian acreage swaps, that's probably our most active area right now with our land business. And so most operators are wanting to drill longer laterals, 7,500-foot, 10,000-foot. And so acreage swaps, especially where you've got more neighboring acreage, trying to swap Midland for Delaware is a little tougher. But in a general geographic area, we're seeing quite a bit of activity, and we've taken advantage of that so that we can drill longer laterals.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. Vicki, back to Colombia, again, what response time, a year, six months? Do you have a sense?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we would expect that from the time that we start water injection that it would be within six months to a year.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And this concludes our call today. I will now turn the call back over to Chris Degner.","Christopher M.

Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. This quarter was another extremely difficult one for the industry. But we stayed focused on our game plan, addressing the things that are within our sphere of influence, so that we not only survive through this time but thrive.","We'll do this through full cycle cost leadership, optimal capital allocation, and maintaining our balance sheet. Superior access to and lower costs of capital positions us to invest in opportunities that will grow our business organically or through acquisitions. We believe the world will continue to need oil. And when markets demand production growth, they will first look to the Permian. And we will be ready.","First and foremost, we're focused on operational excellence to drive full cycle costs lower for all of our businesses. This requires subsurface and surface execution excellence.","In the first quarter we demonstrated good operational performance. We grew Permian Resources production by 30,000 BOE per day or 31% year over year. We performed above our expectations on new wells brought online, particularly in New Mexico. And we delivered better base production.","Permian production outperformance allowed us to exceed total production expectations for the quarter, despite lower than planned production from Al Hosn. Al Hosn was shut down for a successful warranty turnaround. But the shutdown was longer than expected. It is now back on production at full capacity. We also reduced our overall cash operating costs by 23% and achieved SG&A savings of 14% versus the first quarter of last year.","To further improve our overall well performance we're focusing a portion of our workforce on initiatives that will have a step change impact on costs in the future. Such as artificial lift design improvements, multi-bench development, increased integration of new 3D seismic surveys, and the application of data analytics into our reservoir characterization.","To incentivize our management and employees we developed a target metric, called total spend per barrel, which is our cash, operating capital, and SG&A costs, divided by our total production. Our target for 2016 is almost 30% lower than 2015's actual total spend. This is an aggressive target, especially in view of the fact that we reduced total spend per barrel from over $60 to $40 in 2015.","Our 2016 capital program is $3 billion, a 50% reduction from 2015. We're on track to achieve this with first quarter capital spend of $687 million. Our capital is focused in our core areas.","Taking advantage of reduced cost of labor and materials in this environment, we shifted more capital to Permian EOR to modify and expand existing facilities, increasing our capacity to handle and inject greater quantities of CO2. This will enable us to implement additional CO2 projects and further grow oil production. These projects will have a longer duration with typical production response time of 1 year to 2 years. By then we expect prices to be higher than they are today. We're also targeting lower-cost projects, including residual oil zone CO2 floods, where development costs are between $3 and $7 per BOE.","In Permian Resources our development activities are in the Midland and Delaware basins, in areas where we have existing infrastructure, allowing us to achieve higher returns. We are maintaining minimal activity levels, sufficient to continue to improve execution efficiencies and well production performance. This allows us to retain our inventory of shorter cycle, unconventional wells for development during an improved environment.","In the Chemicals business the Ingleside cracker remains on budget and on time for startup in the first quarter of 2017.","Our balance sheet remains strong on an absolute basis and relative to our peers. In the first quarter we closed on $285 million of asset sales in the Piceance Basin, the Dallas Tower, and a small specialty chemical operation. We received $550 million of proceeds from our settlement with Ecuador.","In April we issued $2.75 billion of bonds that will be used to retire and call about $2 billion of debt maturing in 2016 and 2017. We ended the first quarter with $3.2 billion, which is ample cash and liquidity to fund our capital program and dividends.","With a strong start in the first quarter we've raised our production guidance on our core assets to a range of 585,000 BOE to 600,000 BOE per day. Overall domestic production is anticipated to decline slightly through the year, primarily due to the declining natural gas and NGL volumes, caused by the curtailment of drilling activity in our gas assets in 2014.","We expect a modest increase in production from Permian Resources versus last year. And Permian EOR production will remain flat.","In our capital programs we expect slightly higher spending in the second and third quarters due to the timing of major projects in our Chemicals and Midstream segments. As I mentioned earlier our full year production will not exceed \u2013 our program, our capital program will not exceed $3 billion. This plan should approximate our expected cash from operations at current commodity prices.","In summary, I'd like to thank our employees for their commitment to excellence in both safety and operations during these challenging times. They're continuing to find ways to add value through increased sales and cost reductions across all segments of our company. While the macro environment remains challenging for the industry, we believe our continued focus on returns, improved cost structure, and a strong balance sheet provide us with the opportunity to emerge from the current cycle as a stronger company relative to our peers.","Finally, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Steve Chazen. While he's not here today, I know he will eventually listen to this call. On behalf of investors, the Board of Directors, and employees, I would like to thank Steve for his leadership and outstanding service to Occidental over his 22-year career. He shaped our company into what it is today. And we're grateful to him for that.","I'll now turn the call to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results and detailed guidance.","Christopher G. Stavros - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. As Vicki noted, despite the severe weakness in product prices during the quarter, our business benefited from higher than expected production volumes from our ongoing domestic operations, lower cash operating costs, and improved capital efficiency. These factors help support our operating cash flow during the quarter. This, in combination with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, has allowed us to weather the continued weak product price environment.","Our core financial results for the first quarter of 2016 were a loss of $426 million or $0.56 per diluted share, a decrease from both the year ago quarter and also the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline in both sequential and year-over-year core results were attributable to much weaker commodity prices, which more than offset the benefit from lower costs.","Reported results for GAAP purposes during the first quarter of 2016 was income of $78 million or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $218 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the prior year period. Reported results included gains on asset sales of $87 million after tax, and $438 million after tax as a result of proceeds received from the settlement with Ecuador, partially offset by several non-cash charges.","Oil and Gas core after tax results for the first quarter of 2016 were a loss of $388 million, a sequential decline of about $200 million, mainly due to lower commodity prices, partially offset by improved cash operating costs. Our first quarter 2016 worldwide realized oil price of $29.42 per barrel fell by nearly $10 a barrel or nearly 25% compared to prices during last year's fourth quarter.","Total company Oil and Gas production volumes from our ongoing operations averaged 590,000 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2016, 59,000 BOE per day higher than the prior year period, although down 7,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarterly basis. This was well above the higher end range of 570,000 BOE to 585,000 BOE per day for full year 2016 production guidance that we provided earlier this year.","Total domestic production volumes climbed 3% sequentially at 307,000 BOE per day during the first quarter. Our domestic oil production was 197,000 barrels per day, up 7,000 barrels per day from last year's fourth quarter and 17,000 barrels per day higher from the same period a year ago.","Production in our Permian Resources business grew to 128,000 BOE per day during the first quarter of 2016, compared to 118,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter, far exceeding our earlier guidance of 121,000 BOE per day for the period. Permian Resources volumes grew by more than 30% compared to the year ago period.","International production from ongoing operations was 283,000 BOE per day during the first quarter of 2016, down 16,000 BOE per day compared to the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to the scheduled first quarter warranty shut down at the Al Hosn gas plant.","Total production from our ongoing operations excludes volumes of 67,000 BOE per day from assets we have either divested or exited or are in the process of exiting. Domestically, this includes our Williston operations, which we sold in November 2015, and our Piceance operations, which were sold in March of 2016. Tables showing volumes both on a reported basis and also from pro forma ongoing operations are included in the schedules along with our press release.","Domestic Oil and Gas cash operating costs from ongoing operations declined to $11.86 per BOE in the first quarter, compared to $12.28 per BOE during the fourth quarter of 2015 and 13% below full year 2015 costs of $13.58 per BOE. The reduction in costs is mainly a result of improved efficiency around our surface operations and maintenance. Overall Oil and Gas DD&A for the first quarter of 2016 was $15.61 per BOE, compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015.","Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $1.15 per BOE for the first quarter, compared to $1.32 per BOE during 2015. First quarter exploration expense was $9 million.","Chemicals first quarter 2016 pre-tax core earnings were $126 million, compared with earnings of $116 million during last year's fourth quarter and $139 million in the year ago period. The sequential improvement in earnings reflected higher sales volumes across most product lines compared with lower natural gas costs, partly offset by weaker PVC, VCM, and caustic soda pricing. Weakness was also seen in the calcium chloride business as a result of the unseasonably warm winter evidenced in key markets, combined with the industry slowdown in fracking activity.","Chemicals also closed on the sales of its corporate headquarters building in Dallas and a small specialty chemical operation, which together resulted in pre-tax gains of roughly $90 million. And those are excluded from our core Chemical earnings.","Midstream pre-tax core results were a loss of $95 million for the first quarter of 2016, compared to a loss of $45 million in the fourth quarter of last year and a loss of $5 million in the prior year first quarter. The sequential decline was mainly attributable to lower midstream income from Al Hosn due to the warranty shutdown in the quarter and planned maintenance at the Dolphin [Gas] Project, which led to lower foreign pipeline income.","Looking at our cash flows for the first quarter, we began the year with $4.4 billion of cash on hand. During the first quarter we generated $825 million of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes. Net working capital changes consumed $320 million of cash during the period. The use was related to the reduction in capital spending associated with deceleration of drilling activity, cyclical payments of property taxes and employee severance-related costs, and payment of liabilities accrued at year end related to the exit or exiting from some international operations.","Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $685 million, a 41% decline from the $1.2 billion spent in the fourth quarter of 2015. While our first quarter capital was lower than expected, this was due to a deferral of some outlays in Midstream and Chemicals into the second and third quarters.","Our 2016 total company capital program remains on track to be between $2.8 billion to $3 billion and ending the year at a rate similar to the first quarter as committed project capital winds down.","We received $285 million from the sale of non-core assets in the Piceance Basin sale of some chemical assets as I noted earlier. We also collected $550 million from our settlement with Ecuador during the first quarter and expect to receive payment of more than $300 million in the coming months. These proceeds have been classified as discontinued operations in the cash flow statement.","During the quarter we retired $700 million of debt which matured in February and paid $575 million in dividends. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $3.2 billion.","On April 4 of this year, we completed a $2.75 billion three tranche senior notes offering with attractive coupon rates of 2.6%, 3.4%, and 4.4% on the 6-year, 10-year, and 30-year notes respectively. Primary use of the proceeds will go towards refinancing of $750 million in notes that mature on June of this year. And we've also exercised our early redemption option to call $1.25 billion of notes that were scheduled to mature in February of 2017.","After this redemption, Oxy's total outstanding debt will be approximately $8.3 billion, essentially the same as at the end of 2015. Importantly, this transaction extended the life of our debt maturities by 5 years with our next maturity not scheduled until February 2018. Moody's currently rates Oxy at A3 stable, and S&P rates us at straight A stable.","Turning to guidance. As Vicki highlighted, we are raising our full year 2016 production guidance from a range of 2% to 4% previously, to 4% to 6%, essentially a 2% increase. We're within a new range of 585,000 BOE to 600,000 BOE per day for the full year. The increase will be accomplished without any change to our original capital program and is primarily a result of better than expected production in our domestic operations. Specifically, results in the Permian Resources continue to outperform our expectations, due to improved well productivity and better management around our base volumes.","Turning to guidance for the second quarter. We expect our total Oil and Gas production pro forma for ongoing operations to increase sequentially to a range of 600,000 BOE to 610,000 BOE per day, as Al Hosn and Dolphin ramp back up from the first quarter scheduled turnarounds. And as gas production from Oman's Block 62 continues to rise towards full production levels. Domestically, we expect production to be flattish with the first quarter levels or about 307,000 BOE per day.","Second quarter should also see production in Permian Resources similar to the first quarter, despite the slowdown in activity. We expect production in Permian Resources to decline modestly during the second half of 2016. Variability around the outcome will be a function of well performance, capturing further efficiency gains and our ability to continue to manage base production. Permian EOR volume should remain relatively steady at about 145,000 BOE per day, while also providing stable cash flow.","Our DD&A expense for Oil and Gas is still expected to be approximately $15 per BOE during 2016. And depreciation of the Oil and Gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1 billion. The combined appreciation for the Chemical and Midstream segment should be approximately $670 million for the year. Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pre-tax for the second quarter.","Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every dollar per barrel change in WTI. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $50 million.","Our Midstream operations has exposure to two separate and different lines of businesses. The results of our Oil and Gas marketing and gas processing businesses are inherently volatile and sensitive to changes in commodity prices and price differentials. Conversely, our pipeline and transportation operations and partial ownership interest of the Plains All American GP provide a stream of more stable and predictable income and cash flow.","With regard to our marketing business we have supply commitments and takeaway capacity to handle our Permian and equity production volumes in addition to third party volumes. The downturn in oil prices has slowed production growth in the Permian, creating a situation of overbuilt infrastructure, where takeaway capacity exceeds production.","Price differentials between the Permian and Gulf Coast have shrunk to levels that do not fully cover our cost of transportation. A gradual improvement in oil prices should incentivize production growth in the Permian Basin. And we expect price differentials to widen, as production fills some of the excess takeaway capacity over time.","Our domestic gas processing business supports domestic upstream production. Margins in this business have suffered, as NGL prices have dropped significantly. The recent quarterly losses incurred in the Midstream business are a direct result of these factors.","In Chemicals we anticipate pre-tax earnings of about $100 million for the second quarter. The expected sequential decline in income is due to planned maintenance outages at several of our chloro-vinyl plants during the quarter. While price support for chloro-vinyls has been lackluster so far this year, the combination of both scheduled and unscheduled industry outages are expected to tighten market conditions for both vinyls and caustic soda into the second half of this year.","The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 29% for the first quarter of 2016. Using current strip prices for Oil and Gas, we expect 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 36%, and our international tax rate to be about 76%.","Turning to our overall costs. Total spend per barrel, as Vicki mentioned, was added as a new internal performance metric last year, because of OXY's increased focus on operational efficiency, especially in consideration of the sharp decline in commodity prices. This metric is defined as the total cost per BOE of production and includes capital spending, cash operating costs, and G&A costs.","A portion of senior management's incentive compensation is directly aligned with this performance metric, as it focuses our efforts on efficiency, financial returns, and free cash flow generation. This efficiency metric is designed to help manage the reduction in overall spending, while rewarding production growth.","During 2015 we were successful in reducing our total spend per BOE by more than 30% compared to the prior year to approximately $40 per BOE. A reduction in our total spend per BOE of similar proportion is also targeted for 2016.","I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who will discuss activity around our Permian operations.","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll review the highlights of our Permian Resources and Permian EOR results in the first quarter, provide guidance on our program for the remainder of the year.","As Vicki highlighted previously with regard to capital priorities, due to the current oil price environment, our focus has been to prudently allocate capital to our Permian Basin businesses. With this in mind our Permian Resources operation is being managed to maximize the value of our workforce and enhance operational capabilities, invest in areas with existing infrastructure, and gather critical appraisal information to drive better well productivity.","In Permian EOR we've proportionally increased the capital allocated to this long lived business to expand CO2 injection capacity and facilities and to bring forward the resource potential. We continue to invest heavily in the application of geoscience and data analytics into our development strategy to ensure we are competitively positioned to take advantage of a sustained improvement in commodity prices.","Turning to Permian Resources. In the first quarter we achieved record daily production of 128,000 BOE per day, a 31% increase versus the prior year. Oil production increased to 84,000 barrels per day, an 11% increase from the previous quarter and a 35% increase from a year ago. Additionally, we have leveraged and extended our industry leading practices from our EOR business to drive improvements in base management in order to minimize decline.","Our Delaware Basin well performance continues to be strong. We placed 15 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the first quarter. We continued to increase well productivity by increasing contact with a reservoir near the wellbore, utilizing higher cluster density, higher proppant loads, and drilling longer laterals.","For example, the Vanguard 3 number 15-H achieved a peak rate of 2,099 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,308 BOE per day. The HB Morrison B 13H, with a 10,000-foot lateral, achieved a peak rate of 2,335 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,781 BOE per day.","Our successful efforts of applying geologic and reservoir parameters into our completion design continues to drive breakthroughs in well productivity and will reduce the economic hurdle point of our inventory.","In the Delaware Basin our Wolfcamp A 4,500-foot well cost decreased by about 18% from the 2015 cost of $7.7 million to a current cost of $6.3 million. We reduced our drilling time by 6 days from the 2015 average of 25 days to 19 days, measured by rig release to rig release. We expect the cost and productivity improvements in drilling, completions, and facilities to continue as we progress our program.","In New Mexico we are delivering play-leading wells by applying our understanding of geologic and reservoir parameters into our completion design. We are enthusiastic about superior reservoir quality and multi-bench potential in this play. During the first quarter we placed six horizontal wells on production in the Second Bone Spring in New Mexico. One of our best well results to date, the Second Bone Spring Cedar Canyon 23 Federal 5H produced a peak rate of 2,820 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,879 BOE per day at an 82% oil cut.","We increased proppant from 1,000 pounds to 1,500 pounds per foot and trialed two wells with 2,000 pounds per foot. This has resulted in greater contact with the reservoir closer to the wellbore, as compared to the prior completion design. As a result of these advancements in our completion design, the last four Cedar Canyon wells put on production have achieved 90-day cumulative production totals, approximately double the prior results. We'll continue to leverage our geo-driven analytics to identify advancements in completion design. And we'll test more aggressive cluster spacing, more clusters per stage, and slick water fluid systems in the second half of 2016.","Drilling and completion costs continue to improve in New Mexico as well, reducing costs per lateral foot by over 20%, resulting in a current completed well cost, including hookup, of $5.9 million. We expect continued improvement and efficiency gains and have targeted well cost of $5.5 million for our 4,500-foot Second Bone Spring wells in the second half of 2016.","In the East Midland Basin we brought the Shields 3105 1WA well online in the first quarter at a peak rate of 1,606 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,395 BOE per day. We also brought online the Polo 1605A at a peak rate of 1,265 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,018 BOE per day. Both wells are producing with high oil cuts.","In the Midland Basin we made similar improvements in well cost and drilling days in drilling the Wolfcamp A formation. We reduced the cost of these 7,500-foot horizontal wells by 14% from the 2015 cost of $7.1 million to a current cost of $6.1 million. We reduced our drilling days as measured by rig release to rig release by 16% from 19 days in 2015 to 16 days in the first quarter.","In Permian Resources we're continuing to lower field operating expenses through optimized water handling, lower work over expenses, and better down hole performance. Since the first quarter of 2015, we've reduced our operating costs per barrel by 33% and continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements. We'll maintain flexibility to ramp up our rig activity in the fourth quarter of 2016 and full year 2017, should prices exhibit fundamental stability above the current strip prices.","In Permian EOR we continue to lower our drilling cost and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. With resilient base production and low capital requirements, Permian EOR continues to generate free cash flow at low product prices. Drilling costs are running 25% below our benchmark target, and we've lowered our cash operating expenses by 21%, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and injectant costs.","Phase 1 of CO2 injection at South Hobbs continues to perform well. Additionally, the initial implementation of the residual oil zone, or ROZ, projects are underway at South Hobbs and West Seminole. The ROZ development is a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval. This activity is economic in a low price environment, because we typically utilize work over rigs to drill the extra depth into the CO2 floodable sections of the reservoir. The residual oil zone underlies most of our major EOR properties and can be developed between $3 and $7 a barrel.","In summary, we're focusing our resources to achieve four core goals: Accelerate geo-science, characterization, and modeling programs to enhance recovery, productivity, and field economic returns; minimize base decline and set up major growth programs in both resources and EOR businesses; focus on game changing technologies and applications; and accelerate continued improvements in both execution and cost.","We expect to run between four to five rigs in our Permian business over the remainder of the year. If we do see evidence of sustained price recovery with improved fundamentals, we could gradually add rigs at a modest pace to ensure our gains and efficiencies are preserved.","Our technical staff and engineers will focus on long term projects, enhance base production, and prepare full field development plans to ramp up activity when oil prices recover. We're taking appropriate steps to preserve the efficiency gains achieved and are well positioned for growth as prices recover.","Thank you. And I'll now hand it back to Chris Degner.","Christopher M. Degner - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Jody. And, Emily, we'd now like to open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. And congratulations, Vicki, on officially assuming the CEO role.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","To start, Vicki, as new CEO, any general strategic thoughts on how you see Oxy's portfolio changing over time? Or through an ultimate upcycle? I know the portfolio was in the middle of a restructuring when the commodity market began falling apart. And should we expect that strategy reasserts in a recovery? Or what are your thoughts there?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we've almost done all that we wanted to do with our portfolio optimization. The main thing that we wanted to do was to exit those areas that were not core for us, where we didn't really have a competitive advantage and therefore were going to have a really hard time truly adding value at the rate and the delivery that Permian Resources and the Permian EOR can give us. So we \u2013 the remaining area that we are now that's non-core that we will be continuing to reduce our exposure to will be in Bahrain. Libya, where we've stopped all investment there.","So now we're down to the core areas of Abu Dhabi, Oman, and Qatar in the Middle East, Colombia in South America, the Permian in the U.S. along with South Texas. So we view the Permian, Colombia, and the three areas in the Middle East to still have opportunities for us to continue to grow. And we're going to try to restrict our activities to just those areas, because the one thing that we think will make us better and where we can continue to get better is to focus. And again to focus in areas where we have a competitive advantage. And we believe that we do in all those areas.","So our growth opportunities in the future will be focused on just those areas, with a priority being given to the Permian Basin. Because of our size, our exposure there, we feel like that's where we get the most value for the dollars that we invest. So we would prioritize the Permian as a growth strategy.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That makes sense. And I know the Permian delivered strong results in the quarter. I know on the last call you'd mentioned the Permian Resources, 20% in future growth. And maybe you can elaborate that, given the performance and your opening comments on where you'd add capital? And where that mix and where that rig count can optimally go in an upcycle? I know you're used four rigs here, which is under your 24 peak. And I mean you even had ambitions to go higher at that point. So just any thoughts on how that mix changes in your ultimate rig redeployment strategy?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'll talk first about the 20% that I mentioned. Really the 20% that I'd mentioned in terms of what we expect ultimately our Resources business to contribute to total production. That comment was driven by the fact that we were really excited about our EOR business, and the fact that our teams over the past year-and-a-half have been working on ways to expand our capacity there, so that we could actually accelerate some of our development.","We have about 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent remaining reserves and potential in EOR. And we want to \u2013 at our current pace of development that would take about 22 years. So we really wanted to accelerate that. But when we looked at cases where we would need to build a new massive mega plant to do that, it really didn't add the value that met our hurdles.","So what our teams have done now is they've actually found ways to expand our existing infrastructure for a much lower cost. So we're really excited about being able to over the next 3 years to 5 years start to accelerate EOR. And the good thing about that is our EOR business has just a 4% decline. So we think that combining it with the continued growth from our Resources should get us to a point where we can manage the overall base decline of the company to a point where we can better weather these down cycles that are always going to occur at points as we go forward.","So right now we \u2013 what we would do in the short term, though, as we're waiting for our facilities expansion in EOR, is any improvements in oil prices to a level that's sufficient to enable us to be able to ramp up, that activity would go first to Resources. So for example, this year we have about $500 million committed capital that will come off next year. And so we expect next year that we would shift that $500 million, most of that, to Permian Resources to continue the growth that we had started there.","In terms of rigs, it's hard to estimate what our rig count would be because our teams are continuing to improve their efficiencies, they're continuing to reduce the days required to drill per well. So we would look at it more from a targeted production sample. And then Jody and his team would have to figure out what number of rigs that would require. And based on the productivity of the wells and the improved efficiencies, I think they want to go through another couple of quarters to get an idea of how much better that's getting before they put any estimates together. But we're really encouraged by what we're seeing.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. And I'm assuming Steve is listening in somewhere, so we wish him well. And, Vicki, congratulations.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I have a follow-up actually to Evan's question on CO2. And it goes back to an announcement at the beginning of the year that you had been awarded the Pinon Field in the West Texas Overthrust from SandRidge, and all the facilities went along with that. Well, I seem to recall that then essentially gives you a CO2 source. And I'm wondering how that fits into the CO2 strategy as it relates to potentially additional capacity? So I wonder if you could speak to that first? Then I have a follow up please.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We \u2013 as you said we just got that. We haven't had it very long. But our teams are already starting to work there and to see potential there.","When SandRidge was developing it, they were developing it more for the hydrocarbons. Our teams are looking more \u2013 at it more from a standpoint of looking for CO2. And they're \u2013 so they're seeing some opportunities for us to increase our delivery through Century Plant for CO2. So that's going to help us going forward.","Now that for us is not something that we absolutely have to have to begin our acceleration. But it does help. And it could help to lower our cost. So that will play a part in our strategy.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perhaps a related question. Vicki, you continue to show this lovely bubble map with all your CO2 competitors. And of course there's been a lot of chatter about whether M&A could be a factor there. So any additional thoughts you could give us on how this \u2013 the acquisition opportunity to look in that part of the business? And I do have one final one, if I may please?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. We \u2013 as I said Permian will be our highest priority in terms of looking for growth potential and for acquisitions of assets. As other companies are still in the process of streamlining their portfolios, we're hoping that there will be properties that come available, assets that they may decide that are no longer core to them. We're staying abreast of that. And we're actually \u2013 we are proactively talking to other companies, some not on the list that you see on the slide. Some are companies that may have just water flood opportunities that we can expand into for future CO2 development.","But we're certainly interested in both EOR assets, as well as resources. But the problem with the resources assets currently is that the prices are still very high for those.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. And my final one if I may. I think this might be for Chris. A couple of \u2013 a couple quarters ago you gave us a slide showing the cash burn in the non-core assets, the stuff that basically you're trying to exit. I think it was at $100 oil. I wonder if you could you share with us what that cash burn associated with those was at the \u2013 in the first quarter? And I'll leave it there. Thanks","Christopher G. Stavros - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It really wasn't much, Doug, because to some extent we \u2013 or to a large extent we really exited most of those areas. So the cash burn that we had seen was really for the most part over with.","And through the fourth quarter there may have been a little bit in the way of working capital. If you want to call it sort of $100 million more or less, as we continue to look at exiting scenarios internationally. But by and large it's largely through.","I'd point out too that the only thing left really in terms of the difference between what we've defined as sort of core \u2013 non-core or core and not the ongoing operations at this point is really the Bahrain assets or operations. So that's really it. And so I think we're most of the way through","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Chris, does that explain the DD&A drop on the Middle East as well?","Christopher G. Stavros - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, that's part of it. And also the uplift or continued ramp at Al Hosn.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Our next question is from Philip Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","The first question is just on the Permian Resources and just the overall volume outlook for the year. If I look at what you achieved in 1Q on the core piece, and then your guidance for 2Q, that's running \u2013 at the midpoint you're running at about 597,000 BOE per day. So it's already toward the upper end of the full year outlook. So just wondering maybe what moving pieces we should think about in the back half? And I guess in particular Permian Resources, how you might think about at the current prices what the exit rate would be there in the fourth quarter?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Again getting back to what I said earlier, we're seeing better productivity from our wells. And we're particularly excited about the New Mexico wells. So we're really reluctant at this point to give a forecast. And Jody and his team would like to have at least one more quarter to see how that development will progress to determine not only what we expect Q3 and Q4 to look like. But also whether or not he might add another rig. Jody? You might have some more comments on that?","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","Yeah, Vicki. I think the other thing that we want to see is the effect of our base management programs. We're having some really good success there with pump maintenance, with surveillance activities, re-completions. And that's providing some uplift as well. So we want to see all those play out before kind of committing to the back half","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Sure. Okay. And I guess there was a comment in the slides about the development and resources focusing on fields with existing infrastructure. So I was just curious is there a point at which you think you might need to add some chunky infrastructure spend in resources that could come up against a constraint?","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","At this point we've got a pretty good inventory in those areas with the infrastructure that meet a pretty low price hurdle. So we'll have some infrastructure, but not the really big stuff in the near term.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. My last question is just on Midstream. Obviously you highlighted the multiple elements of what's been hampering that business for the past few quarters. I guess if you look out in a more normalized world \u2013 I know I asked this of Steve a couple quarters ago \u2013 but I mean what do you think, Vicki, is the kind of true earnings power of this business in terms of just higher level or maybe the sub-component? So any color you could provide?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's in a normal world \u2013 and that would be one where we would expect to see production increasing in the Permian and NGL and gas prices recovering to some degree \u2013 we would expect to see in the neighborhood of $100 million to $200 million income at least from the Midstream business.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. I wanted to come back to the Bone Springs. I mean obviously you've got a big acreage position there. So the improvement there obviously has a big impact on your resource base. So maybe just a bit of additional color around whether this is a particular geological sweet spot? Or whether you think the results you've seen extend across a large portion of your acreage?","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","Yeah. Thanks, Ed. I think we see this extending across a good portion of that acreage. It's not just in that Cedar Canyon area that we've showed some highlights on. We're really encouraged with New Mexico.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And in terms of stack pay potential outside of the Bone Springs?","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","Multiple benches. And again that's going to be a function of where you are. Some benches are better and some geographic areas. But at least two and in some cases upwards of four.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then a different trajectory just on costs. Obviously costs are very low today. And that's helping everyone in the industry. As the industry starts to get back to work, costs may start to inflate. Any thoughts about trying to lock in some of these sort of lower margins for longer \u2013 very low cost structures, I should say.","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","Yeah. Good question, Ed. Trying to predict the time where that supply\/demand balance occurs is a little bit like trying to predict oil prices.","Today there's a pretty good excessive capacity in the market. But having said that a significant portion of our improvements are due to things like design changes, technology improvements, utilizing some proprietary things such as Oxy Drilling Dynamics. We've invented some special stabilizers and drilling. Integrated planning, manufacturing mode, all those things are really driving the portion of \u2013 the big portion of our cost improvements. And those are sustainable.","We've maintained our workforce. So when we ramp back up we won't have to access high cost consultants to run rigs and run frac cores. And we've recently made an alignment change with our supply chain organization, where they've been integrated into operations as part of our integrated planning teams.","And so the result of that is we've got better alignment of our commercial and our technical strategies to the actual value drivers in each one of those programs. And that lets us drive productivity, utilization, logistics improvements. And that takes cost out of the system, not only for us but for our suppliers.","And so in most cases price is important, but it's not the needle mover. So but we are in conversations with our strategic suppliers to determine ways we can better align our operations, drive out combined system costs, and focus on goals where we've got common success. And given our scale in the Permian, we're getting pretty considerable interest.","So we continue to make immediate improvements to cash flow and cost. We're proactively taking actions to mitigate against inflation in a higher WTI environment. I mean at the end of the day we'll be ready","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then, sorry, small one. Just on the EURs in the Bone Springs, any update?","Jody Elliott - President, Domestic Oil and Gas","Again we take a pretty measured approach to updating our EURs in our inventory. We want to see more production, better understand GOR modeling. And so with a little bit more time we'll update our EURs. But we are really encouraged by the results we're seeing with kind of generation two, generation three, not only frac designs but our modeling efforts. We would expect those to help across the board","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sorry, I did get pulled away briefly, so I apologize if this was asked. But as you think about increasing spending, increasing the rig count, what oil price and what magnitude should we think about in either of those categories?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, what I'd say about that is we really don't have a set price at which we would increase. We want to see some sustainable improvement with prices. And we want to make sure that the fundamentals support prices.","I know a lot of people are saying that around $50 they would start to ramp up. We have a very deep inventory in both resources and the EOR business that would generate really good returns at $50. We're pretty committed to staying at the $3 billion capital range for this year.","But Jody and his team in the Permian business are looking at opportunities to ramp up in those areas where they've already started development. And we're prepared to do it when prices do recover. But we would expect that to be maybe adding a rig toward the end of this year. And then ramping up at some point next year again, if prices look like they're going to be in a range that's sustainable.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And kind of following up I think originally on Evan's question about the portfolio. And again I apologize. I did get pulled away. But the \u2013 you've done the disposition side. A few more things you might do. Acquisition wise, you've talked a lot here about opportunities in Southeast New Mexico and all that. Are there other areas you want to expand your footprint in within the Permian Basin?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We're looking at all areas within the Permian Basin. We're \u2013 for Resources we would look in Delaware [Basin], Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform. We'd also look in some of those same areas, particularly Central Basin Platform and parts of the Midland Basin for EOR opportunities. So we're definitely looking around the Permian.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just a final follow-up on that. We've heard obviously prices in the Permian have stayed stronger than most other regions. Any movement? I mean does anything look more affordable today? Or as you think about maybe a more sustained $50 to $60 oil price environment, are there things that look more attractive than maybe they have over the last several quarters?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we look at the long view of things. So the issue has not been with us in terms of what we would be willing to go out and do from a pricing standpoint, because we \u2013 especially around EOR assets, those are assets that produce 50 years, 60 years, 70 years. So we're taking a long view on looking at acquisition opportunities with both EOR assets and Resources.","The issue has been with some of the sellers who seem to believe that prices were going to really spike back up to $80, $90, $100. And it seems now that both the outlook for prices is starting to come closer together between the buyers and the sellers. But not quite on the Resources side, where we think it ought to be.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. I guess we can all dream about $80 to $90 oil, even if we don't see it.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons. Please go ahead.","Guy A. Baber IV - Simmons & Company","Thanks for taking my question. Vicki, Oxy has not made the head count reductions that many of your peers have made. Can you talk about that decision and the internal capability that you're maintaining?","And then in your prepared comments you noted that the workforce is focused on initiatives that could have a step function improvement on your performance. Can you just elaborate on those comments? The value you can create and how you retain capability to respond when higher activity levels might be necessary? And does that differentiate Oxy from peers in your mind?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that what we've done with our staff has definitely differentiated us from our competition. And I think it's a contrarian view to how one should manage through a cycle like this.","What we've done is we made the commitment to our employees that we were going to keep our staffing level. We did have just a voluntary separation program at the beginning, where some of our later career people who had family issues and needs to go and to leave the company. We allowed some people to leave. But we were selective in terms of trying to make sure that we lost no capability internally. And so those people that did leave had in most cases done a great job of training and mentoring people to take their place.","So what we've ended up with is a very capable workforce that has the skills and experience necessary in the mid-career to later career experiences. But also some early career people who have done just a phenomenal job of helping us through this down cycle.","Because what we did is to try to ensure that we were reducing cost, we took some of our early career people, sent them to the field. They replaced contractors in both our production operations, our well servicing, and our drilling activities. And so they were replacing contractors who had been doing these jobs for a number of years, had a lot of experience. And our early career people went out there, learned it quickly.","And because of the way they view things and their fresh approach to asking questions and looking at things differently, we expected them to go out there mostly to learn. But they actually went out there to learn, they added value, they improved logistics, and improved efficiencies. And not only was it a cost reduction from the elimination of contractors, but it was actually an improvement, because they did a fabulous job to improve efficiencies and to think about how to do things differently.","Our field staff on the other hand, what they did is they got really aggressive and proactive with mentoring these early career people. And so the combination of both our experienced staff and our earlier career staff working together, they have really added value. And that's part of the reason that our efficiencies are improving. We're seeing these cost reductions in the field. We have to attribute that to both the early career and the mentors out in the field.","In addition to that, what we're doing is we know that to be successful for the long haul with an industry that has changed now \u2013 and the industry that we're facing today has reservoirs that are tougher to develop, costlier. And really a world that's more complex than it used to be.","So what we feel like is we've got to get to the absolute lowest possible cost structure to ensure that we have sufficient margins in a wider price range than what we've worked in in the past. And so to do that we feel like you can't do business as usual. You really have to take a different approach to how you're looking at cost structure reductions.","And so we've got teams that are working on things that are further out. Some of which I can't talk about right now. But they're looking at how do we change the cost structure of 2018, 2019? What we have to do now to do that?","And so they're working on the longer view. And these are some of the people that were deployed to these project groups from the drilling and completion operations since we had the major reduction in that activity.","What we've found is by giving our staff more time to become more strategic and innovative, they're delivering value. So we not only have a commitment from our management to keep our staff, our staff has more than paid for that decision by their delivery and their performance. And they're continuing to exceed our expectations. Every time it seems that we set targets for them, they exceed it, because they're not \u2013 they recognize that we've made the commitment. So they've already also made the commitment. And they're just \u2013 they've been phenomenal.","And our staff is very, very engaged. And I believe we'll come through this cycle with a much more committed, loyal, and highly skilled workforce that will be well prepared for any kind of ramp up that we'll see over the next couple years.","Guy A. Baber IV - Simmons & Company","That's very helpful, Vicki. And then my follow-up is when we think about growth for Oxy, we obviously typically think about Permian Resources, now EOR over time. But do you have any update to share or any new thoughts around whether you're becoming more optimistic on the potential for growth opportunities around your core Middle East operations? And any update on over what timeframe those opportunities might materialize? And I'm thinking of potential opportunities in the UAE or elsewhere for example.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I would say while we very much value our operations in Oman and Qatar, we also \u2013 I've been very impressed with the UAE, especially the leadership in Abu Dhabi. And they're very progressive. And we enjoy doing business there. We've had success with a couple of companies there, Mubadala when we developed the Dolphin Project. And now ADNOC in the Al Hosn Project. We've seen that our team partners very well with both of those companies. And both of those projects were highly successful.","Now I'm going to let Sandy talk about a project that we just entered into an agreement a year ago or so to look at some offshore fields there. This is also a project I'm really excited about.","And before I hand it to Sandy to talk about that, I would say in Oman, Block 62, we've just brought on some gas production there, which also is another growth opportunity for us there. So we still believe there are opportunities to grow in the Middle East. I'll hand it over to Sandy.","Edward A. Lowe - President, Oil and Gas, International","Thank you, Vicki. We are \u2013 we've entered into an agreement with ADNOC on the Hail and Ghasha fields. These are fields that have been producing oil for some time. And they have had the gas discoveries, some going back 40 years.","So we've worked up an appraisal program for a number of fields. And there's been a few additional fields thrown in, called the Dalma fields to determine just what and when we should be developing. Make a recommendation to the state as to how they can both increase their available gas supply, but also further develop some of the hydrocarbons that have not yet been developed, other liquids included.","We've just amended that agreement to add a partner of \u2013 the Austrian state oil company, who we've partnered with in many places. So there's a pretty robust team working appraisal and engineering development.","One other area of more immediate growth is that we recently \u2013 Vicki went to the region to participate in the inauguration of the Al Hosn facilities. And it appears that we are well along the way to getting an agreement to expand the Al Hosn plant. Engineering is underway. And we're having further discussions later this month to determine just on what schedule and how we would do that.","So those are the good areas of growth, both medium term and long term.","Guy A.

Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll begin our fourth quarter results followed by our 2018 achievements, a plan for the year ahead and an overview of the benefits of our integrated business model. The fourth quarter of 2018 wrapped up a successful year for Oxy both financially and operationally. We returned $900 million to shareholders in the quarter through a combination of dividend and share repurchases.","Our continued focus on increasing returns for our shareholders was achieved due to outstanding performance from all three of our businesses in a changing market condition. Despite WTI falling below $43 a barrel in the quarter, we posted core earnings per share of $1.22 and generated the highest semiannual level of operating cash flow since 2014, making the second half of 2018 our strongest six-month period since our portfolio optimization.","Permian cash operating cost were the lowest this decade, driven by the long-term high-return investments that we're making such as in facilities and infrastructure. We operate our assets with a full lifecycle view. Our investments will continue to provide payback in the form of lower cost as our production base expands. OxyChem and our Midstream business both achieved record fourth quarter earnings as a result of our integrated business model, which enables us to take full advantage of market conditions such as delivering higher realizations from our Permian take away position.","In 2018, we grew cash flow to a level that exceeded both capital expenditures and our dividend, a key achievement we have been working toward since completing our portfolio optimization. Organic cash flow growth was driven by prioritizing the allocation of capital to opportunities that generate the highest full cycle returns. We are pursuing cash flow growth with two key objectives in mind, first and foremost to generate a higher return on capital; and second to return an increasing level of excess cash to shareholders.","In 2018, we returned more than $3.6 billion to shareholders through our sector-leading dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases under our $2 billion-plus share repurchase program. We intend to complete the remainder of the share repurchase program in 2019. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through a balanced combination of dividends and share repurchases as we've done for a long time. Since 2002, we've increased our dividend each consecutive year and we've returned $33 billion to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. That's about 70% of our current market capitalization.","Almost 50% of this was returned in the last five years, a time period which included one of the worst downturns our industry has ever experienced. Through this downturn we also maintained our strong balance sheet and A-level credit ratings. Our focus on investing in our high-quality assets delivered a 2018 return on capital employed of 14% and cash return on capital employed at 27%, both significantly higher than 2017 and our per quartile performance versus our performance peer group.","These achievements reflect our commitment to our value proposition, the strength of our integrated business model and the high quality of our assets. We made notable productivity and efficiency gains across all three business segments in 2018. The investments that OxyChem and our Midstream business completed in recent years paid off in 2018 as both segments optimized cash flow and delivered record earnings.","Our Permian business continued to outperform with Permian Resources delivering an impressive 52% production growth and Permian EOR exceeding cost reduction targets for the acquired Seminole CO2 field. Our international business generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow in 2018 and has enormous potential to grow cash flow going forward. On our last call Ken provided details of our new international opportunities. Now we're pleased to have been awarded a new block in Abu Dhabi that Ken will describe in a few minutes.","This new Abu Dhabi block along with six in Colombia and three in Oman, make 10 new blocks added in the last year. These new international opportunities will add significant high-return low-decline development inventory to our portfolio. At the same time, it's worth highlighting that these will require only a modest investment in the short-term.","One of our key competitive advantages is our ability to develop assets in a way that efficiently maximizes all production recovery and generate significant cash flow growth over the next decades. For the last three years, we've achieved all-in reserve replacement ratios exceeding 160% companywide. The 2018 reserve replacement ratio of 164% is due to the excellent technical work our teams have completed in enhancing subsurface characterization across our portfolio and building customized development plans.","Our momentum has continued into 2019 as our business segments continue to invest in high-return opportunities. Last month we discussed various capital budgets through three different pricing scenarios, but we've decided to limit our full capital spend in 2019 to $4.5 billion. This represents a $500 million or a full 10% reduction from 2018. By maximizing efficiencies, we are reducing spending to adjust to a lower oil price environment.","As activity is adjusted to make full year capital spending of $4.5 billion, we expect spending to be higher in the first half of the year. In creating our capital budget to realize the highest returns, Permian Resources shale production will become a larger portion of our total oil and gas production. We expect this will increase our oil and gas base decline to 20% in 2019. As we continue to invest in the Permian, we will advance our appraisal in the short cycle low decline development opportunities in our new international blocks to prepare them for growth.","Our 2019 capital program is dominated by short-cycle investments, the majority of which we\u2019ll pay back within two years at $50 WTI. We will continue to be conservative and if necessary, within six months we can reduce capital spending to sustainable levels, meaning that OXY remains flexible throughout the commodity cycle. We will grow oil and gas production by 9% to 11% in 2019 to replace the cash flow from Qatar in 2020, but our long-term annual growth rate forecast remains at 5% to 8-plus-percent.","Cash flow growth is an inherent driver in generating a high return off-capital and a higher return on-capital. Our 2022 roadmap details the projects we will prioritize and execute over the next few years, in order to grow cash flow from operations to $9 billion in 2022.","While Permian Resources will continue to be the main driver of growth through 2022, our international business will also grow in terms of both cash flow and production. In addition to having many high return short cycle opportunities, we also continue to benefit from the stable sustainable cash flow generated by OxyChem, Midstream and Dolphin.","Even with a lower activity level and a significantly reduced capital budget for 2019, we still remain on track to achieve the low end of the 2022 cash flow range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion that we communicated in our third quarter call. As you will have noticed based on our expectations for the WTI spread we\u2019ve updated our Brent price assumption for 2020 onwards and this will have minimal impact based on our production sharing contracts.","To be conservative, we modeled OxyChem and midstream cash flow at the low end of the previous range and our projection of $9 billion in cash flow by 2022 does not include significant upside from several additional projects that we're currently evaluating. We'll provide updates on these projects as we advance.","This morning Cedric will take you through our financial results and updated guidance; and Jeff will detail the continuous improvements we are creating in the Permian. Ken will then provide an update on our new opportunities in our international business.","I'll now hand the call over to Cedric. ","Cedric Burgher","Thanks Vicki. As Vicki highlighted, we are pleased to have continued repurchasing shares, allowing us to return $900 million of cash to shareholders during the fourth quarter and over $3.6 billion in 2018 including our dividend.","On slide 10, I'd like to start with our earnings which improved across all segments year-over-year. For the fourth quarter we had core earnings of $1.22 per diluted share and reported earnings of $0.93 per diluted share. The difference between reported and core income is attributable to an impairment charge of $220 million which was driven by lower oil prices.","Earnings also included a net tax benefit of $224 million, which significantly decreased our fourth quarter effective tax rate and it consisted of $100 million for additional EOR tax credits and tax credits related to U.S. export sales; $99 million for releasing a foreign withholding tax accrual; and $25 million for changes related to the 2017 Tax Reform Act.","Oil and gas core income decreased in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter, reflecting lower oil and NGL prices as realized prices declined by 10% and 23% respectively from the third quarter. Fourth quarter oil and gas results included a non-cash mark-to-market change related to our CO2 purchase contracts, as well as higher operating and DD&A expenses in Qatar as a result of the ISND contract expiration later this year.","Total fourth quarter reported production of 700,000 BOEs per day was above the midpoint of our guidance, due to the continued best-in-class execution and well productivity in the Permian Resources, which resulted in 250,000 BOEs per day during the quarter at the top end of the guidance range and represents an exit to exit increase of over 57%.","Total international production of 290,000 BOEs per day was up slightly lower than guidance primarily due to the oil price adjustment in our production sharing contracts in Oman. The contracts utilize pricing mechanism with a two-month delay which resulted in a higher realized price and lower production for Oman in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter international production was also impacted by weather and accelerated maintenance.","OxyChem continues to perform strongly reporting its highest fourth quarter pre-tax income ever of $223 million, above guidance of $220 million. Earnings decreased from the third quarter, primarily due to expected seasonality and end market demand for core vinyl products as well as lower realized caustic soda pricing and higher natural gas and ethylene costs.","Our midstream business reported record core fourth quarter earnings of $670 million, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance, due to positive mark-to-market movements and a higher-than-expected Midland to MEH differential. Compared the prior quarter fourth quarter earnings reflected lower marketing margins due to a decrease in the Midland to MEH differential from $16.67 to $15.31 and lower pipeline income from the sale of the Centurion Pipeline in the prior quarter.","Fourth quarter revenue and cost of sales were both grossed up by $340 million due to the accounting treatment of certain Midstream contracts where we've used our excess takeaway capacity from the Permian to purchase and resale third-party barrels. The third quarter gross-up amount was $327 million.","Operating cash flow before working capital for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, which covered our capital expenditures of $1.3 billion and dividends of $594 million. Our total year-end capital spend came in just under our planned spend amount of $5 billion.","Slide 11 details, our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2019. As Vicki mentioned, we will pursue high-return reinvestment opportunities in 2019 that will be funded by a total capital budget of $4.5 billion, which will result in annual production growth of 9% to 11%. We are reducing capital spending year-over-year and due to technical and operational advances, we are still able to deliver significant cash flow growth.","As we advance into 2019, our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample liquidity available to complete our share repurchase program. We ended 2018 with over $3 billion in cash and still hold PAGP units with a market value of approximately $700 million.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Alvarez","Thank you, Cedric. 2018 was an outstanding year for our combined Permian business as we improved the value of our conventional and unconventional assets through our value-based development approach. We're able to add high margin barrels and generate great returns on our investments. We replaced 216% of our production with new reserves through industry-leading performance and successful appraisal. Combined total year production per Permian Resources and Permian EOR grew 77,000 BOEs per day compared to 2017, and exceeded 400,000 BOEs per day in the fourth quarter.","We lowered Permian operating cost 9% by utilizing advanced data analytics on our artificial lift, implementing new water recycling technology, and improving maintenance efficiency across the Permian.","Permian Resources has a simple model that I love called 'leave no doubt' which refers to our relentless pursuit of generating the best returns in the industry. In 2018, we made tremendous progress toward achieving this principle as we increased our total production 52% and exceeded our initial 2018 guidance by 12,000 BOEs per day.","Our subsurface characterization improvements have driven breakthroughs at an accelerated pace. By integrating advancements in geoscience with our 12,000 square miles of 3D seismic and subsurface characterization models, we are rapidly achieving step change improvements in well design and placement.","In 2018, we improved our average six-month cumulative production by 25% compared to 2017. Over the last 12 months OXY has delivered 40% of the top 50 horizontal wells in the basin which is the most for any operator while only drilling 5% of the total wells over the same time period.","On the capital efficiency front our operational improvement initiatives continue to drive efficiency, compressed time-to-market, and lower full cycle cost. In 2018, we increased our fee drilled per day by 19% and we drilled record 15-day 10,000-foot wells measured rig release-to-rig release in both our Mexico and Texas Delaware areas.","On a base management front, our investments and operability and surveillance are transforming how we optimize our base as demonstrated by our 10% reduction in operating cost per barrel in 2018.","In addition to efficiency improvements, we're also achieving major advancements in artificial lift optimization and well enhancements to lower the base decline rate. The rate of progress in Permian Resources is extraordinary and will lead us to exceed to 600,000 BOEs per day for this business alone within the next five years.","Our Permian EOR business also had a great year. We continued the integration of the Seminole-San Andres unit and have now lowered OpEx by $8 per BOE since we took over operations in September of 2017.","We start injection on new grassroots CO2 flood at the West Sundown unit which start injection four months earlier than planned and will achieve a development cost of under $6 per BOE.","Permian EOR continues to provide a low decline cash flow and high returns for our shareholders. We're excited about the critical role it will play in our long-term business sustainability strategy, especially as we leverage our position and expertise to reduce our carbon footprint.","Slide 14 provides more detail on the 2019 capital program. Permian Resources will comprise $2.6 billion of our $4.5 billion total capital budget in 2019. We will utilize approximately 12 operated rigs and one to two non-operated rigs with development focus on our core areas.","We plan to operate six to seven rigs in New Mexico which will primarily develop the high return Bone Springs and Wolfcamp formations. We will continue development in areas proved to be highly prolific in 2018 and plan to allocate activity to the tanks area of Greater Sand Dunes in the second half of the year.","The appraisal results from tanks area have been outstanding, the three wells online in 2018 averaging over 3,000 BOEs per day per well for 30 days. In Texas, Delaware, we'll operate five to six rigs primarily developing the Wolfcamp A and Hoban formations. The tapered well design we implemented in the second half of 2018 to significantly improve the returns of our new wells and we expect to see continued improvement through 2019.","Overall our capital program for 2019 will generate significant value for our shareholders and result in 30% to 35% annual production growth. We will also be advancing the commercialization of unconventional EOR development and expect to share more information on results later in the year.","As you can see, 2018 was an exceptional year for our Permian businesses. We saw well productivity records, significantly lowered operating cost, and realized breakthroughs with data analytics and subsurface characterization that improves the returns from our assets. 2018 may seem like a hard year to beat, but the organization is more energized and capable than ever and I'm sure we will leave no doubt in 2019.","I'll now turn the call over to Ken to discuss international.","Ken Dillon","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Vicki and Cedric mentioned our 2019 capital plan focuses on investing in projects that grow cash flow and generate the highest returns.","Today we're pleased to share the details of onshore Block 3, which is a new 35-year concession in Abu Dhabi. We feel honored to expand our relationship with ADNOC and the first award of its kind onshore.","With Block 3 as well as the new onshore blocks landed in Oman and Colombia, we feel we have established the clear pathway for OXY to grow sustainable cash flow from our low-decline long-life international assets. We certainly appreciate the recognition as a partner of choice.","As shown on slide 16 Block 3 covers an area of approximately 1.5 million acres, which is slightly greater than the total of our net unconventional acreage in the Permian. We have high expectations for this block given its location between the prolific oilfields of Abu Dhabi and Oman. It's also adjacent to our outhouse gas project.","As I mentioned in the last call, our regional geological knowledge is best-in-class and it continues to develop. We utilize that experience in preparing our initial stacked pay prospect infantry for Block 3.","In 2019, our capital spend in Block 3 will be modest. The initial scope of work involves participating in the state-of-the-art 3D seismic acquisition and degradation. Our plan is to initiate drilling in 2019.","Expanding our footprint in UAE in such a meaningful way, especially through the 35-year concession has allowed us to enhance our long-term international portfolio at an attractive price of entry. Additionally in Abu Dhabi, we continue to look at cost effective ways to debottleneck the Al Hosn Gas facilities.","In Colombia, in partnership with EcoPetrol, we have signed an agreement to develop Blocks 39 and 52. These blocks are adjacent to our giant Ca\u00f1o Lim\u00f3n field and where we had successful discoveries this year.","In addition we formed into four blocks in the highly prospective Putumayo Basin where we have regional knowledge of the reservoirs. With these blocks, our net acreage in Colombia has arisen to approximately one million acres with a low cost of entry. Like your other recent word\u2019s capital will be small in 2019.","In terms of performance, our OXY international drilling teams continue to improve performance and since 2014 I'd say it's approximately $650 million for OXY and our partners, as well as improving efficiency cost and time-to-market, the international safety performance was again world-class.","Our international exploration programs in 2017 added 47 million BOE of resources and bettered that in 2018 by adding 94 million BOE of resources while at the same time opening up new place. Funding costs were around $0.76 per BOE.","In closing, we expect 2019 to be an exciting year for OXY internationally as the exploration programs in new blocks for gas we will continue to provide updates on significant developments. As you can see the work we are executing closely aligns with OXY's key technical competencies and returns focused on our true partnership.","I'll now turn the call back to Vicki. Thank you. ","Vicki Hollub","Thank you, Ken. Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to emphasize that we believe the strongest oil and gas companies of the future will be those that have a shareholder-focused value proposition and our structure and sustainability to withstand the oil price cycles, while also maintaining a social license to operate in the world in general and operate in a low carbon world.","Our value proposition will continue to deliver a growing dividend in the upper quartile or maybe best-in-class returns to our shareholders, while also growing oil and gas production 5% to 8-plus-percent annually. Unlike many companies in our sector, we delivered this through one of the longest downturns our industry has faced.","Our company is primarily an upstream oil and gas company with integrated midstream and chemicals business, so that adds significant value and provides important support during low oil price cycles.","The diversification of our upstream oil and gas business also provides strength in periods of low oil price along with substantial upside in higher oil price cycles. This upside is made possible by our short-cycle, high-return, unconventional assets in the Permian, along with a new conventional opportunities that we just picked up in Oman, Colombia and Abu Dhabi.","Our strength in the low price environment bolstered by our very low decline enhanced oil recovery projects in the Permian, Oman and Colombia. I'm specifically referring to our CO2 and water plugs in the Permian, our water plugs in northern Oman, our steamflood in Mukhaizna which happens to be one of the largest steamfloods in the world and our new TECA steamflood in Colombia.","Our production sharing contracts and our road to decline gas projects in offer and Al Hosn also provides significant support in low oil price cycles. I believe there is no other oil company\u2019s in the oil gas industry that has this blend of high-quality, focused oil and gas projects that provides this diversity. This is why we can continue to deliver our value proposition.","Not only do we have a great blend of assets with the addition of our new blocks, we have incredible inventory of development opportunities. Over the past few years, we've replaced our production with new reserves at a ratio of greater than 160%.","With the inventory we now have, we expect to achieve that replacement ratio for the foreseeable future. This ensures the sustainability of our value proposition. With respect to our social license to operate, our commitment is to manage our business in a way that improves the quality of life for our employees, contractors and the communities where we operate, while also minimizing the potential impacts of our operations.","Our employees are the lifeblood of our company. They are the drivers of our success and as such, we are committed to their continued development and helping them address the challenges of work\/life balance.","Many people refer to this as human capital management, but I don't. These are our people, the OXY family not just capital. It's personal to us. We want their lives to be the best that they can be at home and at work. This will enable them to be engaged and ready to deliver the best possible value to our shareholders as they have done in a significant way during this downturn.","And in the areas where we operate, we want to ensure that we have a positive impact and can find ways that improve the quality of life in the community. Lastly, but equally as important is our commitment to use our unique skills and assets to lead carbon capture use in sequestration or CCUS, starting in the United States and ultimately in other parts of the world. Along with many other initiatives, CCUS is necessary to limit the impact of climate change.","With our CO2 Enhanced Oil Recovery expertise and projects in the Permian, we believe we can lead the effort to capture current CO2 emissions from industrial sources to use in sequester in our Permian reservoirs. This will benefit the climate and our shareholders. As we have previously mentioned, we now have a low carbon team whose mission is to seek opportunities to innovatively reduce our carbon footprint in ways that also improve our operations and thus are expandable and sustainable.","Our comprehensive strategy addresses all the factors that make a company great and sustainable. I believe this has built us into our next-generation company that is uniquely positioned to excel in our changing world.","We'll now open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Yeah. Good morning. How are you? Hopefully, everybody can hear me? Yeah. I just wanted to kind of come at it from the capital discipline side. Obviously, the presentation you put out in January highlighted that you would live within cash flow given the oil price. Good to see the higher growth rate now 9 to 11 versus the 10 to 8. But just really my question is along the lines of trying to think about how Oxy and maybe the broader E&P space fits here, with what you're trying to do versus maybe what we\u2019re seeing out of the super majors in terms of increasing activity in the Permian, and then we haven't seen the magnitude of drop-off, I think we would've expected out of some of the private companies. So as you think about capital returns, capital discipline, but then maybe a little bit of the risk being squeezed between these other two components, how do you kind of square that circle up? And what do you see as the driver for how you want to run the company?","Vicki Hollub","The driver for us is to maximize returns. And so the way, we put together our development programs is, we don't try to design for peak rate production. We really try to design all of our development programs and our comprehensive development of the Permian with the synergies between EOR and resources. We try to design that in a way that creates the highest difference in value. And I can tell you, we're not trying to outpace the majors.","We're trying to outperform the majors. And I think that, we're clearly doing that in the Permian at this time. I think it's \u2013 from the standpoint of our programs versus theirs. We're doing a lot more with the rigs that we employed today than many other companies are with almost double the rigs that we have. And our focus is more on making sure that every dollar we invest creates more value. And so we're trying to really work the side of maximizing recovery from the reservoir and minimizing our cost.","So it's not a race for us to outpace them. And we have teams that have built our infrastructure and our position and our relationship in a way that grow as they will they will not impact our operations. We believe we are perfectly positioned to be able to do the things we need to do. We have the takeaway capacity. We have the export capacity. We have the infrastructure within the Permian. So we're positioned there, and I think in a catch-up mode at this point.","Roger Read","Okay. Thanks. And then Jeff just the part you mentioned about data analytics, I understand it's helping. Is there any quantification that you can offer on that front? Or either what's been captured to-date or what you would expect going forward?","Jeff Alvarez","Yes, I think the real quantification is when you look at performance improvements and ultimately what's going to play out from a capital efficiency standpoint. So, I think when we point to our well performance and our development performance, all of that -- or a good portion of that is being driven with how we utilize data analytics.","And the thing I'd point to the most is as you can see our development; our performance isn't based on a lot of trial and error. It's largely based on our ability to go in, understand the reservoir from a subsurface standpoint, utilize the huge amounts of data that we have in an effective way, and come up with an optimal development that delivers very good results from the beginning, not in a trial and error mode, where we have to deploy a lot of capital that gets underutilized.","And so it's almost unfair to point out we used artificial lift because that's where we've made some huge breakthroughs, but we are applying data analytics in almost every aspect of the business with sub-surface characterization is the one we talked about the most because it's so impactful. But it's being used universally across the business and there is example after example on how that's creating value.","Roger Read","Great. Thanks. And it's okay from our perspective if you want to be unfair when we're thinking about other stocks.","Jeff Alvarez","Thanks Roger.","Operator","And our next question will come from Bob Morris of Citi.","Bob Morris","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. My first question, Vicki, is with regard to again the capital discipline side, you've capped the budget this year at $4.5 billion so you can return any cash generated above $50 a barrel to shareholders. But then beyond this year, you're stepping back up the CapEx and to do that you're spending -- you end up spending cash above $50 a barrel and I know you have to do that to still hit your 5% to 8% production growth target. But to what extent would you consider continuing what you are doing this year just sort of cap any spin to return cash above $50 per barrel to shareholders? I know that would put your growth at the lower end of the range and you can still obtain double-digit growth out of Permian Resources. So, is there a scenario where you may continue, like you do in this year, beyond this year to then return any excess cash above $50 a barrel to shareholders?","Vicki Hollub","Our assumption for 2020 was based on our belief that oil prices will be $60 in 2020. And if that's the case, with a budget of 5 to 5.3, we would still be able to return cash to shareholders. And we want to continue to, at some point, grow our dividend more meaningfully and Cedric will talk about that a little later but our 5 to 5.3 capital budget would allow for us above a $60 environment to return cash and that's something that we've always done as I mentioned in my script and something that we'll continue to do. We think of balance to return of cash to shareholders through repurchases and strong dividend with a right balance between those is important to continue.","Bob Morris","Sure, I appreciate that. So, my second question is for Cedric. Cedric last quarter you mentioned that M&A was part of OXY's DNA and so at this stage, do you see the A&D environment more conducive to opportunities for OXY out there or have you grown more optimistic with regard to potential acquisitions or adding to your portfolio in the Permian?","Cedric Burgher","Well, it's -- we've certainly seen a few -- some activity picking up in M&A. I would say from OXY's perspective, we're always aware and we keep ourselves very informed. We look at a lot of opportunities, it\u2019s rare when we don't get a call and when there's something coming to market. But if you look at our organic growth opportunities as we've described, they're robust across the globe and across each business sectors.","So we don't have to do a deal and we only want to do a deal, if it's going to be very accretive to our shareholders and for values. So we do see ourselves over the long run being a consolidator. That's one of the things that goes with -- or opportunities that goes with being a low cost producer.","We consider ourselves one-off, if not the lowest cost producer in the basins and places we choose to operate. So I think, there will be consolidation opportunities over time as I said before, however it needs to be a compelling deal for us and for our shareholders and that's how we look at it. ","Bob Morris","Is there an advanced catalyst that sort of sparks an increase in consolidation not necessarily for OXY, but across the Permian at some point? ","Cedric Burgher","That's hard for me to predict. You know there's certainly a lot of assets and small private companies that don't seem to have the scale or the technology to put themselves in a low-cost producer status. So at some point perhaps those come to market at more reasonable prices. There have been a few, but it's hard to predict those things. We're certainly ready when that happens.","And then otherwise there are other operators that are trying to figure out, if they can make the breakthroughs that we have and so on and it will just be something that will be -- to be determined. It's hard to predict. ","Jeff Alvarez","Hey Bob, this is Jeff. I mean, the only thing I'd add to what Cedric said, if you look at the Permian history it's consolidated when the business got really hard, prices drop, margins get squeezed and then consolidation generally happen.","I think when you look across though in conventional space, you all know better than anyone, the business continues to get harder not easier as people move to full section development, having to operate with lower operating cost, manage infrastructure, large KOLs all those things. So we're definitely progressing to where you're starting to see differentiation between those that are good operators and those that are maybe aren't as good. ","Bob Morris","No, I agree. OXY is positioned very well in that type of environment. So, I appreciate your comments. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Sankey of Mizuho. ","Paul Sankey","Good afternoon. Just a couple of points of clarification on your presentation, if I could, on slide 4 you stated that you drilled less than 5% of the horizontal wells in the Permian, but have 40% of the top 50 well results. Could you expand on that a little bit in terms of what you're comparing and how you're comparing that? Thank you.","Cedric Burgher","Sure Paul. I'll take that. Basically if you go to anyone who has the deck opened slide 31 shows that. So there's lots of ways to measure performance. Specific measure that we use is the cleanest as to where we look at over the last year top 50 wells from an IP standpoint, where are they? Who has them? And then you can see on the left, we've got 20 of the top 50 over the last year. We've showed this for several quarters, so you can see moves around and how it progress.","And 40% of those were the top operators when you look at the data. Another thing we add to it, on the right, which is something we often talk about is, we are able to do it with less proppant. And the reason we highlight that is twofold; one, it\u2019s a big cost driver. Obviously you all know, the more profiting in pump, the more cost.","But two, its really indicates how we customize our development. You can see we don\u2019t have a universal number where we use 2,000 pounds per foot on every well, we vary it. And that\u2019s a function of our development strategy and our understanding on the subsurface to get really, really good wells in a customizable way.","The other thing I'd point you to, Paul, one thing we put in there, because the question we keep getting asked all the time is, are results continuing to improve? And it seems like every time we show a comparison of results, they are normalized by something, or you cherry pick which wells you use, you exclude this, you include this.","So we include a slide in this deck that I'll point out slide 28. So what this slide is, it shows our six-month performance for every horizontal well. We didn't cherry pick which wells that go in there, all appraisal wells, all development wells, all of our wells are in every year that you can see for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, across Midland Basin, New Mexico, Texas, Delaware and it answers the fundamental question of are we able to continue to improve?","And you can look at each year and there's reasons that vary on why we're improving. Some years, it may be more of the lateral length, some years it may be better completions. Every year is being driven by a better understanding of the subsurface. And so, there's lots of things driving it. But the fundamental question of are we continuing to improve, I think, is answered with this slide.","And what makes it even more impressive is, when you dig in to the details and you look at 2018, that's with 90-plus-percent of wells that have an offset, so characterized as children wells. So the big debate on our children wells, versus some parent wells, we can have that discussion. But fundamental, you can look at for many different reasons; we continue to get better well performance every year.","Paul Sankey","Thanks, Jeff. And follow-up along the lines of clarification on slide 7. You talk about unconventional EOR commercial success in 2019. Could you talk more about that? I'm not sure what you mean there? Thank you.","Vicki Hollub","We have in the past, on done 4 CO2 injection pilots in the Midland Basin to test the efficiency and the commerciality of CO2 flooding the shale. And that's in the Midland. And what we're looking at in the Southeast New Mexico area is more of an enhanced oil recovery with using hydrocarbon gas injections, which would do two things for us.","First, it would help us to maintain pressure. Secondly, it would become also somewhat miscible than the oil and would make it the same as CO2 does, make it less reluctance to flow, lower the friction and improve the ability to flow the oil from where it is to be freezed, to help in performing a full string.","What we intend to do in Southeast New Mexico would be a continuous injection that would be full stream. So we're going to test that. We believe based on our models that it'll work and part of the objective there is to try to lower the decline of the Resources business and we believe that we'll successfully do that over time.","Paul Sankey","Understood Vicki. Thank you.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you.","Operator","And next we have a question from Ryan Todd of Simmons Energy. Mr. Todd, your line is open.","Ryan Todd","Sorry. Looking forward, as we think about the normalization of CapEx, you have a back door, it's kind of a $5 billion to $5.3 billion level beyond 2019. The incremental capital driven -- in that case, driven more by an acceleration of activity in the Permian Basin? Or by a resumption of activity in international regions?","Vicki Hollub","It will be both. The incremental capital in 2020 will be spread between our resources and the international areas, part of which will go to the growth areas. We do expect to start seeing -- we're going to continue growth from our base areas internationally through exploration and some of the other things that we're doing. But we'll pick that up in the new areas as we complete our appraisal programs. Now, the bulk of the growth capital is still going to go to resources in 2020, but we will send more to these \u2013 to the new areas.","Ryan Todd","And maybe on that as well, I mean, you referenced some of the base case kind of assumes $60 crude in 2020. If you were to be at $50 again in 2020, would you see a similar type of program that we see here in 2019, where you continue to kind of smear out the international investment and run a moderated program in onshore?","Vicki Hollub","It will be dependent really on where we are with respect to our cash flow. Our commitment is to stay, keep our capital programs within cash flow going forward. So if we're in a $50 of environment with what we're seeing from efficiency improvements and are increasing production in 2020. I wouldn't say that, we would be at the 4.5, it would depend on how our costs are looking now and everything else, but we would stay within cash flow.","Ryan Todd","Maybe an unrelated question, I appreciate some of the details you provided on water sourcing. Can you talk through how you see potential risk of increasing cost from water disposal going forward particularly in the Delaware Basin? And how you set up the handle water disposal over the long term?","Jeff Alvarez","So one thing \u2013 this is Jeff. So, one thing given our full cycle value focus, water infrastructure is really, really important in all of our development areas from the very beginning. So if you go look at New Mexico and how much we're recycling up there, the size of our water infrastructure in Texas, Delaware. I mean, we see \u2013 not only a risk to the business, if you don't manage it properly, but definitely a significant economic risk if you can't do it well. So one of the things we do from the very beginning of when we go to a development area is ensure we have water infrastructure in place to collect the water, recycle it where we can as much as we can, and then have numerous disposal outlets for when we're done for whatever water is left over.","And so I'd say, in all of our development areas, we're very well-positioned and where there are some areas that have different have risks than others, some may be cost and just availability, some maybe permitting related to seismicity or whatever it is, we've identified and mitigated those risk in all of our development areas.","Ryan Todd","Great. And thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And the next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. A couple questions with regards to the longer-term outlook here. In the years to come, how do you see your skill in the Permian impacting global unit operating in G&A cost? Do you see these costs falling flat or rising on a per BOE basis? And then what base case into that 2022 to cash flow plan? And then if I might add to that separately and you talked a little bit about this earlier what gives you confidence to base case production in Oman in the UAE even if it's three to four years out at the key milestones that we should be focused on between now and then?","Vicki Hollub","Firstly with respect to the G&A, the G&A on a per BOE basis will be coming down over time. So that should be the case. And that's what we've assumed in our 2022 plan. The other thing that with respect to the milestones, the milestones are listed on slide 7 and what we try to give you there is more of a roadmap of how we're going to get there and the international blocks, particularly for some information about the non-conventional EOR and when that might happen. But this is essentially of the roadmap you wanted to be able to see, so you can check what's happening as we go.","With respect to what -- yeah, with respect to what the performance will be, it's going to be based on analogs. Ken pointed out something to me just recently, and that is that if you look at the four countries that are contiguous there, you look at -- we're probably the only company that has operated in all four of those countries that have this similar trend. So we have a lot of experience in this trend and we can do analogs and help us understand how to forecast what to expect. So we have a lot of good information around that.","But with respect to the roadmap, I\u2019ll let Ken tell you a little bit more about that.","Ken Dillon","Thanks Vicki. If we start with the Oman in the north, the game plan is to further define the hydrocarbons in Block 30 and 51 in order that we can optimize the regional development by potentially using their existing Block 62 as a hub for facilities.","On a previous call, I was asked would we spread the well in Block 30 before the end of last year. We did. It's an on trend discovery and in fact, we found a new zone that we were not expecting. We plan to drill a follow-on well this quarter on Block 51 we\u2019re reprocessing the existing seismic lines and plan to be drill ready by Q3 this year, which led to look at the hub concept for Block 62. We think hub and spoke is the best and most efficient way to develop this area.","In Block 72 we started shooting seismic and we hope to have useable data by Q2 2020, but we may use some fast-track data for early drilling. Again our oil targets there are similar to those we've seen in our existing Block 53 hub, again hub and spoke concept to maximize efficiencies.","In Abu Dhabi we were delighted to land Block 3. The block is 90 miles long, 30 miles wide and very few wells have been drilled there since the 1970s. It's in a great location not only because of proximity of super giant fields, but also because of infrastructure for success where we can hook up the flow lines very quickly and get that oil to export very quickly.","I mentioned earlier we\u2019ll spud a well this year. We've already mapped 162 prospects into 11 stacked reservoirs as targets and within these based on the new 3D seismic, which we think is some of the most cost efficient seismic ever obtained by anyone in the industry.","So overall we try to detailed the milestones for a mine in Abu Dhabi and Colombia we're ramping up TECA, we'll drill 30 wells this year in TECA and will stream online to them this year, replacing all of long lead items for TECA, which will enable the ramp up that continue through 2020 and 2021. And as Vicki said, we're continuing to explore in our core existing assets also.","So we've tried to make the roadmap something that we can update you on periodically as we get good results and I hope that answers your question.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you, yeah. So my follow-up goes back to the Permian. And you highlighted some of the areas of efficiency and productivity gains in your comments and so far in the Q&A.","I think if you look at across the landscape even among larger and more scaled Permian companies for a company of your Permian Resources production base, you're planning to grow production at a rate that other E&Ps kind of spend more in capital to achieve than what you're projecting. Can you just talk to what you see as the risk around the Permian capital and production plan this year? And to what degree Aventine hub is going to be a driver of further capital efficiency or whether that's already essentially been reflected in recent CapEx results?","Jeff Alvarez","Yes, Brian, this is Jeff. I will take your question. So, I mean the rest -- we feel really good about the areas we're developing in because they are -- one, they're core development areas, we know them really well. There's not a huge appraisal component to it. There is a little bit.","Again like last year when we drilled a lot of development wells, so we weren't just out drilling single wells. It fits that same old, so it's a progression of areas we feel very comfortable with technically.","So, from a well performance risk, I think it's very, very low. The biggest risk I see is actually -- from a performance standpoint, we're starting to see high productivity gains and lower time-to-market, drilling faster, and things like that. So, the biggest challenge is with us is as that continues, what do we do when that pace keeps picking up.","But from a cost standpoint, Aventine is up and running. So, we've realized two-thirds of the benefits from that. We feel very comfortable with that. We have our people in place. I mean one of the things we did very early on is not just wait until we have the activity to start getting all the right resources in place.","So, I really feel like our program is de-risked from execution standpoint cost and performance standpoint for this year, especially at the pace we're going. Because like Vicki said running 12 rigs for us is a very moderate pace, especially compared to many others and especially compared if you go back a few years ago we are at 40. So, it's well within our bandwidth to handle this not just execution but technically.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate","Thank you, good morning everyone. Cedric I wonder if I could just get some clarification from you on slide 21. And I guess I'm also comparing it to the slide you put up specific to 2019 capital back and I think there's a confidence at the beginning of the year. So, what I'm really trying to understand here is $50 TI post-2019, you're capping your spending is that the way to think about this and above that is going back to shareholders? ","Cedric Burgher","Hi Doug, good question, I appreciate the clarification. We're weren't intending to have it be precise where you move to one penny to the next and that shift gears but it\u2019s indicative of our -- the way we think about it we would spend I guess two years ago when we came out with our breakeven plan which allows us to sustaining a world-class dividend and keep our production base flat at $40 oil. And what we're doing today two years later is nothing short of amazing in terms of beating those assumptions -- beating that plan we're beating it on cost.","As Jeff outlined, we're beating it on productivity of our wells and so as we continue to lower our breakevens just by the way that is one of the keys to us raising our dividend at a more meaningful rates. We've continued to raise our dividend 16 consecutive years but it's been more modest since the downturn more modest rates. We'd like to go back to more aggressive rates but the key to that is lowering our breakevens and delivering more cash flow from that.","So \u2013 but above $40, we are looking at reinvest first and would get to that 5% to 8% target long-term growth rate, continue modest dividend growth and then above the $50, we are looking at both balance sheet improvement as well as share repurchases and that's something we certainly demonstrated last first.","So I wouldn't give you a precise $50.01. We're going to share buyback that number or dividend increase, but it is how we're thinking about it, as you get into a certainly a $60 environment which is what we're forecasting to the 2020 we think that as a logical price for the industry to balance supply and demand. That is something we would look to do as we return more capital at that point. We don't need to grow any more than that 5% to 8% long-term target.","Doug Leggate","I understand. I appreciate the clarification, because I just wasn't \u2013 I think there was an earlier question it sounded like it was different but that's very clear. Just to talk on that very quickly the $50 TI I assume you're still using a $10 differential for Brent?","Cedric Burgher","Yes.","Doug Leggate","Okay. My follow-up then is also related to the dividend. So I know you guys talked to this many times in the past, but if you're at $9 billion let's assume in a couple of year's times or let's assume oil maybe is a little bit more generous in between times. Is your first priority to reduce the dividend burden by buying back stock because on a per share basis you still get the growth of your buyback the stock? So how should we think about absolute dividend growth versus per share growth through share buybacks? I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Cedric Burgher","Great \u2013 great question. I mean, we see dividends and share buybacks as complementary. I will say our first priority is always the dividend. We prove that in the downturn. We're one of the few high-dividend paying companies that didn't cut the dividend. There's a long trail of bodies of companies that did. We're very proud of our track record in a very tough time. So our priority is and always will be the dividend. We want to \u2013 we will continue to grow it. That's our intent and we certainly want to grow it even more meaningful rates as we're able to. Can't forecast when that will be, but as we think about higher prices that's certainly like I said earlier, when we start to think about buybacks and it's complementary as you stated, because it does reduce the share count that which enables us to afford dividend growth more easily.","So but certainly that $9 billion that we're forecasting in 2020 should we have a $60 environment? If you back out the midpoint of the CapEx range at that time of $5.1 billion that leaves you $3.9 billion of free cash flow. That compares to our current dividend of about $2.4 billion. So that's more than a 50% cushion on that dividend, if you will that would allow you in a $60 environment to both grow the dividend and do buyback. So I think we would be in a very good position that even a modest improvement in oil prices over that time to be in a really good position to deliver a return a lot more capital and we would do it in both dividends and buybacks, which again I think \u2013 we think of as complementary.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the full answers. Thanks Cedric.","Cedric Burgher","Yep.","Operator","And the next question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.","Philip Gresh","Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in here, just starting I guess with Midstream. Could you help maybe bridge the 4Q actual results to the 1Q guidance? I know, maybe there was some items on both sides here but it just seems a little bit bigger than the normal sensitivity, I would suggesting the differentials. And then if you have an outlook on the full year for the midstream business whether it's on differentials or the pretax income, if you could share that?","Vicki Hollub","Yeah. Part of what's happening in Q1 is a Dolphin turnaround. So that's part of the difference between Q4 and the Midstream and the differential impact and Dolphin. We have some other just general marketing things that will have an impact in Q1 that we can detail out after Q1.","Philip Gresh","Okay.","Vicki Hollub","With respect to the full year, it's kind of hard to forecast the full year at this point because of the differentials and what the volatility there might be. So we\u2019ll see how things go over the next few months or so. ","Jeff Alvarez","Hey, Phil this is Jeff and just to add to what Vicki said. I mean one thing that we wanted to update people on is to remember when the differential collapses, you see that in midstream from a negative standpoint.","But the upstream now, given our oil production in the Permian, we\u2019ll realize more than 50% of what you lose on the midstream side. So good way to think about that. We gave that sensitivity so, as that differential collapses just for everyone to remember that more than half of the benefit will be recognized in oil and gas. ","Phil Gresh","Sure. And is there a caustic price assumption that will be behind that chemicals guidance? I know that maybe early part of the year seems to be a little tougher than the back half, I'm just trying to calibrate that?","BJ Hebert","Yes Phil, this is BJ. For caustic, and obviously, we saw price erosion towards the end of 2018. Our assumption in 2019 is we're going to see some price pick up but not to the level of the erosion that we saw towards the end of the year. So we're taking a conservative approach looking forward.","But we feel really good about supply and demand fundamentals long term in the caustic market. So I think it's conservative but we still felt really good about the forward years. ","Cedric Burgher","Just to add one thing on. As we've certainly made a few adjustments to the 2022 cash flow outlook because we wanted to keep it current and that was one of the items that we were more conservative on caustic prices as well as sulfur which affects the midstream business.","The combined effect of that is a deduct of about $150 million versus what we showed in 2022 versus what we showed you in the third quarter. We also had a deduct of a $250 million related to the lower production associated with a lower capital spend in 2019 and the less of a ramp in 2020.","So that caused some confusion also last night, we didn't intend for that. We thought we\u2019ve laid it out, but just to clarify. So that's $400 million combined which more than offset the $150 million pick up we have from the $5 increase in the Brent price differential versus last quarter.","So just trying to bring it kind of current with current thinking, so it's not stale, but that's where we kind of move from the midpoint of the $9.25 billion last quarter to the $9.0 billion this quarter. ","Phil Gresh","That's really helpful. Thanks Cedric. Last question for Vicki, you just made a comment in your prepared remarks about 20% base decline rate and that it was higher than in the past. So I just wanted to understand that comment a little bit more, what would you have said it was in the past? And I guess just because Permian's only one-third of the production at this point, so it's a little bit high to me, but just any additional detail behind that would be helpful? Thank you. ","Vicki Hollub","In the past we were traditionally running at a little bit less than 10%. And so the increase in the Permian has gotten us to -- will have us by the end of this year to around 20%. But it's important to think about the strength of our chemicals business in this sort of environment is that, when you think about our overall cash flow decline that's really only about 15%. So the 20% decline in the oil and gas business is not alarming, although the international assets as we develop those that will somewhat mitigate that decline. ","Phil Gresh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Philip Jungwirth of BMO Capital Market. ","Philip Jungwirth","Thanks good morning. I was just hoping you can give a little more color around the 6% international production CAGR key drivers and then really just the progression of that growth over the next couple years because when we look at the 2019 guidance it looks like you're budgeting around $800 million of CapEx flat year-on-year production. So, how is that -- really either capital efficiency improved? Or is it more value increasing than the level of investment?","Ken Dillon","It's Ken here. As I mentioned earlier in terms of capital efficiency, our drilling performances improved beyond measure over the last few years. So we're able to drill many more wells now than we could say three or four years ago.","In terms of the roadmap on slide seven, we basically have a large portfolio in our opportunities going forward. We have milestones associated with Colombia, the TECA development and new blocks.","If you look at it, it spades through year by year, each of these plans will be optimized over time, so that we can maximize the returns of every one of these streams. So we feel comfortable in reaching the 6% with the portfolio that we show here. We haven't talked about Al Hosn debottlenecking, we see opportunities there and we see great well performance and also a new geological and petrophysical model, so that we have additional gas there to enable that to be -- probably be debottlenecked.","Phillip Jungwirth","Okay. And then on slide 6, where you lay out the facility investment at 24% of the 2019 program, I was wondering if you could just isolate that to the Permian Resources as a percent of the $2.6 billion capital budget, and then also how that would trend over time? And maybe provide some color around just operating cost benefits around that facilities investment?","Jeff Alvarez","Sure, Phil, this is Jeff. So for 2019 it's around 21% facilities and I\u2019ll carry that when we do our OBO, we exclude that but they also have a facilities component to it. So if you're looking at it from a peer standpoint you\u2019d probably want that in. But of the $2.6 billion, it's about 21% as facilities and you brought up one of the most important thing, not just from a productivity standpoint, but that really helps drive full cycle cost, which shows up in operating cost.","So when you look at our operating cost, us able to get down into the mid to low-sixes is really where you see the benefits of that. He also see it from a productivity standpoint it's harder to measure just from an uptime standpoint and ability to handle the production reliability it shows up there as well.","So from a long-term standpoint, we look at most of our field development plans, we expect to get on average below 10%. So if you go and look at our more mature areas like in the Midland Basin where we have infrastructure developed and you look at the new developments there we're below 10%. So we expect to get there in the not too distant future from a total facility spend.","Phillip Jungwirth","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays.","Paul Cheng","Hi, guys. Just couple quick question. On the breakeven you're talking about the 24% on average per year growth in the Permian Resource. But can you give the number for 2020 to 2022 what is your rig count per well, productivity improvement that you assume comparing to 2018 or 2019? And also what is it the CapEx assumption as well as the base decline curve?","Cedric Burgher","Sure. So, Paul, what we said last year, so 24% CAGR, four-year CAGR. This year it will be 30% to 35%. So obviously, that number is coming down as the base grows. And so the way I think about it, when we originally rolled that out, we said capital would be roughly flat with where we were last year, which was around $2.8 billion.","And so, what's going on when you do that it goes back to question Phil asked is, you actually -- we're running say 12 or 13 rigs at that pace. But as you spend less on facilities, you're able to dedicate more of that capital and to drilling wells. So just easy math, these aren't exact numbers because we'll factor in with working interest and other things, but facilities goes from 20% to less than 10%, that could add a couple operated rigs to better generating production growth, instead of being spent on facilities.","Paul Cheng","So you're basically looking about 14, 15 rigs. And in the base assumption what kind of productivity improvement on the well production?","Cedric Burgher","Yes. That's a great question. So, hopefully, you've heard, with our long-term forecast, we always want to make sure we can deliver our long-term forecast. So when it comes to productivity improvements, we've assumed almost zero. I think we've had like 1% in some areas for productivity improvements.","When I just reference the slide that shows is 25% improvements in the last year, 20% improvement in the year before that and so on. So we've been really conservative with productivity improvements and how we've built that into the plan. So it's almost zero. But we had some areas that were new from an appraisal standpoint, so they have some uptick in them. But it's small on a global scale.","Paul Cheng","And just a clarification, Jeff, you earlier had mentioned in your prepared remarks saying that in five years time that this will be over 600,000 barrel per day. Are you talking just the Permian Resource or Permian Resources plus EOR?","Cedric Burgher","Yes. That's just Permian Resources.","Paul Cheng","Just Permian Resources. Okay.","Cedric Burgher","Correct. So that excludes EOR, obviously.","Paul Cheng","A final question that, I think, Vicki was talking about, you guys have done a number of pilot on the CO2 as well as using the other hydrocarbon. Have you so far seen any distinct pattern, certain type of activities like of the reservoir will be better respond to a certain -- to CO2 flooding and the other one? And is there anything that you can share? And how wide spread is that application could be?","Cedric Burgher","Yes. I mean, nothing meaningfully that we can share, but you're right. I mean, different reservoir characteristics will be more conducive to hydrocarbon gas versus CO2. And I'd say, you can look at, in a conventional world, many of the same principles will apply with miscibility, depth, pressures, temperature, all of those things.","And so, as Vicki said, we're really comfortable now from a technical standpoint that we know with the EOR, hydrocarbon gas and CO2 through the different reservoirs, we can get more oil. And actually is better technically than what we thought.","The real challenge is, from a commerciality standpoint what do patterns look like, how do you design them and how do you handle the gas processing, all of those things, that's where the real challenge lies and that's why we're focused on proving up that commerciality. But you will see differentiation based on reservoir characteristics, not that different than what you see in the conventional reservoirs.","Paul Cheng","And when you guys will be in a position that you maybe share more of the data?","Cedric Burgher","I would expect late this year, we'll share more of that.","Paul Cheng","Thank you. ","Cedric Burgher","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And the next question comes from John Herrlin with John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John Herrlin","Yes, hi thank you. With respect to your CapEx budget, what kind of labor or oilfield services inflection cost are you baking in for this year?","Vicki Hollub","We're baking at about 4%. 4% is domestically but internationally, we're not seeing the kind of inflation that we're seeing domestically.","Ken Dillon","Internationally we're seeing the last 16 contracts we've bid; we've seen 4.1% deflation. And if we focus only on the sort of major suppliers what we're seeing is a 16% reduction internationally.","John Herrlin","Good. My next question is regarding international policy, you had some good growth in Colombia and also me in it, was that all drilling-program elevated?","Cedric Burgher","I think a combination of drilling also some of the reservoir characterization work we're seeing and overall, it's just a really good performance. I don't see anything one individual thing it's just a collective individual activities across the whole international.","John Herrlin","Okay and the last one for me is on the Permian Resources. Earlier it was mentioned that you haven't had sort of the parent-child relationship that some of your peers have. Have you changed your spacing design balance in your core areas? Or is it very petrophysically specific.","Cedric Burgher","Yes. I think it's very petro-physically specific. So, if you look at our core areas, they may vary from three well spacing to six or seven as where they are. And the numbers that we give in or less than 50 inventory we average about 4.7. So, I'd say significantly lower than many others. But again we're getting really, really good performance. So, that comes out there.","But that's one of the variables that we continually update and modify and I think we mentioned an example in Texas Delaware where now we're doing more of a Chevron design in developing kind of two benches almost together and the implications of that are really good well performance and you are able to remove a well and get better performance when you combine those two together.","So, it's one of the variables we turn all the time, but I would say when you mentioned the parent-child, we're not unique. That relationship exists. I would say we've just figured out how to manage it optimally from a net present value standpoint and not just try to drive up inventory.","John Herrlin","Great. Thank you.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you.","Operator","And next we have a question from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc.","Leo Mariani","Hey, guys. I just wanted to touch quickly on the EOR business. Obviously, you guys have put some longer term growth rates between 2018 to 2022 for Permian Resources and international. Just want to get a sense of how is that EOR business play out that outlook? Is it more flattish with cost reductions? Or how do you think about that production stream?","Jeff Alvarez","It has very minimal growth. It's on the order of 1% CAGR over that time period. So we continue -- as we show we have tons of inventory for further EOR projects, so we continue to prosecute that. But we need more inject and other things. So it\u2019s CAGR is around 1%.","Cedric Burgher","The one thing I'd add to that is if you had noticed when created the Low Carbon Ventures group last year, we've got some milestones listed in that area too. It's not reflected in the 2022 outlook but it is certainly an area that we like to make great progress and develop. And as Jeff mentioned we have a lot of running room to grow in terms of EOR projects if you could just get more CO2. It's kind of the irony in today's world where most people want to eliminate CO2 emissions and we just can't get enough CO2 commercially to our locations. And it's an area we're focused on.","Vicki Hollub","Yeah, the bottom line is that that's another potential upside for our 2022 plan.","Leo Mariani","Okay. And just shifting gears over the new block you guys picked up in UAE there. You certainly talked about a plethora of prospects over there. Presumably is most of the activity going to be focused on oil over the next couple of years, obviously, you're neighboring out holes and block there is more gassy, can you just give us any color on what you're targeting?","Ken Dillon","Yeah, it's mainly oil we\u2019re targeting as I mentioned earlier between the super giant fields in Abu Dhabi and the prolific fields in Oman, we\u2019re focused mainly on oil.","Leo Mariani","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","In the interest of time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Vicki Hollub for any closing remarks.","Vicki Hollub","I want to thank you all for your questions and have a good day. Thanks. Bye.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"16104":["Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 25, 2012 11:30 AM ET","Executives","Christopher G.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Occidental Petroleum Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","Mr. Stavros, you may begin your conference.","Christopher G. Stavros","Thank you, Christie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Occidental Petroleum's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.","Joining us on the call this morning from Los Angeles are Stephen Chazen, Oxy's President and Chief Executive Officer; Cynthia Walker, Oxy's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bill Albrecht, President of Oxy's Oil and Gas Operation in the Americas; and Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas Business.","In just a moment, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Cynthia Walker, who will review our financial and operating results for this year's third quarter. Steve Chazen will then follow with comments on our strategy, progress, as well as providing some guidance for the remainder of this year.","Our third quarter 2012 earnings press release, investor relations supplemental schedules and the conference call presentation slides, which refer both to Cynthia's and Steve's remarks, can be downloaded off of our website at www.oxy.com.","I'll now turn the call over to Cynthia Walker. Cynthia, please go ahead.","Cynthia L. Walker","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Income from continuing operations was $1.4 billion or $1.70 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $1.8 billion or $2.18 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011 and $1.3 billion or $1.64 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012. The third quarter income from continuing operations improved by $0.06 per diluted share from the second quarter of this year. The improvement reflected higher margins in the marketing and trading businesses, partially offset by lower earnings in the chemical segment.","In the oil and gas business, the effect of higher liquids production and domestic gas prices was partially offset by the impact of a 3% decline in realized worldwide crude oil prices.","Now let me turn to the segment breakdown for the third quarter. In the oil and gas business, earnings for the third quarter of 2012 were $2 billion, compared to $2 billion in the second quarter of 2012 and $2.6 billion in the third quarter of 2011. Overall, third quarter 2012 production was 766,000 barrels per day, flat with the record set by the company in the second quarter of 2012, and up 4% from the third quarter of 2011.","Our domestic production was 469,000 barrels per day, an increase of 7,000 barrels per day from the second quarter of 2012, and most notably, the eighth consecutive quarter of domestic record volume growth for the company.","Production was 8% higher in the third quarter of 2011 -- versus the third quarter of 2011. Almost all the sequential quarterly increase came from the Permian and Williston basins. California production was higher in liquids, but flat on an overall BOE basis with the second quarter, mainly due to lower gas volumes associated with initial startup issues of the new gas plant. These issues were resolved mid-quarter, although the positive effect of the plant on overall third quarter production was muted as a result.","Today, the plant continues to run as expected, and California's current production run rate is approximately 150,000 barrels per day.","In Latin America, volumes were 32,000 barrels per day. And in the Middle East, volumes were 265,000 barrels per day. I'll note meaningful sequential changes in Qatar production, however, details regarding other company-specific production levels are available as usual in the investor relations supplemental schedules that we provide.","Dolphin's production was 13,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter, resulting from the full cost recovery of pre-startup capital, as we noted to anticipate last quarter.","Qatar's production was also impacted by a facility outage in August, which reduced production in the quarter by about 5,000 barrels per day. The outage was subsequently resolved.","The rest of the Middle East partially offset these decreases in part due to higher spending levels. Factors affecting production sharing and similar contracts, including oil prices, did not significantly impact the quarter's production volumes compared to the third quarter of 2011 or the second quarter of 2012.","Third quarter 2012 realized prices were mixed for our products compared to the second quarter of the year. Our worldwide crude oil realized price was $96.62 per barrel, a decrease of about 3%. Worldwide NGLs were $40.65 per barrel, also a decrease of about 3% from the second quarter, while domestic natural gas prices were $2.48 per million cubic feet, an improvement of 19%.","The change in worldwide crude oil realized price was primarily due to the mix of sales volumes in the quarter. Third quarter 2012 realized prices were lower than third quarter 2011 prices for all of our products. On a year-over-year basis, price decreases were 1% for worldwide crude oil, 27% for worldwide NGLs and 41% for domestic natural gas.","Realized oil prices for the quarter represented 105% of the average WTI price and 88% of the average Brent price. Realized NGL prices were 44% of the average WTI price and realized domestic gas prices were 90% of the average NYMEX price.","At current global prices, a $1 per barrel change in oil prices affects our quarterly earnings before income taxes by approximately $36 million, and $8 million per $1 per barrel change in NGL prices. A change of $0.50 per million BTU in domestic gas prices affects quarterly pretax earnings by about $35 million. These price change sensitivities include the impact of production sharing and similar contract volume changes on income.","Oil and gas production costs were $15 per barrel for the first 9 months of 2012. This is compared to $12.84 per barrel for the full year of 2011. The cost increase reflects higher well maintenance activity, in part reflecting our higher well count, higher workover activity and higher support and injection costs.","Taxes other than on income, which are generally related to product prices, were $2.43 per barrel for the first 9 months of 2012, compared to $2.21 per barrel for the full year of 2011. And third quarter exploration expense was $69 million.","Now turning to the chemical segment. Earnings for the third quarter of 2012 were $164 million (sic) [$162 million], compared to $194 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $245 million for the third quarter of 2011. Both the sequential quarterly and year-over-year declines were due to lower Asian market demand that drove export prices lower, partially offset by lower ethylene costs.","In the midstream segment, earnings were $156 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared to $77 million in the second quarter of 2012, and as well in the third quarter of 2011. The 2012 quarterly increase in earnings was in the marketing and trading business primarily and power generation, partially offset by lower margins in the gas plants, reflecting lower NGL prices.","Our worldwide effective tax rate was 38% for the third quarter of 2012. The lower rate compared to our guidance was attributable to a shift in the mix of income towards more domestic. Our third quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the investor relations supplemental schedules.","In the first 9 months of 2012, we generated $9.2 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital changes. Working capital reduced our 9 month cash flow from operations by approximately $660 million to $8.5 billion. Approximately $510 million of the working capital use occurred in the third quarter. Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of 2012 were $7.7 billion, of which $2.6 billion was spent in the third quarter.","Year-to-date capital expenditures by segment were 82% in the oil and gas business, 14% in midstream, and the remainder in the chemicals business.","Acquisitions for the first 9 months of 2012 were $1.2 billion, of which $100 million was spent in the third quarter. Financing activities, which include dividends paid, stock buybacks and a $1.74 billion borrowing earlier this year, provided a $300 million net cash inflow for the first 9 months of the year. These and other net cash flows resulted in a $3.8 billion cash balance at September 30.","The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the first 9 months of 2012 were 810.1 million, and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 810.8 million. Diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were approximately 810.1 million.","And lastly, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 16%. Copies of the press release announcing our third quarter earnings and the investor relations supplemental schedules are available on our website at www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR system.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve Chazen to discuss an update on our strategy, our operations and also provide guidance for the fourth quarter of the year.","Stephen I. Chazen","Thank you, Cynthia. Oxy's domestic oil and gas segment produced record volumes for the eighth consecutive quarter and continued to execute in our liquids production growth strategy.","In the third quarter, domestic production of 469,000 barrel equivalents per day, consisting of 334,000 barrels of liquids and 812 million cubic feet of gas per day, was an increase of 7,000 barrel equivalents per day compared with the second quarter of 2012. The increase in domestic production over the second quarter of 2012, almost entirely in oil, which grew from 249,000 barrels a day to 260,000. Gas production declined 28 million cubic feet of gas per day on a sequential quarterly basis, mainly in California, some of which was due to the initial startup issues of the new gas plant that Cynthia mentioned. Compared with the third quarter of 2011, our domestic production grew by 8%, or 33,000 barrels a day, of which 30,000 a day was oil production growth.","Our annualized return on equity for the first 9 months of 2012 was 15% and return on capital employed was 13%.","As we near the end of 2012, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on our strategy, our progress and our future. As a company, we continue to have 3 main objectives: Generate rates of return on invested capital significantly in excess of our cost of capital, achieve moderate growth of the business and deliver continued dividend growth. With regards to returns, we don't believe that a depleting or shrinking business or selling profitable future opportunities to fund high-decline production can yield high rates of return. One can reduce spending to achieve short-term higher returns, but these returns would not be sustainable as the company would deplete. Our business model is to balance the need for growth of the business, while maintaining attractive returns.","We are currently in an investing phase in many of our businesses, where higher-than-normal portion of our capital is spent on longer-term projects. This year we expect to spend approximately 25% of our total capital expenditures on future growth projects that will contribute to our operations over the next several years. These expenditures include: Capital for the Al Hosn Shah gas project, which we expect to start production in late 2014; capital for gas and CO2 processing plants and pipelines to maintain or expand the capacity of these facilities to handle future production increases; part of the capital for the chemical segment and other items.","In our oil and gas business, we have built a portfolio of assets that allow us to execute this strategy. Domestically and internationally, we have a business mix of both higher return assets and higher growth assets. Importantly, many of our higher growth assets are relatively early in their development, although we have already experienced meaningful success.","In the U.S., our Permian CO2 operations continue to be our most profitable business, generating the highest free cash flow after capital among our entire portfolio of assets.","In contrast, our Permian non-CO2 business is one of the fastest growing assets in our entire portfolio. Since we've began significant delineation and development efforts in late 2010, we have grown production by over 25%. As a result of the significant activity by us and our partners, our Permian acreage, where we believe resource development is likely, has grown from our estimate of about 3 million gross acres earlier in the year to about 4.8 million acres in October. Oxy's share of this acreage grew from about 1 million acres to about 1.7 million acres during the same period. The attached conference call presentation slide shows our current acreage position in the Permian.","In California, we have a very large acreage position with diverse geological characteristic and numerous reservoir targets. As a result, development opportunities range from conventional to steam floods, to water floods and shale drilling. The drilling cost and expected ultimate recoveries also vary for each area.","In mid-2010, we shifted our development program to conventional and unconventional opportunities outside the traditional and more mature Elk Hills areas. As a result, we have experienced strong production growth in these new areas, although traditional Elk Hills had experienced some decline. As you can see on the attached conference call presentation slide, traditional Elk Hills production dropped from 41,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 37,000 in the third quarter of 2012.","Liquids production growth in the rest of California more than offset this decline during the same period, growing from 49,000 barrels a day to 69,000. Traditional Elk Hills gas production declined from 22,000 equivalent barrels per day to 19,000 during the same period, which was mostly offset by an increase in gas production in the rest of California from 21,000 equivalent barrels a day to 23,000.","Recently, we further modified our programs to emphasize oil production in light of depressed gas prices and associated liquids. As a result, gas production in all of California declined in the third quarter of this year. Total California growth on a BOE basis is slower than we thought it would be, in part due to the higher-than-expected declines at Elk Hills, permitting issues, and more recently, low gas prices. On a positive note, overall performance of the new resources has been consistent with expectations, including our unconventional opportunities, for which well performance is similar to the type curves we showed you a couple of years ago.","I would also note that over the last several years, we spent $370 million on the new Elk Hills gas plant. The plant went into operation in early July and, not withstanding initial startup issues, is positively affecting our operational efficiency and production, including higher liquids yields. The plant operated optimally for about 1 month in the last quarter and has been operating as expected since.","We will continue to focus on higher return, low-cost opportunities in California, and as I mentioned, this is a very diverse opportunity set. For example, one of the projects we haven't talked about much in the past is a major steam flood project in Lost Hills. We expect to achieve significant production growth, about 15,000 barrels a day in several years, from the current 4,000 barrel a day rate. Total oil in place is estimated to be about 500 million barrels. Using reasonable assumptions, we expect to recover over 50 million barrels net to Oxy. Our drilling cost in this area average in the low $200,000 per well, and we expect to bring this average cost down over time.","In the Williston basin in North Dakota, we currently have over 310,000 net acres of significant resource potential, which we estimate to be about 250 million net barrels. Our production in the basin has tripled since we entered the area over 1.5 years ago. We have recently slowed our drilling activity and significantly reduced our rig count in the basin as a result of cost pressures. While well costs have subsequently declined modestly, we will only increase our rig count when costs come down enough to make returns competitive with the rest of our portfolio. We believe that over the long term, our resource base in the Williston basin represents a significant opportunity for the company.","In the Mid-Continent, including our assets in South Texas, we have significantly reduced our gas drilling. However, we could ramp up our gas production rapidly and meaningfully if prices for gas and liquids improved from their current level on a sustained basis. Internationally, our most significant businesses are in the Middle East region, where our operations are characterized by limited duration contracts with high rates return on invested capital during the contract term.","Our primary focus in the Middle East is United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar, which includes Dolphin. Most of our international capital is allocated to these countries, and we derive a very substantial portion of our international earnings and free cash flow after capital from Qatar and Oman. Going forward, the UAE, where we are developing the Al Hosn gas project, is also expected to make a significant contribution to earnings and free cash flow.","The Al Hosn gas project is approximately 61% complete and is progressing as planned. The project made up about 11% of our total capital program for the first 9 months of this year. While capital spending is running higher for 2012 than our initially anticipated levels, total development capital for the project is expected to be in line with previous estimates.","Currently, the Al Hosn project is consuming sizable amounts of capital during its development phase. We expect to see a significant shift in late 2014, when the project changes from being a cash consumer to a cash generator. Once the project becomes operational, early free cash flow should generate -- should be approximately $600 million annually at roughly current oil prices and conservative sulfur prices. The project has the potential for additional production in later years, which would significantly increase its cash flow.","We're going to spend approximately $1.2 billion on the Al Hosn project this year. Once the project becomes operational, our free cash flow should increase by the difference in the capital -- between capital consumption and generation. Based on our 2012 capital spend for the project, this would equate to a $1.8 billion increase in our annual cash flow.","Lastly, we are focusing on improving our returns through a comprehensive effort to reduce operating expenses and improve capital efficiency. As we indicated in the past, our operating costs have been increasing for some time for a variety of reasons: including industry inflation; our desire to take advantage of high product prices by accelerating production through workovers, which pay for themselves over a short period of time; and our recent rapid growth, which has caused some short-term inefficiencies. We are embarking on an aggressive plan to improve our operational efficiencies over all cost categories, including capital, with a view to achieve an appreciable reduction in our operating expenses and our drilling cost to at least last year's levels. We believe that we will start seeing the benefit of this plan clearly in the first quarter of 2013 and achieve last year's cost levels by the end of the next year on a run rate basis. Several initiatives have already begun, and we are seeing good early results. For example, during the third quarter, we reduced our drilling cost by over 15% in parts of Elk Hills. Our goal next year is to reduce U.S. well costs by about this amount.","I will now turn to guidance for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter capital spending will slow from the third quarter level to a run rate that we believe will be in line with next year's total capital program. Our intention was to reduce capital spending meaningfully starting in the third quarter. However, this would have resulted in inefficiency in areas where we were seeing positive results, such as the Permian, parts of California and Oman.","As we discussed in prior quarters, we are sharply reducing our pure gas drilling and have more recently cut back our drilling in certain liquids-rich areas as well. We are also in the process of eliminating our less productive rigs to improve our returns.","Our focus on much higher-return oil drilling will result in a decline in our gas, and to a much lesser extent, NGL production in the future.","Turning to production expectations in the fourth quarter. Over the last year, we achieved our goal of increasing domestic production by 6,000 to 8,000 barrels equivalent per day quarter-over-quarter. We expect our fourth quarter oil production to grow by about this much. However, the expected decline in gas production, resulting from the change in our capital program focus I discussed earlier, may offset some of the increased oil production on an equivalent barrels per day basis. Internationally, at current prices we expect production to be approximately flat with the third quarter, while sales volumes will increase slightly.","We expect fourth quarter exploration expense to be about $100 million for seismic and drilling in our exploration program. The fourth quarter is typically the chemical segment's weakest quarter. We estimate fourth quarter earnings will be about $140 million, or slightly lower than the third quarter. Along with seasonal factors, weak global demand from the European and Asian economies and rising natural gas costs will keep pressure on the margins. We expect the worldwide tax rate for the fourth quarter in 2012 to increase to about 40% to 41%.","In closing, we believe that we have a deep portfolio of development opportunities that will allow us to continue to deliver returns that are 5 to 6 points above our cost of capital. Total return to our shareholders is a combination of appreciation in stock price and dividends. We have long believed that the job of management is to convert earnings that are retained into stock market value.","For example, if we retain $1 billion, we should be able to give the shareholders at least $1 billion increase in the market value of the company. Historically, we have generated closer to $1.5 in value for each $1 kept. This is a challenging proposition over time as the company continues to grow. An old Wall Street maxim is that, \"The market is a voting machine over the short term, but a weighing machine over time.\" We hope that this is true, as we firmly believe that our program of investing in a longer-than-usual, for us, timeframe will reap rewards for our shareholders. If for some reason, our investment plans do not generate acceptable stock market results over the next few months, we will return more of our retained earnings to our shareholders.","We have increased our dividends at a compounded rate of 15.8% over the last 10 years through 11 dividend increases. We expect to increase our dividends again next year and in the future at a rate that would maximize return to our shareholders.","I think we're now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Doug Terreson of ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Your emphasis on returns on capital was pretty clear from today's comments. And on this point, I wanted to better understand the point about achieving 2011 cost levels by the end of '13. First is, is that the correct interpretation? And if so, does that imply the pretax cost savings will be above $1 billion, maybe $1.5 billion? And if so, are there some specific compartments from which those cost savings will emanate that you can highlight to us today?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, there's 2 elements of the cost saving. One is operating cost. And I think it's fairly straightforward to take the current $15 rate and subtract from last year's number and multiply by 275 million barrels, which is roughly the annual production. That will give you an idea of sort of the savings. I hope to beat that, frankly. We should be able to, but I think that's what we're going to say for now. There may be some G&A savings too, but we haven't really baked that in. On the capital, I think it's fairly straightforward to say that the capital program for the U.S. business, if we say 15% on wells, the capital for the U.S. business will decline sort of by that amount. So with the cash flow savings, you're right about where that will be. We may decline the U.S. business by more than that, frankly. But it just depends on how well they're converting dollars into returns. We can delay drilling where the returns aren't as good as we would like, and I'm going to be more aggressive in the capital program than I've been in the last year. So a lot more negative feedback to the unit. So I think you should look to lower capital levels next year for the U.S. business. International business is a little more complicated because a lot of that's really not in our control, but similar levels. About the only increased area I see is in the midstream, where we're going to build a pipeline from our gathering system and our pipelines in the West Texas to the Houston area, and that will cost us about $400 million. And we hope to capture a fair amount of the differential and improve our returns that way. But we're going to focus a lot more starting this quarter but in the quarters ahead, on improving the returns and translating more of the volume growth into profits.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve, I've got a couple, if I may. The first one is really on your very last comment about -- I don't want to paraphrase you too badly here, but if your current strategy doesn't translate to shareholder returns or better shareholder return to the share price, I guess, you're going to take a different track. Can I just ask you to elaborate on that a little bit, because obviously, there has been, as you're well aware, material underperformance of the stock. And I'm just wondering how tolerant you're going to be of that on a go-forward basis before...","Stephen I. Chazen","Not too tolerant, I think is the short answer. I don't know whether -- I don't know the form it will take. But dividends are the easiest form because that way everybody knows. They actually get the check. If the stock is trading at crummy levels, there'll be more emphasis on share repurchase than we've done historically. But my tolerance level is modest. If we don't see -- if I don't see real improvements in the returns in the next couple of quarters, strategy will change.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. My follow-up is really, as you're well aware there's been a fair amount of -- I'm not going to call it misinformation, but there's been a lot of questions on, specifically, around the California assets, given perhaps the fact that you haven't given a lot of disclosure. I'm curious, when you talk about reallocating capital, if your type curves are still per your presentation in 2010 and your liquids mix is as per your presentation and of course, your costs presumably, are down, and now you've got the gas plant, I could go on and on and on about all the things that have lined up here. It seems to us anyway that those have got to be some of the more compelling returns in the portfolio. So I'll just ask you to explain, why are you not getting after that a little more aggressively, now that you've got the gas plant in place, the cost down and so on, and accumulated permits in place? And I'll leave it at that.","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes. The permitting process, well, is working pretty well in the fields, that is the existing fields. Extending beyond the fields is still slow. And so, and some of the plants -- there's some air quality permits that are slow in coming. The permitting process is a lot better, say, in Elk Hills field or Buena Vista field or some of the other fields. Outside of the field, it's still slower than it used to be. The only way I can assure that there's -- getting the squeal out of every dollar that they spend, is to tighten their capital, rather than give them more money. And so they will probably suffer less in the capital tightening, but they can still take their costs down considerably. And the more capital -- I don't know how to say it, but discourages prudent spending. So I think their capital program will not be as affected as some others, but will still be affected some. And there are clearly some efficiencies that are needed there. I think they're operating costs are way too high, and they need to bring their operating cost by a whole bunch. And I understand that -- and to some extent, I'm pushed and pulled. I got half the shareholders think I should spend $2 billion a year on capital, and the other half think I should spend $20 billion a year. So I'm trying to maybe probably unsuccessfully sort of weave our way through that. But I think that -- if this thing doesn't -- if they don't get their operating cost down, which is what I'm most focused on, because that translates immediately to profits, then I'm going to continue to tighten there, and there'll be some other changes there in the business unit. The same thing, frankly, in the Permian, where their operating costs are still too high. And the operating costs affect the profits right away and affects our cash flow right away. The capital affects it over time and our drilling -- we're simplifying our program, we'll be drilling fewer, different types of wells next year, and that should make us more efficient. I think we can improve the capital efficiency a fair amount. But where I'm looking for it is, is in the operating costs because there I can affect it more quickly. And if they don't do it soon, there's going to be widespread changes in the operation.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Let me ask you a very quick follow-up. There seems to be a perception that you've got something, pardon me for being direct, but you've got something to hide in California with your failure to be more transparent. Would you care to address that? And then I'll leave it at that.","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, sure. I think the way -- I've tried to think about how to show this. We're effectively the only one drilling in California. So you can't look at somebody else, which is what you can do in the Permian or something like that. We show you the actual -- again this quarter, we take out old Elk Hills and we show you the growth in the other business. That's really the best way to look at the total business. The acquisition program doesn't add much in California because there really isn't any volumes to buy. And so that's growing at a very high rate, and if that were a standalone business, you would think it was terrific. This is the best way to show what's going on. There's really nothing to hide. We aren't drilling as many shale wells as somebody would like. And the reason is, and it goes back to this capital efficiency question, if I could bore you for a second. A shale well has a very high decline rate, maybe 30%, 40% the first year, maybe more. Okay, so I could boost this year's production by drilling a bunch of shale wells. But in order to keep the production flat next year, my capital program has to go up, because I got to drill more wells. I mean -- and so that goes against the capital efficiency that people are looking for, and the free cash flow. So I'm trying to do more conventional drilling, which has a lesser decline rate, to keep the capital from bloating in California, and I don't want it to bloat. There's really nothing to hide, and we show you this number excluding Elk Hills. The disappointment has been at Elk Hills, where the decline rate has been worse than we thought. And maybe the gas plant will make it better, maybe it won't. It's doing fine now, and we'll just have to see. But there's really nothing to hide. I disclosed the Lost Hills numbers for a reason. In some report somebody sent me, I don't know where it came from, the guy estimated that the Lost Hills wells were costing $3 million each. They cost roughly $200,000 each. So either the guy doesn't know anything about California or it was deliberately designed to make the numbers for the total of California look worse. Did somebody think we would drill 120 wells that had a $250 breakeven? So we disclosed that. And if you either take Lost Hills out of the numbers or put the right numbers in there, it doesn't really look so bad. While we could track the number of wells that were in that report, we couldn't track the other numbers that he used. So I don't think there's anything to hide. We've shown you what in aggregate is going on, which is all you really should care about.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ed Westlake of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess I'll try another one on California. And I know that's just because obviously there have been a lot of research reports that may or may not have been correct. So you say that you have to reduce costs before you want to put more assets to work. I mean, is that a concern that you have of the average IPs, they're not as good as you are hoping? I mean, is there any statistical well data you could share with us this morning?","Stephen I. Chazen","It isn't really the IP rates. The IP rates have actually gotten better. The operating costs has reduced the margins to a point where they're going to overspend on operating costs, and it doesn't make sense to encourage that. And so we're not going to -- with the reductions in the capital program, in the cost of the wells that they say they can achieve, and that they will achieve, they'll be able to drill more wells for the same money, which is the true objective. The leases aren't going anywhere. So that's where -- I'm a steward for this money. I'm not -- the goal is not volume growth per se, but profit growth. And we focused on volume growth and the profit growth sort of went away. So that's not -- and California is a big piece of the total. And you can't change the company without improving California. So for the near term -- oil guys, I think, I tell people this all the time only half jokingly, can only work on one thing at a time. So if you tell them you want volume growth, they'll give you volume growth, but some of the other stuff doesn't show up. And if you say, well, what I want is something else, it's only one thing at a time. So I guess I'm going to have to be more agile in giving them objectives. Maybe I have to give quarterly objectives, not annual ones. But the operating costs that they're running in California doesn't make any sense to me. They were running a lot less, half, 2 years ago. And they need to be back to that. If they do that, they'll have plenty of capital to drill the wells.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then a follow-up on the CapEx side. I mean, this is focused more in the midstream. $1.4 billion, I guess, this year, which is obviously ramped up. Some of that's Shah, some of it's integrity in the domestic business. But as you look at your plans, and I think you said that CapEx will go up next year because you want to build this additional pipe. But is there a year at which that, as you look at the forward plans, that you've done enough of that spend, and it will fall to free up some free cash as well?","Stephen I. Chazen","I would -- once we're through this pipeline and the Al Hosn project, the spending on the plant will basically end in 2014. It will fall the next year. Because you shift from a plant phase to a drilling phase. So the actual spending on Al Hosn will decline some next year and more on the following year as you go from drilling to building out the plant. I think Chris showed you a picture of the plant in the presentation there. This is not a small plant. So it's going to take -- so spending will decline some on the plant next year, and by the following year, it will be down considerably. And we'll be through with the pipeline next year. It's a 1-year program, really. So that will fall off pretty sharply. Unless there turns out to be -- you should understand that if this arbitrage continues, where you can buy oil in our pipeline system at $85 and sell it on the Gulf Coast at $100, we'll probably spend more gathering other people's oil and shipping it through our lines, and that's -- until we do enough of it that the arbitrage goes away.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Steve, that was very interesting and your words were interesting about, quite specifically, if things don't change within the next few months, which came not long after you had said how the market is a voting and weighing machine depending on your timeframe. Are you saying that if the stock price doesn't improve over the -- relative performance doesn't improve over the next few months, you would essentially radically change the strategy, if you like, the long-term strategy? Or are you saying that if you don't get the cost improvements over the next few months, you would radically change your strategy?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, I think we're saying some of each. If the relative performance doesn't improve, then we'll return more money to the shareholders, one way or another.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Relative stock performance?","Stephen I. Chazen","Relative stock performance. I think it's also useful to note that we have a 75% or so correlation to WTI as a stock, which is a lot more than other people. So to some extent, some of it's caused by the decline in WTI, I think. But putting that aside, the costs are how I intend to make the performance of the stock do better. So you got to say, what's the tool to make it so? The tool is bringing the costs under control and improving the profitability. If that doesn't work, that is to say, the profitability improves and the stock continues to be a dog, then we'll have to rethink the whole thing.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","To use your words, that the stock's been a dog over the past year, I'm not sure why you haven't, for example, A, changed the dividend most recently, but B, why there's been so little buyback in the recent months?","Stephen I. Chazen","The buyback is -- basically when we know what the earnings are, we stop buying back. And so a lot of the decline, for whatever reason, shows up in the month before the earnings call. But buybacks are, as far as raising the dividend, we raise it once a year. And it's, whatever, 16% compounded growth in the dividend over a decade, starting not from 0 like some companies. So I don't know what the complaint would be. But fundamentally, dividends are raised once a year once we -- and it goes with setting the program. So we go to the board, we set the program, we figure how much we're going to spend and we figure out how much the dividends go with it. So it's all done together. I think doing the dividends in a vacuum doesn't give the board the kind of oversight that it should have.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","No, I guess my point was that your balance sheet would suggest you could do both. I mean, you could be buying back stock aggressively as well as pursuing the cost.","Stephen I. Chazen","We could.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Now in the past, you've talked about, I guess this is going to be a pretty obvious answer, but in the past, you said you have a vision of the value of the stock on any given day. And I think what you're saying obviously is that you feel it's poorly valued relative to what you think it's really worth. But again, I still don't understand why the buyback has been so muted, given that.","Stephen I. Chazen","The buyback is done on a formula basis. And if -- at the current levels, our current levels this morning anyway, when I woke up, you get one set of numbers at higher levels, you basically buy less back. If you look at the -- we don't look at relative performance when we do the share buyback. The share buyback is against absolute value. And so the lower the stock falls, the more shares are bought back.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And then finally for me, it sounds like the action you would take would be a radical, let's say radical, I don't know if that's the right word, financial approach, probably cutting CapEx aggressively, probably significantly raising the dividend, possibly buying back stock. Is there an alternate strategy that would be, for example, to split the company, sell the company, anything in  the other direction?","Stephen I. Chazen","I don't know if anybody's got enough money to buy it.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Then I'll ask about splitting.","Stephen I. Chazen","Splitting, you got to be -- if you split it, you really have to have assets that would be valued materially differently than the overall. And it's very difficult right now to see -- I don't know what an international business would trade for. So I think that before you go down the splitting the company route, you got to see whether -- you got to see whether you can bring your costs under control.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the last, very last one for me, would you consider special dividends or do you want to make those a regular?","Stephen I. Chazen","Regular dividends work better.","Operator","Your next question comes from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, just kind of following up on that last point there. So if there's the possibility, if the underperformance continues, that you cut CapEx and raise the cash returns to shareholders, I mean, the Al Hosn project, that CapEx is going to be what it's going to be. You've added acreage in the Permian. You've added acreage in the Bakken. You've got a huge acreage position in California. Presumably, it doesn't make sense to just sit on these assets. Asset sales, joint ventures, bringing in others to drill this stuff, is that part of the plan? Practically speaking, what does it really mean to cut CapEx when you've been building up these big acreage positions over the years?","Stephen I. Chazen","In the poorer performing or the lower opportunity areas, you might think of doing something like that. In the stuff that's got long term, very strong potentially, you don't really want to sell your futures. So but you could cut the cap -- for example, you could cut the capital. We haven't really added much acreage in the Permian. All we're showing you here is that the areas that we think that have resource potential have grown. We haven't really bought the acreage. That's just recharacterizing what we own. You don't know, but you don't really -- if you have stuff that has long-term potential, you don't really want to sell your futures, if you can avoid it. But if you looked and you said, well, okay, for the next -- you could cut the -- the U.S. business, especially long-term leases or ownership outright, you could cut the capital, and then as the Al Hosn project comes on in a couple of years, suddenly you got a $1.8 billion swing, and so you could bring your capital, you could use some of that then. So I view it as sort of a deferral mechanism, rather than just sort of cutting it. But if they can't -- if they can't generate the returns in some of the assets, we might farm some out to people who might operate more efficiently.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Absolutely. So I know you've worked on the organization over the years. And I think it was a couple of years ago, you were pretty honest about -- classically, you guys are an EOR company, not a shale drilling company. You're now kind of, again, going after that same operational execution ability. Do you have to acquire a company that can do this stuff for you? I mean...","Stephen I. Chazen","No, I don't think so. It was 2 years ago, we had this exact conversation in New York. And I said that, we were shifting the business from a -- for want of a better word, an EOR\/acquisition company to something that was more operational and more traditional. And I said that was not going to be easy, and I was right. And we've lowered -- I don't know how to say it, the average experience level, I guess is the politically correct way of saying it, of the people. And so some more mistakes have been made than might otherwise have been made. But I think we're getting there, I hope we're getting there. I'm just in a hurry because I'm older than the average. So it's taken longer and been more difficult to change the organization to operational efficiency. One of the issues we have is, outside the United States, our competitors have names like Shell and Exxon and BP, and they operate differently than a small company might operate. We spend a sizable percentage of our capital on environmental, health and safety issues, similar probably to the percentages that Exxon or somebody like that would in both the U.S. and internationally. The smaller producers simply probably doesn't do that. And so we're never going to be the absolute best, because of the fact we're more environmentally focused than some small producer can be. On the other hand, we can be a lot better than we are. And it's been more difficult, there's no question about it, and it's come -- I knew it would be difficult. And we've made a number of changes in the people that are running the assets, brought more aggressive people, and if need be, we'll make more changes.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just the final one on this point, Steve. I think for any larger company, there's really no great examples of being able to grow at a fast rate and generating good returns. Sometimes over a few years, luck happens and it can happen. But you've had a 5% to 8% growth objective, you've historically had top quartile returns on capital, is this really just an acknowledgment that having both of those goals is just not possible and you are picking returns right now?","Stephen I. Chazen","Pretty much a lot of the growth is baked in for the next few years with the capital we've invested. But we need to do it with returns. It isn't just about volume growth. At some point in size, the need for capital becomes so -- a typical E&P today, whatever they say, I mean, they may sell assets to fund it, is spending, I don't know, 150% of its cash flow on capital. We obviously aren't spending anywhere near that nor would we. So you can't grow as quickly as they do. We spend more on capital as a percentage than are generated [ph]. So it's attempt to do both. I don't know where you come out in the percentages. Obviously, if we said, well, we're going to grow 15% a year, that wouldn't be something we could do. But we need to grow at a moderate rate, because I think the business -- if you don't grow at least some and on a regular basis, I don't mean by saying, well, in 2014 -- in 2017, we're on track for our 2017 program. We're going to grow in 2017, meanwhile we're going to deplete 5% a year. That's not what I call growth. But regular growth, you have a hard time attracting people, investors tend not to like it, they tend to compare you to basically depleting businesses. So you got to have a fair amount of growth. I don't know what the right percentage is. Right now, it's 5% to 8%. We're running really about 5%, currently. And there'll be a boost in 2015 from the Al Hosn project, which will bring the growth rate up. Over a long term, we're not going to just make the -- if you continue to drill high-decline wells, your capital will soar, because if your wells are declining 30%, 40%, you need huge amounts of cash to keep -- to replace the 40% and grow. And so we're shifting the program to more stable things so we can keep the capital under control. And that's really what we're doing underneath the hood, if you were to look at it that way. Instead of drilling as many high-decline wells, we're drilling more -- we're doing more stuff that has a lesser decline rate, which is what we historically did.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Portillo of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a few quick questions for me. You mentioned that on the release, the Q4 CapEx. And I was just curious if you could give us a specific number that you're looking at for Q4 CapEx?","Stephen I. Chazen","Since my reliability on this has been crummy, the only thing I'll give you is that in September, we ran about 785, and we're coming -- on a month, that's a monthly number. And it's coming down from that as the wells come -- as it comes down. So that would give you sort of a feel for it. And I think that's a -- I've missed it so many quarters, I'd just as soon not miss it one more.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Sure. And then just on the M&A front, could you talk a little bit about the M&A market today and kind of your interest level? It sounds like -- kind of with the packages in the market today, there may not be that much interest, but just curious on your views.","Stephen I. Chazen","We always look at stuff in our core areas. Really right now, the only area I would call core right now is the Permian. There's a rush to do -- by private people, to do something by the end of the year, lest their tax rates go up. There might be some things, but they would be oily and basically in the Permian, if there was anything. There's some other stuff going around, it's pretty gassy. And I'm not sure we would do that. The market is not good for sellers particularly. It may not be good for buyers either, but it's definitely not good for sellers. So especially for larger packages, I think you can do a $100 million deal and get 25 people to bid. At $500 million, you're lucky if you attract one. And I think that's really where the market is today, where there's money for small deals and really no money for large deals. The larger being $500 million deals. We don't have any appetite for large-scale M&A. We've said that for several quarters.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And just a last question for me. Could we get just, I guess, a quick update on maybe where your rig count is roughly in the Permian, California and Mid-Con, Bakken? And then as we think about that 2013 program, can you give us just a rough direction on maybe where those are heading, either up or down, just directionally trying to get a better sense of that capital allocation?","Stephen I. Chazen","I don't -- as far as next year goes, we sent the team back several times, as you could probably tell from the tone of my voice. So I'd hate to talk about what next year is going to look like at this point. We've cut back materially, I think in the -- Bill, in the Williston, how many rigs are you running?","William E. Albrecht","We have 4 running right now, Steve.","Stephen I. Chazen","And we peaked at?","William E. Albrecht","We peaked at 14.","Stephen I. Chazen","14, so that gives you a feel for the Williston. California, it varies a lot. We might drop -- and the type of rigs run. And so we're running about...","William E. Albrecht","20 in California.","Stephen I. Chazen","About 20, about 20 in California. Permian also, there's been some rigs dropped, and we peaked at?","William E. Albrecht","Peaked at around 32.","Stephen I. Chazen","And we're sort of 1\/2 that.","William E. Albrecht","We're at 21 now.","Stephen I. Chazen","21. Okay.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And is that just a function of kind of where we are in the capital spend for this year? Or is that really, as we think about your program, and I know that you said you continue to go back to the drawing board. But just trying to get a sense of, is that activity going to accelerate a little bit into next year or you're pretty happy with the level?","Stephen I. Chazen","I think the way I'm thinking about it at this point is, is that more or less, going into next year, it's going to look like this. My current plan would be to withhold a fair amount of capital from the units, that is drilling at these levels. Until I can see which units are doing well and which ones are not. And those that do well will get some more rigs to run, and those that don't, won't. And so I think going into the first quarter, you'll see sort of this level because that's the way we sort of manage it at this point. Beyond that, we'll just see.","Operator","Your next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm just trying to reconcile some of the comments you made on California. My understanding is the opportunity in California for you is supposed to have amongst the lowest breakeven sort of oil prices in those sort of projects, or those sort of wells that you're drilling, but CapEx is running about $2 billion a year. You seem to say, you're having higher declines in Elk Hills and costs in California are higher, and it seems like you're trying to rein in some of those costs. So what is it that's -- if this is such a great opportunity, what is the -- is it now what you thought it was 2 years ago when you first started out on the program?","Stephen I. Chazen","The operating costs have doubled.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So is the resource opportunity not the same also?","Stephen I. Chazen","No. The resource opportunity's the same. It's the cost to extract it. And if you thought that was fundamental, that's one thing. And then you say, well, okay. But it's not, I think it's fixable.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Does that mean the F&D cost that you kind of talked about maybe a couple years ago, of $5 a barrel, $10 a barrel, are more like closer to $20 right now in the current environment?","Stephen I. Chazen","They're below $20. But they've come up with the well costs. And so they need to bring those down closer to where we were, and they need to bring their operating costs down. And the only way to do that is not to give more money to drill wells, even though the wells are economic, more than economic. Gas prices here are a little higher than the rest of the country and oil prices are higher. To throw more money at it is simply the wrong solution.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sure, I understand that. And the rig count in California is 20 rigs now? Weren't you at 35 kind of a little bit earlier in the year? So it sounds like you've done like an about-face on that program.","William E. Albrecht","It was around 30.","Stephen I. Chazen","Around 30.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So within a short period of time, you've cut 10 rigs out of the operation?","Stephen I. Chazen","Because we didn't like the cost of the wells.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And once again, the type of wells that you're drilling, this is all kind of the same depth, homogeneous sort of opportunities? Or is it kind of different opportunities spread across?","Stephen I. Chazen","It's different opportunities. And again, as I said earlier, we shifted the program to lower decline wells.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So I mean, the shale program that you guys had outlined before has kind of been pulled back?","Stephen I. Chazen","Some, not a lot.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And the exploration program that you guys were running in California?","Stephen I. Chazen","The exploration program has been slowed by the permitting process. We're well behind on the exploration program, by the way. So we're 2 years behind where we thought we'd be.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then if I were to look at your returns on capital employed, you're talking about a 13% sort of number for 2012. How would that split between international and domestic?","Stephen I. Chazen","I don't know. International generates higher returns on capital employed. And that's really -- that's how the company is structured. I said it from the beginning, the high returns on invested capital come out of the international business the highest. And in domestic business -- because the leases are forever and then the oil in the international business are basically cut off by the life of the contract, so the upside, if you will, in the reservoirs over time and the long-term product price goes largely to the country, but you generate good returns meanwhile. Domestically, you get to keep all that. So you generate more money domestically, but the returns are less. And that's the balance in the company, and that's how you generate the above-average returns compared to an E&P which are well into the mid-single digits.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then the last question for me, so going into next year, given this focus on returns and given where the rig count is, do you still think you can grow production year-over-year?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes.","Operator","Your final question comes from John Herrlin of Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Just a few quick ones. You've been complaining about returns now for several quarters. Why weren't you more proactive with the organization, or why do you, it just takes them that long to react?","Stephen I. Chazen","I don't know. I don't know why I wasn't -- it wasn't that I didn't try, it just didn't -- apparently it didn't translate.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay, that's fine.","Stephen I. Chazen","And I've made some changes in the management structure.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Yes. Regarding the Permian, you had about a 36% working interest. Given the potential there, why not higher, because it seems like it's probably kind of your historic level?","Stephen I. Chazen","Sorry?","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","With the Permian acreage, your working interest was about 36%.","Stephen I. Chazen","Oh, I see. The gross and net using the play acreage.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Yes, correct. Why not higher, because it seems like it's probably more your historic level?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes. It would be nice if it were higher. We acquired some properties in the last couple of years in the areas that we historically hadn't been active, and those tended to be smaller interest. So you wound up with a lower average working interest in the new plays, and that's really -- it's just a result. We would like to have higher interest. In the end, when you drill a well, you might wind up with a higher interest, by the way.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Sure. Last one for me is on the Bakken. You've also kind of complained about those operations as well. Is that really critical to you going forward long term?","Stephen I. Chazen","I think in the remarks, I pointed out the large amount of resource base there. I believe that the product prices on a relative basis have improved recently. One of the issues is at least partially on its way to resolution. The other issue is, that the wells cost too much, and we need large-scale reductions in the cost. If we can get the large-scale reductions then the assets clearly -- an asset we could -- that will be fine.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Christopher Stavros. Please go ahead, sir.","Christopher G. Stavros","Thanks, Christie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Occidental Petroleum's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call this morning from Los Angeles are Stephen Chazen, Oxy's President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Lienert, Oxy's Chief Financial Officer; Bill Albrecht, President of Oxy's Oil and Gas Business in the Americas; and Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas Operations.","In just a moment, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Jim Lienert, who will review our financial and operating results for this year's second quarter. Steve Chazen will then follow with comments on our performance and update on our capital program and production for 2012 and including our outlook for the second half of this year.","Our second quarter 2012 earnings press release, investor relations supplemental schedules, conference call presentation slides, which refer to both Jim's and Steve's remarks, can be downloaded off of our website at www.oxy.com. I'll now turn the call over to Jim Lienert. Jim, please go ahead.","James M. Lienert","Thank you, Chris. Net income was $1.3 billion or $1.64 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012 compared to $1.8 billion or $2.23 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011 and $1.6 billion or $1.92 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. All the drop in the second quarter earnings compared to the first quarter of 2012 was attributable to the decline in commodity prices. Worldwide oil and domestic gas and NGL prices were significantly lower during the quarter.","Here's a segment breakdown for the second quarter. Oil and gas segment earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $2 billion compared with $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2012 and $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2011. In the oil and gas segment, the second quarter 2012 daily production was 766,000 barrels, the highest volume in the company's history for the second consecutive quarter and was up 7% from the same period of 2011. Our total domestic production was 462,000 barrels per day, the seventh consecutive domestic quarterly volume record for the company. Our total domestic production was 9% higher than the second quarter of 2011. Latin America volumes were 33,000 barrels per day. Colombia's production of 31,000 barrels a day improved 7,000 barrels a day from the first quarter of 2012 due to significantly lower levels of insurgent activity in the second quarter. In the Middle East region, volumes were 271,000 barrels per day. In Oman, the second quarter production was 72,000 barrels per day, 2,000 barrels lower than the first quarter volumes. In Qatar, the second quarter production was 74,000 barrels per day, 2,000 barrels higher than the first quarter volumes. For Dolphin and Bahrain combined, daily production increased 7,000 barrels from the first quarter, which included planned plant shutdowns in Dolphin. The rest of the Middle East\/North Africa production decreased by 10,000 barrels per day.","Oil prices and production sharing and similar contract factors did not significantly impact this quarter's production volumes compared to the previous quarter or the second quarter of 2011. Our second quarter sales volumes were 759,000 barrels per day, slightly lower than our production volumes due to the timing of liftings in the Middle East\/North Africa. Second quarter 2012 realized prices were lower for our products compared to the first quarter of the year. Our worldwide crude oil realized price was $99.34 per barrel, a decrease of about 8%. Worldwide NGLs were $42.06 per barrel, a decrease of about 20%. And domestic natural gas prices were $2.09 per MCF, a decline of 26%.","Second quarter 2012 realized prices were also lower than the second quarter 2011 prices for all our products. On a year-over-year basis, price decreases were 4% for the worldwide crude oil, 27% for worldwide NGLs and 51% for domestic natural gas. Realized oil prices for the quarter represented 106% of the average WTI and 91% of the average Brent price. Realized NGL prices were 45% of WTI, and realized domestic gas prices were 92% of the average NYMEX price.","Price changes at current global prices affect our quarterly earnings before income taxes by $38 million for $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $8 million for $1 per barrel change in NGL prices. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices affects quarterly pretax earnings by about $35 million. These price change sensitivities include the impact of production sharing contract volume changes on income.","Oil and gas cash production costs were $14.50 a barrel for the first 6 months of 2012 compared with last year's 12-month cost of $12.84 a barrel. The cost increase reflects higher well maintenance activity, in part reflecting our higher well count, higher work overactivity and higher support and injection costs.","Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $2.46 per barrel for the first 6 months of 2012, similar to last year's comparable period. Second quarter exploration expense was $96 million.","Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $194 million compared to $184 million in the first quarter of 2012 and $253 million for the second quarter of 2011. The sequential quarterly improvement was due to improved PVC and VCM margins, driven primarily by lower ethylene cost. The year-over-year decrease was the result of lower domestic and export caustic volumes, lower VCM export demand and lower PVC and VCM export prices, partially offset by lower natural gas and ethylene costs.","Midstream segment earnings were $77 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to $131 million in the first quarter of 2012 and $187 million in the second quarter of 2011. The decline in earnings was mostly in the marketing and trading businesses, and to a lesser degree, in the gas plants, reflecting lower NGL prices, partially offset by improvements in the pipeline businesses.","The worldwide effective tax rate was 40% for the second quarter of 2012. Our second quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedules.","Cash flow from operations for the first 6 months of 2012 was $6 billion. We used $5.1 billion of the company's total cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $1 billion for acquisitions. Financial activities, which included dividends paid, stock buybacks and $1.75 billion borrowing during the quarter provided a net $800 million of cash flow. These and other net cash flows resulted in a $4.4 billion cash balance at June 30.","Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2012 were $5.1 billion, of which $2.7 billion was spent in the second quarter. Year-to-date capital expenditures by segment were 82% in oil and gas, 15% in midstream and the remainder in chemicals. The Al Hosn Shah gas project made up about 11% of the total capital spending for the first 6 months of 2012.","Our acquisitions for the first 6 months of 2012 were $1 billion, mostly consisting of bolt-on acquisitions in the Williston Basin, South Texas and the Permian. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the first 6 months of 2012 were 810.4 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 811.2 million. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were approximately 810 million. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 16%. And at the end of the second quarter, we issued $1.75 billion of senior notes at a weighted average interest rate of 2.4%, which brought the company's average effective borrowing rate down to 3%.","Copies of the press release announcing our second quarter earnings and the Investor Relations supplemental schedules are available on our website or through the SEC's EDGAR system.","I will now turn the call over to Steve Chazen who will provide guidance for the second half of the year.","Stephen I. Chazen","Thank you, Jim. Occidental's second quarter 2012 production set an all-time record for the company for the second consecutive quarter. The domestic oil and gas segment produced record volumes for the seventh consecutive quarter. Second quarter domestic production of 462,000 barrel equivalents per day consisted of 322,000 barrels of liquids and 840 million cubic feet of gas per day. This was an increase of 7,000 barrel equivalents per day compared to the first quarter of 2012. About 86% of the domestic production growth of the first quarter of 2012, which was in -- was in liquids, which grew from 316,000 barrels a day to 322,000. Compared to the second quarter of 2011, our domestic production grew by 9% or 38,000 barrels a day, of which 25,000 barrels a day was liquids production growth and 79 million cubic feet a day was gas.","Our annualized return on equity for the first 6 months of 2012 was 15%, and our return on capital employed was 13%.","For our capital program, we are raising our estimate of the total year capital program to $9.2 billion from our previously announced level of $8.3 billion. Of the increase, about $600 million is for the Al Hosn Shah gas project, the remainder of the increase going to the rest of the oil and gas segment, primarily to non-operated properties where our forecasting ability is limited. We expect our capital spend rate to slow down modestly from the current levels during the back half of the year and stabilize in the fourth quarter.","The Al Hosn gas project is approximately 49% complete and is progressing as planned. This project made up about 11% of our capital program for 6 months of this year. With spending continuing at current levels, we are increasing our anticipated spending for the remainder of 2012, as I just mentioned. However, total development capital for the project is expected to be in line with previous estimates.","In our domestic operations, we expect our total average rig count at current levels of about 75 to go down to an average of 70 by the end of the year. However, with the mix of rigs, we'll shift among different regions related to changes in gas and NGL prices.","With our production growth wedge firmly in place for the back half of the year, we will focus our efforts on improving our profitability. This includes an increased oil program rather than drilling gas\/NGL wells. We are releasing and we'll continue to release underperforming rigs and crews. We will also work on improving our operating costs. These things are well within our ability to achieve. We expect to do more with less money in the rest of the year.","California, we're continuing to see improvement with respect to permitting issues relative to last year. We received approved field level rules and new permits for both injection wells and drilling locations. The regulatory agency continues to be responsive and committed to working through the backlog of permits.","The new Elk Hills gas plant, which went into operation early July, will positively affect our operational efficiency and production in the back half of the year.","Turning to production expectations in the back half of the year. Over the past year, we have generally achieved our 6,000 to 8,000 barrel a day quarter-over-quarter domestic production increase. We expect that we will achieve the high end of this range increase throughout the rest of the year, which should give us an entry rate into the new year of at least 480,000 barrels a day. The increase will be spread among all of the domestic operations.","Internationally, at current prices, we expect production to increase modestly for the rest of the year, depending on spending levels in Iraq. This includes the effect of a drop in production at Dolphin to about 40,000 barrels a day starting in the third quarter, resulting from the full cost recovery of the pre-startup capital over the first 5 years of production, which commenced in July 2007.","We expect international sales volume in the third quarter of 2012 to be similar to the second quarter. A $5 change in global oil prices would impact our daily volumes by about 3,000 barrels a day. Financial impact of this volume change is incorporated in the product price sensitivities that Jim provided you.","Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $85 million from seismic and drilling for exploration programs in the third quarter. Chemical segment earnings are expected to be about $175 million. Weakness in export demand, conditions in Europe and China, slowdown in U.S. demand and rising U.S. natural gas costs will keep some pressure on margins. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the third quarter of 2012 to increase to about 42%.","To summarize, we closed the quarter with our second consecutive all-time company production and seventh consecutive record domestic oil and gas production. We increased our total domestic production by 7,000 barrels a day over the first quarter and by 38,000 barrels a day for the second quarter of 2011. Domestically, where we are the largest onshore liquids producer in lower 48, our production increased by 9% the second quarter of last year. Our total production increased by 7% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. We are increasing our estimate of the total year capital program to $9.2 billion from our previously announced $8.3 billion. Of the increase, about $600 million is for the Al Hosn Shah gas project, the remainder of the increase going to the rest of the oil and gas segment. Our business generated cash flow from operations of $6 billion in the first 6 months of 2012. We spent about $5.1 billion of our cash flow on our capital program. I think at this point, we're ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Leo Mariani of RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just quick question on your Permian basin production it looked like it was down a tiny bit in the second quarter. Just wanted to see if there's anything unusual in terms of interruptions or maybe just timing of completions there.","Stephen I. Chazen","Bill can answer that. Bill?","William E. Albrecht","Yes, Leo, really, it's all around gas plants. We had several significant gas plant turnarounds in the quarter, as well as some third-party gas plant outages. We think most of these turnarounds are behind us for the rest of the year. But it was all attributable strictly to gas plants, both third-party and company-operated.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And you guys talked about going from 75 to 70 rigs and really de-emphasizing NGLs and gas and adding some crude rigs. Can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of where the rigs are going to be dropped and where you're going to add some on the crude side as you reshuffle?","Stephen I. Chazen","Not really. But we talked about reducing our count in the Williston last quarter and that's continuing. There are some quite rigs nationally that we have that are less than -- at the bottom 1\/8 of efficiency. And so we're basically releasing those rigs. We expect that with the higher concentration and better quality rigs and crews, that we'll do better in the quarter. And I expect that we'll drill as many wells in the back half of the year as we did in the first half of the year for -- with the fewer rigs. What the shift is -- we're not quite through shifting yet.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, got you. In terms of acquisitions, you guys talked about doing $1 billion kind of in the first of the year. Do you guys still continue to be very active on the acquisition side in the second half? And is there any type of -- certain area that you guys are focused on at all from there?","Stephen I. Chazen","It looks pretty slow here in the third quarter. We're going to have very little, if anything, in the hopper in the third quarter. So I don't expect to see much in the third quarter. There's a fair bid ask spread, I think, right now between what we would be willing to pay and what somebody would be willing to accept. So we're not in any hurry. We don't really need to do anything. You shouldn't expect to see any large-scale M&A from us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, you did mention some bolt-on acreage acquisitions in the Williston. Can you just talk about where your position is now? I know you dropped some rigs and I think you've been less enthusiastic. But where are you, acreage-wise, now in the Williston?","Stephen I. Chazen","I think we're north of 300,000 acres.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the bolt-on?","Stephen I. Chazen","I don't know exactly because they never tell me this stuff.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. So give me a bit in California exploration. There's something you highlighted a couple of years ago. I know there's some small stuff and some bigger stuff, but where is that program now?","Stephen I. Chazen","It's actually doing pretty well. We have some moderate successes and some oil and we've got some things that are working. They're a little bit off the mainstream, off the main plan that we had as far as where they're located. There's still some acreage to be acquired that other people have. So I just don't want to go into details. But I think it's doing pretty well, and we're doing -- we have some nice adds and a few million barrels a year, maybe 10 million, 12 million barrel adds.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then just lastly, I know you started increasing the drilling of some of the Permian unconventional stuff. How -- any comments on how that's going?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, obviously, the gassy NGL stuff, while it may be interesting at some point, not real exciting right now. And a lot of these plays are towards New Mexico and people call them liquids rich. I call them gas rich. So they're just not that exciting right now. And -- but the oil stuff is doing pretty well. And really, we are doing just fine. And I can't complete -- there is another area where are there's some poor-performing rigs and crews that we're going to upgrade the quality of that. So my focus, as I said in the back half of the year, I think the production wedge will be fine, maybe even more than fine in the back half of the year. So I think we've got a pretty good sized backlog. But I'm really focused on improving the efficiency of the rigs and generating -- lowering the operating cost.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Terreson of ISI Group.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","You guys are obviously later in the Permian and this BridgeTex pipeline looks likely to debottleneck that area to some extent, that is if it were to materialize. So my question is whether or not you could provide us an update on your expectations and any timeline that you feel is reasonable for that situation?","Stephen I. Chazen","I think I'd rather defer that and let talk Magellan about it since they're a pipeline company but you should understand that we could give enough crude to make any pipeline go out of the basin. Next is maybe even more than one pipeline to go. But not only do we have our work, our net production but we also have the royalty production and third-party barrels. And so the plan in the basin is to expand our gathering system, hook it into these pipelines and maybe make 1 or 2 lines that go maybe into -- whether it goes into Houston or Corpus and then into Houston. And put as much of our stuff through there as we can. And we're not trying to fix the problem in the basin, we're just trying to fix our problem.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I understand. Let me ask you another question. In Abu Dhabi, can you tell us whether or not you guys are still under consideration on the onshore development phase with the SPC? And if not, do you think that you could be brought in at a later date so...","Stephen I. Chazen","No, we are actively involved.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The gas plant in California, I guess we've been kind of waiting for this for a while. My understanding is you've also gone ahead and ordered a second gas plant. Can you help us understand what...","Stephen I. Chazen","I think we're in the study phase of the second gas line. Remember gas isn't such a high commodity right now.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. The new gas plant that you started at Dolphin, can you just walk us through how does that help? Because I seem to recall the capacity was fairly significant. But what should we anticipate in terms of volume response as a result of that?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes. I don't know yet. When we ordered the plant, we thought we would drill more gas wells and obviously, we're a little ways away from that yet. So you'll get, I think, maybe 3 effects. The most significant one is an increase in reliability. And so there is a significant loss every quarter due to some something that's blamed on some third party. So we'll have to take the blame ourselves now, I guess, instead of blaming it on somebody else. Second, there's a much deeper cut and so there'll be more NGLs, for whatever they're worth, coming out of the plant. And finally, there's clearly more capacity, and I'd like to defer the discussion about the capacity response from the rest of the field until we get at least a quarter of actual results rather than just a few weeks.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And my follow-up, if I may, is also on California. So I guess a bunch of quarters ago, you kind of laid out the run-ins that you had there, but the permitting seems to have gotten an awful lot better. I guess what I'm curious on is what is it going to take for you to get after what you acknowledged are some of the highest IRR opportunities in the portfolio? Because it seems that with your guidance on rigs, you're not planning to do that anytime soon.","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes. I'm waiting for them to further reduce their cost per well. I mean, it's simply they can make step changes, sizable step changes in their cost per well. And my experience over the last, however long is, giving them more money does not cause that. And so a little diet for a little while will have significant reductions in our cost per well. I'm talking not 10%, not 20%, but 1\/3. And once they get to the point where their well costs are in line with what they ought to achieve, then we'll pick up the pace. But if I can reduce the cost, I'll get more wells for the same money and that's really what I'm after. I'm not after volume per se. I'm actually after money. And right now, they can do a lot better and they will. But the only way to do it is to ensure that they feel pressed.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Forgive me, Steve, you dominate the play. How do you benchmark? What's achievable and you're, I guess, competing with yourself?","Stephen I. Chazen","Competing with myself. And I know -- we can tell what's achievable. We've experimented and we know. So it isn't -- it's not a theoretical discussion. We changed some things and we had step changes and this is just the beginning. So they can do better.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gammel of Macquarie.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Steve, I wanted to ask you, first of all, about your transportation capacity out of the Permian Basin. And really, my question is really more around what we've seen as a building differential between Cushing and Midland. And with the pipeline that you acquired a few years back, that you should have the ability to avoid any block in differentials there on at least some volumes. I wanted to see how much you are actually covered on transportation there. And then my second question is really more housekeeping on the acquisitions. Should we look at the $1 billion of acquisitions year-to-date as incremental to the new CapEx guidance that you've given? And is there any associated production figure with those acquisitions for the second quarter and then for the rest of the year?","Stephen I. Chazen","Starting with the Midland, there was a small problem that somebody had in Midland early sometime this quarter -- last quarter. And that's really gone away. So I think some of the differences is pretty much gone. So you don't really see that anymore. There was -- somebody had a problem there, I can't remember who. The capital, I've included in the capital additionals for the back half of the year, the additional spending on the acquisitions that came in the first half. And then, there was no production effect from the acquisitions in the second quarter because most of them were done late in the quarter. And there might be 1,000 or 2,000 barrels a day of liquids in the third quarter.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Okay. And just a follow-up on the differential again, Stephen. It may be or not relatively a temporary issue in the 2Q, but does it indicate that you're starting to experience pretty tight infrastructure in the Permian in general? So it could be another issue that crops up periodically over time.","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes. I think -- let me just take a long view of the basin -- the pipeline system was built for a very large amount of oil years ago and was allowed to degrade because everybody thought it was going to deplete away. And the ownership for the pipeline has changed from integrated producers to, generally speaking, cash flow-driven organizations who get paid on increased distributions rather than maintenance. And so what's happened is that the system is not in particularly great shape, which is why we bought the pipeline systems, and we're going to invest some money to improve our results in that. But the system is tight right now and it does not take much to create a modest disruption and we're in better shape than most people because we control our own destiny largely. But I think this is something not just in the Permian, but everywhere where everybody assumed the United States was going out of business in the oil industry. Even if you don't buy some of the more ridiculous things that people have put out, as far as growth, modest amount of growth will tax the system nationwide because the infrastructure is basically designed currently for -- as a cash cow rather than something that you need to keep up. Does that answer your question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Portillo of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions for me. Just on the acquisition side for the second quarter, could give us an idea, of the $2.7 billion, what approximately is spent on acquisitions? And then just a quick second question here. In relation to Colombia, obviously, you guys had a nice uptick back to kind of normalized volumes. There seems to have been a continued frequency of pipeline...","Stephen I. Chazen","I think our capital -- just the acquisition money in the second quarter is like $700 million. It was $1 billion for the back half -- for the first half of the year. Capital was $2.7 billion, but the acquisition was, I think, $700 million or so. Yes, so it was $1 billion for the first 6 months in acquisitions. I got lost in the rest of the question, so if you could repeat it.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Sure. And just in terms of Colombia, you obviously had a nice uptick in production in the second quarter, I think, as Ca\u00f1o Lim\u00f3n pipelines kind of normalized. Are you guys are seeing kind of similar levels of production heading into the third quarter? And are there any improvements that you're seeing on the security side down in Colombia?","Stephen I. Chazen","We'll let Bill answer that.","William E. Albrecht","Yes, Matt. So far in the third quarter, we've had about 1,000 barrels a day outage is all. We obviously have had more insurgent activity in the third quarter so far. Who knows what it's going to be like for the rest of the quarter? But so far, there has not been a material effect on production.","Stephen I. Chazen","It's capable of producing 32,000, 33,000. So there was some loss even in the second quarter. So all he's really saying is it's sort of like the second quarter.","William E. Albrecht","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eliot Javanmardi of Capital One Southcoast.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question for you. Do you still see the Williston Basin as a potential longer-term resource play for the company? And the reason I asked that is, you obviously get great returns in California in the Permian plays. I'm just trying to understand what kind of scenario would you actually be willing to put to your dollars at work into Williston? And I think you've addressed some of it potentially on the well cost front. But what scenario would you envision that even if it is the #3 play you would invest in, for example, in the U.S., how would you assess that situation as to when you feel good about putting dollars to work there?","Stephen I. Chazen","Definitely #3. It's really a cost issue. I think that the service companies are getting rich as pigs there. And I think until the costs come down and the efficiency improves, we'll continue to focus on the best wells and the most efficient wells and improving our learning curve. We're still, I think, in the learning curve phase. But there's that and then there's the differential issue, which I think could be fixed over time. But I'm in no hurry to put capital there. We're still continuing to put capital there, but not to the level that we were. We're still making 16,000, 17,000 a day there. But it's clearly assets for the future rather than a big driver for today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just a question. You mentioned last quarter when you were looking at the increase in California rig counts, sort of 5 rigs every 6 months, that's some were going into steam flood, as well as the shale and vertical elements [ph]. Can you give us an update in terms of how many rigs you're in steam flood versus other opportunities?","Stephen I. Chazen","I actually don't know, 3. I think we have 3 rigs in the steam floods right now, and we'll boost that as the year progresses.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So that's still incremental rigs going in against your guidance then into the shale?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, shale and into the steam floods.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. And just on -- this is more of a longer-term question, but obviously, in the central part of San Joaquin Valley, financial geologist that I am, you have a potentially thickest -- thicker part of the shale but its deep and the rock quality may not be as good. But is there any technology that you think could work that, turn that into sort of a repeatable shale play?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, maybe someday. But right -- we try to do easy stuff before hard stuff. And so we're focused on what's easy right now. And what's easiest right now is to drill low-cost shale wells in easy places. We've monkeyed with what you've just said and I think we're still on the early phases of thinking about that.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is it fair to say that you're putting some R&D dollars into that type of monkey guess?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, we do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sven Del Pozzo of IHS Herold.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Your perspective savings on completion costs in California for the -- for your unconventional wells, what kind of time frame do you think we'll have -- we'll start to see some CapEx?","Stephen I. Chazen","It's actually happening now. It's happening now. So you'll see it as -- it will be clear as the year progresses.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And same type of question regarding CapEx for the midstream. When do you think we'll start to see the CapEx deployment in the midstream slowdown?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, a lot of that is the Al Hosn gas plant. And so the domestic capital is not probably going to slow down for a little while until I get the pipeline system up and running better. But the Al Hosn stuff, that part of it should start to roll off into the fourth and first quarters. But the drilling portion, the part that is charged, that goes to E&P, will pick up that slack and more into the fourth and first quarter next year. So all you're seeing is -- so I wouldn't be too confused about where this midstream capital is going. A fair amount of it, except for a little bit right now, is going into the Al Hosn project.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And your production growth sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter in the Midcontinent region, which also includes the Bakken, if it's not the Bakken where the production growth is coming from on the oil side, what regions or...","Stephen I. Chazen","It is from there. I mean, some of -- the bulk of it is from there. We started, if I remember, 3,000 or 4,000 a day last year, early last year. And we're 17,000 running now. So I mean, somewhere in there, it's there. There's improvement in South Texas and the rest of the Rockies. But I mean, fundamentally, that segment is -- the large increases are Bakken production.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. Spike in Bahrain gas production, could you just help me to understand what's going on there?","Stephen I. Chazen","Sandy can probably answer that.","Edward Arthur Lowe","Yes. The gas production is paid for -- on a capacity basis, and we've recently installed a lot of equipment that increases the capacity to what the kingdom thinks they'll need over the next few years.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","And is there any way to quantify the profitability change associated with this increase in gas production?","Stephen I. Chazen","Pretty modest. I mean, the profits there will be made off the oil production. And the gas serves as a -- sort of a base to give us a base return, I think, is the way to think about the project. So the gas, since it's our captive gas market, is basically what pays for the thing. And then the upside of the higher returns will come from crude oil prices, oil production.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay, okay. And lastly, view on chemicals, just your announced -- sometime after 2015, announcement of 1.1 billion pound ethylene cracker. I don't know if it's an expansion or a brand-new plant.","Stephen I. Chazen","No, there's no. I think the announcement is that we are studying it. We are not committed to the cracker. We are going to build a fractionator, but not -- we are not committed to a cracker.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And for working capital component of your cash flow in the first 6 months of the year, that would be -- if you'd like to e-mail it to me later, that's fine. If you have it right now, great.","Stephen I. Chazen","Chris can deal with that. I don't think you'll find it a big deal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Katherine Minyard of JPMorgan.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just looking at 2Q 2012 production for the U.S. How much of that  production came from wells that were brought online since the beginning of the year?","Stephen I. Chazen","It's probably a more complicated question you probably thought. I don't think we -- you have to go basin by basin. I don't -- we don't know. We'll try to have -- why don't you contact Chris and maybe we can reconstruct that over the next -- yes, we don't have it with us.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then when you talk about cost reduction of about 1\/3 in your drilling, are you looking at you...","Stephen I. Chazen","California, we've talked about.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And so are you looking at achieving that? Is it lower drill times? Is it different completion techniques? And what would be the main factors driving the bulk of that type of reduction?","Stephen I. Chazen","Bill can answer that because he's responsible.","William E. Albrecht","Katherine, it's really both, okay? On the drilling side, it's a lot of little things that add up to cost reductions. And then on the completion side, its primarily reductions and pressure pumping costs.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Alec Morris [ph] of Raymond James.","Unknown Analyst","Following up on the Colombia insurgency question from earlier. Could you give an update maybe on Libya and whether production is back at pre-war levels there? And I guess, if not, what needs to happen to get there?","Stephen I. Chazen","Sandy can answer that.","Edward Arthur Lowe","Yes. We're just at about pre-war levels right now. We've just putting new teams into the country to work on new projects. And we will be doing seismic work later this year. So we're pretty much back to normal in Libya.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Herrlin of Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Are you seeing any discounts to price booked by the services companies in the Permian? Some of your peers have been mentioning that. Are you seeing that at all?","Stephen I. Chazen","Bill can answer that.","William E. Albrecht","Yes. John, yes, we're seeing some modest price reduction off of the price book.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","What's that? 10% or less?","William E. Albrecht","Its 7% to 10%.","Stephen I. Chazen","We tend to contract longer term than somebody else who might go to monthly contracts. Yes, and so we don't -- we're not quite as sensitive to the -- somebody might be drilling 6 wells or something.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay, that's fine, Steve. With the Elk Hills plant, is there just a commissioning start-up phase before you get it fully on?","Stephen I. Chazen","It's gone through that. And so we're -- like all plants that are designed by engineers, they always -- they never seem to work just exactly right the first day. So -- but we've actually gone through that because we started the process more than a month ago. So right now, I think we're okay.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. And then I probably missed this because I got on late, what was your cash position at quarter's end?","Stephen I. Chazen","A little over $4 billion.","Operator","I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Stavros for any closing remarks.","Christopher G. Stavros","Thanks very much for joining us today.

Welcome to Occidental Petroleum's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call this morning from Los Angeles are Steve Chazen, OXY's President and Chief Executive Officer; Lienert, OXY's Chief Financial Officer; Albrecht, President of our Domestic Oil and Gas operations; Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas business. And also listening in on the call is our Executive Chairman, Dr. Ray Irani.","In just a moment, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Jim Lienert, who will review our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011. Steve Chazen will then follow with comments outlining our 2012 capital program and our outlook for our oil and gas production for the first half of this year. We'll conclude with a brief Q&A session after Steve's comments.","Our fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings press release; Investor Relations supplemental schedules; and the conference call presentation slides, which refer to both Jim and Steve's remarks, can be downloaded off of our website, www.oxy.com.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim. Jim, please go ahead.","James M. Lienert","Thank you, Chris. Net income was $1.6 billion or $2.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $1.2 billion or $1.49 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our consolidated pretax income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 was about $2.6 billion, $2.02 per diluted share after tax, compared to approximately $2.9 billion, $2.18 per diluted share after tax, in the third quarter of 2011. ","Major items resulting in the difference between the third and fourth quarter income included higher oil volumes and prices, which added $0.07 per diluted share after tax to our fourth quarter income; lower fourth quarter chemical and midstream income of $0.08 per diluted share; higher equity-based compensation cost of $0.05 per diluted share; higher exploration expense of $0.02 per diluted share; and higher fourth quarter operating costs of $0.08 per diluted share.","Here's the segment breakdown for the fourth quarter. In the oil and gas segment, the fourth quarter 2011 production of 748,000 BOE per day was 9,000 BOE per day higher than the third quarter 2011 volumes of 739,000 BOE per day. Domestically, our production was 449,000 BOE per day, representing the highest ever domestic production volumes for the company, compared to our guidance of 442,000 to 444,000 BOE per day. ","Our production costs rose by 13,000 BOE per day compared to the third quarter, with the Permian and California contributing the bulk of sequential increase in our overall domestic production volumes. Our better-than-expected fourth quarter domestic production reflected the effect of the ramp-up in capital spending, as well as higher levels of workover and well maintenance activity. In addition, the fourth quarter was relatively free of significant operational disruptions, which also contributed to the better-than-expected results.","Latin America volumes were 31,000 BOE per day. Colombia volumes increased slightly from the third quarter, while both periods included pipeline interruptions caused by insurgent activity. In the Middle East region, we recorded \"1,000 BOE per day\" production in Libya. In Iraq, we produced 9,000 BOE per day, an increase of 5,000 BOE per day from the third quarter volumes. The higher volume is a result of higher spending levels. Yemen daily production was 23,000 BOE, a decrease of 5,000 BOE from the third quarter. The decrease reflected the timing of cost recovery and the expiration of Masila field contract in mid-December. ","In Oman, the fourth quarter production was 76,000 BOE per day, a decrease of 3,000 BOE per day from the third quarter volumes. The decrease was attributable to downtime from operational issues. In Qatar, the fourth quarter production was 76,000 BOE per day, an increase of 3,000 BOE per day over the third quarter volumes. ","In Dolphin and Bahrain combined, production decreased 6,000 BOE per day from the third quarter volumes. Dolphin volumes declined 9,000 BOE per day because, during the quarter, they reached annual maximum volumes allowed under its contract.","Our fourth quarter sales volumes were 749,000 BOE per day compared to our guidance of 740,000 BOE per day. The improvement resulted from the higher domestic production. Fourth quarter 2011 realized prices were mixed for our products compared to the third quarter of the year. Our worldwide crude oil price -- crude oil realized price was $99.62 per barrel, an increase of 2.5%. Worldwide NGLs were $55.25 per barrel, a decrease of about 1.5%, and domestic natural gas prices were $3.59 per MCF, a decline of 15%.","Realized oil prices for the quarter represented 106% of the average WTI and 91% of the average Brent price. Realized NGL prices were 59% of WTI and realized domestic gas prices were 98% of NYMEX.","Price changes on current global prices affect our quarterly earnings before income tax by $38 million for a $1-per-barrel change in oil prices and $8 million for a $1-per-barrel change in NGL prices. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices reflects -- affects quarterly pretax earnings by about $31 million.","Fourth quarter operating costs were about $130 million higher than the third quarter, as a result of higher workover and well maintenance activity, driven by our program to increase production at these higher levels of oil prices. Oil and gas cash production costs were $12.84 a barrel for the 12 months of 2011 compared with last year's 12-month costs of $10.19 a barrel. The cost increase reflects the higher workover and maintenance activity I mentioned earlier.","Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $2.21 per barrel for the 12 months of 2011 compared to $1.83 per barrel for all of 2010. Fourth quarter exploration expense, which included the impairment of several smaller leases, was $73 million.","Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $144 million compared to $245 million in the third quarter of 2011. The drop in income was a result of seasonal factors. Midstream segment earnings of $70 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 were comparable to the $77 million in the third quarter of 2011. The significantly higher year end OXY stock price, compared to the distressed levels at the end of the third quarter, affected the quarterly valuation of equity-based compensation plans, reducing fourth quarter pretax income of the company compared to the third quarter by $80 million. The worldwide effective tax rate was 37% for the fourth quarter of 2011. Our fourth quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedule. ","Let me now turn to Occidental's performance during the 12 months.","Core income was $6.8 billion or $8.39 per diluted share, compared with $4.7 billion or $5.72 per diluted share in 2010. Net income was $6.8 billion or $8.32 per diluted share for the 12 months of 2011, compared with $4.5 billion or $5.56 per diluted share in 2010. Cash flow from operations for the 12 months of 2011 was $12.3 billion. We used $7.5 billion of the company's total cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $2.2 billion on net acquisitions and divestitures. We used $1.4 billion to pay dividends and had a net cash inflow from that activity of $0.6 billion. These and other net cash flows resulted in a $3.8 billion cash balance at December 31.","Looking at overall cash flow simply, our total debt, net of cash, was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2011, compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2010, representing net cash generated by the company of $0.4 billion. During this period, we returned $1.7 billion to our stockholders in the form of $1.4 billion of dividends and $275 million of stock buybacks. Over 2 years, our net debt at December 31, 2011, was $0.5 billion higher compared to the $1.6 billion at December 31, 2009. During this period, we returned $2.9 billion to our stockholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks, while executing an $11.5-billion capital program and spending about $6.9 billion on acquisitions.","Capital expenditures for 2011 were approximately $7.5 billion, of which about $2.6 billion was incurred in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter higher capital partially reflected the gradual ramp-up of our capital program during 2011. The increases were mostly at Williston domestically and Iraq, Oman and Qatar internationally. The fourth quarter capital also included spending for several midstream projects such as the Elk Hills gas processing plant, which will drop significantly during the first half of 2012 as these projects are completed.","Total year capital expenditures by segment were 82% in oil and gas; 14% in midstream and the remainder in chemicals. Our net acquisition expenditures in the 12 months were $2.2 billion, which are net of proceeds from the sale of our Argentina operations. The acquisitions included a South Texas purchase; properties in California, the Permian and Williston; and a payment in connection with the signing of the Al Hosn gas project in Abu Dhabi, which is the gas development of the Shah Field. This payment was for Occidental's share of development expenditures incurred by the project prior to the date the final agreement was signed.","The weighted-average basic shares outstanding for the 12 months of 2011 were 812.1 million and the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding were 812.9 million. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 13%, a decline of 1% from the end of last year. Our return on equity for 2011 was 19.3% and the return on capital employed was 17.2%.","Oil and gas DD&A expense was $11.48 per BOE for 2011. We expect the oil and gas segment DD&A rate to be about $14 per barrel in 2012. The total chemical and midstream DD&A expense is expected to be about $650 million for 2012. We expect the operating cost per barrel to be about $13.75 in 2012. The 2012 expected costs reflect higher levels of workovers and well maintenance activity. However, significant and substantial product price changes and changes in activity levels and inflation resulting from product prices may affect this cost estimate during the course of the year. ","Copies of the press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings and the Investor Relations supplemental schedules are available on our website or through the SEC's EDGAR system. ","I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to discuss our 2012 capital program, year-end oil and gas reserves, and provide guidance for the first half of the year.","Stephen I. Chazen","Thank you, Jim. We finished a strong year in terms of the 3 main performance criteria that I outlined last quarter. Our domestic oil and gas production grew by about 12% for the total year to 428,000 BOE per day. Fourth quarter domestic production of 449,000 BOE a day is the highest U.S. total production in OXY's history, reflecting the highest ever quarterly liquids volume of 310,000 barrels per day, the second highest quarterly volume for gas.","Total company production increased about 4% for the year. Our chemical business delivered exceptional results for the year, achieving one of their highest earnings levels ever. Our return on equity was 19% for the year and our return on capital was 17%. We increased our annual dividends by $0.32 or 21% to $1.84 per share. We expect to announce a further dividend increase after the meeting of our Board of Directors, the 2nd week of February. ","I will now turn to the 2012 capital program. As I mentioned last call, we have ample legitimate opportunities in our domestic oil and gas business where we could deploy capital. We have tried to manage the program to a level that is realistic at current prices and as a result, have deferred some projects that would otherwise have met our hurdle rates. We continue to have a substantial inventory of high-return projects to fulfill our growth objectives.","We're increasing our capital program by about 10% in 2012 to $8.3 billion from the $7.5 billion we spent in 2011. About $500 million of this increase will be in the United States, mainly in the Permian basin, and the rest will be spent in the international projects, including the Al Hosn sour gas project in Iraq. The program breakdown is 84% oil and gas, about 11% in midstream and 5% in chemicals. We will review our capital program around midyear and adjust as conditions dictate.","The following is a geographic overview of the program. In domestic oil and gas and related midstream projects, development capital will be about 55% of our total program. In California, we expect to spend about 21% of our total capital. We expect the rig count to remain constant in the first half of 2012 to 31, same as what we were running at the end of the year. ","We are seeing improvement with respect to permitting issues in the state. We have received approved field rules and new permits for both injection wells and drilling locations. The regulatory agency is responsive and committed to working through the backlog of permits. We expect to maintain our capital program at current levels for about the first half of the year, which will enable us to grow production volumes. We will reassess our capital program when the number of permits in hand allows it.","The Permian operations, we expect to spend about 20% of our total capital program. The rig count at year-end 2011 was 23. We expect the rig count to ramp up during the year to around 27 rigs by year end. Our CO2 flood capital should remain comfortable to 2011 levels. In our non-CO2 operations, we are seeing additional opportunities for good-return projects. As a result, we have stepped up their development program, and our 2012 capital will be about 75% higher than 2011 levels.","In the Midcontinent and other operations, we plan to spend about 14% of our total capital. In the Williston, we have increased our acreage in 2011 from 204,000 acres to 277,000 acres. We expect that our rig count will be about 6 at the end of 2012. Additional capital that could reasonably be deployed here has been shifted to higher-return opportunities in California and the Permian. This may also encourage Bakken well costs to decline. Natural gas prices in the United States are -- it's written here, \"horrible.\" I think that's probably an understatement. As a result, we are cutting back our pure gas drilling in the Midcontinent, South Texas and the Permian. ","With regard to international capital spending, our total international development capital will be about 30% of the total company capital program. The Al Hosn Shah gas project will continue to increase spending in 2012 as originally planned, making up about 7% of our total capital program for the year. The rest of international operations capital will be comparable to 2011, with modest increase expected in Iraq and Libya. ","In Iraq, the planned spending level should generate about 11,000 barrels a day of production. Each additional $100 million in spending, incurred evenly through the year, would generate about 2,700 barrels a day of production at current price levels. Exploration capital should increase about 10% over 2011 spending levels and represents 6% of the total capital program. The focus of the program domestically will continue to be in California and the Permian and Williston basins, with additional activity in Oman and Bahrain.","With regard to our oil and gas reserves, we haven't completed determination of our year-end reserve levels. Based on preliminary estimates, our reserve replacement levels from all categories are somewhat over 100%. In the Middle East\/North Africa, the highly profitable Dolphin project does not replace its production because of the nature of its contract. The makes overall reserve replacement for the Middle East\/North Africa region very difficult. Despite this fact, the 2011 program, which includes only the reserve carry or its extensions to discoveries and improved recovery, covered about 70% of the region's productions. ","Oil price increases, which under the production sharing contracts, reduce our share of the reserves; and non-fundamental factors in Libya and Iraq, essentially negated the reserve adds to the program. As the program progresses, we expect that Libya and Iraq reserves will be restored.","In the United States, the results of 2011 program and acquisitions replaced around 250% of production with both elements contributing about equal amounts. After price and other adjustments to prior year estimates, U.S. reserve replacement was well over 150%.","As we look ahead to 2012, we expect the oil and gas production to be as follows: During the first half of 2012, we expect our domestic production to grow 3,000 to 4,000 BOE a day per month in the current quarterly average of 449,000 BOE a day, which would correspond to a 6,000 to 8,000 BOE a day increase per quarter. As Jim noted, fourth quarter of 2011 was relatively free of significant operational disruptions, resulting in better-than-expected domestic production. A more typical experience with respect to such issues could moderate the growth somewhat in the first quarter of 2012. If the production growth rate continued at a comparable pace in the second half of the year, our year-over-year average domestic production growth would be similar, between 8% to 10% this year.","Internationally, Colombia production should be about flat for the year compared to 2011. In the first quarter of 2012, volumes should be about 3,000 barrels a day higher than the fourth quarter of 2011, although insurgent activity has picked up recently.","The Middle East region is expected to be as follows for the first half of the year. Production has resumed in our operations at Libya. And at this point, we expect about 5,000-barrel equivalent a day of production with further growth to come later in the year. At this point, we reasonably expect the total year production to be about half the level that existed prior to cessation of operations.","In Iraq, as I discussed previously, production levels depend on capital spending. We are still unable to reliably predict the timing of spending levels, but we expect production to be similar to the past quarter.","In Yemen, as we previously disclosed, our Masila block contract expired in December. Our share of the production at Masila was about 11,000 a day for the full year. Our remaining operations in Yemen typically have higher volumes early in the year due to timing of cost recovery each year, which will partially offset the loss of Masila barrels in the first half of 2012. As a result, we expect our total Yemen production to drop slightly from the fourth quarter 2011 levels in the first half of the year.","The remainder of the Middle East, we expect production to be comparable to fourth quarter volumes.","At current prices, we expect total first quarter sales volumes to be comparable to fourth quarter 2011 volumes, depending on the scheduling of liftings. A $5 change in global oil prices would impact our production sharing contract daily volumes by about 3,000 barrels per day. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $100 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs in the first quarter. ","The chemical segment first quarter earnings are expected to be about $165 million with seasonal demand improvement expected in the second and third quarters. We expect that lower natural gas prices and the continuing improvement in the global economy will have a positive impact on our chemical business margin, which is to be expected -- which is expected to be offset partially by higher ethylene prices.","We expect our combined worldwide tax rate the first quarter of 2012 to increase to about 40%. The increase from 2011 reflects a higher proportional mix of international income with higher tax rates, particularly from Libya.","To summarize, we closed 2011 on a solid note with high domestic oil and gas production in the fourth quarter, which is ahead of our guidance. We continued to generate strong financial returns, well above our cost of capital. We enter this year raising our capital program by 10% compared with last year in order to prudently pursue our substantial inventory of high-return growth projects. The business continues to grow and generate free cash flow after capital, which should allow us to consistently grow our dividend at an attractive rate, further boosting the total return to our shareholders.","I think we're now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Steve, I'm going to go very general on the questions, actually. First of all, I wondered if you could observe how you expect the U.S. natural gas market to rationalize itself, whether we've got an issue with associated gas production. Obviously, a very low price relative to the full cycle cost of production and so on. I just would be quite interested to hear what your latest views are on that.","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, most -- the bulk of our gas is associated gas, so it comes off with oil. There's not much I can do about cutting that back. I don't think the gas -- I mean I think currently, we're -- the current price is clearly not sustainable. I don't think anybody's pure gas drilling works at whatever it is, $2.50, $2.60. I think we need to wait for the U.S. economy to improve. I just -- all these other fixes people talk about are much longer term. But if the U.S. economy improves, we'll use more natural gas and hopefully bring the prices up. But I think $2.50 for a rational person in drilling pure gas wells, no matter what they say -- maybe they hedged it or something for next year. It's just not a sensible price and is significantly below any rational replacement cost. We can't do much about ours to reduce it because we just don't drill that many pure gas wells. We're not going to shut any in because, again, most of the gas is associated. It has -- you have to have -- in order to make this work, you have to have a reduction in gas drilling and improvement in the U.S. economy. And frankly, the costs to drilling the wells have to come down. We're obviously not, --despite what some people think, we're obviously not going to be in a $10-per-MCF gas price environment anytime soon. And so we need to bring the cost of drilling of gas wells down to rational levels. Some of that will come from efficiencies and some of it will come out of service companies.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the second very general one is on M&A. Firstly, specifically to OXY, whether you're seeing the potential for more deals or whether you're happy with your organic growth rate as it stands today. And also, industry-wide would be interesting as well, the M&A trend for 2012.","Stephen I. Chazen","Most of the stuff that's for sale is pretty gassy right now. And the prices that people are talking about don't reflect rational, current or even the strip in gas prices. We try to buy things for inventory, that is to say drilling 3, 4, 5 years from now. Not trying to buy current production. So I think the organic in the United States is fine. And I think we'll be fine overall. So I'm not really in any hurry to spend a lot of money on some acquisitions, especially a very capital-intensive one. A lot of the things that are being done are extraordinarily capital-intensive. On a good day, the cash flow equals capital. And so, that's just not what we want to build. So I'm really reluctant to enter one of these capital traps.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understood. And then very finally, on California, post-regulatory change, have you had a notable change?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, I think I say that in the remarks that clearly, we've gotten some permits, some injector permits. It's the first time in a long time we got that. And clearly, a change in attitude. And so I -- the question is really where you get the permits, not necessarily exactly how many. But I think as we approach midyear, we'll have a sizable opportunity based on current trends. So I think we're -- we feel pretty good about this at this point, especially -- it may be that you were being hit in the head with 2 hammers, now only 1 and you feel better. But right now, we feel pretty good about this.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, and the guidance last time we spoke was 5 rigs added every 6 months, constrained by...","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, I think once we get rolling and the permits come at a more normal rate, the rig count will pick up. But right now, we'll wait until the permits are in hand.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I got a couple as well, if I may. I wanted to just pick up on Paul's final point there. It looks to us that you got about a couple hundred permits in the last few months of the year. As you say, a pretty significant step up. Can you give us an idea of how that's being split between unconventional -- or sorry, I guess the rate of unconventional drilling and the new conventional exploration program? And I've got a couple of follow-ups, please.","Stephen I. Chazen","Most of the permits are within fields. So they were within existing fields, because those are some ways the easiest permits to give. So I think that's the best way to say it, so within current field boundaries, because those are the easiest thing to clear. And so there's no way to tell you what the split is, but it's really within the existing fields.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, well, maybe my second question is really on the conventional exploration program. Because I think when we last spoke, Steve, you suggested that's where your preference for incremental capital would be. Are you actually done delineating the original Gunslinger [ph] exploration discovery? Or are you basically done with that and moved on to new exploration targets? In which case, can you give us an update on progress?","Stephen I. Chazen","We're in a development phase on the -- there will be more wells drilled this year in that. And while it may not be perfectly delineated, it'd be delineated through a development phase, not an exploration phase. We basically moved on to look for other opportunities, so that's really -- that program has moved out of exploration.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Go it, okay. And then my final one is, in 2010, you suggested that you could double your midstream earnings to about $1 billion. And I think a large part of that was predicated upon the increased steam flood at Mukhaizna. Can you just give us an update as to where both of those things stand? And then I'll leave it at that.","Stephen I. Chazen","Most of the -- and Mukhaizna doesn't generate any midstream earnings. Most of it was different gas processing projects around California and the Permian and the Al Hosn gas processing. So that's where a lot of it is. There's other pieces around our pipeline business. The pipeline business actually did -- is doing pretty good. So that's growing nicely and we're putting more effort in the pipeline business, because we think there's more money to be made there, so -- and the additional tariffs in Dolphin also is another area of significant growth, as they're moving more gas and we're getting -- we may not get credit for barrels but we're getting a fair amount of fee income. It's not -- Mukhaizna uses gas but don't make money on gas.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, I guess what I was referring to, Steve, was the incremental steam flood on the mid -- I was under the impression that you had some control of the pipelines over there and that would generate some revenue for the gas.","Stephen I. Chazen","As they use more gas, the gas will have to come from Dolphin, and there'll be more fee income from that. I guess that's the way to think about it.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Well, maybe just to clarify and then I'll jump off. The Mukhaizna steam flood expansion, has that been permitted and approved? Or what is the status of that?","Stephen I. Chazen","Maybe Sandy can answer that.","Edward Arthur Lowe","The permitting is up to about 680,000 barrels of steam per day and we're running about 430,000, so we're just about to bring on quite a bit more this year. In fact, most of it comes on this year. We're now looking at the practicalities and possibilities of a third phase of steam flooding as we further understand this reservoir.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jessica Chipman from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","First question just quickly, could you please give us an update, Steve, on current well cost really in the Bakken, the Wolfberry and the Bone Springs?","Stephen I. Chazen","Bakken well cost hasn't really changed from the third quarter. It's still too high for what you get relative to our other projects. Somebody else may have a different hurdle rate than we do. So we've cut back. I don't think we've had any real inflation and -- Bill?","William E. Albrecht","Just on the Wolfberry, we're looking -- depending on where you are in the basin, $2 million to $2.5 million completed well costs there. And in the Bone Springs, those long-reach horizontals are somewhere in the $6-million to $7-million per well range.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then in the Bakken, I think the last update was $8 million to $8.5 million, so that's...","William E. Albrecht","It's still a good number, Jessica, yes.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. Then just my second question. Your comments around the acquisition potential and to be a capital trap even sort of as a segue into this question. So OXY has ramped activity pretty significantly recently and CapEx is increasing as a percent of total cash flow. 2011 looks more like 2\/3 of cash flow whereas historically, Oxy was more in the 45% to 50% range. The question is just, in general, how you think about capital efficiency as OXY allocates spend from long-dated international projects to more capital-intensive drilling in the U.S.","Stephen I. Chazen","The long-dated projects are just that. The returns will be good, just a few years before the production starts. In the United States, you can't really ignore the fact that the price of oil is not $40 anymore, which is the way we used to budget it, but some other higher number. The objective of the exercise is that we spend about 25% of our money on finding and development; about 25% on lifting cost, production taxes, that sort of thing; giving us 50% gross pretax margins. So as oil prices go up -- and we got a lot of oil in place around both in California and the Permian. As oil prices go up, we're going to spend more on -- to basically raise the bar. It won't raise the capital, and I don't think it will hurt the capital efficiency over time. But you got -- you just have to -- you can't just assume the price of oil is going to be $40, nor can you say, \"Well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to -- not going to spend the money and store the oil in the ground.\" So just a balance between returns and growth, and we've tried to have a system where we're sort of in between. We're not trying to spend all of our capital for sure, and we're not trying to also deplete the business. You can cut the capital and get whatever you want, but your returns would go up but the business would deplete. We could spend a lot more money and have a lot more growth. And we wouldn't have the high dividend, the growth rate that companies enjoy and will continue to enjoy. I don't know how else to answer it.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Then just 2 very, very quick ones. Going forward, will you then target a certain plowback ratio in terms of capital as a percent of cash flow? And...","Stephen I. Chazen","No. It's totally driven by the opportunity set. And so it's not driven by some formula. It's driven by an opportunity set to -- and it depends on oil prices. Even our workover program is really an oil-price-driven program. If you get your money back real quick, we'll spend more money on workovers. Oil prices decline, you won't get your money back so quick, we'll spend less. It's really that simple. It's not very -- these are short-term programs to some extent. The stuff that's drilling in the Permian, a lot of oil there and I think capturing oil at $100 a barrel, probably a pretty good business.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And just last, will you provide an update sometime this year on the long-term growth rate of 5% to 8%? Is that still what you're targeting for 2012?","Stephen I. Chazen","That's still a long-term target. We've had a variety of reasons, mostly outside of our control. We had a tougher year in the Middle East than we'd anticipated. But I mean, when that gets back on track, pretty straightforward to make the growth rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess in the past, shale has not been as much of a priority given, I guess, the returns that you have in California in the Permian, and your CO2 floods. But I guess you're increasing rig counts. You've given the cost, just announced to that previous question, for the Wolfberry and the Bone Springs. But I mean, is it encouraging progress on recoveries, EURs and IPs that's encouraging you to spend more? Or is it the oil price?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, it's both. If oil were $30, the higher recoveries wouldn't be any good, so it's oil price. I mean we're driven by this 25% F&D sort of margin thought, or 50% including all our costs. And we don't use the $100 oil but we're sure not using $40 to do this. And it's a relatively straightforward -- there where we have a large inventory, we can either spend a lot more or a lot less. It's really in our control. We're going to ramp the program up or down based on how we -- based on the returns that we see looking at these margins. These margins will generate, by the way, very substantial returns on invested capital. The accounting type, not the IRR things people talk about, which I could have pressed you with those but I don't think they're really meaningful.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And on the mix in terms of the increase, more Wolfberry wells or more Bone Spring wells, just in terms of sort of like...","Stephen I. Chazen","They're more Wolfberry, aren't they, Bill?","William E. Albrecht","Yes, the preponderance of our program -- development program, is Wolfberry in the Permian for 2012, Ed.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Good. And just on California, obviously you increase 5 rigs, say, every 6 months from the middle of this year. Any thoughts on where you see the sort of the maximum rig counts for California, driven by obviously internal constraints, say, organizational and maybe external constraints?","Stephen I. Chazen","No, I don't have any idea. We'll find out -- as the program boosts, we'll see where it takes us. It's relatively people-intensive, so you have to build your organization as you go. It's not just a bunch of guys, hopefully with -- hopefully, it's not a bunch of guys just fooling around on a computer. So you have got to build the organization as you go and you have to -- the people have to get more experienced. So you want to do it in a way you're not wasting money. The resource isn't going away. As we own the minerals -- we either own the minerals or we have very long leases, the resource isn't going away. So we got a lot of flexibility on when. And I really don't have any idea because the program always has surprises. Some of them are good surprises; some of them are not. But the program always has surprises. It's very difficult -- especially in California, it's very difficult to predict some maximum rate.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A final question for me. You said most of the permits are within fields when we're talking about the increase in permits. Any progress on sort of geologically and doing the EA, environmental assessments, to sort of define some new field areas within the acreage?","Stephen I. Chazen","Oh yes, we're doing that. We'll get the permits eventually. This is just where we are right now. Because the state -- it's easy to clear permits within a field. I mean, it's easy in theory. They weren't doing it before. So that allows us to have a decent program and a predictable program. But there's a fair amount of progress. There's always issues in California, environmental issues that they're rightly concerned about. So are we. So I think there's always going to be something that isn't perfect for us. But we're pretty encouraged the way things are going now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sven Del Pozzo of IHS Herold.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","I know you've got the royalty advantage in California. I'm wondering if on your Permian acreage, you have similar advantages because you've had the acreage for a long time.","Stephen I. Chazen","I think our royalty interests are significantly below average. And if you went over the whole thing, compared to current things, it's not as great an advantage as in California for sure, because a lot of ranchers still own the underlying minerals. I'm going to guess it's sort of 9 to 10 points of average against new leases that somebody might take.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And some Permian E&Ps, talking about the Wolfberry again, with the inclusion of some other interbedded [ph] zones -- perhaps it's varied from area to area -- we're talking about a 25% increase in EUR compared to a couple of years ago that the reservoir engineers are giving them. And a little bit less than that on IP rates, but I was wondering whether you're experiencing similar performance given the application of new hydraulic fracturing techniques.","Stephen I. Chazen","I think we need to hire their reservoir engineers, as they have different numbers than we do.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. Then just for clarification, in the Bone Springs, are we talking Avalon Shale or the Bone Springs sands? How is the program weighted?","William E. Albrecht","It's definitely more weighted to the Bone Springs sands because, as you know, that's an oily play, whereas the Avalon is mainly gas.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. Any interest in vertical stacked pays in the, say, Wolf, Bone or drilling vertically on your acreage at this point in Bone Springs now?","William E. Albrecht","Yes, we're looking at that as well.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And then last question. Could you just give me a general impression of John Laird, what you know about him historically and what you've seen most recently? What you like?","Stephen I. Chazen","Who?","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Secretary of Natural Resources that's been appointed by Jerry Brown, the new guy?","Stephen I. Chazen","That's a lot higher than -- we're sort of nuts and bolts people working with people giving permits. Policies are best left to more sophisticated people than us.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","So it's bottom-up kind of bottlenecking you could say that's helping things along.","Stephen I. Chazen","It's right in the agency that generates permits, which is basically an engineering discussion about things. It's not about California environmental policies, which is way above my pay grade.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Neuhauser of Livermore Partners.","David Neuhauser","My question is a little bit macro. I wanted to see or give some thought into some of the headwinds that are currently facing the company as you look out this year and the next few years. I mean, we've had hard asset, hard commodity prices that actually fall overall this past year with the strengthening dollar. But at the same time, we've seen recoupling between WTI and Brent crude. So I wanted to see if you think the prices will remain stable in this band or what your current thoughts are on the landscape.","Stephen I. Chazen","For planning purposes, we're always more conservative than the current pricing. We're not very good at predicting this, you should understand. We were conservative at $25 oil too. So as a matter of running the business, we're always conservative about how we manage the business and what we expect for product prices. Having said that, I think globally, it costs more to find a barrel of oil -- I'm talking about oil, not gas -- than it did a few years ago. And it doesn't make a difference where that is. The overall finding costs are rising. And I think it's very likely that, that will continue to push prices higher over time. But just for planning purposes, we're always conservative about it. There's always a bearish argument for oil prices. There's always some explanation of why it's going to go down. And there's also the sort of the wacky extreme arguments it's going to be $200 a barrel in an hour. So I think it's almost impossible to ever -- I'd [ph] accept a general view that over time, it will rise with costs and to be, I think, conservative on a short-term basis.","David Neuhauser","Okay. And what about opportunities in general? I know you touched on a bit of M&A activities out there today and that you're seeing a lot of gassy assets. But are there areas out there or areas that you'd like to focus on where you could see increasing your footprint it, would be more advantageous to do so with an acquisition?","Stephen I. Chazen","We're basically not, as a rule, company buyers. There's always properties around. And we added in the Bakken basically not by buying companies, but by buying assets. We'll continue to do that. I wouldn't expect to see some new areas, if that's the question. But we'll see. I'm always surprised at what shows up in the course of a year. My ability to predict this is even less good than my ability to predict oil prices.","David Neuhauser","Okay. And my last question is, what are some things -- I mean, you seem again to be hitting on all cylinders for the most part on the year. And I guess my question is, what are some of the things that you're most not happy with, with the company's performance today that you would definitely like to see...","Stephen I. Chazen","I think we can get more efficient. I think there's always improvements in efficiency that are around. I think we're on an efficiency drive, but I think that's always something that we're looking for. You never get -- the problem with the goal is you never get to perfect. And even if you did, we'd move the goalposts. So not much chance at getting to perfect. So we look for that, and I'm always unhappy about some of the physical breakdowns. The infrastructure in the United States needs work. And so we get more breakdowns in infrastructure than you might like, so the full potential of the business really never shows up in any quarter. Those are the main things I'm concerned about. I can't do anything about the oil prices. No sense at being worried about it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from John Herrlin of Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Just some quick ones, Steve. In terms of your California spend, what would the breakdown be conventional versus unconventional, or shale versus your normal business?","Stephen I. Chazen","Probably about half, about half. I wouldn't take that number to the bank. It's probably -- it's about right. And it changes from month to month, as you can imagine.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. That's fine. In terms of your midstream spend, how much of that is going to be in California and the Midcontinent?","Stephen I. Chazen","Most of the spend in the midstream is the gas plant in -- right now in the Al Hosn gas plant. So that big number there is pretty much that. The gas plant in California will be done. This one -- this plant will be done -- the spending will be pretty much done by midyear for sure, most of the remaining spend in probably this quarter. And then, there'll be some gas plant spending in the Permian on CO2 plants and stuff, but a much lower level. But the big number you see there is the finishing up in the California plant and the gas plant and the Al Hosn gas plant.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Last 2 for me. What's water disposal running per barrel in the Bakken in terms of cost?","Stephen I. Chazen","That's definitely something I don't know. We'll find that.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","And the last one, any issues with proppants since you're doing a lot of exploitation?","Stephen I. Chazen","With what?","Stephen I. Chazen","Proppant.","William E. Albrecht","No, we haven't had any supply issues.","Stephen I. Chazen","You're asking about supply issues?","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Correct.","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, no. No.","Operator","Your next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Steve, just want to go back to, I think, some of your comments on Iraq and Libya. The spending level in Iraq, you talked about, about a \"11,000 barrel a day\" sort of number for the year, I believe. How confident are you in that number? Are things kind of -- are things getting done on the ground there to be able to keep that spending level fairly consistent?","Stephen I. Chazen","Sandy will answer that.","Edward Arthur Lowe","We've had a series of meetings in November and December with the procurement committees in Iraq. And they've recently approved a number of drilling-related contracts, and indeed the main drilling contract got a letter-of-intent approval. This will get all the drilling started. The facilities that will be needed for the increasing production are under bid right now, and they're coming through the committees in the first and second quarter. So we are seeing an opening up of procurement, which of course drives our production.","Stephen I. Chazen","So to put it in sort of financial terms, I think we feel okay about the 11,000, but it's certainly not the most solid number. On the other hand, if it worked right, it would be more.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And in Libya, what's the situation on the ground with you guys right now? How confident are you that you can bring back those volumes to a level that you outlined in your prepared remarks?","Stephen I. Chazen","Sandy can answer that.","Edward Arthur Lowe","Right now, the gross production in the fields where we have an interest are about 65%, 70% of what they were before the conflict started. We are continuing -- and our Libyan partners are continuing to repair and improve, and they still have a small drilling program going. So I think that we'll be back up to normal later this year, probably in the third quarter. We're still working with an interim government, so we're currently meeting with our counterparts in Libya every day to discuss how to go forward and how to increase production even further.","Stephen I. Chazen","We try to be conservative in the estimate for that, understanding things don't work perfectly.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And last question. In Bahrain, any updates on -- I think, is it the exploration of the deep gas sort of rights that you guys have?","Stephen I. Chazen","We're doing it with the wells this year. Yes, a well will be drilled this year.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How many, Steve, sorry?","Stephen I. Chazen","I think it's supposed to be -- it's one deep and a couple of others. Whether they get all done this year is a different issue. But the drilling will start this year.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Any operational issues in Bahrain following some of the civil unrest?","Stephen I. Chazen","Sandy?","Edward Arthur Lowe","It's a little more difficult place to work. We have trouble with our contractor sometimes, but it's been relatively quiet recently. We're watching the anniversary of the initial problems there. But it's affected our production only a few hundred barrels on a per-day basis over the year. Things are reasonably okay.","Stephen I. Chazen","It's growing. It's probably a little behind where we thought we'd be, but it's actually growing and doing fine.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Quick question about Colombia. Given that it's one of the very few assets you have outside the Mid East and the U.S., of course, any interest in monetizing that?","Stephen I. Chazen","No. If you ask a short question, you got a short answer.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","No, it makes a lot of sense. And just one more, if I may, about California. You've talked about permitting getting sort of tentatively better. Are there any catalysts that you envision to meaningfully accelerate the change in permitting approach of the administration there?","Stephen I. Chazen","I think generally, they're going back to a version of their historic rules, and they have a sizable backlog from us and others, I'm sure, to clear. And so, what they have to do is work through to get back to their historic rules. And again, the easiest ones to clear are the ones within the fields. I think they'll get to some version of the historical rules. There'll be other rules that won't be quite historical, but I'm not really concerned. As long as we understand the rules, we'll abide by them. There isn't really a long-term problem. It's just that the rules have to be clear to us, that's all.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is it fair to say that in the last 12 months since Brown came into office, there has been a systemic change in how they approach it versus the...","Stephen I. Chazen","The governor is very pro-jobs, -industry, whatever you want to say, and has been someone who understands that businesses generate jobs. That or a fair number of jobs here in California, we continue to. And I think the governor understands that and is appreciative of that. And it's a very -- he's very interested in this and very interested in employment here in the state, and we're pleased with the governor's involvement.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And just one last quick one. Did you book any reserves in Iraq in 2011?","Stephen I. Chazen","2011? We booked some in 2010 based on the program that was approved. Unfortunately, the program, because of a variety of reasons -- and the program is only approved through 2013. For a variety of reasons, we didn't achieve the program in 2011, mostly because we didn't spend the money and we couldn't. So the net result was that the reserves were negatively affected by the program. Those reserves will come back once the -- you can't book reserves beyond where the program has been approved by the government. So once they give us approval beyond 2013, those reserves will come back. As a technical matter, those reserves came off. Chris?","Christopher G. Stavros","Thanks for joining us, everyone.

One the first quarter earnings call we announced our plan to achieve cash flow break even after funding the dividend and growth capital. As a reminder over the past few years we executed strategic initiatives to divested lower margin, lower return oil and gas production but to replace it with higher margin, higher return production from our Permian resources business. ","This was a return focus strategy with the objective of insuring that every dollar we invest delivers the highest possible return. To reach the cash flow needed to be break even at $50 WTI and cash flow neutral at $40 WTI. We determine we would need incremental production of 80,000 BOE per day from Permian resources along with the additional cash flow that was expected from our chemicals and midstream businesses. Today I will update our progress with the plan but first I will share some second quarter highlights. ","On July 13, the board approved an increase to our quarter dividend, this is the fifteenth consecutive year we\u2019ve increased our dividend and as indicative of our core belief that dividend growth drives long-term share price appreciation. We believe dividend growth along with the earnings growth that will be generated from our returns focused pathway to breakeven, we\u2019ll maximize shareholder return over the long-term. ","The confidence that I, our board and our management team have in our ability to significantly grow shareholder value is based on the quality of our assets, the capability of our organization and the strength of our pathway to breakeven. Our pathway to breakeven begins with the best portfolio of assets that Oxy has had and it\u2019s nearly 100 years history. But it\u2019s not enough to have great assets, we must also ensure we continue to increase margins through further cost reductions. To accomplish this, we\u2019ve implemented a value based development approach along with innovative operations and technology applications. ","We\u2019re seeing exciting progress across all of our assets. Our value based development approach has already resulted in 400 additional Permian resources locations year-to-date with breakevens under $50. We expect further additions through the remainder of the year exceeding our original guidance of 400 location additions during 2017. ","And finally, with the efforts of the housing gas team the plan reached operating rate of 75,000 BOE per day net to Oxy. We\u2019re also managing our portfolio, during the quarter we announced multiple Permian transactions which resulted in the addition of low decline assets that will increase our operating cash flow by $80 million in 2019, with no incremental cash outlay. ","Turning to slide five, we have clarified what it means for Oxy to be breakeven at lower oil prices. Upon completion of our plan, we will be cash flow neutral at $40 WTI, meaning we\u2019ll cover the dividend and the production sustaining capital within operating cash flow. At $50 WTI, we\u2019ll also be able to generate 5% to 8% production growth. This chart walks you through the milestones we need to achieve this plan. Our entire organization is laser focused on our breakeven plan, in fact we introduced this plan as the key metric for our compensation across the organization. All the decisions that management will make in the upcoming quarters will align with achieving these goals. ","Slide six, illustrates our progress towards the breakeven plan. The chemical segment achieved a full quarter of operations at the new Ingleside ethylene cracker. However, our first cash distribution from the JV will be received in the third quarter due to funding of JV working capital during the second quarter. We did benefit from additional caustic soda volumes associated with the full quarter of operations from the cracker. Additional chemicals cash flow will come in 2018 from the startup of the fourth CPE plan in the fourth quarter of this year and from improving product prices. ","Then mid-chain segment improves substantially due to widening differentials between Midland and the Golf Coast. Improved marketing spread was partially offset by sequential declines in the NGL prices and gas processing fees. Further increases in volume through the export terminals as well as the additional debottlenecking of our hosing will also add to our cash flow. ","Our oil and gas segment added 9,000 BOE per day of high margin production from Permian resources bringing us closer to our production target. And finally, as I said earlier, Permian transactions will improve annual cash flow generation by $80 million in 2019 at $50 WTI. Each quarter we'll show the progress towards our pathway to breakeven on the same slide. ","Slide seven quantifies the liquidity we have available to fund the gap between cash flow from operations and the capital needed to achieve our goal of cash flow breakeven at low oil prices. At the end of the second quarter, we had $2.2 billion in cash as well as TIGP units with a market value of about 800 million. ","We will manage our portfolio to contribute at least an additional 500 million to ensure we bridge the cash gap, if prices average $40 through 2018. To be clear even with an average oil price of $40 through 2018, we have sufficient cash and liquidity to cover sustained capital, the dividend and our resources growth needed for the $50 breakeven plan. ","I will now turn the call over to Cedric Burgher. ","Cedric Burgher","Thanks Vicki, Jody will cover our Permian activity so I will address other significant items. Total reported production was 601,000 BOE per day with ongoing production coming in at 594,000 BOE per day which was at the top end of our guidance range. ","Domestic operating cost were below guidance and capital cost are on track to meet total year guidance. We spend approximately $800 million on our capital program with the majority of our $3.6 billion capital budget anticipated for the second half of the year. As a reminder, we received our tax-free fund of approximately $750 million during the second quarter. ","Second quarter core earnings per share was $0.15 with cash flow on track for our breakeven plan. Reported income included one-time gains on the sales of domestic oil and gas assets including sales taxes and a noncash fair value gain on our plains equity investment. ","Chemicals second quarter earnings were well above our guidance as caustic soda exceeded priced continue to increase based on a favorable supply and demand balance and low inventory levels. Chemical production and sales volumes were stronger than anticipated across most product line slightly offset by higher ethylene and natural gas cost. The second quarter Chemicals income also benefited from a full quarter of contributions from the joint venture ethylene cracker in Ingleside, Texas. However, our first cash distribution will not be received until the third quarter. ","The cash distribution will be approximately $50 million which includes some catch up from the second quarter. Midstream second quarter core earnings also came in above our previous guidance reflecting improved Midland and Gulf Coast spreads, higher volumes to the Ingleside crude terminal and improved foreign pipeline income with the completion of the Dolphin pipeline in our Hosn plant maintenance in the first quarter. Midstream improvements were partially offset by lower NGL prices and gas processing fees. ","On Slide 10, second quarter cash flows included $600 million in proceeds from the sales of assets including South Texas and $360 million in acquisition payments primarily related to the Permian resources and international operations. ","With respect to guidance please refer to Slide 11 in today's investor presentation. Our full year 2017 ongoing production guidance has been narrowed to a range of $597,000 to $605,000 BOE per day. From prior guidance of 595,000 to 615,000 BOE per day, the low end was raised to reflect the new production increase from the previously announced Permian transactions. The high end of the range was reduced as we finalized our ramp up scheduled in that Permian resources and recognized accumulative uncertainty in OPEC quarters [ph] extensions, Columbia downtime and our non-operated production growth timing. ","Permian resources total year production guidance has been narrowed with an adjustment only to the top end of our guidance to reflect the sale of our Permian resources acreage and our non-operated production growth timing. ","EOR production guidance has been increased to reflect the other part of that transaction. We continue to expect production in Permian resources to exit this year at a growth pace of approximately 30% higher than 2016 levels. We expect our capital expenditures to ramp up to about $1 billion for both the third quarter and the fourth quarters and our full year capital spending to be about $3.6 billion. ","Lastly, I would like to call your attention to our investor slide appendix which has been reorganized to include additional details on our business including several slides on our environmental, safety and governance framework and commitment. Since joining Oxy in late May, I have been thrilled to learn more about OXY\u2019s industry leading efforts in Carbon sequestration which we have highlighted on slide 34. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jody. ","Jody Elliott","Thank you, Cedric. Today, I\u2019ll provide an update on our Permian business and the improvements we\u2019ve made to the portfolio that will contribute to OXY\u2019s cash flow breakeven goals. In June, we announced a series of transactions that monetized non-strategic Permian resources acreage to accomplish two things for us. One, enhance our low decline Permian EOR business and two, core up in an area of glass cut county that will now become a new development area. The Permian resources we divested had less value in OXY\u2019s portfolio because of the expected timing of development, so we used it to provide liquidity to accelerate OXY\u2019s pathway to cash flow breakeven and increase the value of our portfolio. We will continue to evaluate the tail of our Permian resources portfolio for additional value adding opportunities. ","The Seminole-San Andres Unit we acquired produces from the world-class San Andres reservoir and is a natural fit in our industry leading Permian EOR portfolio. Oxy has strategically pursued these assets since we became a non-operated partner in 2001, with an initial working interest of 7%. Overtime, we increased our working interest to 53% before the recent acquisition and now we\u2019ll operate the assets with an 87% working interest. Our reservoir management expertise, operating experience and scale provide cost reduction and production optimization opportunities that will increase the value of this asset for Oxy.","We\u2019ve identified cost improvements of $5 per BOE that we target to realize by year-end 2017 and have an upside target of $10 per BOE that will bring the Seminole-San Andres Unit OpEx to parity with OXY\u2019s nearby Denver Units CO2 flood. ","Turning to slide 14, beyond the operating cost opportunity, we have provided an initial estimate of resource potential for the Seminole-San Andres Unit. We estimate approximately 100 million barrels of resource potential with the less than $6 per BOE future development cost, which brings our Permian EOR total inventory of less than $6 FND to almost 1 billion barrels. We believe that OXY\u2019s value base development approach which is grounded in subsurface characterization, operating capability and innovative technology along with the synergistic benefits from our scale in the area will provide significant upside to our initial resource estimates. ","I\u2019d also like to highlight one additional milestone in the EOR business. In January, the US EPA approved the second monitoring, reporting and verification plan for injecting and storing CO2 safely in the Permian Basin as part of our CO2, EOR operations. Oxy was the first company to received EPA authorization for EOR with CO2 sequestration in 2015. EPA approval of these plans represents an important milestone in the development and commercialization of carbon capture, utilization and storage technology as an approach for long-term management of greenhouse gas emissions. We believe OXY's assets and expertise and enhanced oil recovery and CO2 sequestration provide a long-term competitive advantage under various possible carbon pricing scenarios in the future. ","Moving to Permian resources on Slide 15, we achieved our 2017 target of adding 400 locations to our less than $50 WTI breakeven inventory. We now have approximately 16 years of inventory at a 10-rig pace with less than a $50 breakeven. Improved capital efficiency and well performance added 255 locations and are based on repeated performance improvements from well design and technology that are sustainable and have further room for improvement. We've traded approximately 7000 total net acreage this year enabling us to convert shorter wells into higher value extended laterals bringing our less than $50 breakeven average lateral link to 8600 feet. ","We\u2019ve also evaluated approximately 15,000 new net acres which added 100 locations to our less than $50 breakeven inventory. Our inventory now covers approximately 302,000 net acres which includes the effect of the divestitures during the year. ","As we progress our value based development approach we see continued potential for improvement in our inventory by applying new technology and enhancing operating efficiency. We continue our subsurface characterization to customize the development plans and well designs that will maximize the value of each section. Although we meet our 2017 less than $50 breakeven target of 400 locations, we believe we still have opportunity to further grow this number by year end. ","On Slide 16, updated our all-in capital intensity outlook through 2019, this metric provides an estimate of total annual CapEx for each 1000 barrels of annual average wage production during the given calendar year. Our improvements in 2017 to 2019 are the result of thoughtful development planning and created facilities infrastructure designs that increase facility utilization over the life of the field. ","We've also progressed our subsurface characterization and focused on understanding the why as opposed to just to what. For example, in Barilla Draw we utilized our advanced subsurface characterization that pin point a specific landing zone that would allow for maximizing SRV within the Wolfcamp A. This identification and execution of the why, resulted in a well specific landing point for the light of 16 edge, which contributed to an OXY record 30-day IP of 3200 BOE per day. ","As with our inventory we believe there is still upside to further improve our growth plans, all of our forecast assumptions are based on demonstrated performance where we have enough data to conclude that the improvements are sustainable. Our most recent improvements in well productivity, capital efficiency and improvements from applications and new data analytics projects represent upside opportunities. ","We also expect cost savings from logistics hubs multi-lateral drilling and additional water recycling that have not been recognized in the plan. We estimate there could be at least another 10% improvement as we continue development in our core areas through 2019. We believe our capital intensity is best in class and will the primary driver in providing OXY's growth while generating cash in 2019 and beyond. ","Turning to Slide 17, I'll provide an update on Permian resources drilling activity. Permian resources exited 2Q with 11 operated rigs an increase of four from the end of the first quarter. The increase in second quarter activity was late in the quarter which will primarily benefit production in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. ","In the second half of 2017, we\u2019ll operate five rigs in the greater San Dunes area, four rigs in the Greater Barilla Draw area and two rigs in the Midland Basin. As we build out infrastructure and progress our subservice characterization, we expect to move additional activities in the Mexico in 2018 and beyond. ","Resources are currently on the 30% CAGR trajectory based on our current development activity plans. You will also see that we lowered our expected rig count in 2018 and 2019 by one rig for both scenarios which is the result of the value based improvements we\u2019ve discussed and that improved our inventory and reduced the capital intensity.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Vicki Hollub.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you, Jody. We\u2019re fully on track to achieve our plan as shown across our oil and gas chemical industry businesses as each beat our second quarter expectations. Additionally, our teams are exceeding goal to increase value within the plan, we\u2019ve already met our Permian resources inventory improvement goal by adding 400 additional locations below $50 breakeven, and we expect to add more. We were able to complete multiple Permian transactions to add value and enhance our plan as announced this quarter. We ended the quarter with more cash on the balance sheet than we had at the end of the first quarter and we have ample liquidity to fully fund our plan at any old price. ","We will now open it up for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","So, Vicki, I wonder if I could just ask you to elaborate a little bit on the full year guidance. There seem to be a number of moving parts and I know it\u2019s not easy to answer that in a quick question. But, CapEx is obviously backed loaded it looks like OpEx cut production but I\u2019m also interested in slide 17 when you\u2019re showing this 13-rig count basically coming on about six months earlier. So, can you just walk us through what the nature of the bringing the top end of the guidance is and how that impacts your timing of when you expect to get the incremental I guess is certainly 1,000 barrels a day in the Permian. I\u2019ve got a follow up, please. ","Vicki Hollub","Okay. Thanks Doug. Our guidance really does not indicate any change in our confidence or in our pathway to breakeven as we\u2019ve laid out. Actually, this is just a narrowing of the guidance, our business teams are progressing and working and achieving exactly what we need them to and actually where as I mentioned in my script, we\u2019re really ahead of schedule in terms of performance. ","But there are several reasons that we did it, first we increased the low end of our range 2,000 barrels a day to account for the increased second half production as a result of our Permian transactions. And then we -- secondly, we now have a greater clarity on the redeployment of our South Texas sale proceeds. For example, we had said we would be able to deploy those into those proceeds and the Permian resources which we have done. And that activity is taking place in the second half of this year and now we expect that with the pad development that we had going on, some of that production will actually go into January and February. So, the activity we got better clarity on the timing of that. ","Third, our updated range really reflects some uncertainties around a number of things that have happened. Earlier in the year we had expected that the announced six-month quotas for OPEC would be in place and now that\u2019s been extended for a full year. Also, we've had some impacts of electrical storms in the Permian in the second quarter, we wanted to take that into account and we've also had some third-party processing outages. ","In our own EOR business we had two unplanned plant client outages which are now behind us and we wanted to a be a little bit conservative with Columbia with respect to pipeline outages we been able to manage that recently and expect to be able to manage it but we don\u2019t feel that there will be upside there. ","And then with respect to our Permian non-operative positive we are seeing indications that a lot of companies now starting to cut their capital. So, we feel like there could be some risk on the upside and again there are risk on the upside because we did increase the bottom side our range. And having said all that we felt like that it was small but wanted to make sure that we provided clarity around what we expect. ","Doug Leggate","Just to be clear on Slide 17 the earlier addition or move to 13 rigs I guess would be there in a couple of months, middle of next year looks like about the number for 80,000 barrels per day is that right?","Vicki Hollub","The 80,000 barrel a day really is going to be dependent on our efficiency improvements and how well we're able to move from pad to pad, logistics and several things. So, I'm not prepared to just to accelerate that schedule, we've said that it would be happened by the end of 2018 or first of 2019. I don\u2019t think that we see anything right now that would prompt us to change them. ","Doug Leggate","Okay my follow up hope is quick one, is another slide question on Slide 7, it looks as if I'm eyeballing this right, I guess you have broken it out, 0.5 billion to 2 billion of portfolio management I guess you called it, is that half in respect of the oil pricing or whether its $40 to $50 [indiscernible], I'll leave it there. Thanks. ","Vicki Hollub","What we're going to do is, we\u2019re make the right decisions from a monetization and value stand point, so where they are assets that we certainly feel would be best monetized for them to add value to the shareholders that\u2019s what we will do. We not going to monetize things that are not value adding, meaning we\u2019re not going to sell assets that we think would add more value if we kept them for development. So, we will look at that and make the decisions as we go, we're not going to try to target any upper end; we just think we need to make the best value decision. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Charles Robertson of Cowen and Company. ","Charles Robertson","Thank you and thank you for all the update on the operational side but my question comes, I would appreciate your thoughts behind the 15th consecutive year of raising your dividend and you could expand on that appreciate it. Thank you. ","Vicki Hollub","As I said we felt like that, we have extreme confidence in our plan and we know we can execute this. So, we felt it important to continue to increase our dividend. We know that there are holders that expect that to happen and needs to happen for some of the holders of our stock. We wanted to do a modest increase at this point and expect that as we achieve our cash flow neutrality in our breakeven that we will then be able to grow our dividend more in line with our value growth. ","Operator","And our next question will come from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","On the strategic plan, your strategic plan now evolves this lower stress case at 40. And given the capital efficiencies can you discuss the $50 side and is the 5% to 8% growth is that the sweet spot for growth or where improvements would rather lower to $50 threshold or could that allow the growth to drive higher. Just trying to understand how you see the upper end evolving with improving productivity or commodity price?","Vicki Hollub","Well, one thing that we do expect to see is we do expect efficiency improvements. This plan that we\u2019ve rolled out is very conservative, it does not include many of the things that Jody\u2019s team is working on in the Permian resources business. And it also really doesn\u2019t take into account some of the things internationally that we\u2019re seeing that great success with, with respect to some of the capital efficiency improvements there as well as the improved recovery in OpEx reductions. ","So, I think that certainly our plan is conservative, so with the $50 oil price there would be potential for further increases, but in terms of production, but what we want to do is make the best decision so we would just look at market condition, we\u2019d look at our other opportunities for use of capital and make a decision is to what\u2019s the best thing to do. I believe overtime, because of the assets we have, we have the potential to grow more. But we\u2019ll make those decisions as we get to that point. ","Evan Calio","Great. And my second question on the Permian. In your allocations, you\u2019ve achieved your full year guidance to add the 400 horizontal locations sub 50 by mid-year versus full year. Maybe you discuss what drove that earlier, does that mean you are ahead of your guidance and should we expect another update before year-end. Just color on that process would appreciate.","Jody Elliott","Yeah, this is Jody. Thank you for the question. Yeah, we have achieved that goal that we set out of 400. I\u2019m still working on your stretch goal of 600 locations as well. But we do think we can continue to progress that better well productivity, some really innovative things around pad development sequencing, moving a little more activity over the next year and in the Mexico longer laterals you see in the slides that we\u2019ve extended our average lateral length in the inventory. And that doesn\u2019t stop, right so I think that will continue to add sub 50 inventory. Plus, we\u2019re marching through the other 300,000, 350,000 acres that we really haven\u2019t fully evaluated. We knocked off another 15,000 this last time. So, probably not every quarter an update on inventory but maybe every other quarter we would provide an update. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Philip Gresh of JPMorgan. ","Philip Gresh ","Vicki I think one of the concerns I've heard from investors with the cash flow targets that have been outlined its just the timing of it, you mentioned end of '18 early '19, so I was just hoping that you could frame up some of the interim milestones you're thinking about here potentially exit rate '17, how much of this you think you might be able to achieve and I guess I'm thinking perhaps the mid-stream the chemicals pieces etcetera, do you think you could get 500 million to 600 million of this by the end of '17 or anything else you would be comfortable sharing on that front?","Vicki Hollub","I think that certainly -- I think by the end of this year we will make more progress, we're going to see probably our biggest incremental changes in beginning in Q1 of 2018 because lot of the ramp up in Permian resources will really start to pay off in Q1. So, I would certainly expect to have significant incremental progress towards our goal by that time. ","But some of the other things will happen in mid like 2018 for example we expect the [indiscernible] expansion will be certainly before the end of 2018, the four CPE will be at the beginning of 2018 that\u2019s the plant in Louisiana. We're going to see next quarter as we mentioned, the cash flow from the cracker starting to come in from the JV, so that should actually be happening next quarter, will help toward the end of this year. ","We expect that we will see incremental from the export terminal, we do plan to expand it a bit, but we're not sure the timing on that but that could also occur later in 2018. So, the closure things are immediate cash flow next quarter from the JV, the four CPE beginning of 2018 and then we're looking at [indiscernible] toward the end and the incremental growth from the Permian, while it wasn\u2019t a straight line from the time we announced it, over the next couple of quarters is really they are ramping up, they are going to start, they will see good fourth quarter production and then they are on a very strong trajectory going into the 2018. So, the growth in 2018 is going to be well above the 30% CAGR from Permian resources. ","Philip Gresh","And then you outlined how you see the balance sheet progressing from a cash standpoint, how you see things progressing to help fund the growth plan. I'm wondering how you think about acquisitions at this point, you did the swap etcetera but when you say they are in the next 12 to 18 months acquisitions are still something you're looking at or is it more just your organic growth in the portfolio management on the other side. ","Vicki Hollub","That going to be mostly organic growth. Where we see opportunities to continue to increase our working interest or do bolt on acquisitions we would do those. But we're so confident with this organic execution plan that we have that we're really focused on it and making sure that happens. ","Philip Gresh","Okay if I could just ask one last one, Vicky I kind of asked you about this in other conference a month ago, but perhaps you could just refresh us on the 5% day growth rate in this long-term target versus may be targeting a slightly lower growth rate and covering the dividend sooner and I ask this kind of in the context of seeing a lot of E&P companies out there missing numbers, stocks getting hit on a weaker production outlooks and it seems like the cash flow oriented stocks have been doing much better on the execution front and from a share price perspective. So, just curious on your thoughts on this.","Vicki Hollub","Yeah. I\u2019m want to emphasize that our growth rate right now and what we\u2019re doing over the next 18 months is, we\u2019re just replacing cash flow from those assets that we exited or divested. So, this high growth rate that you\u2019re seeing is a consequence of that, we need to replace the cash flow, we want to do that as quickly as we can and beyond that once we are cash flow neutral at 40 and breakeven at 50 with the 5% to 8% we will be -- we will stay within cash flow. And we expect over time, our cash flow to continue to increase. And that\u2019s our goal.","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Yeah. Thanks. good morning. Maybe the follow up on Phil\u2019s question here on the dividend, for the growth rate potentially why not talk about maybe a higher growth rate in the dividend or some growth rate in the dividend versus slightly slower production growth number at $50?","Vicki Hollub","I\u2019m sorry Greg -- Phil, could you repeat that question, you\u2019re asking why not growth, I\u2019m sorry, Roger you\u2019re asking\u2026 ","Roger Read","Yeah. So, the dividend is laid out at 2.4, 2.4 and then the production growth and just kind of getting back to the question that Phil asked. Why not talk about dividend growth blended with production growth as opposed to just a production growth number, or is just the goal here the toggle is always is production growth and the dividend secure at 40. I\u2019m just trying make sure I understand where you kind of you\u2019re laying out a sort of a drilling plan in 2019 and our productivity plan. How does that come back to the dividend?","Vicki Hollub","Right. In this interim as we are on this breakeven plan, the dividend is going to be -- the increases will be modest as we\u2019ve just show you. However, once we get beyond that the growth in the dividend will be consistent with our value proposition and that we\u2019ll grow that accordingly. So, as we\u2019re growing production, growing value, growing cash flow beyond the breakeven and our dividend at that point will certainly start to resume a healthier growth rate. And it will be according to at that point what the best use of capital is, best use of the cash. But it\u2019s not that the dividend will not grow, it will beyond this breakeven plan. Does that answer that Roger?","Roger Read","Okay. Great. Yeah it does, more of a timing issue here getting through this period and then focus on it. Okay. And then Jody maybe switching gears to you or Vicki if you want to keep on with it. In the appendix slide 25, 26, I think there was one or two more showed, it look like outperformance versus type curves. I was just wondering is that predominantly lateral linked which looks like some of it or is this kind of what\u2019s driving that improvement?","Jody Elliott","Yeah, Roger it\u2019s a combination of things. It is better, continued subsurface understanding and progression and refining our landing points, changing our stimulation designs to maximize stimulated rod volumes so that connection to the reservoir and lateral length is really all of those things. If I had to wait, I might probably say that the landing point in stimulation changes are driving the bulk of that. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. ","Paul Sankey ","I guess to would be remising me not to ask you about gas, oil ratios given the opposition in the Columbian scale of your position in your experience. What's your prospective on this latest controversy that too [ph] much as regards OXYs competitive position. ","Jody Elliott","Paul this is Jody, thank you. I think as we've talked all along we really emphasize our subsurface work whether that\u2019s geologic work or reservoir engineering and so the understanding of GOR [ph] behavior, it's not new to us, it is not a surprise for our assumptions, we model, we do more than just decline curve analysis, we have multiple defector [ph] changes like go through the life of this well, we model the GOR increase when you get to bubble point, we use rate transient analysis, we use reservoir modeling so it is a full cycle engineering analysis. And so, our plans have got those reservoir behaviors built into our forecast over the next couple of years, our GORs actually stay fairly flat based on the mix of new development and declining development. So that\u2019s well understood by us and built into our plan. ","Paul Sankey ","Looks like as though was playing the gas oil ratio bingo there and you excluded points for bubble point but you didn\u2019t manage to throw in big data. ","Jody Elliott","Thanks, the big data is really is analytics, it's not big data, its analytics that helps us get even better at that, so we're adding statistical models on top of the engineering analysis whether it's in reservoir, whether it's in geology, completions drilling, we're seeing that across the board with our analytics projects and that just refines our confidence on our EOR predictions, on our type curve predictions even more as we move forward. It's some of the technology thing that Vicki mentioned that really aren\u2019t based into this cash flow to breakeven plan, they act as upsides for us as we continue to solve those kind of though problems out there. ","Paul Sankey ","Could you contrast, I know you are all over the Permian but can you talk about how things differ across acreage and where you might be differentiated or not as the case may be as regards some of these issues. ","Vicki Hollub","Our activity set over the next several years is predominantly in a Delaware basin, where we're positioned where we had good rock positions, its geo pressured for most of those benches that extends the period of time before you start having GOR effects. So, I think we're well positioned from an inventory standpoint relative to some of our competitors with respect to GOR. ","Paul Sankey ","Got it, Vicki if I could just pin you down slightly, you're talking a lot about breakevens and then as you cost dividend increases, I think you know the market is getting tired of what is quite a modest time to ultimately to be a breakeven. But it feels as if the opportunities is better than it ever has been and can you not be more ambitious about your dividend growth over time, I'm for example pinning it to future volume growth assuming the margins were constant. Wouldn\u2019t it be reasonable to say that in the future we can get a 5% to 8% annualized dividend growth as our target? Thanks.","Vicki Hollub","I do expect that to be not only possible but likely, I just didn\u2019t want to pin my sub down to a range on that, but that\u2019s really time to target [Multiple Speakers] but that\u2019s our goal, it\u2019s in the interim we\u2019re just trying to get to the milestone of being able to then refocus and get our dividend growth back.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. You\u2019ve broken out your PAGP holding of $0.8 billion in the slide. And I remember the last time you sold some of that, I think it\u2019s about 2.5 years ago. Is there a threshold for the yield on that stock where you would feel compelled to monetize it?","Cedric Burgher","Yeah, Pavel this is Cedric. Really our approach is to be opportunistic, we have a number of assets in our portfolio that don\u2019t produce cash or not much and those would be likely candidates for sale earlier. But clearly the plant units from a long-term perspective are not core to our business and therefore a source of liquidity. But, the way we look at it they\u2019re throwing off good cash, we think it\u2019s a well-run company with good assets and so, we\u2019re happy to continue to hold on to those units and look for an opportunistic time to sell them down the road. ","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. Quick question about the sustaining capital under the $50 versus $40 scenarios. The difference is only 10%, $200 million, is there a certain amount of conservatism in another words if oil were $10 lower than your base line wouldn\u2019t sustaining capital be meaningfully lower than in 2.1 billion potentially?","Vicki Hollub","Sustaining capital does go down with oil prices because we would expect as you\u2019re alluding to service company cost and some of our CO2s tied to oil prices. So, it would go lower, what the estimate that we have on our slide though is what we believe today without significant efficiency improvement. So, it\u2019s conservative. ","Operator","And the next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Couple of questions on the Permian. You highlighted the coming shift in rigs in to New Mexico. Wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the decision to do that and the implications on the returns there versus the returns elsewhere in the Permian portfolio like the Southern Delaware and Midland Basins and also given that it\u2019s topical, can you speak to how you see the rest associated with navigating drilling horizontal wells around areas where there are legacy vertical wells particularly in the Midland?","Vicki Hollub","Yes, Brian the reason for the shift in the Mexico is really kind of grounded in our capital intensity calculations. The Mexico, because of the stack pace and very good stack pace is not like we have a primary bench and then three or four secondaries'. There are three or four primary benches that compete very well, very high returns and so it\u2019s that nature that drives us toward more in the Mexico kind of second in the tier would be the Texas, Delaware and then Midland Basin. I mean, those two aren\u2019t that different but they just have different production profiles with the wells as we drill and that\u2019s why we're in a more dominated with our activity still [ph] on the Delver side. ","The risks of drilling with vertical wells a lot of the areas we're developing are not historical vertical development or they were done in a way that you still have a lot of room between those verticals wells for not having any collision areas. A lot of our New Mexico development that we're going to is clean acreage in very little historical development if it was, it was in shallower reservoirs. ","We got a long history of this. You\u2019ve got to remember, we've been in the Permian for a long time at 25,000 wells, a lot of experience dealing with both vertical and now horizontal activity, we're doing more horizontal activity in our legacy EOR properties and on the central basin platform. So, it's something very manageable for us and I think the properties that we set themselves up well for continued horizontal development. ","Brian Singer","Thanks, and then on the technology side can you give us an update of some of the technology solutions that you're deploying such as I think most had lateral wells, one that you highlighted in the past. And if there is more to say on some of the predictive analytics, but then you already, that would be great, but, what the impact is on production or capital cost today. ","Cedric Burgher","We've got a great number of slides in the appendix that lays out the different projects that we\u2019re working. We made a lot of progress here recently in one around reservoir management of our injecting. So, both in Kim's business and [indiscernible] with steam and then northern Oman with the water flood and then our EOR business with CO2 floods we're deploying kind of the early versions of those tools that combine essentially low fidelity reservoir models with the statistical models that we can make changes in where our injecting goes on a greater frequency and so what that does, it allows us to get the biggest bang for the buck for every molecule of injecting that we put in the ground. So those are starting to get rolled out and from a technology standpoint that\u2019s all kind be done in the cloud. So, from an IT stand point, we\u2019re able to do this work from Oman all the way back here to Houston and again that\u2019s our starting point but technology applies to all three geographic areas. ","On the drilling side we're pushing out our bit trajectory data analytics tool, so we've been through kind of our early round of validating where the bid is based on serving equipment being 45 or 60 foot behind the bit, that\u2019s now starting, start beginning to get penetrated across multiple rigs and what that does is it again it keeps you in zone, it allows you to build you curves more accurately because you know where you are instead of projecting where you are and that results in better wells, if you stay in zone longer. So that\u2019s a couple of examples but there is a long list that we continue to push forward on the technology front. ","Brian Singer","And the multi-lateral wells, have there been any examples there?","Cedric Burgher","We're continuing to as we spoke before, we have one that we have completed the stimulation on, we have others planned. The impact of multi-lateral is really when we move into our second and third and fourth bench kind of development. So, we continue to move down that path kind of no new news there on multilateral. ","Operator","And our final question today will come from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning. Vicki, I was just wanted to ask you, I\u2019m looking at the various illustrations of the $40 and $50 per barrel spending and the 30% CAGR and the Permian resources and your remarks about replacing solid cash flows. Is the overall message that you\u2019re going to maintain this spending plan through 2018 regardless of oil prices or is there any chance that you would pull back if prices really swooned. And in particular what I\u2019m trying to understand is that the spending that you\u2019re outlining is really necessary to drive the efficiencies that are going to continue to lower cost further out?","Vicki Hollub","Well first of all, as long as we\u2019re investing our dollars and things that deliver rate of return that are better than our cost of capital, we\u2019ll continue to execute this plan. That also assumes that the fundamentals are there to support oil prices that are at least close to $40, because that\u2019s about where we get the returns that we feel are appropriate for our dollar invested. With respect to, I think in slide seven shows the liquidity that we\u2019ll have available to support that if that was the second part of your question at 40. And this is all for this 40. ","Jeffrey Campbell","But one other thing that I was just curious about is that and in addition investing for rates of return and so forth there has been a lot of illustration throughout the slice on driving cost lower overtime. And I was wondering if also part of this you want to get to a certain scale over the next 18 months to 20 months, that that\u2019s going to help to drive cost further even going further out?","Vicki Hollub","Yes, we set the $40 and $50 as milestones and we do believe that going forward beyond that in and again those are conservative because we haven\u2019t baked in a lot of the things that we\u2019re trying that we believe have a good possibility of working out. So, we do believe that overtime we\u2019ll continue to lower our cash flow neutrality that will continue to improve our operations and drive our cost down and our margins up. So, this to us is just a milestone. And Cedrick, you have something to add?","Cedric Burgher","I'll just say that the point of slide seven was to show you at $40 that we\u2019ve got the liquidity path that works obviously, so we\u2019re planning for the worst if you will, if things were to go below that on a sustainable basis then we would of course reassess the whole world probably would, but even as low as $40 WTI, we\u2019ve got a path that this plan we can execute from a liquidity standpoint.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. Well, that was really helpful. And just going back quickly Jody to your remarks about the multiple core opportunities in New Mexico as opposed to Texas and Midland. Slide 26 highlights that the Wolf Camp A and the Wolf Camp B are your core zones in the Midland Basin, but there has been pretty good success in the lower spread very in the Midland Basin as well. I was just wondering is that the zone that you\u2019re looking at, does that have the possibility to maybe become a third core zone overtime?","Cedric Burgher","Yeah. It does and in this new core development area that the transactions allowed us to develop their spray berry activity there as well, in New Mexico its second bone, its first bone its third bone, its XY, it's another zone in between the XY and the Wolfcamp, that\u2019s the beauty of New Mexico again as there is more what I would call premium benches, per acre of opportunity that we have. ","Jeffrey Campbell","And if I could just, kind of going back to what Brian was asking about, when you look at all those two C [ph] basins in New Mexico, do you think of minimum amount of development that you will do with individual well bores and at some point, later on you'll come up with the multi laterals and how you\u2019re thinking about that. ","Cedric Burgher","We take the multi-lateral -- we view multi-lateral as kind of an arrow in the quiver, it's one of many tools we have in our development plan. So, areas where we are location constrained, there are some environmentally sensitive areas that we operate in, there is BLM acreage, we're trying to minimize our footprint and so if you have multiple benches that\u2019s a lot of well heads if you do them all by one well at a time. So, we take that into account when we think about the development plan of an area of whether we want to deploy multi-lateral in that future development or not. ","Operator","And that concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vicki Hollub for any closing remarks. ","Vicki Hollub ","To close I would just like to reiterate our excitement and our confidence in our plan. The quality of our assets, the capability of our organization and the strength of our pathway to our breakeven plan is well understood by our organization and we're completely in line toward achieving our goals. ","But looking beyond our breakeven plan we're also confident in our ability to sustain our value proposition for the foreseeable future and that does include meaningful dividend growth beyond this breakeven plan. ","In addition to the multi decade reserves and resources that we have in the Permian basin and the long-term cash flow from OXYChem, we also have long-term contracts in the Middle East and Columbia and they will provide significant cash flow for multiple decades. So, we do have sustainability. So, I would like to thank you all for joining our call today and wish you happy day. Thanks. ","Operator","This conference has now concluded.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental Petroleum's first quarter 2015 conference call.","On the call with us today are Steve Chazen, Oxy's President and Chief Executive Officer; Vicki Hollub, Senior Executive Vice of Occidental and President, Oxy Oil and Gas; Chris Stavros, Chief Financial Officer; Willie Chiang, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas Operations.","In just a moment I will turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Chazen, who will provide an updated outlook for 2015. Our CFO, Chris Stavros, will review our financial and operating results for the first quarter and also provide some guidance for 2015; followed by Vicki Hollub who will provide an update of our activities in the Permian Basin.","As a reminder, today's conference call contains certain projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws.

Steve, please go ahead.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Chris.","Yesterday we announced that Vicki Hollub has been named to head our worldwide oil company and will succeed me as CEO when I retire. Both of us will be visiting shareholders either at conferences or in their offices over the next few months. My commitment is to remain in place until the board and Vicki feel it is time for me to move on but not any longer. Vicki has worked for Oxy for over 30 years. She's had a number of very challenging assignments over the years including operations manager in Ecuador and Russia.","In our California assets, she reorganized the business and changed its processes so that it would be stable in a wide range of product prices. She has built our Permian Resources business into a sustainable, profitable growth engine for Oxy. She's an accomplished team builder, has the confidence of executives and employees throughout the business. She also has had the misfortune of officing next to me for the last couple of years.","The Board, of which I'm a part, has worked on this succession plan for the last two years. The directors interviewed a number of executives and considered both internal and external candidates. In the current volatile business climate, our view is that an experienced, successful executive who knows our business well is the best choice. You will find Vicki to be a thoughtful, engaging and agent of change for Oxy.","Yesterday we also announced a dividend increase of just over 4%. This is our 13th consecutive year that we've raised our dividend. We carefully considered our future capital needs and likely cash flows. Our current estimates are that we should be able to continue to grow our dividend for many years into the future. The new ethylene cracker, which comes on in 2017, provides a substantial boost in distributable cash from our already-important chemical business. Our base oil business in Abu Dhabi, Oman and the Permian EOR will all support our cash flow and grow modestly over time.","Without profitable growth the company will not prosper. High rates of growth and cash flow and profits will come from our Permian Resources business. We remain mindful of the need to pay close attention for drilling for profits not just volume growth. Our overall financial strength gives us confidence that we'll be able to spend what we need in a range of product prices and still grow our dividends.","I'd like to lay out our goals for 2015 and how we have planned to adjust to lower commodity prices. Our principal goal for the year is to achieve cash flow neutrality where our operating cash flow covers our capital spending and dividend outlays by the fourth quarter of this year at around $60 per barrel oil prices. We will achieve this goal through deploying our capital and operating cost savings into further production and cash flow growth driven mostly by our Permian Resources segment and the startup of the Al Hosn gas project.","Year-to-date we estimate that about $400 million is in captured cost reductions. We expect our 2015 capital outlays to be less than our $5.8 billion budget and some of the savings will be redeployed into Permian Resources. In short we are learning to do more with less and expect continued improvement in productivity through the year. The Permian Resources segment has made considerable progress over the last six months improving our capital efficiency.","As slide six illustrates we have at least 16 years of inventory with returns that exceed our cost of capital at oil prices less than $60. Through continued reduction in drilling and completion costs, improvements in productivity, we will lower our finding and development costs and increase our inventory of well locations with returns that exceed our cost of capital.","In addition to improved capital efficiency, we expect to see improvement in our cash operating costs with reduced workload activity, lower energy costs and a larger base of production. This improved cost structure gives us confidence in driving production growth.","In the first quarter of 2015 we grew U.S. oil production by 9,000 barrels a day, a 5% gain over quarter-over-quarter and 14% year-over-year. Production growth was driven by our Permian Resources assets which produced 98,000 BOE a day in first quarter of 2015, a 46% increase year-over-year. Oil production growth in Permian Resources was stronger with a 25,000 barrels per day increase year-over-year. Given the strong start to 2015 we are increasing our full year guidance for the Permian Resources segment from 100,000 BOE a day to 105,000 to 108,000 BOE per day.","The Al Hosn gas project started up in January with one train online. During the start-up process production was curtailed to modify the sulfur and NGL processing units. These adjustments were completed in late April and the plant was restarted. We expect to ramp-up production through the second quarter and to average (7:13) we expect production of 35,000 BOE a day with the plant running at full capacity in the second half of the year.","Despite a lower capital program we expect production growth of 60,000 to 80,000 BOE per day in 2015 driven by the start-up of the Al Hosn gas project and the focused development program we will run in our Permian Resources segment. In the United States we expect oil production growth of about 8% partially offset by declines in NGLs and natural gas production. Vicki Hollub will provide further details in the outlook for the U.S. oil and gas business.","As we capture price savings from suppliers and improve the efficiency of operations we are able to do more with less spending. Our capital run rate in the first quarter was higher than the $5.8 billion full year level and will decline through the year given our large acreage position, deep inventory with the flexibility to defer drilling and appraisal activities. Although we will likely outspend our cash flow in the first half of the year, we expect that by the fourth quarter our operating cash flow will cover our capital expenditures and dividend payments, assuming a $60 per barrel oil-price environment.","We have approximately 69 million shares remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. We will continue to repurchase shares subject to stock price and market conditions and expect to ultimately repurchase the entire amount.","Now I'll turn the call over to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results.","Christopher G. Stavros - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone.","We generated core income of $31 million for the first quarter of 2015 resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.04, a decrease from both the year ago quarter and fourth quarter of 2014. The decline in core earnings is primarily due to lower commodity prices for all products. Our realized oil price for the first quarter of $48.50 a barrel was down about $23.00 a barrel sequentially. U.S. natural gas prices also declined, down more than a dollar, to about $2.50 per MCF. NGL prices also fell sharply to just under $18 a barrel in the first quarter, down about 35% from last year's fourth quarter.","In response to the current price environment we have aggressively ramped down our capital program focusing our development activity in our core areas of the Permian Basin and parts of the Middle East with an emphasis on growing our production volumes more efficiently. We have also renegotiated many of our supplier contracts which should result in meaningful savings this year, which Steve outlined.","The combination of reduced drilling activity, the wind down of spending for the Al Hosn project, and improved well cost efficiencies resulted in our total capital spending falling to $1.7 billion in the first quarter from $3 billion in fourth quarter of last year. As Steve noted earlier, we expect to be running cash-flow neutral after capital spending and payment of our dividends by the fourth quarter this year at oil prices of roughly $60 a barrel.","Despite the cut in capital, we continued our strong domestic production growth generated from our Permian Resources assets. Permian Resources grew its oil production 68% in the first quarter, adding 25,000 barrels per day compared to the year-ago period with total BOE growth of 46%. Permian Resources oil production improved by 11,000 barrels per day or 22% sequentially to 62,000 barrels a day in the first quarter.","Turning to the specific business segments, oil and gas core after-tax earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were $109 million, $259 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2014 and $851 million lower than last year's first quarter. For the first quarter of 2015, total company oil and gas production volumes averaged 645,000 BOE per day, an increase of 29,000 BOE in daily production from the fourth quarter and 72,000 BOE per day from the same period a year ago. As I mentioned earlier, our first quarter of 2015 worldwide realized oil price fell sharply, declining by 32% and 51% compared to the fourth and first quarters of last year.","After-tax core results for our domestic oil and gas operations were a loss of $89 million, compared with income of $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and income of $412 million in the first quarter of 2014. Results on both a sequential and year-over-year basis at our domestic operations were severely impacted by much lower realized oil prices, and to lesser degree, lower NGL and natural gas prices. The negative price impact was partially offset by lower DD&A rates and higher crude oil production volumes for both comparative periods. Total domestic oil and gas production averaged 326,000 BOE per day during first quarter of 2015, up 5,000 BOE per day sequentially and 24,000 BOE per day on a year-over-year basis, with substantially all of the increase coming from Permian Resources.","Domestic oil production was 198,000 barrels per day during the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 9,000 barrels per day from the fourth quarter and 25,000 barrels per day from the year-ago quarter.","International after-tax core income was $200 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $355 million from the fourth quarter and $553 million from the same period last year. The decline for both periods was driven by lower realized oil prices.","International oil and gas production volumes rose by 24,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarterly basis to 319,000 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2015. Approximately half of the increases to production both year-over-year and sequentially resulted from lower prices affecting our production sharing contracts.","Commencement of production from the Al Hosn gas project added 9,000 BOE per day in the quarter. Production at Al Hosn for the quarter was less than anticipated as during the start-up of production, during the ramp, we experienced some commissioning-related issues on the sulfur recovery units. Modifications have now been made and we anticipate reaching full productive capacity at Al Hosn over the coming months.","Our oil and gas cash operating costs fell to $13.36 per BOE for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $14.18 from the fourth quarter of last year due to the benefit of higher production and lower energy costs. DD&A for the first quarter of 2015 was $15.35 per BOE compared to $18.09 per BOE during the fourth quarter. Taxes other than on income which are directly related to product prices were $1.63 per BOE for the first quarter of this year compared to $2.45 per BOE for the full year of last year, 2014. Our first quarter exploration expense was $8 million.","Chemicals first quarter 2015 pre-tax core earnings were $139 million compared with $160 million in the fourth quarter and $136 million in the same period a year ago. The sequential decrease in earnings primarily reflected lower prices for most product lines and lower caustic soda volumes products, partially offset by lower ethylene and natural gas feedstock costs.","Midstream pre-tax core results were a loss of $5 million for the first quarter compared to income of $168 million in the fourth quarter and $96 million in the same period a year ago. The decline in results for both comparative periods was caused by several factors including lower marketing margins as a result of tighter Midland to Gulf Coast crude oil differentials, lower gas plant income which reflected sharply lower NGL prices, lower pipeline income due to a turnaround at the Dolphin plant, as well as lower third party gas sales combined with the impact from our reduced ownerships in the Plains Pipeline GP after the fourth quarter sale of a portion of these units.","Our cash flow from continuing operations before working capital changes was approximately $1.1 billion for the first quarter of this year. During the fourth quarter of 2014, our accrued capital spending and operating expenses were based on a work program that was significantly higher than the first quarter of this year. As we ramped down activity in the first quarter, our capital accruals declined and our net working capital declined. We used about $1 billion in the first quarter of 2015 for payments related to the higher capital operating expenses that were accrued at year end 2014.","As we continue to reduce activity in the second quarter, we expect to see further working capital usage as we reduce our accounts payables. However, we expect this to be at a lower rate. This trend is normal in a commodity down cycle and one that we would expect to dissipate by the third quarter as we reach a more stable level of capital spending. Should we see a continued recovery in crude oil prices and increase our drilling activity, we would expect this trend to reverse and see positive working capital movements.","Total company capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2015 were $1.7 billion and we expect our quarterly expenditures to continue to ramp down through the year. Oil and gas spent $1.5 billion with Permian Resources expenditures comprising nearly 50% of the total, with the remaining $200 million split about evenly between chemicals and midstream. Based on our lower pace of spending in the first quarter and continued cost efficiency gains, we expect our total capital spending for the year to be below our original guidance of $5.8 billion.","Our fourth quarter 2015 exit rate of capital would imply an annualized spending level of approximately $4 billion. We paid cash dividends of $557 million in the first quarter and purchased 2.7 [audio skip] (16:51) of our shares for $207 million. Our cash balance at the end of the first quarter of 2015 was $5.4 billion.","As a reminder, we currently hold shares in the Plains GP and California Resources Corporation with an aggregate value of about $3 billion. With respect to CRC we continue to own 71.5 million shares currently valued at about $600 million. We are required to dispose of all of these shares within approximately a year through either a dividend to our shareholders or in an exchange for either Oxy shares or debt.","Our debt-to-capital ratio was 17% at the end of the first quarter 2015.","The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 75% for the first quarter of 2015. The increase in the rate reflects a higher proportion of international income for the first quarter.","With respect to our oil and gas production, domestically, we expect our oil production for the second quarter to grow by 5,000 barrels per day with the increase coming from Permian Resources. Permian Resources is expected to grow its overall volumes by more than 7,000 BOE per day in the second quarter. Our Midcontinent gas production is expected to decline from the first quarter levels resulting in an overall domestic sequential growth rate of at least 4,000 BOE per day.","We expect our international production volumes to increase by about 15,000 BOE per day in the second quarter. The increase should come primarily from improving production rates at Al Hosn which we expect to be about 25,000 BOE per day, and offset by the loss of production in Yemen due to the civil unrest and security issues in the country. Although the contract in Yemen was set to expire at the end of this year, we anticipate no further production volumes from the country in 2015.","For reference, Yemen contributed approximately 9,000 barrels per day in the first quarter. As Steve mentioned in his opening remarks we have raised our full year 2015 guidance for production growth to a range of 60,000 to 80,000 BOE per day, an increase of 20,000 BOE per day versus our previous guidance. We expect full year production in Permian Resources to be in the range of 105 and 108,000 BOE per day, a year-over-year increase of more than 40%.","Overall, domestic volumes are expected to increase to over 325,000 BOE per day, at least 5% higher than 2014. Internationally we expect full year volumes from Al Hosn to be approximately 35,000 BOE per day. Should oil prices move higher, our production volumes could be negatively impacted by our production sharing contracts.","Price changes at current global prices affect our quarterly earnings before income taxes by $30 million for a dollar per barrel change in oil prices and $7 million for a dollar per barrel change in NGL prices. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices affects quarterly pre-tax earnings by about $15 million.","Our second quarter 2015 exploration expense is anticipated to be about $35 million pre-tax. We expect our second quarter 2015 pre-tax chemical earnings to be about $185 million, and second quarter midstream earnings should be in the range of $100 million pre-tax as we anticipate higher gas sales from the Dolphin pipeline and improved marketing margins as a result of wider inland versus Gulf Coast crude oil price differentials.","We expect our interest expense to rise to about $42 million in the second quarter from $28 million in the first quarter as the start of Al Hosn reduces our capitalized interest. Using current strip prices for oil and gas we expect our 2015 domestic tax rate to be 36% and our international tax rates to remain at about 65%.","To summarize, we've demonstrated strong year-over-year production growth of nearly 13% in the first quarter bolstered by our Permian Resources unit. The performance of this business combined with growing volumes from Al Hosn provides us with confidence to raise our guidance on 2015 production growth. We expect the growth in our volumes combined with the reduction on our capital spending and improving efficiencies to lead us to a cash flow neutral position by the fourth quarter at oil prices of around $60.","I'll now turn the call over to Vicki Hollub who will provide an update on our operations in the Permian Basin.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oil & Gas Americas","Thank you, Chris.","Today I'll first review the highlights of our Permian Resources and Permian EOR activities in the first quarter, and then I'll provide guidance on our program for remainder of 2015.","I'd like to highlight a few key messages. First, Permian Resources performance is exceeding expectations. Second, our core Permian unconventional programs generate strong returns in the current environment and we believe they will get even stronger through our focus on execution excellence. Finally, our Permian portfolio is unmatched in the industry. The combination of our assets in Permian Resources and EOR along with the expertise and commitment of our teams will allow us to grow the business and live within cash flow in a $60 oil environment.","In the first quarter Permian Resources achieved daily production of 98,000 BOE per day which is a 17% increase from the 84,000 BOE per day that were produced in the fourth quarter, and a 46% increase versus the prior year. With regard to oil, we produced 62,000 barrels per day for the first quarter. This is a 68% increase from a year ago and a 22% increase from the previous quarter. We would have achieved even higher production, but were negatively impacted by approximately 4,000 BOE per day by winter weather events in January.","During the first quarter, our capital expenditures were $728 million. We operated 25 rigs and drilled 86 wells including 61 horizontal wells. We placed 126 wells on production including 67 horizontals. This is an increase of 20 horizontal wells from the previous quarter. At the end of the quarter 16 wells were on flow back and 48 were not yet completed. Permian Resources has a large inventory of profitable wells to develop in a low price environment and we are successfully implementing four actions that are reducing the economic hurdle point of our inventory.","First, we are investing reservoir characterization and optimization to improve well productivity. Second, we are applying enhanced manufacturing principles to improve time to market and reduce costs. Third, we are aggressively working with suppliers to lower cost. Lastly, we are enhancing base management and maintenance operations to maximize production at minimal operating cost.","In the fourth quarter of last year we began transitioning from appraisal mode to a targeted development program utilizing a manufacturing approach combined with integrated planning and engineering. This has reduced nonproductive time, maximized the efficiencies of pad drilling including the use of zipper fracs, and has reduced infrastructure cost.","As a result of efforts we have achieved significantly improved well delivery and well costs. In the Delaware Basin our Wolfcamp A 4500-foot well cost decreased by 24% from 2014's cost of $10.9 million to a current cost of $8.3 million. We reduced our spud to rig release time by 17 days from 2014's average of 43 days to March's average of 26 days. In the Midland Basin we reduced the cost of our Spraberry 10,000-foot wells by 19% from 2014's cost of $9.7 million to a current cost of $7.9 million. In New Mexico we reduced the cost of our Bone Spring wells by 14% to $5.7 million.","These reductions were achieved by implementing design enhancements such as two-string casing design, optimizing bottom hole assemblies and bits, and utilizing drilling dynamics to improve rates of penetration. Additionally we continue to achieve reductions in our commercial rates. Based on the results achieved so far, we are confident that by the end of this year we can achieve an average well cost that is 20 to 25% lower than in 2014.","In the Delaware Basin we've currently identified 4,600 horizontal development locations. We have 1,500 horizontal locations ready for development, including 800 sites in the Wolfcamp A bench. The majority of these locations are in our operated areas of Reeves County. In New Mexico, our Bone Spring potential is equally as significant, with 1,500 potential locations. And in the Delaware in Q1 we operated 10 horizontal drilling rigs and two vertical rigs. We drilled 45 wells and placed 64 wells on production.","In Barilla Draw we placed 18 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches. These wells achieved an average peak rate of 1,371 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1017. In the last call I discussed the Peck State 258 #6H well which achieved a 30 day rate of 1,760 BOE per day. I'm excited to report this well is still producing over 1,000 barrels of oil per day after four months of production.","We continue to achieve encouraging results with our efforts to improve landing zones, optimized cluster spacing, and increased sand in concentrations. For example our Eagle State 28#6H well reached an average peak rate of 2037 BOE per day and 30 day rate of 1470 BOE per day. Additionally, our Peregrine 27#8H well achieved peak rate of 1768 BOE per day and 30 day rate of 1309 per day. In New Mexico, the performance of our Bone Spring wells continues to exceed our expectations. Recently our Cedar Canyon 15 Federal 5H was placed online with an average peak rate of 1322 BOE per day and a 30 day rate of 1127.","In the Midland Basin, we've currently identified 2500 horizontal well locations with 1,050 in Spraberry and Wolfcamp A and B benches. In the first quarter here we operated 11 horizontal drilling rigs and two vertical rigs. We drilled 41 wells and placed 62 wells on production.","Now I'd like to update you on Merchant, which is a new area in the Midland Basin that we mentioned last quarter. We launched into development mode early in this area and are drilling multi-well pads along with zipper frac completions. Our Wolfcamp A and B have achieved an average peak rate of 1408 per day, a 30 day rate of 1145 and a 60 day rate of 844. Our current well cost is $7.9 million, but we expect to lower it to $6.9 million as we move forward. The Merchant 1411A well that we discussed last quarter achieved six months' cumulative oil production of 100,000 barrels and equivalent production of 108,000 BOEs.","I'd also like to provide an update on our Permian EOR business which provides a stable and low decline base to our production at an advantaged cost. As we discussed last quarter our Permian EOR business remains profitable in the current downturn and we are continuing to make investments in these projects that significantly increase oil production from our portfolio of large conventional reservoirs. The EOR business is expected to generate free cash flow this year even in the current oil price environment. Continued investment in these long-life projects during the current market will result in more efficient construction costs which will yield a strong base for future growth in resources.","During the first quarter, we authorized the first portion of the North Hobbs phase II-A expansion project. The project will develop 13.7 million BOE of reserves for development costs of $13.82 per BOE. The phase II project builds on the success of the North Hobbs phase I project where CO2 flooding has added a sustained 5,300 barrels of oil per day that had a peak of 7,000 barrels of oil per day to the unit's production since the project began 12 years ago.","Another significant EOR project in currently progress is the Denver Unit: Battery 5 redevelopment which we will yield 21 million BOE of net reserves for a development cost of $4.80 per BOE. This project is typical of many opportunities to develop and comingle both the main oil column and the residual oil zone in the same well bore. The Battery 5 project includes the deepening of almost 150 main oil column producing wells to the residual oil zone.","Year-to-date EOR is ahead of plan and meeting our aggressive cost improvement targets which includes a $65 million reduction in well maintenance. By applying manufacturing concepts to well repair we have reduced our rig hours per repair by 20%. This is allowing us to reduce operating costs while maintaining our base production.","In closing, we will continue to execute a focused development strategy in 2015 and we'll also continue to pursue step changes and well productivity and cost structure. For the remainder of 2015, we plan to operate an average of 13 drilling rigs to drill 150 wells in Permian Resources. This is a higher activity level than previously planned, but we believe investing the efficiency gains is the prudent action to take.","As Chris said we expect to produce an average of 105,000 to 108,000 BOE per day in 2015 which exceeds our previously-stated target of 100,000 BOE per day. Strong production growth from our resources business along with a high volume, low capital intensive EOR business keeps us well positioned to not only meets the challenges of this lower price environment but also to profitably grow our combined Permian businesses.","Now I'll turn the call back to Chris Degner.","Christopher M. Degner - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Vicki. I think we'll now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And, Vicki, congratulations. It's nice to get that issue behind us. Looking forward to seeing what you're going to do next.","I guess I've got two questions, if I may. The first one is the Al Hosn guidance. I just wonder if you could explain the difference between what you suggested at the beginning of the year and what you're looking at now in terms of the reduction in full year expectations. Then I've got a follow-up please.","Edward A. Lowe - Vice President and President, Oil and Gas International Production","Yeah, Doug, this is Sandy Lowe. Plant started up and we have 25% sulfur recovery there. And some of the sulfur units weren't working quite properly so we took them offline, made some modifications. Today the plant is back up to 45% of production, which is about 25,000 BOEs to us and we should be back up at peak production of 1 million a day at the end of the month, beginning of next month. So the guidance that's given already by Chris should be good for the year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","I guess I had a couple of other issues I was going to touch on, Sandy, but taking advantage of you being there, maybe I'll make my second one on your region if I may.","Edward A. Lowe - Vice President and President, Oil and Gas International Production","Sure.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","There's been a fair amount of chatter around both the Adnoc concessions, obviously your \u2013 the slowdown, it seems, in terms of asset monetization in the region and finally the prospect of extensions in the Oman contracts. I'm just wondering if you could give us a kind of general update as to how those things stand, and I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Edward A. Lowe - Vice President and President, Oil and Gas International Production","Well, I can guide you only as to what you see in the press on the Adnoc concessions. Everybody who's involved is still bound by a confidentiality agreement. The press has been reasonably forthcoming in that respect.","As far as asset monetization, this \u2013 well, you know, when the price of oil dipped like it is, we have kind of two issues. People want to pay less for it and also they don't have quite as much money to get into it. So things are somewhat held in abeyance at the moment in that regard.","And the last question I believe was about Oman, we're in discussions at the moment. We're now at record-breaking production in our block nine, which is the one under discussion of over 100,000 barrels a day. So everybody's happy with that. And so we're just ironing out the details of a new contract with the government.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Any timeline? Because I believe that contract expires this year, Sandy. So what's the prognosis if you don't get it done in the next six months?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think there'll be an issue with that. So it will be \u2013 if it weren't quite complete, I'm sure they would extend us.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","All right. Steve, maybe I will just squeeze just one more in given that you jumped in there. The pace of buybacks given that your stock has lagged -- just curious on your thought process. Then I will leave it there. Thank you.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We continue to buy the stock back on weakness. And so you should expect that we'll buy back shares over the next year or so and eventually get to our target. The exact date or exact number each quarter, just hard to tell.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks a lot, everybody.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys, and congratulations as well to Vicki.","My first question is a strategic question. Oxy was in the midst of a restructuring and successfully unlocking value prior to the cycle turn and positioned you well with large cash position into this downturn. I know there's some leadership transition here yet. How has the cycle changed your restructuring outlook? I know you just mentioned the MENA asset divestiture or the partial divestiture. But does it alter your view as it relates to midstream or chemicals? And given the balance sheet and does it change your willingness to add resource and accelerate that shift here?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sort of a complicated question. The downturn \u2013 the cycle of course is \u2013 we expect if it stays volatile, whatever that means, we'd expect opportunities to show up during the cycle either to repurchase our stock or to buy other assets just depending on what's going on. Right now the asset market is quite expensive, so there's no reason to believe we'll do much of that.","As far as the Middle East assets are concerned, they fall into two classes of asset. Those that are \u2013 where we've already spent the money and we're clipping coupons, which seem fairly attractive in a more-volatile oil price environment. And those that are more volatile and follow normal trends which seem less attractive in this environment. So I think that's where we are. Some of those assets require some work and probably in the end divestiture or discontinuation of work there.","As far as the chemical business is concerned, the chemical business, once the ethylene cracker is on and the business becomes fully integrated with ethylene, its cash flow will be substantially larger than it is now. And I think that would be the appropriate time to look at whatever makes sense to do. I think if you do it too early, you're going to wind up undervaluing the asset. So I think we're a couple of years away. Of course, I'll be watching that from the beach. But \u2013 so you can ask Vicki at the time what she wants to do.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That's helpful. Maybe let me ask a different question that's kind of I guess the reverse direction of where we were just headed. Prior to the downturn, you discussed going to 54 horizontal rigs in the Permian by the end of 2016. You're at 21 active now. I know you just de-ramped, yet how are you approaching a potential re-ramp in activity given your potentially higher long-term goals? Is incremental free cash flow how you will drive that rate of incremental spend?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to answer first then we'll let Vicki answer. You might get two different answers. But I think generally, in the most attractive asset we have at almost any product price environment is the Permian business. Maybe some in the EOR business but also in the Resource business. Any money we have that's excess is going wind up there.","We've already \u2013 I think Vicki mentioned it \u2013 we've changed the number of rigs we're going to run by the end of the year. We're still looking at that. We got a lot of locations that work in a $60, $65 environment. If we start a well today, we won't see the production really until the third \u2013 late in the third or the fourth quarter. And we've gotten a lot better at bringing the stuff to market faster because the times have really shortened. That's why we're having a hard time keeping up with our estimates. I think our estimates are still \u2013 have room.","But I think what we're going to try to do \u2013 so we may put some more rigs to work depending on the environment. Our view on this is different than maybe some others. You get \u2013 if you put the stuff on production, these wells work. There's no issue about the returns or whatever. If oil prices move up you'll get 90% to 95% of that change in that well, because you have a little bit of production this year some oil prices are higher next year, you're going get 90% of that. I think this \u2013 if there is a boost in prices I think in the end completion costs will start to rise, not fall.","So we may be at the part where you want to finish the wells. And I don't \u2013 when you got a lot of locations \u2013 we've got thousands of locations \u2013 any locations that you put off for now, you've delayed drilling for 10 years from now, effectively, because you've moved them to the back of the line.","So our view is that you drill through this environment. You reap the returns that are there now. Oil prices move up, you're going get the bulk of that. I think delaying your production, because you know what oil prices are going be next year seems to me to be, you know \u2013 if people do know, I wish they'd send me an email so I could get rich.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oil & Gas Americas","I think I'll go with what Steve said. But just to build on that, I'd like to say that we're certainly keeping our team intact and ensuring that everybody is \u2013 has the resources necessary to prepare us to be able to maximize our flexibility. We're continuing to work on development plans in the areas that are not our core areas, because there's certainly a lot of opportunities where with increased prices we could start to ramp up and have lots of opportunities available beyond the core areas we're currently developing. So what we're doing is laying out those plans, evaluating those and starting to go ahead and permit. And just so that we can \u2013 if prices do go up we can ramp up rigs more efficiently than we have in the past.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just one last one: is there any comment on an optimal pace to retain the efficiencies that you're realizing today?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oil & Gas Americas","One of the things we're trying to do is make sure we maintain a minimum level of rigs in order to continue improving our efficiency, because you make a good point. You can't really get efficient if you're not actually out doing the work. And that's one thing that's provided us a lot of benefit here. In all areas we have continued operations, as you've seen on the charts, we've gained significant efficiencies. At Merchant where we \u2013 that's kind of a new startup where we don't have those efficiencies yet, but we're starting to see those coming as well. So we think it's critically important to maintain a certain level of activity with not only rigs, but the frac companies that you're using and the other service providers as well.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, everybody. Congrats on nice quarter, and, Vicki, congratulations to you as well.","My first question was on cost structure, but obviously you've been very successful in reducing your cost structure in recent months. You've mentioned $400 million in savings. Can you discuss where you are in that process? Where you see that number potentially going? And then if you could also just discuss for us how much of that you see as structural and permanent versus temporary and what might reverse when prices begin to rise again? Just trying to understand how that outlook might be structurally proving on the cost front. Then I have a follow-up.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oil & Gas Americas","The cost structure that we're trying to get to is, we currently have some of our contracts with suppliers tied to oil prices, so some of those contracts will go up with oil prices. However, the majority of our contracts for the drilling rigs and for our frac providers are not necessarily tied to an oil pricing index.","So what we're really trying to do is get more efficient. And we expect that the cost structure that we're going to achieve by fourth quarter is going be one that does have some exposure to flexibility in prices, but I don't believe that more than 60% to 70% of our cost structure improvement will be associated with oil price changes.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay, great. And then I had a follow-up on \u2013 I wanted to talk a little bit more about the Permian and capital allocation. But obviously results in the Permian have improved very rapidly and considerably just in the last six months or so. So the question is, does that rapid improvement really change your view of capital allocation relative to what you would have thought six months or a year ago? Meaning, are you much more likely now to commit incremental discretionary capital to the Permian? Or perhaps even look for acquisition opportunities and bolt-ons as opposed to the buy-back versus one year ago. Just hoping you can elaborate on most recent thoughts there? And what those improvements to the Permian really mean?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the Permian is obviously doing well. And we continue to put what's prudent into it. And we'll continue to focus on it. But as it generates better results, it generates more cash. And that cash a lot, the bulk of that will be reinvested in continuation as long as it does what it's currently doing. Facts are, the reason we sort of are running ahead of our outlook was simply because we didn't think we would be quite this good. So \u2013 and we continue to run ahead of outlook in our plans and we \u2013 so I think there's still room there.","I think the buy-back question is quite a different one. We need to reduce the number of shares outstanding over time. And we'll do that, but just as important we need to increase our cash flow so that we can continue to have more free cash flow to \u2013 for dividends and share repurchases. That's really and the purpose \u2013 at the very beginning I said you have to focus on the fact that you can't just save and cut back and that's going to make it better.","If you don't invest and you start to decline, you're going to have a hard time recovering from it because you have a decline curve and you're declining against it, and you're starting up again. So our objective is to continue to grow the volumes through the year. And to the extent we can unless you get a collapse in product prices. And then the free cash flow that that will generate over the next year can be used to enhance the dividend or repurchase shares.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","That's very helpful. Thanks for the comments, Steve.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Congratulations, Vicki. Two questions again on the Permian, it's probably going be a theme. You have a great slide in the deck just in terms of drilling days and getting from your 26 days down to a target of 16. What's the key thing you're doing differently? Is it just as simple as just getting to an efficiency mode or is there other things you need to do to get to the best in class? And then I've got a question on completions.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oil & Gas Americas","In terms of the drilling days, one of the things our team is doing is they're taking an evaluation of the formations that we're drilling through and modeling what it takes in terms of the weight on our bit and rotation of the bit to really design exactly how much we should do, how fast we should rotate the bit. And how much weight we should put on it by interval. And it's a process that's called mechanical-specific energy and that's one of the processes that's helped us to significantly reduce our drilling days, that, along with the fact that we're better managing our mud systems and we've seen a lot of improvement there. We're seeing significant reduction in nonproductive time during our drilling operations. So \u2013 and part of that \u2013 a good part of the nonproductive time reduction is due to the efficiencies of our teams and the scheduling.","Some of that is due as well to the fact that the Permian is not as stretched in terms of the support system now that activity is lower. So it's a combination of a lot of things but the thing I'm most excited about is the engineering that our teams are doing on the wells. And that's sustainable. So the drilling-day reduction is one of the things from a cost structure standpoint improvement that's sustainable and that's \u2013 we haven't been able to apply that everywhere yet, like in Merchant. That's one of the things that's going to help us further improve our drilling efficiency in Merchant. It's really based on some incredible work with teams especially with respect to the engineering aspect of what we're doing.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","My second question on completions, I was down at the Offshore Technology Conference, which they may as well call the Onshore and Offshore Technology Conference. Obviously there's a lot of new technology. Could you give a sense of any pilots or new solutions which you see driving the EUR improvements or lowering the cost.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oil & Gas Americas","One of the things that we've been trying, and we are not prepared yet to talk about the results, but we've used several different techniques to isolate how we inject and place our proppant within the horizontal section of the well. And we feel like that that's the next area that we feel has the most opportunity for improvement. That's getting the most contact with your proppant through the formation. So it's getting the most surface area contact in order to create the conduits through the well bore. What we felt is that if we could isolate our stages with just single clusters rather than two to three to four clusters per stage, that we could more efficiently frac the formation. We've tried some of that and we've tried various types of tools to help us do that. We're in the process of evaluating those results now and hope to have some things that we can share in the next three to six months.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks very much. Good luck.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Todd of Deutsche. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, and congratulations, Vicki. Maybe another follow-up question on the Permian. You have some slides in there that update on well cost deflation in the Permian. Can you \u2013 I guess with the 2014 level, a current level and a target level, I guess can you talk a little bit about where the current level of well costs are relative to what you implied in the 2015 budget? And then is the target well costs kind of a year end 2015 target? Is that an eventually full blown development program target? I guess maybe talk a little bit about how much of that is from service cost deflation versus improved efficiencies.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oil & Gas Americas","Yeah, the target that we're trying to achieve, we already have achieved that with some of our wells. So the current costs where I'm saying we are there is that3 basically an average of what we're seeing. That is actually our planned numbers were a little bit higher than what \u2013 certainly what our target is and sort of in between our target and our current. But in terms of where we expected to be for Q1, we're ahead of schedule because we're implementing these things as we go. So the target was where we expect to be by year end. But we think we will be ahead of that.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then, you addressed costs a little bit earlier and I wasn't clear whether you addressed this point or not. Last quarter you had targeted $500 million of cost savings. You said you'd captured $400 million to date. Any update on whether you expect greater than $500 million at this point, or is that a still a reasonable target for the year?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is Steve. I think it's a reasonable target for the year. I think we'll sort of get there. But I think \u2013 it could be more than that but I think right now we'll stick with that.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. I appreciate it. I'll leave it there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning, and congrats, Vicki, on your new role there.","Coming back around to the Permian Resources for the obvious reasons \u2013 as you talked about guidance and being in a situation where you could potentially still exceed that, can you quantify at all how much of that is the well performance issues that you highlighted earlier in terms of IP rates and 30 day rates and how much of it is just executing on getting the wells in the ground, sort of that if you spud today, whether or not you can get it started late Q3 or if it slides well into Q4?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oil & Gas Americas","Currently it's principally performance execution. It's accelerating the well delivery. However, we do have a couple of areas where we're seeing improved performance. You'll notice that the graphs from the Delaware basin, we're still seeing strong performance versus our peers in the Wolf Bone and the Barilla Draw area. There are other areas where we're seeing improved performance in terms of our program design.","So we're still seeing opportunities to increase our per-well performance and we're seeing \u2013 and then the main thing that we're doing there is targeting better landing zones. So I would say that right now just to go back and bottom-line answer the question, it's incredible execution on the part of our teams to get the wells on faster. And part of it is a little bit of improved recovery on a per-well basis, but we still expect there will be more of that to come.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then Yemen, as you said earlier that was going to go away anyway. But I was wondering what was the margin or cash margin per unit that that impacts you?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't remember. Chris has got it.","Christopher G. Stavros - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","It was generating about $15 million a quarter after tax if you want to think about it that way.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, Vicki.","Steve, you start your slides in a differentiated way with talk about dividend growth. And I think and I assume Vicki will continue this as the primary ultimate aim of OXY. Can you square the circle because, as I said, that's a differentiated strategy from most other if not all other U.S. E&Ps. Does it mean you have better geology costs, lower growth? How is it that you're going be able to deliver a higher dividend growth than others in essentially the same place? Thanks.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, most of them don't have any dividends. So comparing against an environment with \u2013 so we're sort of a tall midget here. So I think the -- dividends, if there is religious activity here, I think that's it. It provides discipline to the management, otherwise you print shares, do all sorts of wealth destructive things. The dividends give you discipline. We have a more diverse business than the typical E&P. We've got the sort of stable stuff that we've already spent the money on in the Middle East to generate cash. We've got the Chemical business, which always generates cash. We have a midstream business which generates cash, and we have less debt, relatively.","So all that provides more cash than the typical, and what we do with the cash is we buy in some shares. And we pay more dividends. You have to have something that \u2013 you can't be at our size \u2013 you can't try to compete with somebody makes 10,000 barrels a day and grow. So we think that our long standing acreage position, that's also part of it, we didn't just acquire the acreage last month or last year. We got the EOR business which generates a lot of cash.","In economic terms, those are called monopoly profits and that's what you're seeing. It's the same thing you see at the large integrateds. That's what differentiates it. The other guys have a different strategy. Nothing wrong with their strategy, it's just different but we think the cash here will be strong and we invest sometimes unpopularly, by the way, in things that will generate a lot of cash for a long period of time. So we always are thinking about how we're going grow the dividend. I guess she can speak for herself but I think Vicki and Chris have the same basic belief because they've been hearing it for a long time. So...","Christopher G. Stavros - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And that's \u2013 and Chris is planning on staying so Chris will be your principal person to talk to about financial matters, but Vicki will certainly set the strategy.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Well, I'm glad to hear that Vicki's not planning to fire Chris. Could \u2013 I guess theoretically. Let's skip over your politically-incorrect comment and just say, assuming you're that not comping against other E&Ps, but I would assume an above inflation rate of growth, otherwise you're not growing the dividend. Would that mean that ultimately given the assets that you listed are all more\/less zero growth once we get through some of the project start-ups, would that mean that we align your long-term volume growth with your long-term dividend growth?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, that probably about right.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Which would be 5%-plus percent but not 10% I guess.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's right. It's hard to say exactly. Because you have the chemical business which is a little different and that's going to generate a sizable amount of free cash out here. I'm sure it will generate $1 billion in free cash. And so that will cover a fair amount of the dividend without doing anything and some growth there. It's sort of a GDP grower when all is said and done on its cash flow.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I mean...","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Go ahead.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That provides the base. And we just \u2013 the dividends are the cost of keeping the shareholders. It's cost of capital. However you want to say it. And without that sort of discipline, you'd do all kinds of crazy stuff.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, and just finally, would it be fair, if harsh, to say the other element here is you're coming off a lower base in terms of your operational performance in the Permian and that provides the potential for greater growth? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know. Maybe. But I think growth is growth. We've spent a lot of time building to this so that we wouldn't be in the same situation that a number of other companies are. We've spent money and time. And so we started the acceleration when we knew what we were doing, mostly. And that's really what \u2013 and I think we've told you that in the past, which nobody listened to.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, thanks, Steve.","Operator","And our last question comes from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah, hi, just a quick one for me. Steve nobody would accuse Oxy as being a contra plastic but regarding the Permian, you're going to drill in the Resources division, I guess Vicki, 150 wells. Can you give me a sense what the split would be, Delaware, central basin and midland? And that's it.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oil & Gas Americas","Yes of the 150 wells, none of them will be on the Central Basin platform. It'll be almost split half-and-half between the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay, great. That's it for me. Thank you.","Stephen I.

Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone.","I'd like to focus on three topics in my opening remarks. First, I'll provide you an update on our portfolio optimization initiatives, and I'll share what this means for our near-term growth plans. Then I'll highlight some components of what we believe is our differentiated and value-based approach. And last, I'll provide details on our plan to get to cash flow breakeven after funding the dividend and growth capital.","Turning to slide 4, in 2013 we began our strategic review process to divest of low-margin low-return assets and assets that simply could not compete for capital within our portfolio. We allocate capital based on the net present value of the project, the returns they generate, the cash flow profile, the reserves added, and its capital intensity. To support our value proposition, we need a balanced blend of short-cycle, high-growth investments along with low-decline long-term cash flow. But in both categories, we need relatively high-margin, high-return assets, and we need the ability to control our own destiny. By this I mean we need a high-quality development inventory with the potential to sustain our growth over the long term without needing to depend on acquisitions or the decisions of others.","As the final step of our strategic review process, we have now divested of our South Texas gas properties, which were our last non-core upstream assets. Our remaining upstream assets are all within our core areas, which are the Permian Basin, Colombia, Oman, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.","The proceeds from the South Texas sale will be redeployed into Permian Resources. Given that Permian Resources margins are three times higher than South Texas gas, only 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of Resources production is needed to replace the cash flow from the 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent produced by South Texas.","As we've been going through this optimization process, we've been replacing the lower-margin, low-return divested production with better quality, higher margin, higher return production in order to restore our cash flow. About half the divested production has been replaced with incremental production from Permian Resources, Al Hosn, and Oman.","The remaining growth needed to restore our cash flow to cover growth capital at $50 WTI will come mostly from our Permian Resources business. As you know, even in a $40 to $50 price environment, our Resources developments generate high returns with low risk due to the quality of the rock, scalability of the development, and availability of services. I want to point out that this has not been a shrink-to-grow strategy. This has been a deliberate drive to ensure the capital we invest will deliver the highest possible returns. This is a returns-focused strategy. We now have the highest portfolio that I believe we've ever had, but a great portfolio is not enough. We must also ensure we do the things necessary to maximize its value.","On slide 6, I'd like to share how we're doing that. We have centered our entire business on a differentiated value-based development approach. The three goals on the left-hand side of the slide may seem basic to running oil company, but can be hard to achieve in actual practice. Our organization and culture are grounded in recovering more oil at less cost while continually building the required inventory to sustain and improve our results.","Before I highlight several components of our approach, I'd like to say that we make decisions and weigh trade-offs that may differ from our competitors because we're focused on creating shareholder value over the long term. The first component is our niche. We have proven and long been known for our ability to get more reserves out of reservoirs than others can. That achievement starts with strong technical capability, a solid understanding of the subsurface, and the application of cutting-edge technology to develop and manage the reservoir over the full life of the reserve. We have done this in conventional, tight, and unconventional reservoirs in many areas of the world. We've done it with primary, secondary, and tertiary recovery methodologies, onshore and offshore, in deserts and in jungles.","We've taken a similar approach in Permian Resources, where the key to our success has been investment in technology and our rigorous internal workflow of subsurface characterizations. We first needed to understand the reservoir and the fluids within the reservoir. Only then could we confidently understand where to land the wellbore, how to design the stimulation, how many wells are optimal per section, and the minimal infrastructure needed to support it.","While many of our competitors are busy drilling the most wells per section, we're focused on drilling the optimal number of wells per section for less cost to recover the same, if not more oil through an infrastructure that's designed to deliver the highest net present value rather than to support a peak production rate. Today this requires strong chemical capabilities, detailed integrated planning, and an innovative culture across the entire organization.","The second component is the early adoption of external trends because I believe this is where we truly separate ourselves from the pack. For example, several years ago we recognized that data analytics would be big for our industry. Early adoption has been key to enable full integration of this technology into our culture. Only culture will allow new technologies like data analytics to drive sustainable business results. The reality is that as we are rolling data analytics out to all of our disciplines, we're starting to find things that we had not previously seen and in many ways that we didn't expect. This will have a material impact on our future business and financial performance. We believe if you're thinking long term, you need to be thinking about data analytics now.","Turning to my final slide, slide number 8, I want to reinforce that getting to a lower cash flow breakeven after dividend and growth capital is a top near-term priority. As always, our financial goal is to grow our dividend and company value by making returns-focused investments that will drive 5% to 8% average production growth over time.","The pathway to this lower breakeven oil price is clear to us, and the actions listed on the slide will all work together to help us reach our goals. And it is important to note that we plan to accelerate cash flows from the tail of our portfolio to help fund the production growth needed to achieve our lower breakeven target. The tail of our portfolio includes Permian Resources acreage that is not strategic to us to but synergistic and valuable to others. This will be done as needed and opportunistically.","On the right side of the slide, we have identified key milestones and accelerators. Our incremental growth target is 80,000 barrels per day above our 2016 average production rate, including the replacement of the South Texas cash flow. To fund this growth capital, we disclosed $2.2 billion of cash sources. Beyond these sources, we're continuing to work several options across our portfolio that will accelerate in value creation, including asset trades, partnerships, and sales. We're looking for win-win scenarios for ourselves and other companies.","We believe oil prices could be lower for longer and only the companies with high-quality assets and top-tier operational performance will be up to the challenges our industry will face over the next few years. We believe we're well positioned to meet these challenges.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris Stavros.","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll focus on the following: a brief summary of our first quarter 2017 financial results, cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity items. And then I'll come back at the end of all of our prepared remarks to close out with guidance for oil and gas production, the other business segments and related items for the second quarter and full year 2017.","Our first quarter 2017 reported income for GAAP purposes as well as our core income was $117 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. While higher product prices were a big factor in our sequentially improved earnings results, all of our operating segments demonstrated better than expected results. For the first time in nearly three years, the arrows are clearly pointing in a favorable direction for all of our core businesses.","In addition to higher product prices, our realized prices for both oil and NGLs relative to benchmarks showed a marked improvement on a sequential quarterly basis in helping improve overall oil and gas profitability. Much of this was due to better than expected Midland to Cushing differentials during the quarter.","First quarter oil and gas production volumes averaged 584,000 BOE per day, and all of our reported data incorporates production volumes for our South Texas gas properties, which have been sold. Permian Resources production grew 6,000 BOE per day, up 5% on a sequential quarterly basis to 129,000 BOE per day in the first quarter and in line with our earlier guidance. More than 80% of the quarter-on-quarter improvement in Resources production came from oil growth.","Our total costs in oil and gas, including cash operating costs, DD&A and G&A, had a positive sequential pre-tax impact of about $130 million. Despite the planned and unplanned downtime, our international oil and gas operations generated more than $200 million of cash flow after capital during the first quarter.","Chemicals generated first quarter pre-tax core earnings of $170 million, up $18 million sequentially and exceeding our earlier guidance. First quarter results reflected higher caustic soda, PVC, and VCM volumes along with higher caustic soda prices and partly offset by higher ethylene and energy prices.","Midstream pre-tax core results were a loss of $47 million for the first quarter and similar to last year's fourth quarter. The better than expected results in the most recent period were supported by higher than expected throughput at the Ingleside export terminal and better NGL realizations.","Turning to our cash flows for the first quarter of 2017. We generated nearly $1.1 billion of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital. Changes in working capital consumed approximately $390 million of cash during the quarter. Working capital usage is typical for us during the early part of the year and primarily due to the timing of payments for property taxes and other cyclical payments. In addition, we also had a build in our accounts receivable, largely due to rising prices for some key products in our Chemicals segment and with cash collection lagged by about a month.","We also used some working capital as we incurred some line fill in our pipelines as our storage and export terminal at Ingleside ramped up its capacity. Under the current product price environment and our expected pace of development activity, we anticipate this use of working capital to be behind us and with some modest reversal expected during the remainder of the year.","Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $750 million, with oil and gas spending representing about $600 million. We expect our capital to ramp up to about $950 million in the second quarter and continue at this pace for the remainder of the year as we ramp up our activity. Based on the anticipated pace of activity in Permian Resources, we would expect our full-year capital spending to be towards the higher end of the $3 billion to $3.6 billion range we had indicated earlier this year.","We ended the first quarter with $1.5 billion of cash on hand. As Vicki mentioned, we closed on the sale of our South Texas gas properties for net after-tax proceeds of nearly $600 million, the bulk of which were received in April. These assets were in decline and did not compete for capital relative to our investment opportunities in the Permian. Our plan is to redirect the proceeds towards our high-return development of Permian Resources and in an effort to drive higher value oil production growth. Together with proceeds from the sale of South Texas and the cash tax refund of approximately $700 million anticipated in coming weeks, we expect to have a higher cash balance at the end of the second quarter.","We continue to hold our investment in the Plains All American Pipeline general partner, although we consider this to be non-core. This, in addition to potential funding options that Vicki mentioned, provides us with a high degree of comfort in terms of leverage we have at our disposal to support our capital program. Our ability to better capture the high-margin, high-return growth opportunities in Permian Resources also supports the future growth of our dividend. Going forward, we will continue to free up capital from non-core or non-strategic assets and seek opportunities to derisk portions of our portfolio in order to reinvest in Permian Resources.","I'll now pass the call over to Rob Peterson, who'll provide some insight around our Chemicals business.","Robert Lee Peterson - Occidental Chemical Corp.","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In February, OxyChem safely completed commissioning of our ethane cracker that will produce 1.2 billion pounds per year of ethylene at our Ingleside, Texas facility. The project is a 50\/50 joint venture between OxyChem and our long-term partner, Mexichem. The project included a dedicated 115-mile ethane pipeline and storage dome in Markham, Texas. This project is the first grassroots cracker built in the United States in over 15 years.","Completion of the project both on time and on budget while maintaining tremendous health and safety performance throughout its construction is a testament to our employees and our contractors to execute and deliver on objectives. The cracker has been operating at design capacity since the latter half of March. In addition, we improved our ability to transport ethylene to and from our Markham, Texas storage dome throughout our pipeline.","Most importantly, the ethylene produced by the cracker is being consumed at Ingleside facility in the production of VCM, nearly all of which is being exported to Mexichem facilities in Mexico and Colombia, where they convert the VCM into PVC and PVC piping systems. The successful completion of the project and the structure of our partnership with Mexichem assures that the cracker will continue to operate at high operating rates over the course of our 20-year agreement and that both parties will receive returns on an investment that well exceed our cost of capital.","This investment is not based upon any secured merchant sales of ethylene or new VCM business, but rather allows us to further back-integrate our value chain to support existing business with Mexichem. This value-based approach is in alignment with our overall company goals.","While we continue to invest in our chemical operations, including our latest investment in Geismar, Louisiana that will provide the feedstock for the production of next-generation refrigerants, the completion of the ethylene project marks the conclusion of a significant capital spending cycle over the past five years. OxyChem's focus will now turn to what it has excelled at, maximizing the value of our assets to deliver significant free cash flow back to the parent company.","On slide 14, I will go over a brief overview of the current trends in the chlorovinyl market. After a multiyear downturn at the beginning of 2013, the chlorovinyl market has been on a trend of sustained earnings improvement since the second quarter of 2016. The primary driver of the earnings improvement is increased margins in our liquid caustic soda business. OxyChem is the world's largest marketer of liquid caustic soda, selling approximately 3 million tons each year, and is the largest exporter of caustic soda in the United States, led by our advanced logistics from our Ingleside, Texas facility.","Both domestic and export caustic soda prices have risen sharply. While average domestic spot prices have risen nearly $190 per dry short ton since March of 2016, export prices improved nearly $250 per dry short ton in the same period. In addition, OxyChem just implemented an additional $50 per dry short ton price increase for the second quarter in every account where contract terms permit it.","On the PVC side of the business, we secured $0.06 per pound of price increases in the first quarter, as we worked to recover margin lost due to ethylene escalation since the second half of 2016. We are committed to take the actions necessary to improve the profitability of this business segment to an acceptable level.","Two factors are the source of chlorovinyl business improvement: first, the conclusion of the consolidation of North American chlor-alkali producers, which created significant turmoil in the market of chlorovinyl products; second, the global absorption of significant new chlor-alkali and vinyl capacity built through 2014. Further consolidation of North American producers is unlikely, and with no significant chlor-alkali or vinyl capacity expansion on the horizon, we believe the current up cycle will persist beyond 2017. Furthermore, we are encouraged by the emphasis of infrastructure replacement in the United States and the potential additional growth it could provide to PVC, which is the most cost-effective and sustainable solution to underground piping systems.","In closing, we are excited about our performance at OxyChem. The completion of our heavy capital spending program concurrent with the business up cycle will create significant improvement in free cash flow generation for the company. As we've indicated previously, we anticipate at least a $400 million improvement in year-over-year free cash flow generation, with upside to that figure based on favorable market conditions and OxyChem's strong market position. As we look forward to 2018, full-year contributions from the cracker along with the initial contributions from our refrigerant feedstock plant should provide in excess of $75 million of additional free cash flow.","I will now turn the call over to Jody Elliott.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll provide an update on our Permian Basin business and how it's driving the plan that Vicki outlined in her opening remarks.","Our efforts in the Permian are a clear example of how our differentiated value-based approach generates growth in value through a sustainable competitive advantage. As part of our corporate portfolio optimization, we will redeploy the proceeds from South Texas into three to five additional Permian Resources rigs, bringing the Resources rig count to 11 to 13 by year end, including outside operated. This activity will increase Resources 2017 capital to between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion but without increasing OXY's capital budget of $3.6 billion.","This activity is aligned with our value-based approach to development and should result in a moderate increase of about 10,000 MBOE per day to the 2017 exit rate. This impact will be more pronounced as we exit 2017 and enter 2018. We are pursuing trades, partnerships, and sales opportunities using the tail of our portfolio to fund accelerated growth within our core developments. We understand the value benefits of acceleration and believe our Permian inventory can support monetization opportunities and high-value long-term growth.","We also appreciate the necessity for value-based development and have found that the NPV benefits of acceleration can be quickly offset by suboptimal development plans, so we will be disciplined in our approach to maximize shareholder value. Our value-based development begins with the subsurface and surface workflows, where we ensure all key attributes are aligned, including bench and well sequencing, well spacing, infrastructure, and technology advancements. We continue to apply innovative technology into our plans, and we will provide additional disclosure as we deliver results there.","We understand the importance of cost leadership in our development plans, which starts with commercial strategies and partnerships to protect margins. So we're taking the right steps to minimize OXY's exposure to cost inflation and supply constraints as activity ramps up. As we work toward our OXY financial goals, both Permian businesses will play an integral part of the strategy. Permian Resources is capable of generating free cash flow in 2018 at greater than 20% growth. We will also continue modest investments in Permian EOR, which is currently generating free cash flow and provides a stable business to help manage through volatile market conditions. For reference, the Permian EOR business provides about $35 million of operating cash flow for every dollar increase in oil price.","Turning to slide 16, I'd like to highlight the low capital intensity growth in Permian Resources. We can grow production at greater than 20% CAGR while investing only $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in CapEx each year. That equates to approximately $30 million of CapEx for every 1,000 BOE per day of wedge production in the first year. Achieving this capital intensity metric represents a 50% improvement from our previous performance. Simply put, our development program is producing more oil with less cost.","The sustainability of our low capital intensity will be grounded in replenishing our low breakeven inventory by realizing the full potential of our high-quality reservoirs through subsurface engineering, technology advancements, and thoughtful infrastructure design. In 2017, we are targeting a 400-plus well increase in our less than $50 breakeven projects, which is about three times our 2017 drilling pace. We believe our Permian Resources capital intensity differentiates us from most of our peers and will allow us to grow production and generate free cash flow by 2018. With the reinvestment of the South Texas proceeds, we're now on track for the 30% CAGR case. However, we will continue to assess the pace of our development program to ensure alignment with overall corporate objectives.","Turning to our Greater Sand Dunes area on slide 17, we continue to see improvements in our Bone Spring program. On previous calls, we've highlighted our top-tier Second Bone Spring program, but our Third Bone Spring and Wolfcamp XY wells are also yielding play-leading results. We've optimized our well design and landing zone and expect to see continued improvement in returns as we get more oil and drill longer wells. In Q2 we will drill six total Third Bone Spring and Wolfcamp XY wells that utilize existing facilities and contribute to the value-based low capital intensity growth. Given the number of proven high-quality benches, New Mexico will continue to reduce its capital intensity and progress to multi-bench development, where we will realize more than a $10 breakeven reduction, as secondary benches can utilize many of the previous investments from the primary bench. We currently operate two rigs in the Greater Sand Dunes area and can reach five operated rigs by year end.","Moving to slide 18, in our Greater Barilla Draw area, we're operating three rigs and will add two additional rigs in the second quarter. We continue to progress the detailed subsurface characterization in mapping in Red Bull South to ensure we maximize value while also working the surface constraints to drill longer laterals. In the short time we've operated Red Bull South, we've reduced the completion cost by 23% while improving well productivity.","In the Lockridge area of the Greater Barilla Draw, we performed a Wolfcamp A and Bone Spring spacing test. The wells are achieving type curve, but we found a new landing zone option that we expect to improve future results and add significant value to future development. We expect to exit the year with approximately four to five rigs in the Greater Barilla Draw area.","Slide 19 demonstrates where our value-based development is yielding great results in two benches at our Merchant area in the Midland Basin. The teams were able to optimize the landing zone and well design of the Wolfcamp B, which resulted in more oil and a significant increase to the economics of the program. The better well productivity, long laterals, and cost improvements have yielded two development benches with all-in breakevens under $40. We currently have two rigs in Merchant and will average two rigs for the remainder of the year in the Midland Basin.","On slide 20, I'd like to introduce a new development technology we call single-location sequenced laterals, or SL2. This is an example where we leveraged our experience with multi-laterals in the Middle East to innovate the unique lower-cost design for onshore unconventional application. The technology will allow us to operate multiple benches in a field at lower full-cycle cost. We believe this technology, which is licensed to OXY, will drop secondary bench breakevens by approximately $5 a barrel. We successfully completed first multi-lateral in December 2016 and are designing many of our new wells to support the technology for future reentry. While we will continue to pilot the technology in 2017, we expect the development application to be in the 2018-plus timeframe, when second and third benches are more predominant in the development program.","On slide 21, our logistics and maintenance hub, located in Eddy County, New Mexico, features a transloading facility capable of handling three unit trains of frac sand with 30,000 tons of storage capacity. In addition to frac sand, the logistics hub is also designed to handle hydrochloric acid from OxyChem, oil country tubular goods, and to provide a base for maintenance and support of strategic drilling and completion services. This project represents alignment of top-tier industry partners leveraging their strengths to remove cost inefficiencies from the overall value chain.","In addition to economic benefits, this approach provides us with a secured supply of critical materials as well as distribution channels. With the sand supply tightening and existing terminal space being contracted, this project secures OXY's ability to execute our development program in southeast New Mexico without concern for scarcity of supply. This provides OXY the benefit of backward integration, with each partner managing their corresponding core businesses to remove the operational and business risks associated with the conventional vertical integration model.","Based on the win-win value assessment for OXY and our partners, we're evaluating options for additional logistics and maintenance hubs in the Greater Barilla Draw and the Midland Basin. Our efforts in the Permian Basin are a clear example how through differentiated value-based approach generates growth and value through a sustainable competitive advantage and differentiates us from our peers.","I'll now turn the call back over to Chris Stavros for guidance.","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks. With respect to guidance, we expect our full-year 2017 companywide production growth from ongoing operations and adjusted for the sale of South Texas to be in the range of 4% to 7% or between 595,000 to 615,000 BOE per day. This is unchanged adjusted for South Texas relative to what we said historically. This includes a modest impact of OPEC quota constraints and volume effects under our production sharing contracts due to higher oil prices. Our long-term production growth expectations remain at 5% to 8% per year.","As a result of increased drilling activity later in the year, we expect production in the Permian Resources to exit this year at a growth pace approximately 30% higher than year-end 2016 levels. For the second quarter, we expect a significant recovery in total company ongoing production volumes and in the range of 580,000 to 595,000 BOE per day. Production at Permian Resources is expected to be between 135,000 and 140,000 BOE per day in the second quarter. Every $1 per barrel change in WTI affects our annual operating cash flow by about $110 million.","In our Midstream business, we see a return to profitability, as we expect the second quarter to generate pre-tax income of between $5 million and $15 million. Foreign income from pipeline and other facilities should improve, as planned maintenance at Al Hosn and Dolphin was completed earlier in the first quarter. A large portion of the financial improvement in Midstream should be driven by wider oil price differentials between Midland and the Gulf Coast and partly as a result of rising production in the Permian Basin.","In Chemicals, we anticipate pre-tax earnings of about $200 million for the second quarter as a result of continued improvement in caustic soda prices and the benefit of operations from the new joint venture ethylene cracker. Looking forward, our Chemicals business is on a pace to generate approximately $250 million per quarter of free cash flow for the remainder of the year.","I'll now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard A. Jackson - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Okay. Thank you, Chris. Kate, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes, good morning and congratulations on the work on lowering breakevens. Maybe if I can talk about the dividend coverage. One of the numbers that helps when investors think about that is maybe the maintenance CapEx number, the CapEx to keep obviously your downstream units in operation and production flat. I don't know if you have an update on that, because obviously international costs are still deflating and the work you're doing in the Permian may have lowered that. So any color there would be helpful.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Ed, currently we're seeing about a $2.2 billion sustaining CapEx, but we do expect that to come down. We're seeing price improvements in international operations. We're also, as you've heard, still seeing significant improvements in our Permian Resources business so that we expect, as that capital intensity goes down, this will also decrease. But with our current situation, we're certainly less than $50 to be able to cover our sustaining capital and dividend.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then good color on the Chemicals. Thanks for that, that $400 million shift. The Midstream is improving, which is good to see. I don't know if you'd be able to hazard a guess at where you see mid-cycle Midstream earnings with the Permian perhaps closer to filling up the pipe sometime next year or 2019.","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think, Ed, certainly the arrows, as I said at the outset, the arrows are pointing in the right direction for that business as well. I think the differentials are suggesting that we see profitable periods for the remainder of the year, frankly, certainly in the second quarter and in the back half of the year as well. So if conditions continue to move in this direction as far as Permian production based on the rig adds that we've seen, it's, frankly, looking pretty good going even into \u2013 exiting this year and certainly going into next year as well.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So you'd figure that there may be some acceleration around that at that point because, obviously, some of it's related to contracts you have that need certain volumes to be hit.","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yes, we would be profitable in excess of any contracts we have in place.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Vicki, I'm not sure who wants to take this one, but I think you've talked about the Permian previously being self-funding in 2018 at around $50. With the higher level of activity, and obviously I think Jody had pointed to the higher end of the growth rate, what does that look like now? Are you still self-funding at $50 oil in 2018 with the higher activity?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Good morning, Doug. This is Jody. Even with the higher activity rate, all it does is push that timeframe out a few months in 2018. So the improvement in capital intensity really does help that timeframe for the Permian Resources breakeven.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I appreciate that. The question that continues to come up, obviously, is around the dividend despite your assurances around breakevens and so on. So I wonder, Chris, if you could address one specific issue, which is the roll-off of your Middle Eastern contracts in Qatar, I think 2017 and 2019, respectively. What is the status of those contracts? Is it a material free cash contribution? And just a general status update as to how that might affect the breakeven calculus as you move forward. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Doug, I'd like to start with that. We feel that we're in a good situation in Qatar. First, let me say we don't have anything rolling off in 2017. Actually, our ISND contract would be in October of 2019. But really what we're doing today in Qatar is, I believe, some of the best work that we've done anywhere in our company in a long time. I'm going to have Ken describe some of the things that we're doing there that give us some confidence that we would be able to extend that contract.","Saad al-Kaabi, the CEO of Qatar Petroleum, the thing that mattered to him most is that we add the most value possible for every dollar we invest in Qatar. We believe that with the success our teams are having there, that we're going to be able to meet his expectations. And our teams are working well to be able to share best practices, to help each other to accelerate some of the technical work and new technologies that we want to do. So we've actually established some things there that are different than being done anywhere offshore in the Middle East. That, along with the fact that we successfully negotiated the extension of the Block 9 contract in Oman, gives me a lot of confidence that we'll be able to continue.","I'll pass it on to Ken to give you some of the details around some of our activities.","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Good morning, Doug. It's Ken. Our approach is basically the same as the one we went with for the Block 9 extension. Our goal is to remain the partner of choice in Qatar. We're focused on technology, reputation, and operational excellence. Our new innovative wellhead platform designs, which provide drilling for about 50% cheaper than conventional Middle Eastern platforms with 40% more capacity, are in detailed design at the moment.","Our next-generation reservoir models for ISND and ISSD are nearing completion and showing positive results. And the combination of just these two aspects mean we can deliver the same reserves for less than half the cost than our previously submitted Phase 5 proposal. We're now starting to roll out OXY Drilling Dynamics and OXY lift, so we think we can make improvements on the Phase 5 performance. And we are already the low-cost operator in Qatar.","The last thing I'd really like to emphasize is last year offshore we hit zero recordable incidents and we've had none this year. That's really excellent worker safety performance in Qatar and one that I think that the team should be proud of. So we're very focused on this. We have regular meetings and we continue to improve month on month.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just to be clear, it sounds obviously you're \u2013 I can't help but think you're pretty optimistic about being able to extend the contract for a number of reasons. But could you quantify the free cash contribution in the current oil price environment, just to put that issue to rest?","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Doug, the best way I would put it is that the plan we have in place from the other assets, and as Vicki discussed certainly around the Permian, would more than make up for cash flow absence if that were to happen in Qatar, I think is what you're asking. It's something that I would view as immaterial relative to the total cash flow that the company generates. By that, I mean less than 5% of the total cash flow that the company generates. So I think that based on the plan that we just laid out, we can accommodate additional cash flow growth and opportunities from the assets that we've got to make up for any shortfall if that were to occur, but we don't think that will happen.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So sub-$200 million sounds about in the ballpark?","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","That's probably right. That's right.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, everybody.","Operator","And the next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. You guys are telegraphing a stronger commitment to a higher Permian growth rate exiting \u2013 I think it was 30%, which is at the high end of the range, in 2017, and you used operational momentum, asset sales, and balance sheet to support it. How do you think about the financial flexibility and willingness to support to continue to outspend if the commodity market remains challenging, or any thresholds? Specifically, you're stepping up as that market is backing off some.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Evan, we want to continue to grow Permian Resources. This is really a drive to continue to lower our cash flow breakeven for not only our growth capital but for additional opportunities in ways that we could use our cash. So currently, we'll continue to be active and aggressive with our development in Permian Resources.","We're going to fund that through resources that we have. And so in an oil price above $50, $50 or above, we're going to continue on this path to get to a lower breakeven for our growth capital as well. Now if commodity prices are not what we expect, we would certainly adjust our plans because we do have that flexibility. But at prices above $50 and above, we'll continue on our plan. And with what we see, we expect that this year we will average better than $50, and then next year will be we think even better than that.","Oil prices are doing pretty much what we expected them to do. We expected to see volatility early in the year. We expect to see that until inventories come down much further than they have so far. We do have contingency plans, but as of right now with what we see we'll continue aggressively on this path.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","And, Evan, this is Jody. I think that's the reason why we provided you the guidepost between the 20% and the 30% CAGR case to show you that even with growth there's some flexibility in the capital depending on commodity price.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. And I guess you're running the exit rate at 11 to 13 rigs, which is well above the 9-year average for 2018. It sounds like that's something you'll address as you go into that budgetary period.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Exactly.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Second question, you guys are talking about adding 500 locations to your sub-$50 Permian Resources inventory in 2017. Could you just provide color on what's driving the additions or where is the focus? Are these new locations or moving existing locations down the cost curve, or within that, the 350,000 acres that are in your portfolio, whether you don't have associated location counts? Any color on that program would be helpful.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Evan, good question. And you sound a little like Vicki. I give her 400, and she changes it to 500. It's 400-plus, but our stretch is bigger than that. It's really coming from multiple places. It's second and third bench development in existing areas, so taking benches that may not have been profitable and finding ways to make them profitable through either the lower capital intensity, the better production rate. It is some from the acreage outside of the core areas. But again, you've got to remember, our inventory is big in those core areas. So we're not just working one area; we're working both.","I think the other thing that really we see happening is wells \u2013 we're not adding wells in some cases, but we're moving them to the left in that inventory curve. So the breakevens are coming down, so really working all three areas.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","But, Evan, let me add. I do appreciate you driving up Jody's target.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It's at 600, right?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I was looking for that.","Operator","The next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. I guess I'd like to understand. As we think about some of the cash margin and the cash breakeven here, the sale of your South Texas assets, how does the cash margin on something like that compare to the reinvestment? I recognize it's not a sell yesterday, get the cash flow tomorrow kind of thing, but what's the general today to say Q1 next year thought process on something like that?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","What we looked at was the replacement ratio, which is 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is three-to-one for Resources production versus South Texas production. And with the funds, we've added sufficient rigs to be able to make up that difference and that cash flow within about five to six months.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's pretty nice cash payback?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yes, it is.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. And then a follow-up to an earlier question on the Midstream. The expectation is that as pipelines start to fill, you're able to recapture some of the differential in the Midstream, something that hasn't been the case over the last probably 18 months. But there's also a lot of expansion in the pipeline system going on. So I was just thinking. As we look to 2018, has some of that recapture potential slipped from 2018 and maybe into 2019, just any clarity you can offer there?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Currently the expansions haven't really occurred, so we're still seeing some benefit from that. Now we expect that through the rest of this year we'll see benefit. Going into 2019, it will depend on the growth trajectory within the Permian Basin, but we do expect significant growth. So we're right now anticipating continued improvement in our Midstream business because of that.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Any way to think about quantifying that though in terms of \u2013 I'm just really trying to think. There's typically a utilization level to think about, but then there's also the actual differential. Where are we today on utilization relative to where you think we need to be to start seeing you capture of that differential?","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think we're capturing it now. It's clear in our results. And that was, as I said in the prepared remarks, that was a large portion of the driver for the second quarter improvement. And based on how things are transitioning, it should potentially accelerate in the back half of the year. So I think you're seeing that.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, I'll follow up offline, but I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Hi. With respect to big data, could you be a little bit more specific about what you're doing? Is it for better frackability, better design in your wells? What specifically are you doing, and what kind of savings do you think it will bring you?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","John, this is Jody. It's really multiple areas. One of the first areas was a multi-variant analysis combining both geologic data and completion data to speed up the process of finding optimum frac designs.","We're utilizing analytics and OXY Drilling Dynamics. It's what we call OXY Drilling Dynamics 2, which is putting predictability of motor yields and motor performance into that program. It's around reservoir modeling, being able to take what we do as a very \u2013 just slower process for reservoir optimization using very robust models, we actually are using a low-resolution model that we can optimize the injectant more on a real-time basis. That applies in Mukhaizna for steam flood. It will apply to our water floods.","And then we will move to our CO2 flood. So these higher-cost injectants get optimized on a day-to-day basis. And I could just keep going here. The list is longer than the resources to tackle these, so we're putting them in priority order. We're really excited about what analytics can do to real step changes in our business going forward.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Then the next one for me is on your logistics hub. Is this enough for your intermediate-term growth, or will you be building another one down the line?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","So in southeast New Mexico, it's sufficient for our intermediate and long-term growth. There's quite a bit of capacity there. We also see it, as you mature in an area and you move off of the rapid growth and now you're into the day-to-day operating cycle, we have enough space there that you can start thinking about maintenance shops for pumping units and compressors. And so it migrates over time from a capital logistics and maintenance hub to an operating hub. And so we're looking in both Greater Barilla Draw and now in Midland to see what aspects of the Southeast New Mexico project make sense there.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning all. Thank you. Vicki, historically the company's differentiation, and you spoke about differentiation in your comments, has been the dividend and the growth in the dividend. I assume that the lower breakevens that you're talking about and everything else are ultimately aiming towards the growth in the dividend approximately in line with volume growth. Is that fair?","And could you also just repeat the free cash flow numbers from Chemicals? And, if you could, give us that number for the quarter? That would be all part of the same thought process. Thanks.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Paul. We're trying to drive our cash flow breakevens down just for that. What we want to do is be positioned to be able to resume significant growth of the \u2013 or maybe I should say moderate growth, not exactly the growth we've seen over the last 10 to 15 years prior to the downturn in the dividend, but we do want to grow the dividend at a meaningful rate. So that's the reason for this accelerated growth to get to a lower breakeven.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","And the Chemicals?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Rob?","Robert Lee Peterson - Occidental Chemical Corp.","Free cash flow from Chemicals should be in the range of about $750 million for the year.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","That's for this year and that could then be considered a run rate?","Robert Lee Peterson - Occidental Chemical Corp.","Plus the additional $75 million I described in the prepared remarks for the contribution full year of the cracker and the refrigerant plant.","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","The run rate, Paul, as I said, is $250 million for each quarter for the remainder of the year and then it accelerates into 2018.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. I just thought it actually bore repeating and I wanted to make sure I heard you straight. That's great. Thanks very much indeed.","Operator","The next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, hi. Good morning. My first question is just going back to the cash flow breakeven at $50 WTI. The slide was talking about including growth capital in the number. So I was wondering what total capital number you're using there. Would it be consistent with the $3.6 billion that you're talking about for this year, or a higher number?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Ultimately for 2018, the number would be higher. But on a run-rate basis, to provide the 5% growth would be somewhere in the $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion range.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So if I look at that slide then and I take $3.6 billion or something slightly higher and the dividend of about $2.4 billion, that would imply CFO of around $6 billion at $50 WTI. And, Chris, I know a couple quarters ago for this year you talked about I believe at $50 it's $4.5 billion. So I was just wondering what drives a one-third increase in the implied CFO to get to that breakeven.","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","What drives it higher is the better margins and better productivity and better wells that we're seeing in the Permian Basin, number one, better margins and the refocus of the capital that we've discussed today from South Texas and from other things going forward. What drives it is the improvement relatively versus several quarters ago in the Chemicals business. What drives it is the improvement in the Midstream business that we're seeing that we had not seen several quarters ago.","So there are several items that, frankly, have changed in a markedly better way that give us more confidence in our ability to generate that higher number going forward with the reinvestment and better conditions in some of the other businesses.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Last question, just the domestic OpEx number. Chris, I think it went from $13 billion to $14 billion for the year. I was just wondering. What was the main driver of higher domestic OpEx?","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, the main driver really is just reconstituting the number for the absence of South Texas going forward and a little bit higher prices for injectant CO2 prices. That's really it.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate some of the specifics on big data in response to the earlier question. I wanted to probe on what you think is uniquely going to be OXY here because I think beyond the secondary and tertiary recovery that has long been an OXY strength, it seems like you're confident in the ability to drive higher recovery rates from primary drilling versus peers. And I wanted to see what you think gets you to a superior recovery rate versus simply increasing recovery rate at a similar pace as your competitors.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Brian, this is Jody. At this point, probably not talking about what recovery mechanism might be the optimum. We've got experience everywhere, Ken's Mukhaizna field, the Qatar field, in our EOR business we find ways to get the most recovery out of these reservoirs economically. And so we believe the unconventional business is an incredible target because the recoveries in primary are so low. And so we believe OXY is uniquely positioned to find that extra 5% or 10% additional recovery and leverage the infrastructure investment we've already made in those fields.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And that is in part by the various types of data analytics that you mentioned in response to the earlier question that you think will end up being more proprietary?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think analytics plays a role there in accelerating your learning because you can do many things by analyzing the data quickly with different models that prevent you from having to do them with experiments or trials in the field. But it will be a combination of data analytics, field trials, laboratory work, research work that then point us to the right application of a technology, depending on which type of reservoir. Again, it all begins with the core understanding of the reservoir. Does the underlying rock fabric have some higher fraction of conventional fabric? Is it truly a source rock shale, very high organic? That application will be specific to the reservoir.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And then on the SL2, the multi-lateral wells, can you talk to the timeline for pilot results and what those pilots look like versus the schematic on slide 20?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We've completed our first one. We've drilled the second lateral, and the key part of that is we have stimulated the second lateral. So as the second lateral depletes, we're in the process of removing the frac string and then we'll put it on artificial lift. We'll do more of those this year. The real application of the technology plays out in 2018 and beyond because that's when you're doing your second and third bench development as a higher proportion of the program.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, one very quick one, Chris. Did you say earlier what you expect 2Q asset sale proceeds to be net after tax?","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We said \u2013 or I said that I expect the proceeds from South Texas to be nearly $600 million net after tax.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And the final question today comes from Doug Terreson of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, everybody. I just have a quick question on corporate governance and specifically your new documents, which indicated a little bit of a shift away from the returns-based metric that you've used historically in favor of payouts that are based on total shareholder return, which is pretty similar to that of your peers. And so when you consider the emphasis on returns and value in your materials and commentary today, which is pretty prominent, my question is was this change undertaken because returns and other measures appear to be consumed by total shareholder in your view, or is something else at work here, meaning why did we have the shift there?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We had a shift because it was really a situation where we wanted to ensure that we were still looking at the metrics with respect to how others are performing. In the cyclic industry that we're in, we're in a situation where returns were very much impacted, as you know, by oil prices. Now we're in a situation where we have internally targets for all of our executives that are based to some degree on a returns metric. Going forward, we expect to resume including the returns metric as a part of our performance management programs. And that will be because of the fact that we believe that in the situation that we're in today, we're now generating positive earnings. We'll generate again positive returns on capital employed. And that's always been something that's been important for us, and it will be and is today an internal metric.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, so it's as important as it's ever been, it sounds like.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","It is. That's why we've talked about it so much today. We're really building our business and we've gone through this whole process, this painful process I'll say of exiting 300,000 barrels a day to get us into a position where every dollar we spend goes for the highest possible return projects. Exiting the things that we did with the timing that we had has now given us the opportunity to grow production with the best possible quality assets. And you look at it, every asset we have today is generating double-digit returns on capital employed. And so we're better positioned now to take advantage of that, and our company is going to be able in the future to excel in that area.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","No, that's textbook. Thanks a lot.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Across the Delaware Basin, we delivered 26 of the top 100 wells on a six month cumulative oil production basis, while drilling nearly 7% of the total wells.","Our enhanced subsurface models enabled us to more precisely design the fracs and those top wells to use much less profit than the other wells in the top 100. Continually delivering the best wells enhances our position as a premier operator of shale in our industry. We're applying a proven targeted scientific approach to each development unit to optimize productivity at the lowest capital intensity to maximize reserves and returns.","We have implemented an oil hedging program for 2020 and have hedged 300,000 barrels per day, representing almost 40% of our combined company's oil production. Cedric will cover the details of a few minutes.","And we're pleased to welcome Robert Shearer to our Board. Bob joined our board on July 10th and brings valuable skills gained for more than three decades of investment experience and a track record of creating significant value for investors, with a focus on high quality dividend growth stocks. His commitment to dividends is consistent with our long term strategy.","We're also excited to have announced a new joint venture in the Midland Basin with Ecopetrol, one of our strongest and longest standing strategic partners. The acquisition of Anadarko increased our development potential in the Delaware Basin by more than 50% which extends our development horizon in the Delaware by at least another decade, as well as providing significant infrastructure synergies.","As we develop our Delaware operations to predominantly drive our production growth over the next few years, this joint venture is an excellent opportunity to bring forward the net present value of our Midland assets without sacrificing any of our current production or cash flow. The joint venture developed will develop 97,000 net acres of Oxy\u2019s Midland Basin properties.","Ecopetrol will pay $750 million in cash at closing, plus an additional $750 million of carried capital in exchange for a 49% interest in the new venture. Oxy will own a 51% interest and operate the joint venture. During the carry period, Ecopetrol will pay 75% of Oxy\u2019s share of capital expenditures allowing Oxy to accelerate our development plans in the Midland Basin where we currently have minimal activity.","We will also retain production and cash flow from our existing operations in the Midland. This transaction which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019 is just one example of the innovative ways through which we can maximize the value of our assets, while deleveraging.","We are pleased to have delivered another successful quarter, but at the same time, we're never satisfied and creating shareholder value continues to be our number one priority. As you can see on Slide 6, we have an unwavering dedication and long track record of returning cash to our shareholders.","I'll now hand the call over to Cedric who will walk you through our financial results and updated guidance.","Cedric Burgher","Thanks Vicki. For the second quarter, we reported core earnings of $0.97 per diluted share and earnings of $0.84 per diluted share as all of our business segments continue to perform well. The difference between reported and core income is due to onetime costs incurred with the Anadarko Trans acquisition. Also in the second quarter, we returned approximately $600 million of cash to shareholders through our dividend, and as Vickie mentioned, increased our dividend for the 17th consecutive year to an annual rate of $3.16 per share.","Over the past 17 years, our track record clearly demonstrates our commitment and ability to consistently grow our dividend and to ensure returning capital to our shareholders remains a top priority.","Oil and gas core income increased in the second quarter, compared to the prior quarter reflecting higher crude oil prices and volumes partially offset by lower domestic natural gas prices and a negative non-cash mark-to-market adjustment on carbon dioxide purchase contracts.","We are very pleased to have lowered our operating costs on a per barrel basis across the board, both year-over-year and compared to last quarter. These cost improvements reflect higher volumes, improved downhole maintenance costs, and lower energy and surface operations costs. So a big congrats to our field operations teams, who continue to excel and lead the industry with low cost operations.","Total second quarter reported production of 741,000 BOEs per day exceeded guidance due to continued best-in-class execution and well productivity and Permian Resources, which exceeded guidance at 289,000 BOEs per day and International production exceeded guidance at 295,000 BOEs per day, driven by increased production in Colombia, due to new exploration wells coming online.","OxyChem surpassed the guidance with income of $208 million for the second quarter. Income decreased from the prior quarter primarily due to lower realized caustic soda prices along with fees received under a pipeline easement agreement executed in the first quarter.","Our midstream business came within guidance with the second quarter income of $331 million. The Midland MEH differential of approximately $9 also came within guidance for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter, marketing results improved as the second quarter did not have the significant negative mark-to-market adjustment that impacted the first quarter.","The increase in midstream income was partially offset by lower gas processing income due to planned domestic gas plant maintenance. Slide 9 details our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2019.","For the third quarter, we expect Permian Resources growth to slow, compared to the substantial production increase realized in the second quarter. This change is related to execution efficiencies, accelerating our time to market in the second quarter, along with the timing of several significant section developments in the second half of 2019.","As a reminder, we entered 2019 at a higher capital run rate and will begin to reduce activity during the second half of the year. Full year international guidance remains unchanged, but we expect lower international production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to maintenance in Qatar and Abu Dhabi.","On a full year basis, Oxy remains on track to spend within our capital budget of $4.5 billion while delivering annual production growth of 9% to 11%. Finally I like to mention our new hedging program that we have executed for 2020. As most of you know, Oxy has not historically hedged production, except when we have completed a major acquisition such as when we acquired Vintage Petroleum.","With the additional leverage from the Anadarko acquisition, these new hedges will strengthen our 2020 cash flow in a low oil price environment, and provide additional assurance that our dividend is safe while we are deleveraging.","I'll now turn the call back over to Vicki.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you, Cedric. Now I'd like to share how Oxy is uniquely positioned to extract the most value from this acquisition by applying our core competencies across the combined portfolio to maximize shareholder value.","We have proven ability and decade\u2019s long track record of innovatively recovering more hydrocarbons from conventional reservoirs than others could. We are continually improving and maximizing efficiencies and recovering hydrocarbons through water flooding and enhanced oil recovery.","Today, we routinely recover more than 60% of the oil from large Permian conventional reservoirs and sometimes reach almost 70% recovery. Doing this cost effectively has required the development of extensive automation, advanced methods of artificial lift and materials expertise, as well as downhole subsurface expertise. These tools will serve us well to maximizing recovery from other less mature assets. This is a competitive advantage for us in the future.","More recently, we have applied a differentiated approach to utilizing advanced technologies and data analytics to further improve our expertise in shale development. The resulting breakthrough techniques in our shale developments are delivering record setting high return wells in our core Delaware basin areas.","This success is transferable to the development of shale assets across our Permian acreage and also in other basins. Additionally, we're applying our technical expertise to developing a business model that will position us as a world leader in the capture and use of anthropogenic CO2 for enhanced oil recovery. We are investing in technologies that will not only lower our cost of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery in our Permian conventional reservoirs, but will also bring forward the application of CO2 enhanced oil recovery to shales across the Permian, D.J. and Powder River basins, and in our conventional reservoirs in our international locations.","Current industry practices recover only around 10% or less of the oil from unconventional reservoirs. Improving recovery from shale is a huge opportunity for the future, and we have the expertise to be the leader.","And as you can see on Slide 13, our expected financial metrics following the acquisition show how our value proposition and ability to return excess cash to shareholders has been significantly strengthened.","We've added low cost, future barrels, in our inferred 2021 free cash flow yield based on today's share prices industry leading, and we'll have the ability to expand our cash margin considerably.","Combining Oxy and Anadarko will create a diverse portfolio of high quality and complementary assets, well suited for our core competencies. As we apply our development approach to the combined portfolio, we expect this to be the low cost producer in all of the areas we operate.","For example, along with the expertise I've already mentioned, we will apply our proprietary drilling process, Oxy drilling dynamics across Anadarko acreage. To date, oxy drilling dynamics has reduced costs by at least 30% and all of the areas that we've applied it, and we expect to achieve similar results in Anadarko\u2019s onshore and offshore developments.","Most importantly, we believe that along with incredible assets, this acquisition provides us the opportunity to combine great employees, best practices and innovative technologies from each company to ultimately deliver best-in-class returns for our shareholders.","We are looking forward to the best practices that the Anadarko employees will bring to our operations and this is upside we haven't yet taken into account. As a combined company, I believe we will have the best quality assets of any company in our industry where in all the areas we operate, we have a competitive advantage due to our scale and\/or our unique operating and development expertise.","Investment in any of our operating areas will deliver double digit rates of return, and our portfolio will be lower risk as most of our production and future growth potential will be in the U.S. and our international operations are in areas where we have established operations and long term valued partners.","We are a leading operator in the Delaware Basin and are continuing to widen our lead. The Anadarko acreage is perfectly positioned in the heart of the basin directly between our New Mexico and Texas Barilla Draw areas. This proximity to our existing operations will allow us to apply our proven strategies and technologies directly to the new acreage.","Our Geomechanical and petrophysical workflows result in customized development plans to maximize the value captured in each section, and we can't wait to roll out these workflows to unlock additional upside with the new -- with our new Anadarko teammates. Furthermore, the Anadarko acreage is well positioned to utilize our Aventine logistics hub, which will maximize supply chain supply chain savings and our development.","Slide 17 reinforces our subsurface expertise and unique development approach that enabled us to deliver 26 of the top 100 wells based on a six-month cumulative oil production, and 20 of the top 100 wells based on twelve-month cumulative oil production.","I'd like to highlight these results that they're pulled directly from public sources with no data manipulation. All of Oxy\u2019s wells on the six month chart with at least 12 months of data are also on the 12 month chart. There are a number of additional wells on the six month chart that we expect to enter the first year cumulative chart once -- once they've been online for a full year.","These tremendous results were accomplished all while using less profit than other operators and resulting in significant capital savings, and again while only drilling 7% of the total Delaware basin wells.","Turning to Slide 18, I want to emphasize the specific improvements in our Permian Resources businesses that are adding significant value. In 2019, we continue to enhance our subsurface expertise with the creation of the next gen frac models to allow for customized well designs that optimize landing and development spacing while resulting in minimal parent child impacts.","Our teams have a relentless focus on utilizing our industry leading data to develop a deep understanding of the subsurface, which leads to the highest economic value per acre. Our subsurface modeling is now predictive, and through calibration can be applied to other basins to unlock additional value and performance improvements.","Highlighting this continued progress, our Permian Resources 90-day cumulative oil production has improved 22% year-to-date from 2018, and 220% from 2015. The record setting well that I mentioned earlier is noted on Slide 19, and had a peak 24 hour rate of 9,495 BOE per day.","Following these tremendous improvements in capability, we expect that our combined Permian business will be cash flow positive in 2020 at a WTI price of $45. As I mentioned earlier, our low carbon business strategy will play a key part in reducing our enhanced oil recovery cost in our conventional reservoirs, which will increase our inventory of conventional CO2 EOR projects.","In addition, it will help to make CO2 projects in our unconventional resources possible and profitable. Our conventional and unconventional CO2 projects will lower our carbon footprint, and will enable us to help other companies lower theirs as well. It's important to note too, that our low carbon business is also aggressively working with all of our operations to reduce all greenhouse gases, not just CO2.","On Slide 21, you'll find our near-term cash flow priorities for our combined company. The two highest priorities will remain unchanged and those are first to maintain our low cost production base, and second, to sustainably grow our dividend per share. We've kept these two highest priorities for more than 17 years.","And currently, our next priority is to deleverage. While we expect to achieve this through asset sales, we want to assure you that we will shift cash from our capital program to debt reduction if we are not meeting our internal divestiture targets. However, with that said, we do expect to our asset sales will meet our targets, which will enable us to grow our production by 5%. We won't resume share repurchases until our deleveraging goal is complete. As Cedric highlighted, we can and will protect our dividend in the event of any potential commodity price pressures, including, during the transition phase of our integration.","In 2020, if we are in a low $40 dollar WTI price environment, we will be able to cover our dividend with hedges in place, and keep production flat with capital spending of $4.8 billion while remaining cash flow neutral. In 2021, our break even position gets back down to $40 WTI with an unhedged position. And as we continue to grow cash, it will drop below $40 WTI.","We're confident in our plan because we have the track record to back it up, we completed a similar program in the second quarter of 2018 and finished six months earlier than originally planned.","As you may have heard us say before in the downturn when others chose to cut or eliminate their dividends or pay a script, we executed a breakeven plan to continue to grow and strengthen our dividend. We did not reduce our dividend then, and our robust cash flow generation will protect and grow our dividend now and going forward.","And if prices go up, our combined company will have significant cash flow generating potential, for every dollar movement in oil prices, we will generate $255 million incremental in additional annual cash flow.","In 2021 with our CapEx estimate at $6.6 billion and annual production growth of 5%, we will generate significant excess cash flows. Anadarko's shareholder vote is scheduled for August 8 and we anticipate closing the transaction as soon as possible thereafter.","Following the transition, transaction close we will ensure that our employees continue to operate our assets with an unyielding focus on safety and operational excellence. We will begin executing our 100-day plan to bring our two companies together to create one culture, that emphasizes collaboration and delivering results.","We have set targets to reduce capital spending by $1.5 billion, capture $2 billion in annual cost reductions and deliver $10 billion to $15 billion in asset sales to reduce debt.","We've already begun delivering on these targets and we'll provide updates during the remainder of the year. By 2021, we will fully achieve our annual synergy targets, but the gains this transaction will bring to our shareholders will not stop in 2021. While there are those that focus on the short term, our commitment to you our shareholders is long-term value creation and it drives everything we do.","As we measure our success over the long term, we will have created a company with ample opportunities to efficiently allocate capital from a position of strength, across our portfolio with sector-leading returns.","We will have reduced our debt level, strengthen our balance sheet and will be positioned to return even more cash to shareholders.","In summary, our combined company will have incredible people, with the technical expertise to operate and develop a unique set of high quality short to medium cycle assets, they are perfectly positioned to ensure we can be the low cost operator.","The cash flow that our teams will generate from these assets will enable us to strengthen our value proposition to generate significant returns on our capital investment, along with return of capital to our shareholders.","We will initially accomplish that with continued dividend growth, and with a more consistent share buyback program, after de-levering. This combined with our differentiated Low Carbon Strategy, will ensure our success and sustainability long into the future.","In closing, I believe we have a bright future ahead of us at Occidental and there is much to look forward to as we integrate our combined companies, and continue to focus on delivering enhanced value for our shareholders.","We'll now open it up for your questions related to our second quarter results and our acquisition of Anadarko.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Good morning, Vicki.","Vicki Hollub","Good morning.","Doug Leggate","Vicki on page 23 of your slide deck, I don't know if you should take the 6.6 billion as a capital guide, but it looks like that at least gives us an idea of how to frame our thoughts going forward. So that, if the combined company is doing closer to 9 billion, even adjusting for the African assets, that still suggests that the combined capital is already falling on your plan by substantially more than the 1.5 suggested.","So I just wondered if you could speak to that, and related maybe speak to how the capital allocation on what you're thinking about as a preliminary thought, particularly in the Permian Basin. I've got a follow-up.","Vicki Hollub","Yes. The combined capital was 9 billion, and we had committed to reduce activity levels to what would be the equivalent of $1.5 billion. But when you consider the synergies that we will achieve, that gets that 7.5 down closer to 6.6, as we achieve our $900 million of capital synergies.","Doug Leggate","So in terms of how that gets allocated in the Permian. Well, let me explain what's behind my question. To drop activity, the working interest that Anadarko had was only 40% on the acreage. So clearly dropping a rig there has a much lower impact on capital than dropping a rig in Oxy but then Oxy has much better wells. So I'm trying to think about how do we think about relative activity within that capital budget in the Permian Basin.","Vicki Hollub","Well, we view it from an investment level, not a rig count per se. So if you're developing on wells that have a lower working interest for you, then that's just more wells, you're going to drill, potentially more wells you'll run but you'll get the same synergies. So we look at it from an investment standpoint, not from a rig level standpoint.","Doug Leggate","I understand, but presumably you'll give us greater details on that as we go forward. My follow-up is obviously this deal with Ecopetrol looks extremely capital efficient. Line of sight on asset monetization\u2019s. I wonder if you could share any additional thoughts and specifically, obviously, everyone myself included, is still quite focused on how you deal with the midstream of WES not least because it's giving you a better than $600 million income right now from the unit distributions. So any updated thoughts on those and I\u2019ll let someone else jump on\u2026","Vicki Hollub","Thanks, Doug. I'd say that from an overall perspective, the good, the other good, really good thing about this portfolio is that we do have a lot more levers to pull with the combination of OXY and Anadarko in terms of monetizations. So there are some things that we can do, the joint venture with Ecopetrol was one example of how we can do something creative without negatively impacting ourselves.","So we will look at those kind of opportunities and with respect to WES, we'll have to after close, when we can take a deeper dive into what's happening there. We can make some analysis of that, but I'll say that the good thing about it and the reason we're so confident about our asset divestitures, is that we have a lot of incoming calls about various things. And so we're able to -- we'll be able to high grade what we want to do over time. The difficulty we have right now is that we can't signal really what we want to do, because that would, that would compromise our ability to negotiate.","Doug Leggate","Can you confirm the press speculation about whether or not you had hired an advisor on WES?","Vicki Hollub","We always use advisors and so we have some advisors that are helping us with various things. So I think it's -- I think that as we look at lots of aspects of our business we'll be bringing in advisors to get their feedback. That should not signal anything in particular that we're thinking right now because we have no decision made, on that.","Doug Leggate","Understood. Thanks so much, Vicki.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Devin McDermott","Good morning and congrats on the solid results.","Kenneth Dillon","Good morning.","Devin McDermott","I wanted to start by actually following up on one of Doug's questions, just on synergies and also some of the activity in capital reductions. With the deal closing now potentially next week, it\u2019s earlier than the initial target. So I was wondering if you could address how, if at all, that impacts the timing of synergy realization versus the initial plan, and also on the 1.5 billion reduction in growth spending, how quickly post close can that occur? Is that something that happens fairly immediately or will it be staggered over time and where were those reductions occur? If you can provide some guidance on that.","Vicki Hollub","So we're going to meet our capital plan for this year. So, we'll meet the $4.5 billion for ourselves this year, we'll have to after close look at what's happening with Anadarko to determine what we do with the rest of their spending for the year. But the real-- the full $1.5 billion capital reduction in activity level will come in 2020.","And I would say that, that getting that really depends on what we see after close and certainly the acceleration of the closing date is going to help us get a jump-start on our synergies. We had committed to 1 billion in synergies in 2020.","So being able to do you get started here before the end of August, when initially we thought it could be a much later than that that's going to be very helpful for us.","Devin McDermott","Got it. Great. And then my second question's actually on the OpEx side, just for Oxy stand-alone. You had some nice reductions quarter-over-quarter there, and it looks like some of the drivers are a mix between lower downhole maintenance and lower energy costs.","I just wonder if you could comment a bit, in a bit more detail on what's driving those cost reductions, opportunities for further cost reductions over time and how initiatives like utilizing solar power in the EOR business might drive cost down going forward as well.","Vicki Hollub","Yes, so our Resources business has been continuing to drive down OpEx as they get better with the artificial lift, the artificial lift in these shale wells was really challenging early on because it's too deep to make being pumping optimized. So too deep for that, too shallow, and the fluid production, a little bit too challenging for ESPs. So our team has worked really, really hard to find the right kind of artificial lift to use, and how to optimize it.","And as they do that they are beginning to get much better at selecting the right kind of lift, and lowering the cost on that and of course, energy helps. And with respect to the EOR business in the US, it's our biggest cost one of our two biggest cost in the EOR business is the purchase of CO2 and energy in general.","So, with respect to CO2 our Low Carbon business strategy is certainly going to help there because we're going to be able to ultimately install net power in the Permian Basin, which will further reduce our electrical cost, while also supplying a pure stream of CO2 for use in our operations.","So once we get that -- start installing that in the Permian that will help a lot, but in the interim, we put in some solar already and plan to install a little bit more over the next year or so, and the solar is really good to reduce OpEx in our EOR operations and it reduces it at the most expensive part of the cycle.","So that's very helpful. So it's going to take a combination of things over time to continue to reduce it, but we do have a strategy to do it, and I believe that that's going to be one of the key drivers to helping us start to take off for the growth in the EOR business in about 3 or 4 years.","Devin McDermott","Alright Great, thanks so much.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Coming back to some of your comments Vicki, about the ability to evaluate the acreage, decide where you want to move forward, just curious how, how long it takes to do that?","And as a second part, or the second question really, if we look at what's happening with some of the other players in the Permian today, if you could give us a little bit of an idea, tying that evaluation, into the performance you've had and how you've been able to avoid some of these problems we're seeing, the too much well density, or the parent-child issues all that just maybe one big wrapper there, around that whole package.","Vicki Hollub","Okay. Certainly, I appreciate the question. But let me -- let me address the OpEx one more point on that. I forgot to give kudos to Anadarko because there, they've really manage their OpEx well, they have a low OpEx and they are apparently doing a really good job to manage that. So the combination bringing that expertise in to us, for the types of wells that they're operating will be helpful too.","But to your question, it's going to take us a little bit of time, because what we have to do, the way we do our business to our subsurface characterization is, we drill appraisal wells and that helps get us some data, so we get some petro-physical and geophysical data from the logs that we run when we drill the well.","We take that data and we combine it with our 3D data -- 3D seismic data, combining those two, then we can perform data analytics on it, and with the data analytics now, we can take that even a step further with a paradigm shift, we had a couple of years ago, on how to look at the subsurface differently, with respect to how the frac is going to be perform in the zone as you're trying to pump it. So not to say too much about that, but that's, but we went through that process to get us to where our productivity was a couple of years ago or about a year and a half ago.","Now what we've done is, we've been able to incorporate 4D frac designs, which is helping us to more accurately understand what's happening with the frac and then not only what's happening with the frac, but what's happening with the drainage area.","And that's all really key to spacing and how you design your wells, where you land your wells and all of that. So our subsurface models are much more sophisticated today than they were about three or four, five years ago, and the kudos on that go to our subsurface teams that have worked it really hard, but also our business unit who watch these wells every day, figure out what's happening with them and collaborate with our subsurface team to really get down to trying to figure out what's happening in the subsurface.","We've seen some operators that just do this on a statistical basis deal, but you really can't do that and optimize what you get from these wells and the value of these wells. This -- this takes a lot of science and it takes science that -- it goes beyond what we've ever had to do with conventional reservoirs.","So the companies that that only drill conventional reservoirs around the world-they haven't dealt with what we are having to deal with here, from a complexity standpoint. We've conquered that, but it's taken a lot of data to do it. It's taken some patience and time, and it's taken getting it to the point where you know it's working, because now we can, and we're predictive with that we can blind wells that we've drilled in the past and run the model and the model will tell us --will match what we're seeing from the wells that we're producing.","That's why we're very confident that this model, what we're using now will not only work in other areas outside the Delaware Basin, but in other basins. That's why we're very comfortable that in the D.J. and in the Powder we're going to see increased productivity there, based on the model that we're using.","And we think it takes a lot of science and it takes patience so that's why we've said that some of our synergies we can't get in 2020, some of our synergies are going to come in 2021, because we're not going to spend dollars to do trial and error. We're really going to need to have our model and then that's going to take drilling some appraisal wells, and making sure that we have the 3D to match it, and the data analytics around it, but that's why it's going to take a little time to get all the synergies. But we're very confident that we'll get the synergies. Jeff, do you have anything to add to that?","Jeff Alvarez","Hi, Roger. The only thing I'd add, Vicki did a great job covering that, but I think, and you know this that is our secret sauce. So I mean we've been like Vicki said, advancing that for years now and not only is it our secret sauce. It's a secret sauce worth having, and because of the value that it creates and I mean a couple of things that she hit on, I think are really important to stress, not just the integration of the work close with geo-modeling, geo-mechanics, petro-physics, stimulation, reservoir simulation, but it's really the combination of the people, tools and data, because the thing we get asked all the time by other people is, how easy is it replicated.","And I think the important thing is, if you remove one of those things, the people, the tools or the data, the other two don't work is optimal as they will, if you have them altogether. So that's why we show on Slide 18, 19 and the performance results. It's not just one thing that goes there you need all of those ingredients to really extract the value, that's what makes us so excited when we look at other reservoirs and being able to apply it because we think it definitely works, not just in the Wolfcamp or the Bone Springs, but in all unconventional reservoirs.","Roger Read","Thanks, build a better mousetrap and you win. Congratulations.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Will Atkinson of UBS. Please go ahead.","Will Atkinson","Good afternoon. I was wondering if we could touch on the rationale for a joint venture, rather than a complete divestiture, especially given the depth of your inventory across the Delaware.","Vicki Hollub","Yes. The reason for a joint venture, is we like the acreage in the Midland Basin, it's quality acreage, quality assets, and we think over time. Again, we haven't built us into our near-term model and we didn't include it in the --in how we evaluated this acquisition. But the upside over time is to use our enhanced oil recovery to get more of the reserves and resources out of the wells.","So we are preserving our opportunity to get significant upside in the Midland Basin, through the application of CO2 enhanced oil recovery ultimately, and we think the more that we have of this, the more upside that we have over time and that we believe will give us an edge into the future on being able to get more out of existing wells rather than having to go drill new wells.","Will Atkinson","Perfect. Thank you.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov","Yes, thanks for taking the question. As you think about deleveraging, obviously the Ecopetrol deal marks the first step. Are you seeing other instances of this kind of rather unusual model, where a player that may not be in a particular geography that you're operating in, is going to rely on you for skill set development and sort of that kind of active partnership beyond simply selling acreage.","Vicki Hollub","Well you are giving me an exciting opportunity to talk about our low carbon business strategy and that, we are getting calls from all over the world, with people wanting our help to -- to help them also figure out how to capture CO2 from industrial sources, and then what to do with it and oil reservoirs.","We have the processing capability, we have the ability to design it and we're the largest handler of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery in the world. So what's happening with these calls that we're getting for technical assistance is that, in some cases, there has been offers, allowing us to come in as a participant in the project, so these are not only opportunities to earn some revenue for our low carbon ventures business through technical providing -- technical services and valuations, but also to, to look at projects around the world for possible participation.","So that's one way. That's one unique and different thing that that we're seeing happening to our group now, and that's really exciting, because as we go forward, there's going to be more pressure on companies to do something about their climate change story, and so that's making a lot of people get much more interested in what we're doing than just a few years ago.","So that's one example. There -- we are always trying to look for ways to monetize things but without losing the potential eventual upside. So, we are getting creative and continuing to look at ways to do that.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. Well since you mentioned ESG, let me follow up on that. I could not help noticing that your U.S. realized gas price in the quarter was $0.23 obviously some kind of one time shifts in there, but the -- is there a point where you would, have to resort to flaring in the Permian, because the economics of selling the gas are just lopsided.","Vicki Hollub","We would not do flaring as a normal routine practice, we don't agree with that, and we wouldn't do it, so we will always try to find a way to utilize the gas and the net power concept that I just mentioned earlier, I should probably explain that a little bit better.","Our team, last year or maybe it was the end of the year before, invested in a new way to generate electricity and it's called NET Power. What it does is, it takes natural gas combines that with oxygen and burns it together, and that's what creates electricity and it creates that electricity at lower costs, especially if you are using gas that cost like $0.10 or $0.15 or $0.20, which gives us this great opportunity because we're piloting that now, we have a pilot project where part-owner. We've invested in it and we are strategic partner to eight rivers, the group that developed the concept and put the pilot in place to start it.","It's, it's in -- the pilot is just South of Houston here. So that's one of our solutions, is to put that in the Permian. It will utilize our gas that that if we sold it would make nearly as much. So it will, not only will it give us a way to utilize that lower-cost gas. It also, as I said earlier, provides that pure stream CO2 off of it, for use in our enhanced oil recovery. So it's a dual benefit of having a way to better utilize our lower priced gas, and also create the opportunity to you CO2 to increase our oil production.","It's a really unique way of dealing with the scenario that we have in the Permian that we expect to be able to have that installed over the next two, three years. It's a little bit out, but in the near term, we don't see that we're going to have to flare. We have the capability to get it out it's just that it's certainly there. There are other ways to better utilize our gas and to get more value for it then selling it for $0.23.","Jeff Alvarez","Hey, Pavel one other thing I'd add to Vicki's comment. EOR, so injecting we've been advancing EOR not just with CO2 but also hydrocarbon gas. And the cheaper the hydrocarbon gas, the better the economics get for EOR because you're basically replace and oil for gas. So that's another thing, we continue to advance, so that you don't flare. But you can extract value from.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. Very useful. I Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresh","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. First, Vicki you made a comment in your prepared remarks, you expect a combined Permian business to be free cash flow positive at $45 WTI in 2020. So I was just wondering, for a little more detail on that, first part would be is that including EOR or is it just more of the standalone Resources business.","And then, what level of rig count and CapEx and just underlying details to help us think about that in the context of this overall CapEx reduction plan that you have, through 2021. Thanks.","Vicki Hollub","So in 2021, it would be the Resources business and it's at the capital level that we projected for 2020. So that would be capital for us and 2020 would be at the $6.6 billion -- have we given -- any additional. Okay. So the run rate of the 6.6, the actual 6.6 is in 2021.","Phil Gresh","Right. So you are going from 9 billion to 6.6 and I think you said in 2020 you expect Permian Resources to be free cash flow positive at 45. Correct?","Vicki Hollub","That's correct.","Phil Gresh","Okay. And so I would be an equivalent level of cap, Resources' CapEx baked into the 6.6 to get to that.","Vicki Hollub","Right, let's say the 7.5; make sure you use the run rate of 7.5% before the synergies of 900 million, which will be fully achieved in 2021.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Okay, got it. Second question, I guess just on the balance sheet, Cedric any latest thoughts here. I think your target all along has been to get to sub 2 times. You've given numbers with and without WES obviously you announced the JV today but any new thoughts there about how quickly you can get to that leverage level and what other levers you might be wanting to pull to get there? Thank you.","Cedric Burgher","Yes. Thanks, Phil. The asset sales obviously are the primary lever there. We've given you kind of a timeline of 12 to 24 months, we think will be on the early side of that. So, and then also as Vicki mentioned earlier, we have expect to have excess free cash flow and if need be, if we for whatever reason hit a snag we direct more of that than planned to delever, is at the very top of our list of priorities. We don't expect to need to do that. We think that that they asset sales will get us there and get us there fairly quickly.","These things don't happen overnight, but. But we think we can easily get there in the timeline, we've allotted. The second thing I would say is that our target, we've said that 1.5 times debt-to-EBITDA that $60 oil WTI by the end of 2021 is kind of our target and base plan, and we're not going -- we're not going to stop there, that is we know for our weight class, we have too much debt, it's our highest priority to knock it down. We have the means to do it. We have a lot of levers, we can pull and so we're going to aggressively do that and we're not stopping at the end of 2021, but we expect to go through that, and get down too much even lower level -- leverage levels beyond that time.","So we expect to basically be back to where we are, or better from a credit metric standpoint prior to the acquisition.","Phil Gresh","Okay, thank you.","Cedric Burgher","Yes.","Operator","The next question will come from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. I had a follow-up actually, just a series of questions with regards to slide 18, given the strong productivity gain shown there in every year but particularly 2019. The first is, if we looked at this on an oil only basis with the gap between 2018 and 2019 look the same, second, what do you see as the longevity to continue to drive productivity gains on Oxy space assets and, third is, what is your base case I realize is an appraisal process to that you need to go through, but what is your base case for how Anadarko well performance and well costs will ultimately compare relative to Oxy's?","Vicki Hollub","I'll take the second one. And I'm going to toss first two to Jeff. We really haven't gotten into their specific data well enough to know, we see the results of the wells, but what we want to do is dive a little deeper, see what data they have, and do our full analysis on it before we can answer a question like that but, we'll be doing that as quickly as we can. And fortunately, getting them to start doing that on a, on a deeper level here in about a week. So I'll pass it to Jeff.","Jeff Alvarez","Hey, Brian. I think I got your first question was, what would it look like on a oil basis? It would look roughly the same. And the reason I would say that is, if you look at our, our oil cuts for Permian Resources over the last 2.5 years -- we've range from about 59 to 62. This year we've been right around 60, last year, we were 61 to 62, the year before we are just a hair below 60, so that's the kind of variability you get on total resources oil cut. So it wouldn't materially impact that curve when you look at it.","Now obviously this year has been a percentage point or so less and that's just a function of where we're drilling different reservoirs that have different gas oil ratios with them, it's not anything that's problematic or something we didn't expect. It's just where we're developing.","Brian Singer","Great, thanks.","Jeff Alvarez","And then what was your other question, Brian. I'm sorry","Brian Singer","The second one was the longevity to continue to drive productivity gains. Just on the Oxy assets. In other words, how many more years in the tank do you think you have faced in the processes of that you've, the technologies that you've talked about.","Jeff Alvarez","Yes, again, I mean, this one is so hard. It is, it's always difficult to know, we can see what the teams are advancing. I mean, every time we talk to the teams working on advancing our performance, I just kept blown away at the things they're thinking about, and working on , like we talked about the 40 models that Vicki talked about, when you look at that our ability now to understand how frac geometry changes, not only in a single well over time, but how it changes in a multi-well section development over time. Two years ago I never thought we would be able to understand how frac geometry changes over time, or how wells would interrelate with each other given the time component.","Now that we can understand that, we're able to figure out better landings, better placements, better frac designs, that continue to propel the advancements. So I would answer it is, I don't know how we will improve next year, but I guarantee you that the teams are going to figure out how they continue to make well performance better, and they've done it every year since 2015 when we really started aggressive development.","So it's hard to believe that's going to stop any time soon. I think it will just come from different areas, different things will drive it, just like different things drove it from '15 to '16 and '17 to '18 and so on, but I do continue to think or we're going to get better and if you put this over and you focused on value instead of rate. I think that has even more running room than just rate and volume performance, but on the value side.","Brian Singer","Great, thanks. And then lastly on outside of the Permian, can you talk about any key learning\u2019s in the Anadarko, Gulf of Mexico are DJ Basin assets and any impacts that those have on your commitment to maintaining and retaining those assets in the going forward combined company, and on the capital and growth outlook there?","Vicki Hollub","Well, Ken's been very involved in that. We'll let Ken answer that one.","Kenneth Dillon","Yes, thanks. We're looking forward to operating again in the Gulf of Mexico. I think one thing I have to say, we're operating as two separate companies, at this time, but I think we're really pleased of our former asset Horn Mountain returning to Oxy again, we were involved with it since the Varstar days even before BP were involved in it. We always believed it had long-term potential.","So I think we're looking forward to the picking that up. I think our goal with Gulf of Mexico so far is to the deliver long-term stable cash flow through step wells close to the existing facilities. So very similar to Anadarko's approach and with Horn Mountain back I think we can see that potential running in for some time.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys just wanted to follow up a little bit on the asset sale. Topic here, just wanted to get a sense, has kind of OXY at this point really identified what they want to sell. I know obviously, you'll be price dependent on ultimately what you sell, but you feel like you kind of have your punch list, sort of down. And have you guys integrated the rating agencies as well in kind of some of these discussions, as you look to hit your leverage targets over time.","Vicki Hollub","I would say that we certainly, we have a punch list of things that we'd like to do, and that's why we want to keep that quiet for our negotiating power, but we do have a punch list and every now and then something comes up that that's unexpected and out of the ordinary and we look at those too. So that's why we're really encouraged that we'll be able to achieve our targets and Cedric will address the credit agencies.","Cedric Burgher","Yes, we've had, we've for years, but even especially this year had extensive ongoing dialog with our rating agencies. We have a confidential arrangement with them, so we're able to share a little more information. All I would really say though is that you --so they are very well-informed on our plans and you can see some of the actions we're taking to today. In fact, some of that information or news comes out, but what I would say is that we've got a longer list and we have needs and so we think we can easily achieve our plans and I think the agencies understand that.","Leo Mariani","Okay. And I guess just a brief follow-up to that, is there any update at all on the timing of the Africa sale and then additionally, Cedric obviously you got off the significant hedge. Are you guys considering other hedges for 2020, given that was portion of your production. But you still have significant remaining oil production unhedged?","Vicki Hollub","I'll take the Africa question, we really, until after close would we really can't make any comments on timing or anything like that, we'd prefer to get a little bit further down the road and we'll update you when we can.","Cedric Burgher","So on the hedging. We're very pleased with what we're able to pull off in actually a very short period of time I was skeptical, we'd be able to achieve what we've done. But as Vicki mentioned earlier in her prepared remarks, we've hedged just under 40% of our combined company oil volumes if you take a Anadarko's second quarter in our second quarter for oil volumes just under 30%, 40% there.","And then if you exclude PSC volumes for us, you get approaching almost 50% of our volumes hedged. If you look at not just in the second quarter basis, so very pleased with the position, not going to be speculative about future hedging doesn't help us to do that other than to say, we'll be opportunistic. I would expect this to be primarily focused on when we're in a more leveraged situation this is giving us a great deal of additional support in a low price environment, potentially in 2020.","But beyond kind of the deleveraging that we've talked about, we're not I'd expect us to kind of go back to the way we've been, which is a very little to no hedging but we'll be opportunistic and we could see ourselves putting on more hedges or possibly not doing that as well.","Leo Mariani","Okay, thank you.","Operator","In the interest of time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vicki Hollub for any closing remarks.","Vicki Hollub","Yes, I'd like to say thanks to the OXY employees for operating safely and delivering great results. And to say we're excited to bring on the Anadarko employees, looking forward to that and then it can't happen soon enough. Thank you all for your questions and for joining our call. Have a good day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"16453":["Occidental Petroleum Corp.

In just a moment, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Chazen, who will provide an updated outlook for 2015.

Steve, please go ahead.","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Chris. We've made progress towards our objectives for this year. Our principal goal for the year is to achieve cash flow neutrality where our operating cash flow covers both our capital spending and dividend outlays at $60 per barrel realized oil prices. We will achieve this goal through deploying our capital and operating cost savings into further production and cash flow growth, driven mostly by our Permian Resources business unit and the start-up of the Al Hosn gas project. Year to date, we estimated about $450 million in captured cost reductions. We expect our 2015 capital outlays to be about $5.8 billion, as we have redeployed some of the cost savings to drilling more wells in our Permian Resources business unit. In short, we are learning to do more with less and expect continued improvement in productivity through the year.","Despite volatile product prices, our Oil and Gas segment has been operating well in nearly all of our key assets. We've increased total oil production by 16% since second quarter of 2014. The focused development program in Permian Resources has driven most of the growth, as well as strong production volumes in Oman and Colombia. We've also focused on optimizing our base production. Rather than making head count reductions during this downturn, we've sent many of our engineers out into the field to replace contractors. They've done a good job of maintaining our base production and driving operating efficiency.","In the Permian, we have shifted our Resources business to a focused development program. We're drilling completing wells at a faster pace and accelerated our time to market. Total production increased by about 50% year over year \u2013 has again exceeded our internal outlook. As such, we have increased our estimate of production for the second half of the year to 117,000 BOE a day. Actual results continue to improve and outperform our internal outlook.","Al Hosn is a large world-scale project and the first of its kind. It is reasonable to expect some operational pains as it has ramped up to full production. In the second quarter of 2015, Al Hosn produced 18,000 BOE a day and sold its first shipment of sulfur. Due to mechanical challenge in the sulfur recovery units, the plant was limited to 50% of capacity for most of the quarter, and production was curtailed for most of the month of April. Repairs to stabilize the sulfur units were completed in July, and the plant has responded well as production has ramped up. The plant is currently producing at about 50,000 BOE a day to us, and we expect it to contribute about 30,000 BOE a day in the third quarter.","Despite a lower capital production, we expect production growth of 70,000 to 80,000 BOE a day in 2015, driven by the start-up of the Al Hosn gas project and focused development program in Permian Resources. In the United States, we expect oil production growth about 8%, partially offset by declines in NGLs and natural gas production. Vicki Hollub will provide further details on the outlook for the U.S. Oil and Gas business.","Construction on the Ingleside ethylene cracker is ahead of schedule and on budget. There are currently 1,300 workers on-site. Construction is about 30% complete, and over 80% of the equipment has been purchased and delivered. We expect to be more than 70% through our capital spending on the project by year-end and for the plant to start up in early 2017.","As we capture price savings from suppliers and improve the efficiencies of our operations, we're able to do more with less spending. Our capital spending in the second quarter declined by about $250 million and will continue to decline throughout the year. As for \u2013 our forecasted capital spending level in some Middle Eastern assets may be slightly higher than expected this year. However, the production sharing contract should allow us to quickly recover our capital costs with increase in oil production. We expect the exit this year at a quarterly spending rate of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. If oil prices remain at current levels around $50, our 2016 capital will be less than both the 2015 full year and the fourth quarter run rate.","Given our large acreage position and deep inventory, we have the flexibility to defer drilling and appraisal activities. Although we will outspend our cash flow this year, we expect that going forward our operating cash flow will cover our capital expenditures and dividend payments, assuming $60-per-barrel oil price realizations.","We continue to invest growth capital in the Permian Resources segment. Over the first half of the year, we did not make any meaningful acquisitions, nor do we have any in the pipeline. The market for asset acquisitions in the Permian Basin has been heated, with new entrants paying sizable premiums for acreage. With our deep inventory of assets, we will focus on organic growth with a low possibility of selective bolt-on acquisitions that leverage our existing infrastructure and geologic understanding.","We have approximately 64 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. At current stock price levels, we would view the stock as attractive for repurchase.","Now I'll turn the call over to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results.","Christopher G. Stavros - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. First I want to highlight some new formatting around our quarterly disclosures. We created a set of earnings release schedules that replaces the previous IR supplemental schedules. The new format is more comprehensive, providing condensed quarterly financial statements, plus quarterly data going back for the entire prior year.","We generated core income of $165 million for the second quarter 2015, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.21, an increase of $0.04 per share in the first quarter of 2015 and a decrease from $1.38 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Worldwide oil prices improved about $6 a barrel in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter, but still remain well below prices comparable to last year. U.S. natural gas prices continue to decline, down about $0.40 per mcf from the first quarter, and NGL prices stayed essentially flat.","Our second quarter capital spending was about $1.5 billion, down 14% from the $1.7 billion we spent in the first quarter. We continued to ramp down our capital program in the second quarter, focusing our development activity in core areas of the Permian Basin and parts of the Middle East, with an emphasis on growing our production volumes and, importantly, our operating cash flow. Despite the reduction in this year's capital program, we continued to grow our domestic Oil and Gas volumes, driven by our Permian Resources operations. Permian Resources grew its oil production 78% in the second quarter, adding 31,000 barrels per day compared to the year-ago period, with total BOE growth of 51%. Production from Permian Resources improved 11,000 BOE per day sequentially, with 9,000 barrels per day coming from oil.","Turning to the specific business segments, Oil and Gas core after-tax earnings for the second quarter 2015 were $108 million, $130 million higher than the first quarter and $833 million lower than last year's second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the largest impact of the change in year-over-year earnings was due to lower oil prices. For the second quarter of 2015, total company Oil and Gas production volumes averaged 658,000 BOE per day, an increase of 13,000 BOE in daily production from the first quarter and 78,000 BOE per day from the same period a year ago. Total company oil volumes were 433,000 barrels per day in the second quarter, 61,000 barrels per day higher than the year-ago period, for an increase of 16%.","Total domestic Oil and Gas production averaged 333,000 BOE per day during the second quarter 2015, up 7,000 BOE per day sequentially and 25,000 BOE on a year-over-year basis, with all of the increase coming from Permian Resources. This was partially offset by lower production from our Midcontinent assets, where we have ceased our drilling activity. Domestic oil production was 205,000 barrels per day during the second quarter, an increase of 7,000 barrels per day sequentially and up 26,000 barrels per day, or 15%, from the year-ago quarter, exceeding our earlier guidance for the period. For the year to-date, overall domestic production volumes have exceeded our expectations.","Our domestic production growth for the first six months of 2015 resulted in an additional $175 million of operating cash flow when compared to the last six months of 2014 and using current product prices for both periods. We achieved this growth while reducing our domestic capital by $389 million. In summary, we not only drilled and completed the wells but sequentially grew both our production volumes and operating cash flow, which can be reinvested in the business.","International Oil and Gas production volumes averaged 325,000 BOE per day during the second quarter, up 6,000 BOE per day sequentially and 53,000 BOE per day on a year-over-year basis. Production from the Al Hosn gas project increased by 9,000 BOE per day from this year's first quarter to 18,000 BOE per day in the second quarter and, as Steve mentioned, also realized the sale of its first shipment of sulfur. Production was curtailed during much of the second quarter, as mechanical modifications and adjustments were made to the sulfur recovery units. These adjustments have been completed, and we expect our net production to exit this month around 50,000 BOE per day.","Our second quarter Oil and Gas cash operating costs of $12.10 per BOE declined 9.0% from the first quarter of $13.36 per BOE due to lower surface and downhole maintenance costs, lower workover costs, as well as higher production volumes. DD&A for the second quarter was $16.06 per BOE compared to $15.35 per BOE during the first quarter.","Taxes other than on income which are directly related to product prices were $1.85 per BOE for the second quarter of 2015, compared to $1.63 for the first quarter of 2015 and $2.45 per BOE for the full year of last year.","Chemical pre-tax earnings were $136 million for the second quarter of 2015. Results were lower than expected, due to higher ethylene feedstock costs and lower caustic soda prices, as well as some unplanned outages at two of our VCM plants.","Midstream pre-tax earnings were $84 million during the second quarter compared to a loss of $5 million in the first quarter of this year and income of $130 million in the same period a year ago. Our Midstream segment is composed of physical marketing, pipelines, power, and gas processing. Our physical marketing is exposed to spreads between WTI Midland and Gulf Coast pricing through multiple pipeline commitments. In the second quarter, our Midstream segment results benefited from wide price differentials. We expect this benefit to partially reverse in the third quarter, as price differentials have narrowed. Our gas processing business converts wet gas to NGLs. Currently, NGLs are trading at an equivalent price to natural gas, which is insufficient to cover the plant operating expenses. Our domestic pipelines as well as the Dolphin pipeline generate a relatively stable and strong stream of tariff income from transporting crude oil and natural gas.","Operating cash flow before working capital changes for the first six months of 2015 was $2.6 billion. As I mentioned, higher production volumes resulting from our continued investment in the Permian, as well as improved oil price realizations, resulted in a sequential increase of about $400 million in operating cash flow before working capital changes to $1.5 billion in the second quarter. Working capital declined by $950 million during the first six months of 2015. At December 31 of last year, accounts payable was $5.2 billion, and as of June 30 of this year, it decreased by $1.1 billion to $4.1 billion. This decrease was due to payments related to higher capital and operating spending accrued in the fourth quarter of last year but not paid until 2015.","Total company capital expenditures for the first six months of 2015 were $3.2 billion, and about on track with our full-year 2015 capital budget of $5.8 billion. Oil and Gas spent $2.7 billion in the first half of 2015, with Permian Resources expenditures comprising 47% of the total and the remaining $500 million split nearly evenly between chemicals and midstream. The continued growth in our operating cash flow should help us to achieve our goal of being cash flow neutral after capital expenditures and dividends at oil prices of roughly $60 a barrel.","In June we completed a bond offering, issuing senior notes at 3.5% and 4.625% and received net proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion. The proceeds were used to build liquidity and partially prefund some of our debt maturing in the first half of 2016. Oxy's credit ratings remain unchanged at A by Moody's and S&P. We paid cash dividends of $1.1 billion in the first six months of 2015 and purchased 7.4 million shares of our stock for $571 million. This amounts to an annualized cash return of 6.2% for our shareholders. The share repurchase activity for the first six months also has the benefit of reducing our annualized dividend outlays by approximately $22 million. Our cash balance at the end of the second quarter was $5.1 billion. Our long-term debt-to-capitalize ratio was 17% at the end of the second quarter. The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 65% for the second quarter of 2015.","Looking ahead to the third quarter domestically, we expect production from Permian Resources to grow by roughly 5% sequentially on a BOE basis, including 5,000 barrels a day of oil growth. Growth in the Permian should be roughly offset by declines in our Midcontinent production, leaving overall third quarter domestic production about flat with the second quarter. We expect our international production volumes to increase by about 10,000 BOE per day in the third quarter. Production rates at Al Hosn should continue to improve, increasing to about 35,000 BOE per day on average in the third quarter.","The increase from Al Hosn should be partially offset by approximately 8,000 barrels per day of lower volumes in Colombia due to pipeline disruptions experienced during July. Assuming no meaningful disruptions during the second half of the year, we are raising the lower end of our full-year 2015 production guidance range from 650,000 to 660,000 BOE per day. Our current estimate of full-year 2015 volumes of 660,000 to 670,000 BOE per day will provide year-over-year growth of 12% to 13%.","Price changes at current global prices affect our quarterly earnings before income taxes by $30 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $7 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGL prices. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices affects quarterly pre-tax earnings by about $15 million.","Our third quarter 2015 exploration expense is anticipated to be about $20 million pre-tax. We expect our third quarter 2015 pre-tax chemicals earnings to be about $140 million. Our third quarter midstream earnings will be principally impacted by Midland to Gulf Coast oil price differentials. We expect our interest expense to increase to about $50 million in the third quarter from $7 million in the second quarter. The sequential increase is due to expensing of previously capitalized interest on the Al Hosn project and the $1.5 billion senior notes we issued in June. Using current strip prices for Oil and Gas, we expect our full-year 2015 domestic tax rate to be 36% and our international tax rates to remain about 65%.","To summarize, we demonstrated strong year-over-year production growth of nearly 13% in the second quarter, bolstered by continued growth in Permian Resources and from the Al Hosn project. We also continued to grow our operating cash flow, which is being used to organically reinvest in the business while providing a balanced return of cash to our shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Vicki Hollub, who will provide an update on our operations in the Permian Basin.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","Thank you, Chris. Today I'll review the highlights of our Permian Resources and Permian EOR activities in the second quarter, and then I'll provide guidance on our program for the remainder of 2015.","I'd like to highlight a few key messages. First, Permian Resources is continuing to drive capital costs down through improved execution efficiency in drilling and well completions. Second, production again exceeded expectations due to reduced time to market and better-than-planned well performance. Finally, the positive returns of our Permian unconventional programs in this environment, along with the large-volume, low-decline production from our EOR operations, provides us flexibility and a wide range of product prices. The advantages this portfolio provides can't be duplicated in the Permian Basin.","In the second quarter, Permian Resources achieved daily production of 109,000 BOE per day, a 12% increase from the first quarter and a 51% increase versus the prior year. Oil production increased to 71,000 barrels per day, a 15% increase from their previous quarter and a 78% increase from a year ago. We drilled 47 wells, including 42 horizontals. We placed 71 wells on production, including 53 horizontals. In the second half of this year, we'll operate about 12 rigs and drill and complete at least 100 horizontal wells.","We continue to work on four key activities that are adding more wells to our inventory and reducing the economic hurdles of our inventory. First, we've used our vast database to update our basin hydrocarbon richness map and to build the petrophysical and geochemical models necessary to improve well performance and to add more locations to our inventory. Second, our teams have further reduced our drilling and completion costs and optimized the value of a manufacturing approach in our key areas. Third, although we have achieved significant cost savings from our vendors, we continue to look for creative ways to reduce service and materials cost further. Lastly, we're enhancing base management and maintenance operations to maximize production at minimal incremental cost. These activities have generated higher-than-expected production and have lowered our finding and development cost, thereby increasing our inventory of drilling locations that deliver returns which exceed our cost of capital. We'll provide an update of our inventory by play and breakeven prices later this year.","In the fourth quarter of last year, we began transitioning from appraisal mode to a targeted development program, utilizing a manufacturing approach combined with integrated planning and engineering. This has reduced nonproductive time, maximized the efficiencies of pad drilling, including the use of zipper fracs, and has reduced infrastructure costs. As a result of these efforts, we have achieved significantly improved well delivery and lower well cost.","As the example on slide 27 illustrates, we've reduced our drilling time by about 50% and our costs by about 40% in a recent Wolfcamp A well in the Delaware Basin. Our improvements were driven by adopting and adapting oilfield technology, including an advanced mud system to eliminate casing across the salt interval in the wellbore. Oxy Drilling Dynamics is a proprietary system we have developed by expanding upon mechanical specific energy concepts to improve rates of penetration. This improvement in drilling efficiency is a structural change to our business that will sharply lower our cost irrespective of pricing concessions from our suppliers.","In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500-foot well cost decreased by about 40% from 2014's cost of $10.9 million to a current cost of $6.8 million. We've reduced our drilling time by 23 days from 2014's average of 43 days to 20 days. I would note that even as we have lowered our completion cost per well, we've optimized the density of our completions and profit loads and have been drilling longer laterals. As I'll highlight later, our productivity has continued to improve while we have lowered our costs.","In the Delaware Basin, we've identified 900 additional horizontal development locations for a total of 5,700. We have 2,000 horizontal well locations ready for development, including 800 sites in the Wolfcamp A bench. The majority of these locations are in our operated areas in Reeves County. In New Mexico, our Bone Spring potential is equally as significant, with 2,300 locations. Our well performance in the Delaware Basin continues to be strong. We placed 13 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the second quarter. These wells achieved an average peak rate of 1,359 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 988 BOE per day. The Moore Hooper 3H well achieved a 2,389 BOE per day peak rate and a 1,769 BOE per day 30-day rate. Additionally our Lenox 2 5H well achieved a 2,425 BOE per day peak rate and a 1,506 BOE per day 30-day rate. Both of these wells produced around 70% oil, and we believe that they are among the most prolific drilled to date in the Permian Basin.","Now I'd like to shift to the Midland Basin. We've made similar improvements in well cost and drilling days in our Wolfcamp A wells in the eastern part of the Midland Basin. We reduced the cost of these 7,500-foot horizontal wells by 30% from 2014's cost of $9.2 million to a current cost of $6.5 million. We reduced our drilling days by more than 50%, from 46 days in 2014 to 20 in the second quarter. Through our program this year and in evaluating the acreage from the acquisition in December, we have added 600 horizontal locations in the Midland Basin for total now of 3,100. Most of the additions were in the Wolfcamp A and Spraberry formations, and we now have 2,000 identified locations ready for horizontal development.","A new area for us is in the Midland Basin. It's called Big Spring, which was part of the December acquisition. We launched into development early this year, and in the second quarter we brought online the May 1102H (25:09) Wolfcamp A well at a peak rate of 1,846 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,262. The well is producing at over 85% oil. These Wolfcamp A well results have been outperforming our initial type curves for this emerging play in Howard County.","Now shifting to Permian EOR, where year to date we're ahead of plan and meeting our aggressive cost improvement target. We've reduced the cost of drilling San Andres wells by about 30% through optimized drilling parameters and crew efficiency. Additionally, we've reduced our downhole maintenance hours per job by 20% since the fourth quarter by applying the learnings gained from a manufacturing approach to well maintenance. We have 15,000 wells in the Permian EOR business and expect to reduce our 2015 downhole maintenance and enhancement cost by $60 million versus 2014. These cost reductions will further increase the free cash flow generated by our Permian EOR business in the current oil price environment.","Despite the low price environment, we're \u2013 continued to commit to developing our technical talent and recently finished construction of a new training center in Midland that will open in September. In previous industry down cycles, we've seen in the industry overreact through widespread layoffs. We're taking a different approach with our response to low oil prices and have deployed many of our engineers in the early stages of their careers out into the field, where they have replaced contractors. They are successfully helping to optimize our base production, improve drilling times, and gain on-the-ground experience.","In closing, we'll continue to execute a focused development strategy in 2015, and we'll pursue additional step changes in well productivity and cost structure. For the remainder of 2015, we plan to operate an average of about 12 drilling rigs to drill around 100 horizontal wells in Permian Resources. This is a higher activity level than planned, but we believe investing efficiency gains back into Permian Resources is a prudent action to take. We expect to produce an average of 117,000 BOE per day in the second half of 2015 and for the business to drive continued growth in operating cash flows. Strong production growth from our Permian Resources business, along with the high-volume, low capital-intensive Permian EOR business, keeps us well-positioned to not only meet the challenges of this lower-price environment, but also to profitably grow our combined Permian business.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Chris Degner.","Christopher M. Degner - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Vicki. We'll now open up for questions. Emily?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, everybody. My first question \u2013 Permian Resources, production beats again, very impressive cost and efficiency improvements here. Really two questions, does your performance lower your existing targets? And secondly, how would you benchmark your Permian operating performance versus peers where there's a peer scope (28:36) to see some continued improvement for a group that's improving at a pretty fast pace?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","Currently, we feel like in the Delaware Basin, we're definitely upper quartile in terms of drilling performance. And actually, we've recently compared our performance to some of our competitors. And we feel like there's maybe one or two operators that have had a couple of wells \u2013 a few wells better than ours. But with the direction that we're headed, we expect to be first in performance in drilling in the Delaware Basin, due to the activities and initiatives that I just discussed.","And with respect to well performance, we looked recently at what some offset operators are doing, and, compared to offset operators in the Delaware Basin, as I said in my discussion here, we believe that we've just completed some of the best wells in the basin, in the Delaware. In the Midland Basin, this new area that we're developing now in Big Spring is certainly showing some of the best production that we've seen yet in the Midland Basin as well. So in some areas in the Midland Basin, we're about par, and, in some cases, slightly lower than some of our competition, but certainly this Big Spring area is competing very well, as is Merchant.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. And does that reset your targets in terms of the targets you put forth in the slides?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","For now, what we're trying to do is \u2013 we feel comfortable with what we've stated for the second half of this year. So that's the target we expect to be able to hit, which equates to about a 109,000 [BOE] average for 2015. With respect to 2016, our targets on a per-well basis, on the average, are going to increase, but what we haven't determined yet is what level of activity we'll have for 2016. So we feel very comfortable that we're going to have a stronger program going into 2016, but the level of capital spend will depend on market conditions.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, fair. My second question relates to locations. There's also a large uptick in locations in Delaware and Midland and particularly in development-ready locations. I mean, it sounds like a model change there that you discussed, but can you give us maybe any further color on that change? And how's that change continuing to evolve throughout the year? Are there drivers for additional scope change, given the pretty significant jump there?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","Yeah, what's happening is our teams have become so efficient in a number of areas. So we're not just getting good with drilling \u2013 and the drilling has been the part of our performance that we've highlighted a lot. So drilling performance is significantly improving, and it's improving because of the modeling work that our teams are doing, in addition to the execution in the field. So it's a combination of our planning, our design, and our guys in the field executing it very well.","In addition to that, though, we have an efficiency team that's driving how we do our business. From the time that we go out, we decide to spot a well, to the time that we get it to sales, every segment of that we've worked on to try to improve our efficiency. And that's gone really well, which has been a big part of the acceleration in addition to the improvement in a per-well basis in terms of initial rates and performance.","The other thing that's helping us significantly is the business units working with our exploitation team to enhance what we understand about the reservoir now. So our modeling work, especially our petrophysical geomodeling and our mapping, has enabled us to do a better job of selecting where to place the lateral part of the well, not only where to spot the well, but where to put the lateral section of the well, and also how to complete it. And while we've seen significant improvements in our wells with the design changes we've made, we feel like there are still more improvements to be made, and we're continuing to work it.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I think you mentioned that you are going to provide price sensitivity later in the year, but are these locations conditioned on a strip or any particular price level currently?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","Well, in the slides, you'll see that we have an inventory of our current well locations identified, and what it shows is the inventory that we can drill by price range. But I want to point out here that this inventory \u2013 it's on slide 25, I think \u2013 but the inventory that's shown on that slide really is not updated for not only well performance, but it hasn't been updated for our current cost structure. So we'll be updating that at the end of the year, and you can use that as the guide to see the level of inventory that we have based on what the oil price is. And this is based on delivering returns that are greater than our cost of capital.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very good, great. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Vicki, I can't help but notice the absence of any meaningful commentary around the Middle East in the slide deck this quarter. I guess, following on from Evan's question, substantially greater opportunity perhaps in the Permian Basin. As you think about the transition of the CEO role over the next year or so, how does your view of the Middle East (34:22) generally \u2013 obviously there's a lot of large core assets, but there's also a lot of smaller, non-core assets. How do you think about your preparedness to invest in those kind of areas, the type of returns, the risk profile, and so on, compared to the short-cycle, fairly-well-known entity that you have right your backyard? In other words, is the Middle East back on the table as a potential rationalization story? And I've got a follow-up, please.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","Well, we're looking at the Middle East basically as a group of what we consider core assets versus non-core assets. And the assets that we consider to be really core to our business over there are the assets in Oman, the Al Hosn project, the Dolphin project. Those are our cash flow generators, so the steam flood in Mukhaizna is certainly one of the projects that's very important to us. Some of the other assets in the Middle East \u2013 we're currently in Qatar, that's been a good project for us. That still has five years left on the contract there. Some of the other assets are assets that, as we've mentioned before, are assets that are non-core to us, and given the opportunity, we would work to try to monetize or exit those.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I don't want to risk wasting my follow-up on this, but the Omani contract obviously is something that when you mentioned Oman you mentioned the steam flood, but you've got 35,000 or so barrels a day of production there today in a contract. Is that asset competitive? Is it delivering free cash flow at this point?","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, this is Steve.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","In other words, would \u2013 go ahead, Steve.","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","She's new to the Middle East, but she'll answer next quarter. The answer is, yeah, it's a free cash flow generator at this point. Whether it's competitive or not is hard to measure. And so, as you know, what happens is you invest the capital and you get it back within the year, typically. So while you show a lot of investment, you get it back fairly quickly, and then some profit oil to go with it. So it's an okay contract at this point. But that's the same kind of financial characteristic that the Permian Resources has, frankly, just looking at it financially. And so the issue that Vicki will wrestle with over the next few months is whether it's competitive to continue to invest \u2013 basically shifting that capital to the Resource business, which basically has the same kind of payout timeframe, maybe a little longer than Resources but not much. So that's really what we're having to wrestle with, and we'll look for a contract extension that is at least as good as what we could get a lot closer to home.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for elaborating, Steve. My follow-up is \u2013 I guess is one of the things that we periodically revisit, and it's the dividend. And obviously you've got a big dividend commitment. The stability of the underlying cash flow is a big, I guess, funding mechanism, CO2, chemicals, and so on. But if you shift your capital allocation, let's say, to the Permian away from those long-life assets that you have in the Middle East, one could argue that the visibility on long-life cash flow to sustain that dividend growth kind of starts to deteriorate a little bit. So what I'm really coming round to is how do you reset the dividend level such that you're able to maintain one of the \u2013 I guess the anchors of Oxy's legacy investment case, which is dividend growth? And, of course, what I'm really getting at is where's your head at on the buyback? Are you going to scale down the shares in order to reset that dividend commitment? And I'll leave it there, Steve. Thanks.","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll answer that for now. And we've talked about this a lot; it's not some new topic. If we concentrate the Middle East on the long-lived projects, that'll generate relatively more free cash flow. In fact, if we stopped investing in the so-called non-core group, we'd have more cash flow than we have now. So they're basically users of cash for either overhead or whatever. And so we think we could improve the cash flow out of the Middle East with that. The CO2 businesses and the chemical business, chemical business will finish the cracker here in a year or so. The cash flow will improve there. We think the dividend will be fairly easy to maintain. However, it will require some shrinkage of the shares; there's no question about that. And so one of our objectives over the next timeframe would be to shrink the shares and therefore reduce the dividend, especially at the current prices of the stock, where the dividend yield is exceptionally high.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answer, Steve. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Good morning, Vicki, back onto the Permian, if I may. So you've got this $6.2 million target for well costs \u2013 I think that's what Evan was trying to get to \u2013 to see where that could get down to. What the limit you think is on that? And then I've got a follow-on about recoveries.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","The $6.2 million is the target, but we feel like that we still have opportunities to lower beyond that. We actually have achieved that with some of our wells, but we're just not achieving that on the average yet. We're still seeing opportunities; the teams are working on new ideas. I think that there's a good possibility we could get below the $6.2 million. Not only that target in the Delaware Basin but our targets in the Midland Basin as well. They're making some really good progress, doing some very good work modeling.","Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","The other experiment you that you spoke about on the last call, obviously making progress on landing zones, proppant intensity, and cluster spacing, all of these things that the industry's using. And we're seeing some individual well results that you flagged out, for example, in the Delaware on slide 30. And the average is kind of static. So I'm just kind of wondering if there's a sort of help you can give us in terms of where you think you could get to from these spot wells \u2013 they could be sweet spots \u2013 versus the average that you're delivering across the play?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","Yeah, what we're trying to do in the Delaware Basin, I think I mentioned before, is that the 3D seismic that we're acquiring, that would be something that could help us identify \u2013 or actually it's the next step to high-grade the locations that we drill. So it's not \u2013 as we've said before, it's not only about where you place the well within the interval, but where you drill the well, too. And our basin modeling, which has recently been updated, that's another tool that we think is going to help us continue to move the average up a bit. So we think that those two tools, the basin modeling where we've done a lot of geochem work and updated our petrophysical models, the 3D seismic now, we're in the process of acquiring that. We should be able to have that processed and begin interpretation by the end of the year. So that should help to impact the 2016 program.","Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Leo Mariani of RBC. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Just question around Al Hosn here. I think you guys previous had a target of 60,000 barrels a day to eventually hit. You think that target's still realistic, and is that something we might get to in 2016?","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, the answer is yeah, it's realistic. They could in theory do better than that. It's running \u2013 if you look at the numbers \u2013 more liquids rich than we had originally forecasted, and we see that continuing. So you're going to wind up with probably more liquids, I think. I think with a little luck we'll get to it by year-end, but if not, certainly by the first quarter.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just with respect to your comments around CapEx, obviously you guys are seeing CapEx move lower here in the second half of 2015. I know you guys previously had said that you might underspend the 2015 budget of the $5.8 billion. Is that still possible here? Because I know it sounds like you guys maybe have probably higher Permian drilling activity. Just trying to get a sense of where that spend may go.","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think the driver isn't the Permian. The Permian is well-managed. The question is the part that's not really in our control, which is some of the Middle East stuff. And, again, I think if we \u2013 effectively, if you put \u2013 it's not totally in our control because you have the issue with the not (43:57) foreign governments. So if we spend a little more or a little less, that really just affects the amount of \u2013 number of barrels we'll get back within six months. So that's about the only thing about the capital that I think is \u2013 what's within our control would be lower, effectively, than that, but there's a part of it that's really not in our control.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, just to be clearer on your intentions for next year, if prices stay low, at $50, you guys have these 12 rigs in the Permian, is that likely to stay at 12? Or potentially could you cut it back further next year?","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, it just depends on what the price is. 12 is, I think, a reasonable guess for now, but we would \u2013 even in a more stable price environment, we would have a hard time at this point of the year in making a sensible outlook for next year. We could make one up, but I think it's hard to make sensible outlook for next year, even now, with the volatility of the prices. We're loath to say exactly what we're going to do. The intention is that we'd like \u2013 I think we can make \u2013 fairly straightforwardly make cash flow neutrality in a $60 environment. The question is can we make it in a $55 environment, and I just don't know that yet, but we're certainly going to try.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So it sounds like cash flow neutrality would be the overarching theme for next year.","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","You can't just run for the rest of your life outspending your cash flow. I mean, you can do it for a year, maybe two years, but that can't be a business model for any ongoing enterprise, although obviously there are companies that have been doing it for a decade, so.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, Steve.","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning. Maybe if I could start in the Permian as well. The addition to the well inventory was great to see. And I realize some of that is on the modeling side, but can you talk maybe a little bit of \u2013 it looked like there were additions across a variety of zones. With the new model and as you continue to drill, is there any zone in particular where you're seeing particularly strong improvements or where your view may be changing at all in the basin?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","Yeah, I would say that our view changed a little bit in the Midland Basin, where we thought at the beginning of the year that the Spraberry would be the best interval for us in the Midland, but now we're seeing the Wolfcamp A and both the Merchant area and the Big Spring area as looking very, very good. So that was a positive sign for us. So we have now three intervals \u2013 the Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B, and Spraberry \u2013 that are economical to develop in the Midland Basin.","And in the Delaware, what we're doing there is we're trying to stay very focused this year on developing what we plan to develop so that we have the infrastructure in place and that we maximize the use of that infrastructure as quickly as we can before we move on to other intervals in other areas. Two of the things that we're seeing is that the third Bone Spring and the Avalon are actually starting to look very good for us around our acreage, and so we're modeling that now. And actually we'll certainly, we think, unless we just have significant improvements in some other intervals, both of those intervals will be a part of our 2016 development program.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great. Are you still increasing lateral lengths in either basin, or where are you on that front at this point?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","Yeah, actually in the Midland Basin what we're doing there is we've drilled anywhere from 4,500 feet up to 10,000 in the Delaware Basin, and our current average there is about 6,800. But we're trying to, where we can, target drilling 7,000 to 7,500 in the Midland Basin. In the Delaware, we've drilled up to about 7,850. And actually, our average in the Delaware Basin probably is around 4,500 there. We're expecting to, in that basin, have a minimum of 4,500 going forward in the future and would like to drill maybe in the 5,000 to 5,500 range.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And maybe if I could ask one on the overall U.S. portfolio, you discussed a little bit your views on the Middle East up to this point, but where do you stand at this point on portfolio, kind of on the state of the U.S. portfolio? The dust has settled a bit on some of your 2014 activity. Are there still assets that you would view as non-core at this point that you could potentially look to market?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","The assets that we'd consider non-core in the U.S. are still Williston and Piceance. We have a South Texas asset that, when liquids prices are good, it's a great project. And actually, we have a lot of work that we could do at South Texas. The team down there has worked up a lot of potential workovers. We have a lot of drilling prospects on our South Texas acreage. So I'm just going to use this opportunity to say that, even though we're not investing growth capital dollars in any of those three assets, those teams have done an incredible job to manage their base production and optimize it, and they're optimizing it with minimal expense of any kind. They're doing a tremendous job.","So we still consider there to be a lot of potential in South Texas. Williston, we simply want to monetize because of the fact that we don't have a lot of running room there. We started some larger completions at the end of last year in the Williston Basin that really showed significant improvement in our well productivity there, but because of our running room, because of the differential in the Williston, it just can't compete with our Permian Basin assets, and we don't think it ever will. So we do want to monetize it, along with the Piceance.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. I'll leave it there.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Could I just jump back to the cash flow neutrality debate? What would the volume outlook be in that situation, Steve? Are we just talking about staying flat or some sort of growth?","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","There'd be growth in the volumes. The reason we're investing is to grow the cash flow, so, yeah, it isn't going to be a flat volume situation. We have our own outlooks for the end of the year, what the fourth quarter production will look like, volumes, and the same thing with some view into the first quarter of next year. So I think, generally speaking, it isn't just what we have but also what we see. But I think also, I think the capital, the cracker expenditures will fall next year. Some of the midstream expenditures will fall. So the amount of capital, which doesn't add to volumes, will decline next year. So I think time we get through, I think, we're fairly close to where we need to be.","I mean, we generated cash from operations in this past quarter about $1.5 billion before working capital changes. So you're talking about a $6 billion sort of run rate. Our capital spending next year would be well below the current $5.8 billion number. So it's pretty much in sight \u2013 you get a little improvement in chemicals and a few more dollars really in oil price. What's really held us back more than anything is probably NGL pricing. We weren't as negative as it turned out to be, so that's another area where I think we've been \u2013 we've been more disappointed, frankly, in NGL pricing than we have the oil pricing, which is very similar to our outlook.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Sure. You said that you were struggling to think about cash flow neutrality at $55. I'm not clear why that would be so much more difficult than thinking about it at $60.","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","It's another $500 million.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, okay. And I guess ultimately you've said many times that you need to grow production if you're going to grow the dividend basically, right?","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","I need to grow production if I want to grow the dividend. I need to grow production if Vicki's going to attract the kind of employees she'd like to have. I think a stagnant business generates a stagnant workforce.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","The alternative would be, I guess, just to sell Oxy if you can't make it, right?","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think that you can ask her about that next quarter.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Uh, Vicki \u2013 all right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah, hi. Given all of the efficiency savings you're getting in the U.S. and the Permian on drilling and completion and all that, do you have a sense of where you think your DD&A rates will go to on kind of a normalized basis?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","I think our DD&A rates are \u2013 you're talking about for the Permian Resources business in particular?","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yes.","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","We're certainly headed toward DD&A of less than $15, and that sort of depends in terms of where it eventually lands, depends on our infrastructure and how we can optimize that. Thus far, we've done a really good job of building water-handling infrastructure and gas processing, gas to sales, gathering systems. So as we continue to optimize that, part of the reason that we're developing the way we are is to ensure that over time we can develop our reserves and minimize the facilities costs. So we're trying to spend the bulk of our dollars on getting the reserves out of the ground. Ultimately, we're putting together these lots of field (54:38) depletion plans, which help us to do that, and our target is to always make sure that our development of any particular area is with less than 10% of the capital spent on facilities and infrastructure.","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","As we look at DD&A, just to give you an accounting sort of answer, as you look to DD&A, you've got the historical costs when oil was $100 that are built up in there. We're adding at basically well below $15 currently, and so the finding cost currently, the incremental finding cost, is quite low. And so it just will take a while to roll through the old stuff, so it's probably going to take a couple of years or something to sort of get the bulk of the adds at the low F&D. So I think putting aside product price changes, you'll see a decline in the real finding costs over time.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Yeah, I was just wondering about the timing of it.","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","It just depends on how fast you DD&A the historic cost, because that's what's holding it back.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay, great. Next one for me is on Howard County. You said you had some very good performers there, and it's newly acquired properties. Is that something that you would accelerate? Or it's just part of the program?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","Actually, we're trying to stay disciplined in terms of how much we accelerate, so we'll do more drilling there. We do have drilling planned there. It'll be at a moderate pace through this year because we have other areas that are pretty good as well. If we see over time that, on a consistent basis, that that's tremendously higher than anything else we have in the Midland Basin, we'll certainly go over and try to accelerate that, but with minimal incremental cost.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott (sic) [Matt] Portillo of TPH. Please go ahead.","Matthew M. Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, all. Just a quick question on the Permian. I wanted to follow up in regards to the inventory update. I was curious, as we think about both the Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B, what are some of the underlying assumptions from a downspacing perspective? And if you're testing any further downspacing in regards to stacked staggered development in the play?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","In the Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B, we're being very careful not to downspace too much. So we have some pilots in place, and we have some reservoir modeling ongoing to ensure that we're spacing those wells appropriately. We're not going to drill wells where we have interference issues, so we're trying to maximize the reserves we get on a per-well basis. So downspacing is not something that we've built into our program. However, the staggered completions between the Wolfcamp A and B is something that certainly we're going to do to ensure that there's no risk of communication between a Wolfcamp A and a Wolfcamp B well.","Matthew M. Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And just a follow-up to both the inventory update in the Wolfcamp B and then just potentially some color around well performance, you've provided a lot of detail in the past on the Wolfcamp A 30-day rates, and I think you've mentioned a type curve of up to 900,000 MBOE for your short laterals. I was curious how the Wolfcamp B wells look in comparison to that, and as we think about kind of the inventory added from 650,000 to 800,000, (58:22) was that based on delineation of additional wells on your acreage in the basin?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","Yeah, the incremental wells was additional delineation, and the Wolfcamp B, with respect to the Wolfcamp A, is \u2013 while the Wolfcamp B is prospective and delivers some better than cost of capital returns, it's not as prolific as the Wolfcamp A in either the Midland Basin nor the Delaware. However, we think there are opportunities to continue to improve the recovery from the Wolfcamp A, where we're doing, as I said, on each of our target intervals more modeling to try to get to the point where we can optimize the Wolfcamp B.","Matthew M. Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our last question today comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning. If we look at \u2013 on slides 29 and 32, you highlight your focus acreage in the context of your broader large Permian position. Can you update us on strategically your plan for the acreage within the Delaware and Midland that are not in the focused acreage, either to delineate, to sell, or to hold, whether those priorities change in a low oil environment? And then also your level of interest and realistic opportunity to expand your acreage positions in the Permian proximate to your focus acreage?","Vicki A. Hollub - President, Oxy Oil and Gas \u2013 Americas","So we have no intention to sell any of our acreage that's designated non-focus right now. The difference between our focus areas and not is the fact that our focus areas are those that we feel like we could put in development mode today or are in development mode today. The ones that are not considered focus right now are the ones that are still in appraisal mode, and we consider those areas to be prospective, but in the interest of trying to ensure that the infrastructure dollars that we spend are used and we get the benefit of that quicker, we're being pretty disciplined about where we spend and how we develop. So the non-focus areas are ones that we're preparing for development in the future. We at this point today don't have any acreage that we would consider for sale today. We have some acreage that falls way down the priority list and are things that we would get to years and years from now, so that, at some point, we might take a look at. Do we try to trade that to move into areas where it better fits where we're currently operating?","And in terms of continuing to appraise, we still have the Central Basin platform where we haven't been drilling as of yet, or many unconventionals. I think we have a couple drilled, but we still have that to assess. So the good thing is that we have a tremendous inventory. The challenge with that is we're always looking at ways to try to accelerate but to do it in a way that's not value destructive. And so we're trying to moderate our pace and trying to ensure that we have things fully evaluated before we move to development.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And my follow up is on the midstream marketing business. Can you just talk to what you all see as the ongoing cash generation potential there and then how you're thinking about that business strategically?","Stephen I. Chazen - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think that it's still in a heavy \u2013 and basically it's supportive of the Permian business. That's really what it does. And they're still really spending more money than they're taking in, because they continue to build out to support the production business.","People talk \u2013 it doesn't make any sense to us, given our financials position, to do anything to increase the fixed charges against the rest of the business by selling debt-like instruments called MLP units that go against that and increase our fixed charges. Fixed charges are okay at $100 oil, but not so much fun in a $50 environment, and I think that's \u2013 people miss that, that \u2013 just like interest. So I think on the cash flow generation, right now it basically is neutral to maybe slightly negative, as they continue to build out either gas plants or pipelines. At some point I think it'll probably generate $400 million, $500 million a year in free cash flow, but I think we're probably a year or two from that.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great.

Joining us on the call first morning from Los Angeles are Steve Chazen, OXY's President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Lienert, OXY's chief Financial Officer; Bill Albrecht, President of OXY's Oil and Gas operations in the Americas; Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas Operations; and OXY's Executive Chairman, Dr. Ray Irani, is also joining us on the call today.","In just a moment, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Jim Lienert, who will review our financial and operating results for the first quarter of this year. Steve Chazen will then follow with comments on our key performance metrics, our capital program, oil and gas production and outlook for the current quarter. We'll also be providing some new information on our activity and exposure on select Permian basin plays and on a one-time basis, some additional data on our California production volumes. ","Our first quarter 2012 earnings press release Investor Relations supplemental schedules and the conference call presentation slides, which refer to both Jim and Steve's remarks, can be downloaded off of our website at www.oxy.com. ","And I'll now turn the call over to Jim Lienert. Jim, please go ahead.","James M. Lienert","Thank you, Chris. Net income was $1.6 billion or $1.92 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $1.5 billion or $1.90 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011. Several factors lowered earnings during the first quarter by about $0.05 per diluted share. These factors included higher insurgent activity in Colombia, resulting in pipeline interruptions; a maintenance-related shutdown in Qatar; field shut-in due to labor disputes, which have shut down the pipeline in Yemen; and inclement weather at our Elk Hills operations, partially offset by additional oil entitlements in Libya related to the initial start-up phase of operations after the 2011 civil unrest.","Here's a breakdown from the first quarter. In the Oil and Gas segment, the first quarter 2012 daily production of 755,000 barrels per day was the highest in the company's history and was up over 3% for the same period of 2011. We're the largest liquids producer in the U.S. lower 48 and grew our oil production from the first quarter of 2011 by 10% to 244,000 barrels a day. Our total domestic production was 455,000 barrels per day, the sixth consecutive domestic volume record for the company, in line with our guidance of 455,000 to 457,000 barrels per day.","Inclement weather, which resulted in numerous power outages in California reduced Elk Hills gas production by about 11 million cubic feet per day. Our total domestic production was about 13% higher than the first quarter of 2011.","Latin America volumes were 26,000 barrels per day. Colombia's production of 24,000 barrels a day was about 7,000 barrels lower than its typical production capacity due to higher insurgent activity that resulted in pipeline interruptions. ","In the Middle East region, Libya production was 20,000 barrels per day, which included additional entitlements related to the post-2011 civil unrest period. In Iraq, we produced 5,000 barrels per day, a decrease of 4,000 barrels from the fourth quarter volumes. The lower volume is directly related to reduced spending levels.","Yemen daily production was 17,000 barrels, a decrease of 6,000 barrels from the fourth quarter. The decrease reflected the expiration of the Masila Field contract in mid-December, partially offset by the timing of cost recovery volumes, which are typically higher in the first half of the year. ","In Oman, the first quarter production was 74,000 barrels per day, a decrease of 2,000 barrels from the fourth quarter volumes. The decrease was attributable to operational issues.","In Qatar, the first quarter production was 72,000 barrels per day, a decrease of 4,000 barrels over the fourth quarter volumes, resulting from a maintenance shutdown in March. ","For Dolphin and Bahrain combined, daily production increased 3,000 barrels from the fourth quarter volumes. As a result of higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting production sharing and similar contracts, first quarter 2012 production was lower by 10,000 barrels per day from the first quarter of 2011. These factors did not materially affect production compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","Our first quarter sales volumes were 745,000 barrels per day. The 10,000-barrel per day difference compared to the production volumes is larger than a typical difference between production and sales, and was due entirely to the timing of liftings, almost all of which was related to Libya and Iraq. ","First quarter 2012 realized prices were mixed for our products compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our worldwide crude oil realized price was $107.98 per barrel, an increase of 8%. Worldwide NGLs were $52.51 per barrel, a decrease of about 5%. And domestic natural gas prices were $2.84 per MCF, a decline of 21%.","Realized oil prices for the quarter represented 105% of the average WTI and 91% of the average Brent price. Realized NGL prices were 51% of WTI, and realized domestic gas prices were 100% of the average NYMEX price.","The NGL realization is low by historical standards and indicates a troubling trend. Over the last 5 years, domestic NGL realizations have dropped from about 73% to 52% of WTI. Absolute realized price of NGLs is not significantly different than 5 years ago.","Price changes at current global prices affect our quarterly earnings before income taxes by $36 million for $1 per barrel change in oil prices, and $8 million for $1 per barrel change in NGL prices. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices affects quarterly pretax earnings by about $35 million.","Oil and gas production costs were $14 a barrel for the first 3 months of 2012 compared with last year's 12-month cost of $12.84 a barrel and fourth quarter of 2011 cost of $14.22 a barrel. The cost increase reflects higher well maintenance activity. ","Taxes other than our income, which are directly related to product prices, were $2.49 per barrel for the first quarter of 2012 compared to $2.21 per barrel for all of 2011. First quarter exploration expense was $98 million, in line with our guidance.","Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2012 were $184 million compared to $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $219 million for the first quarter of 2011. The sequential quarterly improvement was primarily due to stronger domestic demand for polyvinyl chloride brought in part by the unseasonably mild weather, resulting in an earlier start to the construction season and rebuilding of downstream inventories. ","The year-over-year decrease was primarily a result of lower export volumes and higher raw material costs, in large part caused by a rapid increase in ethylene prices. Calcium chloride sales volumes for de-icing applications were significantly lower due to the mild winter weather.","Midstream segment earnings were $131 million for the first quarter of 2012 compared to $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. The improvement in earnings was in the marketing and trading businesses. The worldwide effective tax rate was 42% for the first quarter of 2012. The increase over our guidance was due to higher Libya liftings. Our first quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedule.","Cash flow from operations for the first 3 months of 2012 was $2.8 billion, representing a $600 million increase from the first quarter of 2011. We used $2.4 billion of the company's total cash flow to fund capital expenditures and about $375 million to pay dividends. We also used about $300 million of cash for working capital during the quarter. There were no significant acquisitions during the period.","These and other net cash flows resulted in a $3.8 billion cash balance at March 31. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2012 were $2.4 billion, slightly lower than the run rate incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011. Year-to-date capital expenditures by segment were 84% in Oil and Gas; 14% in Midstream; and the remainder in Chemicals.","The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the 3 months of 2012 were 810.5 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 811.3 million. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 13%. Copies of the press release announcing our first quarter earnings and the Investor Relations supplemental schedules are available on our website or through the SEC's EDGAR system. ","I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to provide guidance for the second quarter of the year.","Stephen I. Chazen","Thank you, Jim. OXY's first quarter 2012 production set an all-time record for the company. And for the sixth consecutive quarter, the domestic Oil and Gas segment produced record volumes. First quarter domestic production of 455,000-barrel equivalents a day consisting of 316,000 barrels of liquids, 834 million cubic feet a day of gas, was an increase of 6,000-barrel equivalent per day compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. All of the domestic production growth in the fourth quarter was in liquids, which grew from 310,000 barrels a day to 316,000. Gas production was flat.","Compared to the first quarter 2011, our domestic liquids production grew by 35,000 barrels per day and gas production by 100 million cubic feet per day. As you may recall, OXY is the largest producer of liquids in the lower 48 states.","Focusing on the total return to our shareholders, in February, we increased our dividends by $0.32 or 17% to $2.16 per share. Our annualized return on equity for the first 3 months of 2012 was 16% and return on capital employed was 14%. During the quarter, the company generated cash from operations of $2.8 billion, 25% increase from the same quarter last year.","In the first quarter, our capital spending was $2.4 billion. The current capital run rate may come down over the course of the year as certain projects, such as the Elk Hills gas plant are completed. In addition, as I indicated in last quarter's conference call, we will review our capital program around midyear and adjust as conditions dictate. The following is the geographic overview of the program. ","In the domestically in California, the rig count at the end of the first quarter was about the same as the 31 we're running at year-end 2011. We expect the rig count to remain at current levels through the end of the year. Relative to last year, we are seeing improvement with respect to permitting issues in the state. We have received approved field rules and new permits for both injection wells and drilling locations. The regulatory agency is responsive and committed to working through the backlog of permits. We expect to maintain our capital program at current levels for about the first half of the year, which will enable us to grow our production volumes. We'll reassess our capital program as the year progresses and the current regulatory environment clearly stabilizes.","Starting in 2011, we shifted our development program on focusing on conventional, nonconventional opportunities outside the traditional Elk Hills area. As you can see in the Investor Relations supplemental schedule, our traditional Elk Hills production on a BOE basis has declined 14% since we began this program. While the remainder of our California production, representing our conventional, steam and shale programs, has increased 30% during the same period. Essentially, all of the increase came from liquids. ","Excluding the traditional Elk Hills, liquids production was about -- was up about 35% or about 17,000 barrels a day. As we have previously discussed, we are shifting our program to emphasize oil and liquids-rich production. We are starting to see the effect of this shift in the first quarter of 2012. We expect most of the California production growth in the near future to come from liquids.","While the current environment -- while in the current environment, we don't expect to drill many gas wells. The new Elk Hills gas plant will possibly affect our operational efficiency and production in the back half of the year.","In the Permian, the rig count at the end of the first quarter was 26, 3 higher than we were running at year-end 2011. We expect our rig count to remain at about this level during the year. As the attached Investor Relations supplemental schedule shows, we have significant acreage positions in a number of plays in the Permian basin that will give us ample opportunity for future growth. ","Our total acreage position in these plays, broadly defined, is approximately 2.9 million gross acres or about 1 million acres net. Based on what we currently believe are the likely limits of these plays, our gross and networking interest are 1 million acres and 300,000 acres, respectively. We are currently operating 24 rigs in these areas. Additionally, 74 wells, in which we have a working interest, were drilled by third-party operators during the first quarter of 2012. We currently expect about 300 additional wells redrilled by those operators during the rest of the year","We expect that our program and the third-party drilling will accelerate our Permian production in the latter part of this year. In the mid-continent and other operations, the lowest in our rig count was 13 at the end of the quarter, down from 14 at year end. We expect the rig count to be about 6 by the end of this year.","As I mentioned in last quarter's conference call, we have shifted some capital from this area to California and the Permian. Natural gas prices in the United States continue at depressed levels. As a result, we have cut back our pure gas drilling. If the current low NGL prices continue, cutback in liquid-rich wells or gas rich wells, may be necessary.","International operations, the Al Hosn Shah gas project is approximately 38% complete and is progressing as planned. This project made up about 10% of our total capital program for the first quarter. If spending continues at current levels, we will see higher anticipated spending for the remainder of this year. However, total development capital for the project is expected to be in line with previous estimates.","In Iraq, the spending declined compared to the fourth quarter levels as a result of contract approval delays. However, recently, a number of major contracts were approved covering drilling and completion services, workovers and logistics support. ","As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect oil and gas production to be as follows: We expect domestic production to grow 3,000 or 4,000 barrels a day per month in the quarterly average of 455,000 a day, which would correspond to 6,000 to 8,000 barrels per day increase for the quarter. ","Internationally, Colombia's first quarter production was reduced by 7,000 barrels a day resulting from increased insurgent attacks on the pipeline. Production should go back to normal levels assuming no significant insurgent activity. Production has been about normal levels so far in the current quarter.","The Middle East region production is expected to be as follows: Production has assumed in our operations of Libyan and averaged 20,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, including entitlements in the post-2011 civil unrest period. We expect that second quarter daily volumes to be about 11,000 barrels a day. We expect production to increase gradually during the course of the year, reaching the historical levels of about 14,000 barrels a day by year end. ","In Iraq, as I've previously discussed, production levels depend on capital spending amounts. We are unable to predict the timing of the capital spend.","For Dolphin, a planned plant shutdown reduced production in January and February. Production increased significantly in March. We expect second quarter production to increase modestly over first quarter volumes. The remainder of the Middle East, we expect production to be comparable to the first quarter volumes. ","We expect sales and production volumes in the second quarter of 2012 to be about equal, subject to scheduling of liftings. A $5 change in global oil prices would impact our production sharing contract daily volumes by about 3,000 BOE a day.","Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about 125 million for seismic and drilling for exploration programs in the second quarter. Chemical segment or quarter earnings are expected to be about $175 million. We expect lower natural gas prices and improvements in exports of VCM and polyvinyl chloride to be offset by several planned maintenance turnarounds and anticipated slowdown in domestic PVC demand, following the unusually strong start in the first quarter.","We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to decrease to about 41%. The decrease in the first quarter reflects lower Libyan liftings.","So to summarize, we closed the quarter with an all-time record total company production and the sixth consecutive record domestic oil and gas production. As the largest liquids producer in lower 48, we increased our liquids production by 6,000 barrels a day from the fourth quarter, and by 35,000 barrels a day for the first quarter 2011. We increased our dividend rate by 17% to $2.16 per share. Our capital spending was $2.4 billion in the first quarter with the Shah gas project increasing to about 10% of the total spending. The business generated cash from operations of $2.8 billion in the quarter.","I think we're now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And your first question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm going to go try a couple if I can, Steve. The gas fund, I guess, we've been waiting on this for quite a while. Can you just confirm the timeline of -- I think you'd originally said, major commissioning. But more importantly, can you help us understand what that does in terms of alleviating any bottlenecks particularly in the legacy Elk Hills field? And maybe help us understand what -- how can we quantify how much incremental production this is actually going to bring to you when the thing comes on stream? And I have a follow up, please.","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes. It's obvious. The plant's on schedule, and it's in the process of testing or whatever we want to call it currently. So there shouldn't be any delays. When we talked about the plant a couple of years ago, we talk thought we'll drill more gas and obviously to fill it up and whatever it is, $2 gas doesn't seem at all that interesting. The wells would be all right, but I think it's wasteful to produce gas at $2. We have a sizable inventory of gas to drill in California, would easily fill the plant and then some, but we'll probably defer that some. Exact increase, basically what will happen is you'll get a little more NGLs out of Elk -- out of the old plant or the old field and much more reliable gas production. And what exactly it will do, we'll be able to see in the third quarter, but it will be an improvement. And we'll see what will happen when the shift the gas, the high-pressure gas to the new plant and keep the low pressure gas in the old plant. So I can't predict that, and I don't want to predict it until I actually see the results.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My follow up is kind of a related question also to California. Your commentary around the permits, I think, is very much supported by the, at least that's what we see coming out of the state. My question is that, you've said in the past that you really were unable to plan because you didn't have line of sight on permits. Well now it seems that you're getting that line of sight and you've said you hold the rig count flat in the middle of the year. But can you just give us a bit more color as to how you're thinking about the operating team performing to your satisfaction, so to speak, you're prepared to allocate more capital? And if so, what can we expect in terms of the split between unconventional drilling and conventional exploration?","Stephen I. Chazen","The second part, I don't really know. They drill a bit -- the best as it builds up. I think I told almost everybody that a massive buildup in drilling rigs in California is probably counterproductive at this point. We expect to build the rig count in the back half of the year as the line of sight improves. It's obviously a lot better than it was, but we need to be able to plan to keep those rigs, because once you bring them into California, it's hard to get rid of them. We're effectively the only one drilling. So I think you just got to say that as the longer lead permitting progresses we'll build the count, and we'll see where we are at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the balance sheet management, can you just talk about buybacks? And you've mentioned the dividend increases.","Stephen I. Chazen","Because we're intermittent buyers of the shares, as we buy when they're cheap and when it's less clear, we leave it alone. Stock declined when we're in basically the closed window period. And so we really couldn't respond this month essentially. And we'll see -- we talked about the calculation a couple of quarters ago. And so that will be something that we'll be looking at very hard in next few weeks. The cash balance courses, and we're not exactly getting rich off the interest. And so we need to put the money to work one way or another. There may be some small acquisitions, but we're earning in spite of -- we earned 16% on equity. So if we can reinvest it and earn 16% on equity, that's probably in the shareholders interest. But if the shares reflect a different number, then we'll take a different tact.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, that's interesting. I think, obviously, the business model in the past has been acquisition at times. I think, I strongly sense your language is this bits and pieces perhaps that you've really got an organic opportunity here that you're going to pursues?","Stephen I. Chazen","I really don't need to do anything material. Some bargain comes up, that's a different story, but we're just not going to do anything material. Again, bargains are one thing but so far, I haven't heard of any bargains coming by. And we're actually not a real estate company. And so we're not actually -- a lot of the stuff that is for sale isn't exactly oceanfront property. And so we're pretty cautious about large-scale acreage acquisitions. So if they can steal it, that's fine. But right now, we have so much on our plate. I think I told you a couple quarters ago that the request from the units were essentially twice the approved spending level. So we got a big inventory. The opportunities that continues to grow both in California and in the Permian. And there's just no need to do something splashy.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. If we think about the balance sheet, is there an optimal level of leverage for you in this environment?","Stephen I. Chazen","I don't know. As you know, I'm a, debtophobe, so there's probably not, but we still have $3.8 billion of cash.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, the inefficiency of the cash is more than...","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes it's more efficient to cash than leveraging up. Commodity business is volatile, and that's not all that exciting. But 2% interest rate's always a little tempting. But right now, we've got a boatload of cash. And we would expect this year, even with a modest level of acquisitions and the growth of the solid gas, the capital spending will build cash this year. So we got to figure out the best way to put it to work.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then a follow up, which is the -- is there anything interesting to say as all there is about Oman? Any outlook there?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, Sandy is a Oman expert. He'll talk to you about it.","Edward Arthur Lowe","Yes, Paul, we're running 15 rigs in Oman right now, 10 of them in the north. And we're working the relatively new Block 62 and still working Block 9 and 27. We're revamping a lot of our facilities so that we can get consistent production over 100,000 gross barrels a day in the North. So I mean we see that as a place that still got a lot of opportunities ahead of us.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","What sort of growth should we look for from this earning?","Edward Arthur Lowe","What sort of gross or...","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Growth, growth.","Edward Arthur Lowe","In growth, we look at -- we're still going to -- we're going to get to about 110,000 gross barrels a day. We're running about 98 right now. Some of it, we actually have more capacity in the ground we have to fix and refurbished and add some facilities to few.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jessica Chipman of Tudor Pickering Holt.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Couple questions. The first, just on the breakout you gave around permian acreage. Looks like 330,000 net acres was in the likely limits that you see...","Stephen I. Chazen","That we currently see.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","So what is the current breakdown, if you could, on the 24 rigs that you're running there currently?","Stephen I. Chazen","You mean by...","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just by location. Most of those were vertical Wolfberry rigs or were you spend the capital?","Stephen I. Chazen","Bill can answer that. We're not going to break it down for each play. We'll do it by basin generally.","William E. Albrecht","Jessica, yes. About half of our rig count is -- and half of the program for 2012 is going to be devoted to drilling Wolfberry wells. But we are active in not all of the plays that you see listed on the schedule but in a number of them. And just also, just as a reminder, we have 8 rigs currently running on our CO2 floods, building largely infill development wells.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. that's helpful. And then I've asked this before and I'll ask this again, could you give us an update just on well cost within the Bakken, the Permian, particularly on the horizontal side and then California?","Stephen I. Chazen","Horizontal side? The Bakken stuff is still not come down to the level that's appropriate, so we continue to reduce our current -- we have a lot more better places to put money right now than the Bakken, so we're reducing that count. The rest of the stuff doesn't seem to change very much. The rest of the horizontal -- I think our service costs are essentially flat.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then just thinking about the run rate of CapEx in Q1 was $2.4 billion. And I think you made a comment there are ways to bring that down over the year. In addition...","Stephen I. Chazen","Not ways, it's just will. There are things just roll off.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","So basically, decreasing Bakken rigs and then...","Stephen I. Chazen","And the buildings at the plants.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","So the $8.3 billion original spend that you outlined to the tune of...","Stephen I. Chazen","The only thing I would say that's really out of our control is the sour gas, because we had a lower number in there, and I think they'll spend more of that now, so the total will go up. The total over time is about $4 billion our share. And so if we spent between now and the end 2014, and just a matter -- you don't really know what year it will fall in, the total's okay. So we'll spend more this year and we'll spend less some of the year. So that's the only variable right now, unless we change the program.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Harrison of ISI Group.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Steven, international EMP and specifically in Iraq, I think you highlighted delays for permitting and contracts and infrastructure that you guys are reducing spending.","Stephen I. Chazen","We didn't reduce it, it's just sort of automatic. They don't get the permits, it's hard to spend the money. There's only so many dinners you can buy if you want.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So my question is, can you talk about that position, and how production's unfolding versus plant meeting? Not just for the next couple of quarters, which I realize is impossible because of what you said about the unpredictability of near-term spending? But has your outlook changed over the immediate term on that position or just cover a general update on how you think about that play?","Stephen I. Chazen","Sandy will be glad to answer that.","Edward Arthur Lowe","Yes, Doug. We are making progress on spending in addition to -- we just yesterday found out they've approved some new production facilities. So we will not only give us more spend, which leads to more introduction, but more gross production. There are some variables facing us with some common infrastructures that the Iraqis are working on. They fixed a lot of your issues on transportation, the terminal. We're still trying to get the water injections fixed. And the actual speed of ramp up of our own production will depend on how soon we can get more water in the ground.","Stephen I. Chazen","The gross, just to fill in, the gross is running 260 right now. These latest approvals on contract awards can get us up to 550, 600 over the next 2, 2.5, 3 years. So that's coming together. It hasn't gone as fast as he like to, we've had some recent progress.","Edward Arthur Lowe","But what was it when we took over?","Stephen I. Chazen","We took it over at 180. That gives you a feel for the growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Leo Mariani of RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just curious on your U.S. gas production. I guess it picked up very modestly here in the first quarter? I guess, roughly 1 million a day over the previous quarter. You talked about pulling back on your  gas activity recently here. When should we expect your U.S. gas production to do? Is that going to peak here in the first quarter of '12 and start declining? Just any color that will be helpful.","Stephen I. Chazen","I would argue, it's probably pretty flattish. It will vary, but I think pretty flattish. A lot of the gas, the bulk of the gas, overwhelming majority of the gas is associated with the oil production. And so -- but we're not -- we could size, we should have a huge increase in gas production as a company if we decided to drill wells. And basically that's what's -- at $2, it's just not going to happen, or $2.50 or $3. So that's really what we're saying is, we could have a very, very large increase in gas production if the prices were sensible. So you ought to expect sort of flatfish so all the growth in the business will come out of the oil business, which is a little easy -- a little harder than growing in the size of our portfolio, a little harder than growing gas. We grow gas a lot because it's a small base.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I guess in the Permian, you talked about participating in 70-something industry wells in the first quarter in a number of different areas. Any thoughts on what you guys are seeing as a result of those wells? Any particular area other than the Wolfberry that you're very active that has you guys excited at all?","Stephen I. Chazen","Most of it is doing pretty well, the oily areas. I think if you've got about 1\/3 of your BOEs in oil, that's a stuff that sells for $100 a barrel, sort of. You have, I think, a pretty economic program. And those programs were, there's really no $100 a barrel stuff, all you have this NGLs and gas, I think they're economically challenged in the Permian. So some of the plays are so-called liquids rich if there's not about 1\/3 of your stream are condensated black oil, I think those are economically challenged. From our perspective, somebody else may have a more limited opportunity set.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Any plans for OXY to get after some operated activity and some of those high oil cut plays?","Stephen I. Chazen","What do you think we're doing?","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm talking about how possible variables...","Stephen I. Chazen","How many rigs are we running -- how many rigs are you running in...","James M. Lienert","Today we've got 30.","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, we've got total today so...","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I guess, I was trying to refer to kind of outside your traditional CO2 floods...","Stephen I. Chazen","No, no. We've got -- how many -- you take out the Wolfberry wells, how many wells you have, rigs you have?","Edward Arthur Lowe","Without Wolfberry, we've got 17 running.","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, 17 rigs.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And 8 of those are CO2, is that right?","Edward Arthur Lowe","It varies, 6 to 8. We do swap them between primary development and CO2 from time to time.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, got you. I guess -- so the remainder of those kind of spread out in different portions and maybe the Delaware and Midland Basin, if there's any color you kind of add around where the rest of the activity is?","Stephen I. Chazen","It's spread out. And whatever we told you today wouldn't be true a month from now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gammel of Macquarie.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","I have a few questions about Permian but have been answered, but I did want to at least ask you about the CO2 to operations. We continue to think of that as an operation that essentially runs a flattish production profile moving forward. And are you still able to secure the type of CO2 that you've been talking about in recent years? Just given some of the changes in century plant operation and that sort of thing? And then if I just get one more. I think it's been asked. I didn't quite catch the answer to it, are you actually drilling horizontally in the Wolfcamp formation in the Permian right now?","Stephen I. Chazen","Bill will answer the horizontal question. But on the other question is, we would expect that the CO2 production would grow, not be flat. And we have sizable amount of CO2 right now. We've covered the problem with the sand rich plant with some other way. And so I think we're in very good shape on CO2 and the production -- and the CO2 area is actually growing.","William E. Albrecht","Yes. And, Jason, did I answer your horizontal question? We do have a couple of rigs drilling horizontal Wolfcamp wells in addition to a couple of drilling some Bone Springs horizontals.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. Can I follow up just one more, Steve, just on the oil in Bakken. It is a play that you talked about being a little more challenged economically than a lot of the other liquids plays that you have. Is this still something that you're still going to essentially hold onto until economics improve? Or would you potentially be looking to exit that position?","Stephen I. Chazen","We don't plan to exit it. If you look at the United States, say where the oil is, the oil is in California, the oil is in the Permian and the oil is in the Bakken. The Bakken right now, if you think about it, there's labor issues that's basically overwhelmed the small place with the drilling activities. We're effectively looking if we can -- the right price to add to the position and build it out as a long-term resource. Right now, given the other 2 U.S. areas, it's just not -- it might be effective for somebody else to compete for capital, but it's not effective for us to complete for capital. That's why I'm slowing it down, because that money is much better used in either California or West Texas. But over time, it's the Willie Sutton discussion of why we're there because that's where the oil is. So that's real straightforward, and we're domestic oil producer fundamentally.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Sven Del Pozzo of IHS.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Just a couple of questions. On the non-operating wells that you've got in Permian, would you care to name perhaps the top 1 or 2 who's drilling is most likely to influence your overall results?","Stephen I. Chazen","No.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. This question regarding client shale looking at your Slide 27. Is it too early to tell, or is there evidence of an eastward expansion of the play onto the eastern shale from where we've seen most of the industry success thus far?","Stephen I. Chazen","I think it's too early. It's -- I think it's fair to say it's -- at this point, it's interesting and doing reasonably well. To find the limits right now, it's pure speculation.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And then on that Slide 27, I'm not exactly sure what the likely limits it means...","Stephen I. Chazen","It means -- it's around whether it's production and people have been successful. We've provided 2 columns because our view is probably more conservative than the average on what the likely limits are. So we've given you sort of small E&P version on one set of columns and sort of the rational economic one on the second. But we would hope that some of the acreage would move over there. But right now, all you can really say that we would view as highly perspective.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And lastly, regarding NGL prices, at least relative to spot prices, your realization held up quite well comparing to the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. So I'm wondering what are some of the reasons for that? And if they'll persist during the course of 2012?","Stephen I. Chazen","If you look at the pricing, we produce a moderate amount of NGLs here in California. California pricing is fundamentally better than the rest of the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Thanks for all the extra disclosure to be around the Permian. I guess 2 questions. One, within that, if you add in, say, current production of 139,000 in the Permian, add in 39,000 of NGLs, call it 180,000 barrels a day in Q1. As you add rigs and as the CO2 business grows, as you said, what scale do think that business could become in a few years, also the type of growth rate would you expect on the liquid side out of the Permian?","Stephen I. Chazen","I'm probably going to get in trouble if I speculate. But it's gone through another rejuvenation, maybe the fifth or sixth one in my life, maybe more, maybe 10 times, if I would really count them. And this is basically driven by not necessarily new technology or some of that, but really by higher product prices. If product prices hold somewhere in this area. This business is going to grow sharply. I mean every forecast I've ever made for this business, over the Permian over the last 5 or 10 years has been way too low. And so the business is a very large business, larger than a lot of companies, and it will continue to grow at a pretty decent phase, but you should remember that's a large business. And so the absolute growth for the U.S. economy kind of growth is going to be quite sizable. But on a percentage basis, it's not going to be impressive. As impressive as somebody who starts at 20,000 barrels a day. So I can't really answer it, but I would think that it will be commensurate with the growth of the U.S. business. That is to say, it is the core of the company's cash flow generation, so it will grow in line with our U.S. business.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And your comment there if all prices remain robust and the fact that Permian surprised you over time. When you're setting out your sort of overall 5% to 7% growth rate for OXY as a corporation, do you think that you're being conservative and therefore any surprise would be additive to that growth rate?","Stephen I. Chazen","Only I learned over the years, the oil businesses that the well making 2,000 barrels a day and might make 0 tomorrow, but it's definitely not going to make 4,000. And so you've got to be cautious about decline rates and stuff. But the Permian has really gone through a significant rejuvenation, and so we're well positioned to reap that.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And given it's a large business, is 500 million acres enough? I mean in the likely of 570 million, so I'm just doing the math.","Stephen I. Chazen","The actual acreage in Permian is much larger. And so that acreage is closer to 3 million for the whole basin. This is just in this area.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So your view is overtime, other areas perhaps could come into you economic...","Stephen I. Chazen","It is the same formation. I mean, they changed the names to protect the innocent, I guess. But these are the same formations that have been producing for a long time. They just changed the names to make them sound more interesting. And I would guess that over time, the basin has always been very good to us, but certainly very good for the U.S. industry. So I'm bullish on the basin. As you move towards New Mexico, it gets a lot gassier, you should understand. And a lot of people have big acreage positions out that way. And that depends really on your view about gas prices rather than oil prices. We're pretty much an oil company.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So your -- to summary, the 570 million here plus the overall position you have, you feel you can -- you've got enough inventory to grow the Permian, say, for the next 5 to 10 years?","Stephen I. Chazen","At least for the next 10 years. We'd continue to acquire more inventory when it's priced properly.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I'll hand the call back over for any closing remarks.","Stephen I. Chazen","Thank you.","Christopher G. Stavros","Thank you very much.

Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone.","Our first quarter key highlights demonstrate the significant progress we made to increase the value of our business while delivering free cash flow and value-based growth. Our low oil price Breakeven Plan will be achieved in the third quarter, six months ahead of our original estimate. This accelerated schedule has been driven in part by better than expected performance from Permian Resources, which added 18,000 BOE per day this quarter, and is currently on a trajectory to deliver a 47% year-over-year growth rate. This will be accomplished with only 11 operated rigs. We're truly doing more with less, as we demonstrated by our increased guidance in all business segments.","It is important to note that our Breakeven Plan not only provides us with the ability to continue value growth in a low price environment, it delivers significant upside in a higher oil price environment. Slide 8 illustrates how leveraged our Permian EOR business is to higher oil prices. EOR will generate significant incremental cash flow in the prevailing environment.","Similarly, Chemicals and Midstream have been positioned for long-term value creation and are capitalizing on today's pricing and marketing spreads to generate substantial improvements in free cash flow versus our Breakeven Plan. We have increased our full-year guidance for these two businesses, and they're actually capable of generating over $2 billion of annual free cash flow.","As we did last year, we will continue to focus on enhancing our portfolio, increasing the value of our assets, and using technology to drive superior operational performance.","On slide 5, I'd like to point out a few important Permian Resources achievements during the first quarter. First, we continued to bring wells online at basin-leading rates in Greater Sand Dunes, with an average 30-day IP of 31 BOE per day. We also increased new well performance by nearly 50% in our current Barilla Draw development area. Third, to support our growth in the region, we brought online our logistics and supply hub, Project Aventine. We have already started to see the benefits of our differentiated approach in well cost improvement and reliability of well site resources.","Turning to slide 6, our value proposition has not changed; it is enhanced. The achievement of our Breakeven Plan strengthens our ability to provide a meaningful dividend with growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet, and will allow us to resume opportunistic share repurchases.","The part of our value proposition that we have significantly enhanced is our ability to exceed our oil and gas production growth targets with industry-leading returns. The quality of our assets and the depth of our development inventory will enable us to deliver higher returns and higher growth rates within our cash flow from operations. We believe our meaningful dividend with a production growth rate greater than 8% is a unique value proposition within our industry.","My last slide, 7, illustrates the differentiated approach OXY takes in developing our assets. Across our businesses, we are focused on long-term value creation through exceptional technical work, life cycle planning, project execution, and operations focused on maximizing margins.","In our Oil and Gas segment, our goal is to get the most oil out of our rock in the fastest time, at the lowest cost, and to sell at the highest price. This means we start by understanding the potential of the reservoir through enhanced subsurface characterization. This is not only critical to producing the best wells under primary development, but also under future EOR applications.","To ensure the best time-to-market and service costs, we have developed operational capability and technology, created strategic logistic networks and relationships, and built key infrastructure, including our Ingleside oil terminal to access world refining markets. As a result, we believe we are the best-positioned company in the Permian to execute on the value-added growth strategy.","The benefits of our strategy are yielding significant productivity improvements, increased capital efficiency, and better product price realizations. We expect our differentiated approach to result in peer-leading value creation.","I'll now turn the call over to Cedric to review our progress towards the Breakeven Plan and our financial results.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Vicki. I will begin with an update on our Breakeven Plan and then address financial results and 2018 guidance.","On slide 10, we have updated our progress towards our Breakeven Plan at low oil prices. We continue to make substantial progress on our plan and are exceeding targets across our businesses. In an effort to be conservative on sustainable cash flow, we adjusted our first quarter cash flow from operations for a positive seasonality and market-related items in Midstream and Chemicals net of turnarounds in the Middle East, which is represented by the gray bar.","Once we achieve our remaining milestones, we will be well-positioned in the future with the cash flow necessary for our $40 oil price business sustainability and $50 oil price business growth scenarios. But we will continue to operate our business to reduce those breakevens even further.","Slide 11 illustrates our progress towards the Breakeven Plan. In the Chemicals business, the 4CPe plant began contributing to cash flow and will achieve peak operating rate in the third quarter of this year. We categorized additional chemical product pricing improvement as seasonal in the gray bar of other improvements to maintain conservatism in our plan.","In the Midstream business, the Midland to Gulf Coast spread for the first quarter came within our guidance at $3.12 per barrel. Additional Midstream margin improvements for crude export, gas processing, and crude inventory sales were categorized as seasonal in the gray bar of other improvements. We also had planned turnarounds in the Middle East which reduced quarterly cash flow but will be back to normal rates in the second quarter of this year.","In the Permian Resources business, we grew 18,000 BOE a day sequentially, leaving 32,000 BOE a day to achieve our Breakeven Plan goal. Jody will give additional guidance on the timing of new wells online and production.","Shifting to our quarterly financial and operating results on slide 13, I'd like to start with our production results. Total reported production for the first quarter was 609,000 BOEs a day, which exceeded the high end of our guidance of 603,000 BOEs a day. Much of this was driven by execution and well productivity in Permian Resources, which came in well above the high end of guidance at 177,000 BOEs a day.","International also contributed to the production beat, with our planned first quarter turnarounds at Al Hosn and Dolphin ahead of schedule and successful step-out wells in Colombia. Total international production came in at 273,000 BOEs a day, above the high end of guidance of 271,000 BOEs a day, even after 2,000 BOEs a day of production impacts from production-sharing contracts.","Earnings improved across all segments, and our first quarter reported and core EPS was $0.92 per share. Improvements in the Oil and Gas segment were mainly attributed to higher oil prices and lower DD&A rates. Realized oil prices increased by 14%, and our DD&A rate for the first quarter was 10% lower than the average 2017 DD&A rate.","Operating cash flow before working capital improved sequentially to nearly $1.7 billion, due to higher oil prices along with higher Permian Resources production as well as higher contributions from the Chemicals and Midstream segments.","We spent $1 billion in capital during the first quarter, in line with our full-year capital plan of $3.9 billion. We issued $1 billion in debt to retire $500 million of notes that were due in February and for general corporate purposes.","Working capital changes included cash payments typical of the first quarter, including property tax and payments against our fourth quarter accruals. Our Chemicals and Marketing businesses also experienced a working capital draw, as a result of a receivable build due to higher prices and volumes.","Chemicals first quarter core earnings of $298 million came in above guidance of $250 million. Pricing for caustic soda and other products continued to increase, as global demand remained robust and purchased ethylene prices declined throughout the quarter.","Midstream first quarter core earnings of $179 million also came in well above our guidance. Included is a gain on the sale of a domestic gas plant for $43 million.","Excluding the gain, Midstream reflected improved earnings from crude exports, gas processing, and higher equity income from the Plains All American investment. The better than expected result also included income from items considered timing-related such as crude inventory sales.","Our updated guidance is provided on slide 15. With respect to full-year 2018, we raised our total production range in spite of a negative production-sharing contract impact of about 5,000 BOEs a day since our first quarter guidance. The increase to the Permian Resources production range was mainly attributable to improved new well productivity. Jody will give additional detail on the outlook for our Permian Resources business.","International production is expected to benefit from Al Hosn volumes ramping back up to average 66,000 to 69,000 BOEs a day during the second quarter and 83,000 BOEs a day in the third quarter. Qatar will have planned downtime during the second quarter, which we expect to impact production by approximately 6,000 BOEs a day. Our guidance now assumes $63 WTI and $67 Brent prices for the second through fourth quarters. The guidance for the total year capital budget is maintained at $3.9 billion.","In Midstream, our improved second quarter and full-year guidance reflects the significant increases in Permian to Gulf Coast spreads. In Chemicals, our guidance increases primarily are due to higher caustic soda prices, and we now assume that they remain at current levels.","Our DD&A expense for the Oil and Gas is lower as a result of lower finding and development costs last year. First quarter domestic operating expense was up slightly over last quarter due to front-end loaded workover and maintenance activities in Permian EOR.","Lower operating costs in Permian Resources, which are forecasted to average under $7 per BOE, are expected to be offset by higher costs in Permian EOR for oil price-sensitive purchased injectant and higher energy-related costs. We have updated our guidance for the total company effective tax rate to 32% in 2018, which reflects higher earnings from our domestic Oil and Gas business.","To close, we are off to a great start to the year, and we expect to reach a major milestone with the achievement of the Breakeven Plan in the third quarter. We are significantly ahead of schedule right now and will evaluate opportunistic uses of excess cash flow that we expect to be generated in the remainder of the year. These could include sustaining current activity levels in Permian Resources, improving our balance sheet through net debt reduction, and more investment in international and Permian EOR.","Last and certainly not least, we now intend to resume our longstanding share repurchase program this year. As a reminder, we have approximately 64 million shares remaining in our buyback program authorized by our Board of Directors. Since the inception of the program, we have repurchased approximately 121 million shares for nearly $9 billion.","I'll now turn the call over to Jody.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Cedric, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll provide an update on the continued improvements in our Permian operations and the progress we've made in delivering high-margin production growth to contribute to our Breakeven Plan.","2018 is off to a great start. Our value-based development approach continues to deliver record wells, and operational improvements are lowering cost and reducing time to market.","On slide 18, you'll see that our Permian Resources New Mexico team delivered another quarter of play-leading results. We turned 16 new Greater Sand Dunes wells to production that averaged 30-day rates of 3,100 BOE per day, which is in line with the step change in productivity that began in the second half of 2017. I also want to highlight a two-well pad in the Wolfcamp XY bench that delivered an average 30-day peak rate over 10,000 BOE per day. As shown on slide 50 in the appendix, many of these record wells in New Mexico were stimulated with significantly less proppant than the industry average, which results in lower well costs and higher full-cycle value.","We continue to integrate our vast seismic data with improved geomechanic and petrophysical analysis that enable us to land the wells in the best part of the rock and stimulate the rock with a customized frac. Our customized stimulation designs rely on our subsurface characterization workflows and data analytics to balance well productivity with incremental cost, ensuring we're developing each section for maximum value.","Lastly in New Mexico, we continue to appraise and delineate our acreage across Greater Sand Dunes. We delivered one Second and one Third Bone Spring appraisal well in a field called Red Tank in the northern part of Greater Sand Dunes, which delivered an average 30-day peak rate of 2,300 BOE per day per well. We're excited about these results, as they provide additional low-breakeven inventory for future growth.","On slide 19, we've updated our Permian Resources quarterly production guidance and increased the midpoint for total year by 2,000 BOE per day. Production in the first quarter of 177,000 BOE per day was above the high-end guidance, which was driven by better than expected well results in Greater Sand Dunes and Greater Barilla Draw and less downtime than expected from artificial lift installations on many new wells. Many of the artificial lift installations scheduled for the first quarter were delayed to the second quarter, as pressure in the new wells remained high and were able to flow longer without intervention. We expect to install lift on these wells in the second quarter, and the associated downtime is included in our production guidance.","Turning to slide 20, I'll provide an update on Aventine, our maintenance and logistics hub located in southeast New Mexico. Since this one-of-a-kind facility the Permian began operations in February, we have received sand from 14 separate unit trains and supplied sand for 31 completions across Texas and New Mexico. In March, the Oil Country Tubular Goods part of the facility became operational and has since received approximately 1,400 tons of pipe, with over 1,000 tons delivered by rail. We also began servicing wells with the new Sandstorm system, which has reduced the number of trucks required to supply sand to the well site and reduced the amount of time each truck takes to unload.","While the facility has started providing cost savings for our new wells, it also plays an important role in ensuring we can execute our plan. As activity has ramped up, we've been able to avoid logistics and supply problems by servicing our wells from Aventine. We expect this facility will be fully operational by the end of the third quarter, providing a competitive advantage for us in the Permian.","Finally, on slide 22, we're delivering operational execution improvements that are reducing the costs of our wells and accelerating production by reducing time to market. We've increased drilled feet per day 23% in New Mexico and 17% in Texas since the first half of 2017. These efficiencies are a result of better well designs and improved well site operations from our proprietary OXY drilling dynamics.","We've also seen improvements in our completions in New Mexico, where we achieved a 19% improvement in stages pumped per day compared to the first half of 2017. These first quarter improvements demonstrate our strong executional capabilities and provide a foundation for us to bring online the wells we forecasted for the year with the potential for upside.","2018 will be a great year for our domestic assets. Our Permian EOR business will continue to generate significant free cash flow while finding innovative ways to operate mature fields at lower cost. Permian Resources is growing high-margin production at the lowest capital intensity level in its history and providing cash flow for long-term sustainability. And thanks to investment in our Midstream business, we're positioned to maximize price realizations with oil and gas transportation agreements to the Gulf Coast, with volumes in excess of our current equity production. Lastly, we're also continuing to build future opportunities by advancing our understanding of EOR in unconventional rocks and will provide updates in future calls.","I'll now turn the call over to Vicki.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Jody.","I'd like to close by congratulating two members of our team on role changes. Richard Jackson will be moving into Jody's team to lead our operations support groups. Richard has been an incredible asset for the Investor Relations team and will continue to be actively involved with our IR activity. He has done an incredible job to change our communication and sharing our story with our investors and shareholders.","Replacing Richard as VP of Investor Relations is Jeff Alvarez. Jeff most recently led the Permian Resources Texas\/Delaware business unit as President and General Manager. Jeff's extensive international and domestic experience has prepared him to be our investment community spokesperson. Richard and Jeff have a long working history together and will be transitioning over the next few months.","We'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning, and congratulations to Richard and Jeff. Vicki, share repurchases have not been vocally high in the pecking order for use of free cash. Can you talk to how you and the board will determine the magnitude and the timing of share repurchase and whether you view repurchases as more temporary to deploy excess free cash flow from above mid-cycle margins in Midstream and PetChem versus something more ongoing as an augmentation to OXY's dividend?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","It's important to note that historically, we've always had a very active share buyback program. And as Cedric mentioned, from 2005 to 2015, we had bought back about $9 billion in shares. That's while we were paying a dividend over that time period of about $17 billion. That dividend that we paid over that time period had a CAGR of almost 14%. So even though we pay a healthy dividend, share buybacks are a part of our cash flow priorities. And in fact, in our last presentation on slide 6 for the last quarter, we had listed that share buybacks would be a possibility in an environment above $60.","The reason we haven't talked about it here recently is the fact that we wanted to get a line of sight to see whether or not prices were going to remain that healthy, and we also wanted to get closer to our Breakeven Plan to resume our buyback program. As for the amount, as Cedric said, we have quite a volume of share repurchases that were authorized by the board for us to make. We'll begin those this year, but it really depends on the market conditions, pricing, and other opportunities.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And then to shift on my follow-up to the Permian, you're planning an acceleration in the number of Permian Resources wells brought online in the second and third quarters, and you've guided to an acceleration in production and growth in the third and fourth quarters. What are the moving pieces around that and potential upsides? What type of well productivity improvements, if any, have you factored in versus what you're seeing? And how should we think about the natural decline rates in Permian Resources?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Brian, this is Jody. Good morning. We tend to take a cautious approach to updating our type curves and projections on new wells. So as we get data beyond the 24-hour IP, beyond the 30-day IP, we really want to start seeing consistency in the 6-month cumes or even the 1-year cumes we start moving up our type curves. So some of that is baked into this forward guidance.","The wells online count, we're confident about that, given all the investment in Aventine and the logistics work and the improvements in our execution. The variability in those numbers is really just the fact that a lot of these land right at the end of the quarter, and so a few wells moving in or a few wells moving out changes your count, but it doesn't appreciably change your production forecast.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks and congratulations, everyone, on the strong results.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","I wanted to start with just a point of clarification on the Midstream. But just to confirm here, the slides show that for every $0.25 per barrel widening in the spread, that's another $45 million of cash flow annualized to the Midstream, which is clear. However, there is I believe a partial offset in terms of your upstream realizations. So can you just confirm for us what that sensitivity is on a net basis to OXY at the corporate level, inclusive of the Midstream benefits but also accounting for the hit to the upstream realizations? I just want to make sure that we're triangulating to the right bottom line, as the guidance is premised upon a $6 to $7 spread, obviously, but we're currently sitting closer to $15 on a spot basis.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Guy, this is Cedric, and that's a good question. The net is about $30 million, so the $45 million minus the $15 million.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, great.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think that answered it.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, perfect. And then for my follow-up here, I wanted to ask an ops question. But, Jody, you alluded to this, and you have a slide on this in the back of your deck, slide 50, I believe. But you highlight how you all drilled some of the most prolific wells in the basin in the last 12 months with a step function improvement in the recent quarters, yet you're seeming to do that without any meaningful increases in your completion intensity and at a completion intensity that's well below average for peers. So that appears to bode pretty well for your capital efficiency. So can you just talk about that dynamic in a little bit more detail? I'm just trying to better understand the sustainability there and what you're seeing leading edge on the capital efficiency front.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Guy, thanks for the question. This all really starts with subsurface characterization. It's what we've been talking about over the last year of improvements on geomechanics and geochemistry and integrating our seismic and advancing our petrophysical modeling to better understand what we call flow units, and then how those flow units will behave with a stimulation. That leads to then a better stimulation design that's customized for basically each well.","But from that customization comes efficiency gains built around standardization. So all of the execution with leveraging Aventine, with how we execute in the field, delivery of sand, the commercial arrangements that support that then turn something that's very customized into something that's very manufacturing-oriented. So the combination of those things is really what's driving what we believe is play-leading capital efficiency.","The other piece in the middle that I want to highlight is what the team does in the area of field development planning. So they take all of those attributes and then optimize what's the best way to develop the field or the different flow units. Do we do them concurrently? Do we do them individually? How do you pace the rigs, how many rigs, how many frac cores? And there's many, many iterations on trying to optimize that, and the ultimate goal is maximum value per section.","And so our teams have gotten very, very good at that, but they also retain flexibility in those field development plans, so as we have new learnings, we have surprises, both positive and negative, we can adjust those plans accordingly. So we really are hitting on all cylinders from subsurface through execution at the wellhead.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's great stuff. Thank you and congrats to you as well, Richard.","Richard A. Jackson - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Guy.","Operator","The next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, hi. Good morning. Congratulations on a strong quarter. First question is just on the capital spending for this year. If I look at the Permian specifically, the wells online in the first quarter are a fairly small percentage of the total-year plan. But the CapEx in the Permian, if I just take your guidance from the fourth quarter call, divide it by four, is tracking ahead of that. But I just want to get an understanding of how \u2013 it sounds like it was in line with your own expectations, but I just wanted to get an understanding of how you think about how that plays out. And if you could maybe just dovetail in the comments about potentially looking to spend more capital to sustain activity levels in the international investments that you talked about.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, I'll let Jody cover a little bit more of the lumpiness of the Resources business and what we had expected to see in the beginning of the year. But when we laid out our program, we intentionally designed it so that toward the end of the year we would have the flexibility to ramp down, and that's built into the capital program for 2018. What we wanted to do is to have the flexibility to ramp down to our $3.3 billion capital in 2019 if we were seeing a $50 environment, which is what we had talked about.","Since we're not sure what pricing will do in 2019 and we want to stay within cash flow with our capital programs in the future, we haven't set that yet. So what you're seeing is an upfront-loaded 2018 capital. With respect to how the wells fit into that, I'll let Jody talk about that.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, when you think about the plan for this year, the front end is considerably loaded with more facility activity. In fact, in the second quarter, we'll be commissioning two large facilities in New Mexico. And so as you move through the year, even though some of the well count is going up on the completion side, you're offsetting that with less facility spending. The wells are also the place where all of these efficiencies, the benefits of Aventine which are just starting and which will grow over the year, start coming into play.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And if I could just clarify, Vicki, on the second part of that question around the activity levels and the potential for further investment in international and EOR, is that something that would lead to spending above the $3.9 billion for the year at this stage?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","At this point, we haven't made any decisions regarding that. But what I will assure you is that we have flexibility. We have a vast inventory of not only things to do in the Permian but internationally. Our opportunities are pretty much unlimited at this point with respect to what we're seeing.","But for the program this year, we haven't made any decision yet to increase our capital. What we would consider doing at the most probably would be to sustain the activity level we have at this point, but we haven't made that decision yet. We'll see how things look over the next few months.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, okay. And then my follow-up was just around the balance sheet. In past quarters, you've had slides there where you've talked about asset sales as a means of bridging some of your spending gap, which obviously at higher prices isn't as necessary. But does that mean that you're not looking to monetize these assets anymore? And just in general, when you talked about your debt reduction objective, what would be the goal at this stage? Where do you want gross debt or net debt, whatever metric you would choose to go by?","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Got it. This is Cedric, Phil. On monetizations, we'll always be looking at high-grading, improving our portfolio. If there are things that we can get a good value for that aren't core or strategic to us, then we certainly would be looking at those kind of exits, like what we just did in the first quarter with the gas plant. It really wasn't \u2013 we got a good price for it, and it wasn't essential to what we needed to do. In a lot of those particularly Midstream areas, we can contractually cover our needs just as easily. You don't necessarily have to own the asset. So there aren't any big plans necessarily, but at the same time we'll always be opportunistic with improving our portfolio.","With respect to the balance sheet and debt, we don't have a precise target other than we want to be at the strong side of the group within the peer group. We've got a good credit rating and a good strong balance sheet, and we would like to make some improvements to it. But there's nothing that's kind of a must-have. So improving the net debt with some of the organic cash flow we expect to be generating over the next few quarters is also on the list of things we'd like to do.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Richard, you're not going to get rid of us that easily, but good luck in your new role. But two quick questions, if I can (34:41-34:54).","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I'm sorry, Doug, but you're cutting out. Could you try to repeat that question for us, please?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry, I apologize. Can you hear me now?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yes.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So when I saw you last, you talked about achieving the milestone for cash breakeven as a potential turning point for the new OXY strategy going forward. I'm just wondering what you think is the right level of growth for a company of your size. What do you think your portfolio can support?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think what the portfolio can support and what's appropriate and prudent to do are maybe two different things. Our portfolio would support significant growth rates. But we believe that a growth rate certainly above 8% is where we can be very efficiently and effective, and we think that that's the growth rate that would be appropriate for our dividend level and for the other cash flow priorities we have, as we mentioned earlier, buybacks.","I'm not sure where that ultimate number would be. It really depends on how efficient we get and what types of projects come up. But certainly, one of the things we always want to do is stay within cash flow, so it will be somewhat driven by prices.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate that. That was, just to be clear, compared to the current 5% to 8% target, right?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","That's right, because currently, we've averaged 5% to 8% over the years. We now have the capability to go well above that. And how far above that we go, to say it more clearly, is going to be dependent on prices and cash available.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. My follow-up is probably for Cedric, if you can still hear me. Cedric, buybacks and dividend growth go hand in hand, meaning that on a per-share basis, buybacks amplify dividend growth, so I'm just curious. How do you think about the dividend policy going forward in the context of restarting the buyback program? Is that a per-share growth target on the dividend or an absolute target on the dividend amount? I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Doug. No, on dividends, really our philosophy has not changed. We are absolutely committed to the dividend, as we've proven through the downturn, not just sustaining it but growing it at a modest rate. It will be dependent on our view of \u2013 a dividend is long-term commitment. Share buybacks are more opportunistic. This may be the way to say it.","But on the dividend, we would look to continue with modest increases. Because it's a long-term, permanent commitment, if you will, the dividend, we look to do that at a more mid-cycle price. So today plus or minus $50 is what we have in mind. So with the higher price, as we showed last quarter on slide 6 of last quarter's presentation, buybacks come into play when you're in a significantly higher price than $50.","So we run our business on a $40 to $50 price deck in terms of being prepared for lower prices, running a low-cost business, and then look for dividend increases as we continue to improve our efficiencies, our well productivity. The Aventine, all the things we've been talking about to drive our breakevens lower, we'll continue to do that. And that's what will position us potentially for further dividend increases.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answer. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","The next question is from Leo Mariani of NatAlliance Securities. Please go ahead.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","Hey, guys. I just wanted to follow up on one of the earlier comments that you guys made. Obviously, your breakeven has been pushed forward to the third quarter. Obviously, that's nice. You talked about potentially higher CapEx later in the year. But you specifically said that that would likely be portioned over to international EOR. I just wanted to get your thought on that. Why those areas versus Permian Resources, for example, do you see better returns in international EOR? What's the thought behind that?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","So for 2018, if we increased our capital, it would be not beyond the program we currently have planned for international. Any increase in capital this year would be to just sustain the Permian Resources business. We do have some capital allocated to our international assets to do some appraisal work and evaluations for a little more aggressive program internationally in 2019, if prices permit, but that's probably what you're talking about is just the work to set up those programs for 2019.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess with respect to the Aventine hub, obviously you guys have put a lot of time and effort onto getting that up and running. If you were to do a bit of a lookback and project forward, is there any way to quantify what you might be able to save in terms of Permian Resources well cost? Is there any way to say look, once this is fully up and running by the end of the year, we can save 10%? Is there any way to quantify that?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Leo, this is Jody. Thanks for the question. I think we've stated $500,000 to $750,000 a well impact when we're up and running. But the concept of Aventine actually wasn't just well cost focus. It was also securing supply. And so we're really getting multiple benefits out of Aventine. Clearly, we think we will drive costs down. We have already shown that securing supply during this tight period has been very, very helpful, not just in New Mexico, but supporting contingency sand deliveries in Texas as well.","The other part that really starts growing over time are the efficiencies that are gained because we've got all of our strategic partners in place that we can start whittling out all of the inefficiencies, the wasted motion, which does two things. It lowers our well cost and shortens time to market. But for our partners, it drives up their utilization. So their profit per frac core, per rig crew, per flowback unit, all of those things go up because we're more efficient than the industry average. And so the result of that is less pressure on price increase because they're driving higher margins. That's how we look at it. The number we've talked about is $500,000 to $750,000 a well. We think there's upside as the teams mature, not just in the physical assets but how we work the process.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Morris of Citi. Please go ahead.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you, good morning, Vicki and team. Congratulations on the continued improvement in the Delaware Basin wells.","My first question is you raised the guidance on the Midstream pre-tax income, and that's based on an assumed spread of $7 to $8 from Midland to the Gulf Coast for the rest of the year. But that spread is currently around $15, and the strip on that is similarly wide. Would you or could you \u2013 have you given any thought to hedging that or trying to lock that in? Because that would be significant incremental cash flow that then you could use for the share buyback or otherwise.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I would say, Bob, up to this point this quarter, we're seeing an average of just a little more than $8. So while it might seem like we're being conservative, it's really based on some information, and some of the spikes we're seeing go well above that, but we're not sure we'll see that. But with respect to your question, I'll pass that to Cedric.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Bob, I'd love to lock in $15 if we could. The truth is there's no market really for hedging those differentials. It's very thin and short-term and just really non-existent. So it's a volatile market. Its outlook is difficult to predict. As we've seen, the primary driver is pipeline utilization, which we expect to continue to be high until these new pipes come on, particularly in the second half of 2019. But as it stands, hedging is just not really an option available to us.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I suspected the market was pretty thin. And obviously, it would be nice to be able to lock that in. My follow-on question is I know you did mention you'd be opportunistic on non-core asset sales. You did say last quarter you expected to execute on some non-core asset sales this year. Has either the recent deal at a very high per-acre value or the widening in these Midland differentials change your view or approach on executing on non-core asset sales this year?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","No, it's still the same. We will look for opportunities, and the opportunities have to be compelling enough to execute on. But we're still continuing to look at ways to monetize those things that are noncore to us.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. Again, congratulations. Thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Portillo of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, all. Jody, you highlighted the value proposition of the Aventine logistics hub in the northern Delaware Basin, which appears to have a strong competitive advantage regionally. I was wondering if you see similar logistics potential in the southern Delaware and in the Midland Basin.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Matt, we sure do, but in a different scale. Actually, the one in the southern Delaware Basin is called Palatine, and it's more of a contractual relationship on sand trans-load. Midland Basin, there's more access to infrastructure, and so you could service Midland out of either Palatine or direct from some of the regional sand mines that are coming online. It's a little less exposed, plus our activity set is considerably lower in Midland. So we're really focusing on the Delaware Basin to ensure we have logistics, maintenance capabilities, those kind of things that are more regional to the activity to take out trucks, to take out inefficiency and downtime.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And the follow-up question is actually around your export business. As pipeline capacity ramps towards Corpus, you mentioned industry volumes will continue to increase, allowing you to expand your Ingleside dock capacity for crude oil. My question actually revolves around your LPG asset base. I know OXY mothballed that facility due to lack of propane access. And I was wondering with some of the new greenfield NGL pipes potentially heading southbound if you see the potential to bring this asset back into service.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We stay aware of all the activity in the area, and we're just keeping a watchful eye to determine at what point. We believe at some point that could be an opportunity for us, but we don't see that now. We're really focused more on expanding the oil export part of that. However, we're going to stay opportunistic with respect to how those pipelines play out and what opportunities might come our way.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you very much.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Muhammed Ghulam - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, this is Muhammed on behalf of Pavel. Thank you for taking the questions. First of all, when the buyback eventually does start, how should we think about it? Should it be a flex variable, as in will it remain relatively constant, or flex up or down with free cash flow?","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think the way to think of it, Muhammed, is opportunistic. We're going to be looking at \u2013 there's a competition for capital around here, and that's one great use of capital, but we'll look at reinvestment and other options as well. And obviously, we'll be looking at the value of the shares. So periods of weakness and things like that, we certainly could step in, but we'll be opportunistic with those buybacks.","Muhammed Ghulam - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","A follow-up on a different topic. The Middle East, it's now been almost a year since the economic embargo against Qatar started. You've said in the past there hasn't really been a significant impact on you guys. Is that still the same, or have there been any changes?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","No, that's still the same. It never really impacted our business very much, and I think Qatar in general has made a lot of changes to the way the country now manages that. And so we don't expect, didn't see any, and don't expect to see any problems with any of our operations.","Muhammed Ghulam - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's all for me, thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Am I on?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Good morning. Yes, you're on.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Okay, I just wanted to make sure. Kind of blank there. Maybe to follow up on the dividend question that hasn't been quite beaten to death, Cedric, if you look at your debt and thinking about the period we've just been through here of focusing more on cash flow neutrality in a low oil price environment than where we are today, do you look at any of your long-term debt and evaluate that as something you might prefer to retire rather than buy back shares?","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Certainly, we would look at that, have looked at it. We know the terms, so that's it. That is one option that we could consider down the road. So again, framing it, hopefully we've laid this out pretty clearly, but we have a plan that we're about to achieve that means we can pretty much in any reasonable oil price scenario stay within the guardrails of cash flow. And then with that, we've laid our priorities, and net debt improvement is one of them.","And so in the short term, it likely means building cash a little bit because most of our debt is termed out, as you've noted. But there are ways to bring that in and make some reductions there too over time. But again, in that area we'd be opportunistic. I've worked on in the past debt buybacks and even a defeasance, and a defeasance is probably the last thing we'd want to do. They tend to be expensive, but there are ways to bring that debt in, and that's something we would look at over time should the cash flow continue to stay at a high level.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks, and then maybe two quick questions on the Permian. This call, no comments or, at least that I saw in the presentation, anything on acreage swaps or additions or anything. Is that an indication the markets slowed down or just a quarterly kind of event?","And then the other question was, if you could help us, just because it's been quite a while since we've had to think about high oil prices having an impact on EOR ops or OpEx, what exactly is exposed, what the percentage, maybe the right way to think about how that stair-steps in, in a higher oil price environment.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Roger, no. The first question on acreage trades, no, there's still a lot of activity there. Last year we did about 17,000 net acres in trades, and in the first quarter we've done 11,000. So there's still a desire to core up, be able to drill longer laterals, leverage your larger positions.","With regard to EOR OpEx, it's primarily two things. It's energy, so as the cost of electricity goes up, you have some exposure to energy. And then some of the CO2 contracts have an oil price relationship. We can follow up with you later on trying to help model that a little closer. But the things we control with well work and activity, that's all managed pretty well and not so exposed to inflation. Our improvement activities typically offset any inflation.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Roger, sorry, this is Cedric. I just want to add one thing just for clarification. The first quarter financials, in our cash flow you'll see $177 million of acquisitions and $275 million of sales. We talked about the roughly $150 million Delaware Basin gas plant sale, which was non-core, in that sale number, but the other piece of it was really the swap. So really the acquisition, we just broke \u2013 the way we did from an accounting standpoint, we broke both the acquisition and the sale out in the financial statement. But it really was done as one deal and it was essentially a swap, a large one.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","And the other thing I'd add, Roger, about EOR is that we put the slide in there to show you it's leveraged to oil. And the reason for that is that it's about 80% liquids. And so on a BOE basis, we have a higher liquid \u2013 higher oil production from EOR on a BOE basis. So that's why it's that margin for \u2013 even though OpEx will go up a little bit, we really benefit from higher oil prices in the EOR business.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I appreciate that.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Gammel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yes, thanks very much. I just wanted to come back to the updated guidance on the Midstream, which obviously a very significant increase. I realize that most of it is due to differential. But if I just take the midpoint change in the differential, multiply it by the $45 million rule of thumb, which sounds like maybe I should be using $30 million, I get to about $625 million versus the $750 million step-up in the guidance. So I was wondering if you could talk about any other factors that are positively affecting your outlook for the Midstream this year.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Certainly, the Midstream business has more than just that \u2013 those contracts related to the takeaway. The export terminal in particular has been doing fantastic this year. As you know, we're a leader in that area, and so I think it would probably be the other thing I'd point to more specifically.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","So that's the ability to capture the arbitrage between, let's say, Brent and Corpus Christi pricing or something along that one?","Richard A. Jackson - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","This is Richard. I may help with one piece of that. I wanted to clarify. The $45 million per $0.25 change, the Midstream segment fully benefits from that. The $30 million is really our upstream production that's based on Midland pricing, and so you'll see that in our realizations and our production schedules. So you do need to take the full $45 million and apply it to Midstream, and that's the benefit.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay, thanks. That is to say even that would be a fairly significant uplift relative to just the rule of thumb that you're giving in guidance. But maybe if I could just transition, your comments around essentially pipeline utilization rates being very high and not really much relief until midyear next year, I know you're only giving guidance for 2018. But should we be able to extrapolate that Midstream is looking to have a pretty good first half of 2019 earnings period as well?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yes, that's our view. If you look at the alternatives, rail would be great, but it's got an $8 a barrel range, but that's limited today to around 100,000 to 150,000 barrels a day in terms of rail capacity. I think there will be efforts to try to increase that, but it's difficult to do. And then trucking \u2013 by the way, slide 63 lays this out pretty well for you.","And then trucking, again, it's a higher cost with around $12 or so a barrel. So those would be some upper limits you might think about. However, with trucking, we've all seen bottlenecks there. The roads are crowded and in disarray, and getting trucks and getting truck drivers even is a difficult thing to do. So as we've said, the outlook for spreads is difficult to predict. It's going to be bouncy for a while as all of the takeaway systems are being stretched to their limits.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","That's really very useful. Thanks very much.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","You bet.","Operator","And the final question today comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks, a lot of mine have been addressed. I guess just one I wanted to hit on, on the Aventine facility, I guess dovetailing off of the comment on crude-by-rail. Is there any opportunity to I guess convert any of that facility into a crude-by-rail terminal, and to what extent might there be any interest in doing that on you all's end?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Michael, this is Jody. You've got to recall, we have 2.5 times our equity oil production volume that we can move on pipe. So for us, we wouldn't likely consider that as an option. We really see this more as an operational facility to support right now mostly the capital side of the business. Then as you go through the full life cycle, it will support the operating cost side of the facility as well.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, I guess I was thinking about it from a marketing business angle, so that was another way to capture even more potential upside from the current situation, but it sounds like no. And then I guess the other piece is just on local sand usage. To what extent, if at all, are you guys testing that in the Delaware Basin in particular is I guess where I'm curious.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Hey, Michael, we see application of local sand in both the southern Delaware and the Midland Basin. Our preferred sand provider is coming online now with their local sand mines, so we will start utilizing more local sand as a percentage of the total. We've the background work, the geoscience work, the lab work and all to test different sands, different sand quality, so we're comfortable applying those. It's just a matter of getting more activity in the local sand market.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Great, I appreciate it.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vicki Hollub for closing remarks.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I'd like to leave you with three takeaways today. First, we are ahead of schedule for achieving our Breakeven Plan. Second, our first quarter outperformance and improving business results have led us to increase our full-year guidance.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Christopher Stavros. Please go ahead, sir.","Christopher G. Stavros","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental Petroleum's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call this morning from Los Angeles are Steve Chazen, Oxy's President and Chief Executive Officer; Cynthia Walker, our Chief Financial Officer; Vicki Hollub, Executive Vice President and Head of our California Oil and Gas operations; Willie Chiang, Oxy's EVP of Operations and Head of our Midstream business; Bill Albrecht, the President of Oxy's Oil and Gas operations in the Americas; and Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas business.","In just a moment, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Cynthia Walker, who'll review our financial and operating results for this year's second quarter. Steve Chazen will then follow with an update on our production growth strategy, progress on our operating costs and capital efficiency initiatives and guidance on our production and capital program for the back half of the year. Certainly, the highlight of this quarter's conference call will come from Vicki Hollub, who will provide a thorough review of our California oil and gas operations, including the abundant opportunities we have to grow that business over the long term while providing strong financial returns.","As a reminder, today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Cynthia, please go ahead.","Cynthia L. Walker","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us on our call today. During my comments, I'll reference several slides in the conference call materials that, as Chris mentioned, are available on our website.","Overall, in the second quarter, we continued the trend of solid execution seen in the first quarter. We produced 772,000 barrels per day, essentially in line with our expectation, adjusting for certain events during the quarter. Our operating cost and capital efficiency programs remain on track. We had core earnings of $1.3 billion, or $1.58 per diluted share.","For the 6 months of 2013, we generated $6.4 billion of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital, and we ended the quarter with $3.1 billion of cash on our balance sheet.","If you turn to Slide 3, you'll see a summary of our earnings for the quarter. As I just mentioned, core income was slightly under $1.3 billion, or $1.58 per diluted share. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, the current quarter reflected improved oil and gas results, driven by higher oil volumes, offset by lower earnings in the marketing and trading businesses, largely due to commodity price movements during the quarter, and higher equity compensation expense resulting from an improved stock price.","I'll now discuss the segment performance for the oil and gas business and begin with earnings on Slide 4. Oil and gas earnings for the second quarter of 2013 were $2.1 billion. And as you can see, this was an increase over both the first quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2012. On a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, improvements came from higher oil volumes, in particular, in the Middle East and North Africa business, following the resumption of production after facility turnarounds in Qatar and Dolphin. We also experienced better realized domestic oil and gas prices, although they were offset by lower realized international oil prices. Improvement in domestic realized prices is mainly attributable to the easing of oversupply in the Permian. This significantly improved differentials for our Permian oil production. There was also a modest increase in exploration expense.","Moving to Slide 5, you'll see a breakdown of production changes during the quarter. As I mentioned, production was 772,000 barrels per day. This is an increase of 9,000 barrels over the first quarter and 6,000 barrels over the year-ago quarter. On a sequential quarterly basis, these results reflect the resumption of production in Qatar and Dolphin and growth in our California business as a result of our drilling program. Elsewhere domestically, we saw the impact of natural decline due to our reduced natural gas drilling activity. Also reflected are the impacts of weather and planned gas plant turnarounds in our Permian business as well as insurgent activity in Colombia. These events combined to reduce production by about 7,000 barrels per day during the quarter.","Also, on a year-over-year basis, full cost recovery and other adjustments under our production sharing and similar contracts reduced production by about 8,000 barrels per day. The impact on a sequential quarterly basis was not significant.","Overall, while there were a number of events that impacted production this quarter, we see the underlying business is performing essentially as we expected.","If you turn to Slide 6, I'll discuss our domestic production in a bit more detail. Our domestic production was 470,000 barrels per day, a decrease of 8,000 barrels per day from the first quarter of 2013, driven by the factors illustrated on the previous slide. And this was an increase of 8,000 barrels per day from the second quarter of 2012.","Focusing on our commodity composition, our oil production was essentially flat versus the first quarter, adjusting for the effects of the severe weather in the Permian. Our natural gas and NGL volumes were 5,000 barrels per day lower than the first quarter, excluding the impact of planned gas plant turnarounds. This reduction primarily reflects natural decline in the Mid-Continent due to lower drilling activity and third-party processing bottlenecks in the Permian.","In total, sales volumes were 764,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2013 compared to 746,000 barrels per day in the first quarter. Middle East\/North Africa sales volumes were 31,000 barrels per day higher, mostly due to the timing of liftings as well as the effects of the first quarter maintenance turnarounds.","Our overall sales volumes were lower than production volumes during the quarter due to the timing of liftings. The pickup in insurgent activity in Colombia caused a delay in 2 large liftings scheduled around the end of June. In total, delayed liftings reduced the second quarter pretax earnings by approximately $75 million, or about $0.06 per diluted share on an after-tax basis.","We expect the third quarter liftings in Colombia to be at their normalized level, barring any pickup in insurgent activity in the third quarter.","Our realized prices for the quarter and the comparison to benchmark prices are summarized on Slide 7. Compared to the first quarter, our worldwide crude oil realized price was almost flat. As you can see, the reduction in Brent was offset by improved realizations for our Permian production.","We continued to experience weakness in NGL pricing domestically, which contributed to a 4% decrease in worldwide NGL realized prices, while domestic natural gas realized prices experienced a 24% increase, driven by improvement in the benchmark. You'll also note that we updated our price sensitivities.","Next, I will cover production costs on Slide 8. Oil and gas production costs were $13.40 per barrel in the second quarter. For the first 6 months of 2013, production costs were $13.66 per barrel compared to $14.99 per barrel for the full year of 2012. The largest improvement was seen in our domestic operations, where production costs were $3.26 per barrel lower in the first month -- first 6 months of 2013 from the full year of 2012. This represents annualized cost savings of over $500 million, exceeding our previously stated goals.","International production costs have remained fairly consistent with 2012 levels, excluding the impact of facility turnarounds in Qatar and Dolphin, which affected the first quarter.","Taxes other than on income, which generally relate to product prices, were $2.66 per barrel for the first 6 months of 2013 compared with $2.39 per barrel for the full year of 2012.","Second quarter exploration expense was $78 million. We expect third quarter exploration expense to be about $90 million for seismic and drilling in our exploration programs.","Now turning to the chemical segment core earnings on Slide 9. Second quarter earnings were $15 million lower than the first quarter. This is primarily the result of lower caustic soda export volumes due to weak economic conditions in Europe, slowing demand in Asia and reduced demand for alumina in South America. We expect third quarter 2013 earnings to improve to approximately $170 million, benefiting from the higher seasonal demand and continued strong PPC sales into construction markets.","On Slide 10 is a summary of the midstream segment earnings. They were $48 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $215 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $77 million in the second quarter of 2012. The sequential quarterly and year-over-year decrease in earnings resulted mainly from lower marketing and trading performance, driven by commodity price movements during the quarter.","Our worldwide effective tax rate on core income was 41% for the second quarter of 2013, and we would expect that our combined worldwide tax rate in the third quarter will remain at about the 41% level.","And finally, on Slide 11, I'll discuss our year-to-date cash flow performance. For the first 6 months, we generated $6.4 billion of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital. This amount includes an approximate $380 million cash inflow from the collection of a tax receivable. Working capital changes decreased our cash flow from operations by about $200 million, to $6.4 billion.","Net capital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2013 were $4.2 billion, of which $2.2 billion was spent in the second quarter. We generated approximately $270 million with the sale of our investment in Carbocloro in the quarter, and we used $225 million for acquisitions of domestic oil and gas assets, of which about $125 million was during the quarter.","After paying dividends and other net outflows, our cash balance was about $3.1 billion as of June 30. Our debt balance remains unchanged and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 15% at the end of the quarter.","Our annualized return on equity for the first 6 months of 2013 was 13%, and our return on capital employed was 11%.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to discuss other aspects of our operations and provide some additional guidance for the third quarter.","Stephen I. Chazen","Thank you, Cynthia. Occidental's domestic oil and gas segment continued to execute in our liquids production growth strategy. Our first half domestic oil production of 262,000 barrels a day was an increase of about 7% from the first half of 2012 production of 246,000 barrels a day. Second quarter domestic production of 470,000 barrel equivalents per day consisted of 338,000 barrels of liquids and 792 million cubic feet of gas, a decrease of about 8,000 barrel equivalents per day compared to the first quarter.","Liquids production decreased slightly due to planned gas maintenance turnarounds in the Permian, which impacted natural gas liquids production. Plant turnarounds also impacted our gas production, which coupled with lower drilling on gas properties. Natural decline comprised the bulk of the total domestic production decline. A number of severe storms affecting the Permian region also lowered our domestic production. Second quarter domestic production was generally in line with our expectations, except for the impact of storms.","We're executing a focused drilling program in our core areas. And to date, we are running ahead of our full year objectives to improve domestic operational and capital efficiencies. For example, we have reduced our domestic well cost by 21% and our operating cost by about 19% relative to 2012. This is ahead of our previously stated targets of 15% well cost improvement and total oil and gas operating cost below $14 a barrel for 2013. We believe we can sustain the benefits realized to date, achieve additional savings in our drilling costs and reach our 2011 operating cost levels over time, without a loss in production or sacrificing safety. The purpose of these initiatives is to improve our return on capital.","I will now turn the discussion over to Vicki Hollub, our Executive Vice President in charge of our California operations. Prior to her current role, she ran our Permian enhanced oil recovery, or CO2, business. She will provide details of our strategies for the next couple of years, considering the current California operating environment. She will also discuss the results of our capital and operational efficiency improvement programs. Vicki?","Vicki Hollub","Thank you, Steve. We are a California company, and we are committed to being a responsible partner in the numerous communities in which we operate, spanning from north of Sacramento to south of Long Beach. We're the state's largest producer of natural gas and the largest oil and gas producer on a gross operated barrels of oil equivalent basis. We provide locally sourced energy to help Californians cool their homes and drive their cars. Since 2010, we have created 3,000 new jobs, invested over $8.5 billion in the state and paid $900 million in state and local taxes. We're also the largest oil and gas mineral acreage holder in North California, with more than 2.1 million net acres in some of the most prolific hydrocarbon-producing areas of the state. Our vast acreage position has diverse geologic characteristics and numerous reservoir targets, providing us with development opportunities that range from conventional to steam and waterfloods and unconventional. We plan to continue investing in providing energy for the state for decades to come.","This morning, I would like to give you a look at the progress we've made in California this year. When we started the year, our overall objective was to position our portfolio for a long-term profitable growth while achieving immediate wins to have a successful year. Our specific goals were: deliver a predictable outcome for this year, given the constraints of working in California; advance projects with solid returns, low execution risk and long-term growth; reduce our drilling and completion cost to improve our finding and development cost and our project economics; reduce our operating costs without affecting production to improve our current earnings and free cash flow; build a growing and highly predictable lower-declined base of production; test out various exploration development concepts both from a cost improvement and execution predictability perspective.","In 2012, we restructured our business units to create teams organized around the unique characteristics of each of our asset groups, resulting in a fifth business unit dedicated to managing our heavy oil properties. This heavy oil team has added the expertise necessary to accelerate the development of our existing steam floods and to evaluate new opportunities.","In addition, we created 3 technical teams to better manage the complex geology of the reservoirs in California. One team is dedicated to the design of new waterfloods or the optimization of existing floods. Another will look exclusively at the aggressive application of the EOR technologies, including steam floods, where they are technically and economically feasible. The third team will focus on unconventional development opportunities to optimize recoveries from the Monterey and other key shale plays in California.","We believe this structure gives us the ability to grow our California operations more efficiently, maximize the benefits from the improvement in operating and capital costs that we've already achieved and drive additional improvements in our cost structure.","As you know, we're engaged in a companywide effort to reduce our operating cost and improve capital efficiency in order to improve our returns. In California, we have significantly reduced operating as well as drilling costs, exceeding our targets. And we expect to save at least $175 million this year in operating costs through these efforts.","On the last call, we provided a thorough breakdown of the efforts being made in all domestic assets, and we have achieved similar success in California.","We've reduced our overall operating expenses by $3.50 per BOE, from $23.20 in 2012 to an expected average of $19.70 for all of 2013. Almost half of these reductions have been in well servicing as a result of high-grading our well service rigs and eliminating less efficient ones, better planning and scheduling of jobs, reducing lower value-adding jobs and adding Oxy supervision through reduction of contract wellsite operators. Improvements and innovations in service operations account for another 35% of the reduction. Activities contributing to these reductions include optimization of the use of chemicals, improved water handling, fuel and power cost reductions and lower rental equipment use.","In capital efficiency, we've also improved by about 15% year-to-date compared to the full year 2012. This success was achieved by focusing on 4 key elements of our capital program. First, we have locked in our drilling programs for a minimum of 2 months and in some areas up to 9 months. This reduced our nonproductive times associated with rig moves and third-party services and helped to reduce our equipment rental cost.","Secondly, we've revised well designs to more appropriately fit the wellbore characteristics and production expectations for each well.","Third, we have optimized drilling equipment and fluids to reduce the time required to drill wells.","Finally, we have improved our contracting strategies to incentivize our service providers to optimize overall performance through integrated service applications while reducing unit costs. In many instances, such as in the Rose Field, we've been able to generate significant savings through the application of one or more of these concepts I just mentioned and then apply those same concepts to other wells across the state, which has allowed us to duplicate the savings.","Many innovative ideas are being generated and implemented by our California teams across the state. As we have stated several times before, many of these ideas are being generated by our people at the grassroots level, which tend to generate individually modest cost improvements that accumulate to significant amounts across all of our projects as successes are replicated. Our people have embraced this effort and are committed to improve operations of our assets at every level by reducing cost and continuing to improve safety everywhere we operate. While the results we have seen so far are very positive and impressive, we believe that we can achieve even more improvements in both operating and capital costs going forward.","After reviewing our California assets as a whole and taking into consideration market conditions, we adjusted our capital strategy at the start of the year to allocate a higher percentage of our annual budget to lower-declined projects project, such as our waterfloods and steam floods. For this year, we plan to spend almost 65% of our capital program on water and steam floods, or approximately $625 million on waterfloods, $370 million on steam floods, out of the total $1.5 billion capital.","We will spend about 25% of the capital on unconventional projects and the remaining 10% on primary drilling projects. Further, given the market conditions, we have increased a portion of our capital on oil and gas liquids development, which represent about 99% of our California capital for this year.","California has unique opportunities, with diverse and complex geology. This geologic complexity leads to a broad spectrum of hydrocarbon fields and reservoir types. The depth, quality and drive mechanisms of the reservoirs vary across many of the producing basins and within individual basins as well. Those varied characteristics, along with product prices, costs and returns, determine the mix of the type of projects to be included in our program each year.","The significant strides we have made in reducing our capital and operating cost that I've described have given us the flexibility to include a large number of potential projects in our development pipeline. For example, depending on the type of project and location, our drilling costs in California, including completion and hook-up costs, range from $250,000 to $7 million, with expected ultimate recoveries of 30,000 BOE to 550,000 BOE per well, getting us a wide range of opportunities and variability.","Given our diverse portfolio of opportunities in California, we have sufficient inventory to sustain the strategy in the future for at least another 5 years and probably even for 10 years or more, while adjusting the liquids versus gas mix as conditions warrant. We believe this approach will provide the best opportunity for growth of the California operations and make it a significant growth engine for Oxy.","Now I would like to share some highlights about each of those project types, beginning with waterfloods. Waterfloods are among our core competencies. We have several new waterflood projects in progress this year in various stages, from screening to implementation, in addition to a number of floods, where we are engaged in redevelopment, expansion or optimization activities. We will spend most of our waterflood capital to further optimize our most developed project, the giant Wilmington Field, where our Long Beach business unit is continuing to have success in reserves recovery. Wilmington is a long-standing waterflood, where the keys to redevelopment success are effective reservoir characterization, performance surveillance, reservoir modeling and advances in directional drilling technology. This year, we will drill 135 new wells, including 35 horizontal wells, targeting attic oil and fault-isolated zones within this multi-play reservoir.","In Wilmington, we have used a combination of vertical and horizontal wells depending on the location. Vertical or slant wells can be cost effective in certain locations. And in others, horizontal wells are drilled to target specific sand intervals within the larger waterflood zone, which have not been effectively swept by the injected water. These wells have an average initial production, or IP, rates of over 3x higher than similar vertical wells at a cost of just 20% more than the comparable wells.","We believe there's still significant potential to be realized in the Wilmington field. For example, since we acquired this asset in 2000, proven reserves have steadily grown. In fact, year-end 2012, proved reserves remained slightly higher than 2000 levels despite 12 years of production, resulting in more than a twofold proved reserve increase during this period. We currently have an inventory of over 1,000 future well locations in the Wilmington field. We believe that a successful development program focused on these wells over the next 7 years will deliver reserves of up to 100 million BOE.","Just south of Wilmington, we are starting the redevelopment of the Huntington Beach Field with 2 new fit-for-purpose rigs, an onshore rig, which has an enclosure specifically designed for drilling in urban areas, and an offshore rig. We expect both of those rigs to arrive and start drilling towards the end of the year. So far, we have identified 128 well locations to drill, which will take 4 to 5 years using the 2 rigs we currently have committed. We expect to add more well locations as we learn more through our reservoir modeling and surveillances, as we have done in the analog Wilmington Field. We believe that we can increase our production from this field by 10,000 BOE per day and develop reserves of at least 50 million BOE.","Another significant project for us is the waterflood expansion at Buena Vista Field, where we expect to drill more than 150 wells over the next 5 years. We believe we can increase the Buena Vista production by 4,000 BOE per day and deliver reserves of 28 million BOE.","In addition, our Vintage unit, which is the team that manages our San Joaquin Valley and Ventura County waterfloods, gas properties in the Sacramento Valley and unconventional projects outside of Elk Hills, they have several waterfloods in the pilot phase this year, several under evaluation for redevelopment and a long list of potential projects going through the waterflood screening process. In total, we will spend around 40% of our 2013 California capital on waterflood projects that are expected to generate returns, exceeding 20% on average.","In addition to waterfloods, our steam flood activities have also been a sizable focus for us this year. Our steam floods in California are highly profitable, taking advantage of the gas versus oil price spread, allowing us to use cheap gas to generate steam, which is then used to inject into the reservoir to produce oil. We believe these projects can deliver attractive returns with the combination of gas prices as high as $6 per Mcf and oil prices as low as $80 per barrel. Typical rates of return for these projects are expected to be 25% or better.","The 2 largest steam flood projects for 2013 are in the Kern Front and Lost Hills fields, being managed by our newly formed heavy oil team. These 2 fields contain over 1 billion barrels of oil, original oil in place, on a combined basis, with an estimated 870 million barrels remaining in place. We're in the process of expanding our steam generation capacity in both fields, and these projects are progressing as expected. We have drilled 100 wells in these 2 areas year-to-date. And with the recent addition of 2 rigs, we expect to drill an additional 200 wells in the second half of this year.","As a result of our activity in these projects, production from our heavy oil business unit is expected to increase by around 3,000 BOE per day by the end of this year over our 2013 entry rate. Full development of these steam floods is a multi-year endeavor, and we believe that over time, we can increase our heavy of production by 15 BOE per day, developing reserves of 120 million BOE.","We're also preparing to pilot 2 smaller steam floods in Oxnard and the Midway Sunset Area by the beginning of next year. With the success of these projects, we expect to be able to develop an additional 45 million BOE of reserves.","Our total steam flood spending will constitute about 25% of our total California capital in 2013. Over the next 5 years, we expect to drill 1,500 steam flood wells.","As we shift capital to greater water and steam flood opportunities, we expect a lag of about 6 to 9 months before we see sustained production growth, as the flow of new projects reaches a steady level. We're in this transition period but are now beginning to see the initial phases of growth from these projects.","In addition to shale plays, our unconventional opportunities include those reservoirs that have low permeability and require special recovery processes to flow. Currently, about 1\/3 of our California production is from unconventional reservoirs. This year, we plan to drill more than 70 unconventional wells. We have more than 1 million prospective acres for unconventional resources, which we believe contain up to 7 billion BOE of recoverable reserves. We have drilled approximately 1,300 unconventional wells in California since 1998. More than 1,000 of these have been in and around Elk Hills, including the Monterey and other key shale plays. Our current plan includes 53 unconventional wells from multiple shale plays around Elk Hills, with varying costs and expected performance depending on the well's location and its particular structure. All of these 53 wells are a part of continuing development programs that are delivering better than 20% rate of return. Our ongoing program around Elk Hills is expected to increase our ultimate recovery by about 150 million BOE.","An example of unconventional opportunities we are pursuing outside of Elk Hills includes drilling and development at the Rose Field. We purchased this field in late 2009 and drilled 1 appraisal well in 2011, 8 development wells in 2012 and 6 horizontal wells this year, with plans to continue drilling. Results have been very good, with average IP rates exceeding our expectations and estimated ultimate recoveries of approximately 155,000 BOE per well on average. We believe our returns from this field will be around 25% over the course of the development program. We also plan to drill additional unconventional wells in South Belridge and the Buena Vista areas this year. Success in these areas could ultimately provide more than 100 well locations and up to 35 million BOE in net reserves.","A discussion of the future potential of California will not be complete without a separate discussion of Elk Hills, which we acquired in 1998. At that time, Elk Hills had gross proved reserves of 545 million BOE, 424.5 million BOE net to Oxy. Now cumulative production since our acquisition in 1998, combined with our current proved reserves, is almost double the proved reserves for Elk Hills at the time of the acquisition, which shows that we continue to generate ways to get more out of these reservoirs, and we're not done with Elk Hills.","In recent years, our growth in California has come from projects outside of Elk Hills. This is due to our big challenge at Elk Hills, where the underlying base decline without any capital expenditures would be around 25%. However, we are now looking at additional opportunities, which we expect will further increase the reserves at Elk Hills and help to mitigate the decline rate, possibly reducing it by as much as 50%. These opportunities include waterfloods, steam floods, as well as potential polymer and CO2 floods that could be implemented over the next 3 to 10 years. These significant operating and capital efficiency improvements made by the Elk Hills team will improve the profitability of these waterfloods and the EOR opportunities.","I would also like to point out that our plant operations team at Elk Hills has done a great job of optimizing runtime and reliability from our new cryogenic gas plant. Currently, the team is operating the plant at greater than 90% uptime, and they have extracted record volumes of NGLs from the gas streams this year.","Elk Hills still has more than 900 million BOE of remaining reserves and resources that can be recovered through waterflooding and current proven EOR technologies, in which we have considerable expertise, so we're going to continue our development efforts at Elk Hills.","Our California exploration program has delivered solid results over the last 5 years since we ramped it up. From 2007 through 2012, we have drilled over 100 exploration wells across the California basins in both conventional and unconventional plays. A full 2\/3 of our wells have found hydrocarbons, and a large portion of these successful wells resulted in commercial production. We have been busy over the last few years acquiring 3D seismic over a significant portion of our acreage, and this has contributed to our high rate of success. Access to this new seismic data and working closely with our operating groups has allowed our exploration staff to build creative and innovative programs.","Last year, for instance, we made a significant unconventional discovery in the San Joaquin Basin. Continued appraisal and drilling and testing this year established reserves and resources of approximately 50 million BOE. The full development of this discovery is expected to require drilling 100 wells. In addition to the 50 million BOE we've established, we are testing and\/or planning wells in late 2013 and 2014 that, if successful, will double this volume.","Further, this concept has repeatability, and we plan to extend this play through much of our California acreage. Our 2013 exploration program, which includes 15 wells, is on track to deliver results consistent with prior years, and we continue to build inventory to ensure we have a robust exploration program going forward into 2014 and beyond.","Finally, I would like to briefly touch on our gas development prospects in the state. In the Sacramento Basin of northern California, we have established a sizable natural gas position, with over 318,000 net acres and 66 million cubic feet a day of dry gas production. We estimate that we operate, through our Vintage business, over 80% of oil production in the region. Our current focus in the area is to optimize our current production, mostly with inexpensive workovers and a modest drilling program of 8 new wells in 2013 and 14 wells in 2014. We believe that the range of possible projects that are available in our acreage gives us the ability to ramp up our development efforts with attractive returns at prices around $5 per Mcf.","Currently, we have identified total reserves and continued resources of about 300 Bcf. We believe that our acreage held about 10 Tcf of original gas in place, with about 2 Tcf currently remaining. As you can see, we have a large inventory of waterflood, steam flood and EOR opportunities in California in and outside of Elk Hills, as well as significant upside in unconventional opportunities. All of these opportunities will continue to be an important part of our California development plans for the future and will make California a significant growth asset for Oxy. The mix of projects in the next couple of years will be similar to this year, as we continue to commit a larger portion of our capital to lower decline projects to manage our capital program more effectively and control escalation and spending while achieving healthy production growth.","In closing, I would like to summarize the progress we have made against the goals we established at the beginning of the year. We are executing a $1.5 billion capital program this year, which takes into account the constraints of working in California. We expect to generate free cash flow after capital in excess of $1 billion. Our program incorporates opportunities resulting from improvements we are already seeing regarding permitting in the state.","We shifted our development program towards a higher percentage of low decline projects such as our water and steam floods. With continued improvements in permitting, we should be able to grow our capital spend to around $2 billion in 2014, with further increases beyond that, reaching around $2.5 billion annually on a sustainable basis. With this program, we expect to grow at least within the corporate target rates of 5% to 8% annually over the next 10 years, while earning returns of better than 20%.","We've improved our capital efficiency by about 15% year-to-date compared to the full year 2012. We expect to further improve on these results going forward, which will improve our finding and development costs and returns. We have reduced our overall operating expenses by 350 BOE, from $23.20 in 2012 to an expected average $19.70 for all of 2013. This reduction translates to cost savings of over $175 million for the year, contributing to our earnings and cash flow. We have identified at least 5,500 well locations, and we'll add more as we continue to evaluate additional acreage and project opportunities.","We're working on several new waterflood projects in addition to a number of floods, where we're engaged in redevelopment, expansion or optimization activities. We're taking advantage of the gas versus oil price differences and expanding our steam flood opportunities, giving us a highly profitable set of projects to work with going forward. We're continuing our focus on a number of unconventional opportunities across the state, including the Monterey shale, to give us further growth prospects.","And finally, we're continuing our focused exploration in 3D seismic acquisition program, which has delivered a high percentage of commercially successful projects, the most recent example being our significant unconventional discovery in the San Joaquin basin. We have a large and diverse portfolio of opportunities available to us across the state. We're very excited about the future of our California operations and the role that it will play in contributing to the company's overall growth.","I will now turn the call back to Steve Chazen.","Stephen I. Chazen","Thank you, Vicki. I'll now turn to our third quarter outlook. Domestically, we continue to expect solid growth in our oil production for the year. Based on nature and timing of our drilling programs this year, such as the steam floods in California and timing of several gas plant maintenance turnarounds in the Permian, we expect the production growth to occur in the second half of the year.","We have achieved the drilling targets we set in the first half of the year. As a result, we expect our second half average domestic oil production will be about 6,000 to 8,000 barrels a day higher than the first half average, the increase coming mainly from the Permian and California. We expect modest declines in our domestic gas and NGL production that we have seen in the second quarter to continue as a result of our reduced drilling on gas properties and natural decline, as well as additional gas plant turnarounds scheduled in our Permian business the rest of the year.","Internationally, we expect more cost pool depletions in our contracts in Qatar and Yemen, which will result in less cost recovery barrels from those locations. However, we expect total international production to be about flat in the second half of the year compared to the second quarter volumes, assuming no renewed pickup in insurgent activity in Colombia and stable spending in Iraq. We expect international sales volumes to increase in the second half of the year and recoup well over half the underlift we've expected in the first half.","In the first 6 months, capital spending was $4.2 billion, with $2.2 billion spent in the second quarter. We expect second half of the year spending rate to be higher. Our annual spending level is expected to be generally in line with the $9.6 billion program we have previously discussed.","The positive effect of our capital efficiency efforts has started to become noticeable in our spending patterns. As a result, we believe there is a reasonable possibility our total spending may be somewhat lower than the program amount I just mentioned, while still drilling the number of wells we set out as a goal at the beginning of the year.","As you can see, the business is doing well, and we're continuing to make progress on our operational goals. With regard to our strategic business review, we have presented various options to our Board of Directors. Our review of these operations is progressing well, although it is not yet complete, so the board will continue to evaluate the alternatives.","We expect to have additional information regarding our plans towards the end of the year. Finally, an affiliate of Plains All American filed a registration statement yesterday with the SEC for a public offering of interest in Plains' general partner. We own 35% of the general partner's interest, and we expect to monetize a portion as a part of our proposed offering.","Now we're ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Leo Mariani of RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question overall on production. It looks like, just kind of looking at the overall company, going to be sort of flattish in 2013 versus 2012. Obviously, you've got a lot of new initiatives in California going here. Looks like that is going to accelerate next year. I know you guys also increased your Permian rig count earlier in the year. Should we expect much better growth on production overall for Oxy in 2014? And maybe any kind of ballpark number we could look for, for growth next year?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, of course, I think the oil production will continue to do well in the back half of the year and into next year because almost all of the drilling is focused on oil. California will do much better as the year progresses and into next year. International production, Iraq aside, sort of flattish because of the cost recovery issues. So if you look at just the oil, I think you'll see reasonable growth and better growth next year. Some of the turnaround -- we won't have the turnarounds we had this year in the plants, so we should do better that way. Gas is a different issue. Gas production, it's hard to justify spending a lot of money on gas production. So on a BOE basis, I think you won't see much out of the gas, probably some decline. But I wouldn't -- I don't think spending money on gas is money well spent at this point.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Any price out there you think you need to spend money on gas?","Stephen I. Chazen","Vicki talked about $5 in California. California is probably the -- California, maybe South Texas are -- and maybe a little bit in the Peons [ph] are the highest return, but I think you'd probably need around $5 to excite us. I mean, the margins are pretty good in oil right now. I think if you look at sort of $100 oil, you make these huge margins, and so trying to squeeze a few more bucks out of gas, just to make some BOEs strike me as not money well spent.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, how about the Bakken? Is that an area where you guys have started to pick up at all, given the strength in oil?","Stephen I. Chazen","I think Bill can answer that.","William E. Albrecht","Yes, we're right now we're running 5 rigs in the Bakken and adding another rig in August. We'll go up to 6, but I don't see much of an increase beyond 6 rigs for the rest of the year.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess how about Al Hosn? Is that still on track for production kind of late 2014?","Stephen I. Chazen","Sandy can answer that.","Edward Arthur Lowe","Yes. The Shah Field gas will come on at the end of 2014. We expect to see pretty much full production in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Steve, the comment you made on the strategic business review seems to indicate that -- well, it directly indicates that we won't get the plans until later -- much later this year. I was thinking we would have more of an update on, for example, the Middle Eastern sales process. Potentially, it seems to be that you're teeing up for a California spin here. And then ultimately I thought there was some fairly clear plans about your intentions for the remaining co[ph]. Can you just sort of go back through how we've ended up here with you saying there's now a number of different options and where things may be different from the way I perceived them to be potentially?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, one of the things that was easiest was the Plains' partial sale and then ultimately full sale. So there's a fairly large number in that. We didn't say anything had changed. I think as you enter in discussions with people about various things, I think it's best that those discussions not be in the public domain and rather be handled privately. And so when we have a definitive thing to talk about in the Middle East, we'll talk about that when it's definitive. As far as the rest of it goes, you can make your own judgments about California based on what Vicki said.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, so I guess we could continue to consider that, that will become a separate -- a standalone company. That seems to be the way.","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, it's certainly one of the options. I didn't mean to imply that there were now 400 options. We're just considering various options. And the board has really just been exposed to this in detail at one meeting, and so it will take a little while and we want to consult fully with them and weigh all the alternatives for them. But clearly, some things are going ahead quickly.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the -- I mean, I guess, we still assume that the overall process needs to be complete before you close your career at Oxy at the end of '14?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, that would be my hope, so.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and just the final -- my final question on this would be the towards the end of the year timing, I guess that's conservative. It just seems that you don't have a huge amount of time to complete this process.","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, it doesn't mean that the process wouldn't proceed without an announcement. So, I mean, there's some things we could do without -- I'd prefer to announce things that are not ideas but well along in the process. So you could move ahead on any of this without some formal announcement.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And my understanding is that things -- you visited the Middle East, things went well. You may be selling more of the Middle East business than previously. I think it had been the idea of 20% to 30% sales for not less than $25 billion total value. Are those reasonable?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, I don't want to comment. I don't want to comment on discussions we might have with those -- over there. The trip went well, and they were very pleased with our people and our operations, and they want us to stay in the region and want to do things to help us stay in the region.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And then my final question is as regards California, it feels a little bit like the movie that we saw in 2010. You described a lot of upside and potential in California at that analyst meeting. It didn't really deliver. We've seen volumes down here sequentially in California. How can we get conviction that this enormous upside potential will be delivered when the recent track record is being -- that we think...","Stephen I. Chazen","I think actually we're up sequentially this quarter. But now you just have to see the production as it goes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ed Westlake of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess my first question is just on breakeven. So you gave some numbers for the steam floods, but just on sort of...","Stephen I. Chazen","Steam floods, you should use that as a ratio rather than exactly those numbers.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, yes. But on that...","Stephen I. Chazen","That wasn't breakeven. That was economically work, so that's different than breakeven. I don't know what the breakeven number is. So basically, what we're saying in California is that those are -- that ratio works, and we would continue to exploit at that ratio.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All right. And then what about the nonconventional wells and the waterflood? I mean, any sort of rough range for sort of economically working oil prices?","Stephen I. Chazen","Vicki?","Vicki Hollub","I would say that for the waterfloods, certainly, we -- those are some of our better margin productions and projects. So our breakeven prices on the waterfloods could go down as oil price is down to probably the $60 to $65 range.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. And then just on the nonconventional side, I mean, obviously your 7 billion barrels of reserve sounds like a great number. I mean, At the current rate, it probably takes about 200 years to drill that. So when you...","Stephen I. Chazen","199, I thought.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. But when you're looking at the types of fields that that's contained, I mean, is it fields like Rose, North Shafter, that area? Is it infill drilling around Elk Hills or is it the deep basin? I'm just trying to get an understanding of what the technical breakthroughs are to actually unlock that at an oil price that works.","Stephen I. Chazen","First, before Vicki answers, I think you need to understand that we've couched this entire discussion around in the current environment, and those are things other than just oil and gas prices. So Vicki can answer now.","Vicki Hollub","Currently, we only drilled and developed on less than 5% of our unconventional prospective acres, so we're still learning a lot about the Monterey shale. We're in the -- what I would still say is even though we've drilled 1,300 wells, we're learning a lot about the Elk Hills area and the Rose and North Shafter areas. We're taking those learnings and applying those to our evaluations of the remaining potential. And the creation of this technical team that we have and working with our [indiscernible] we expect to be able to start expanding out beyond those areas and expect to see some variability, but we'll be able to apply a lot of what we've learned thus far.","Stephen I. Chazen","Right, I mean, I think the short answer is for the next year or 2 you'll see the areas that she has pointed out. And then as this thing -- we're looking for higher predictability. And so what you'll see is this thing will build out over time rather than sort of leap over time. Because, again, we're looking for predictability and outcome here, so their cash flows would be predictable going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Apologies if I'm simply repeating the questions here. But you do talk about 7 billion barrels of opportunity in California. But I guess, it sounds like there's still a lot to study over such a large acreage position. How do we think about how risked that 7 billion is? Is the issue in the pace? And I know the regulatory constraints is one of them, but just that that's sort of an unrisk number and you just had to do a lot more work on it? It's just kind of putting these things together here.","Stephen I. Chazen","Vicki?","Vicki Hollub","That number is based pretty much on what we've seen in the areas that we've been developing thus far, so that number is taken from the actual performance we've seen in the Elk Hills area, with respect to our shale play there, and also taking into account what we've learned in the Rose and North Shafter area. So we feel comfortable about that number. What we are trying to do is work on techniques to actually improve the percent recovery of the oil in place. And there are some techniques that we think we can start to apply and we're starting to see some success on things that we're implementing thus far, and those are results that we hope to be able to share with you in the next -- in the coming quarters.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's a great...","Stephen I. Chazen","I think her answer is that it's a risk number.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. No, I know. I got that. So then, I guess, the pace, on the one hand, there can be regulatory constraints. On the other hand, you're still trying to learn more. I don't know how you can weigh between these 2 things. But I think there's just this ongoing question of why not go faster in these areas?","Stephen I. Chazen","Neither -- we want to make sure this California company has stable, solid cash flow going forward and the regulatory environment will take a while to develop. This is not North Dakota.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. And then just a follow-up on the strategic business reviews. I think you've said it, Steve, but a lot of companies, when they announce these things, do present basically ideas of what they then want to accomplish. It sounds like, whether it's before year end or some other time frame, it'll be much more conclusionary for you or perhaps much more concrete in terms of what you'll actually be announcing at that time. Perhaps actual sales...","Stephen I. Chazen","If you look at the PAA action, we could've said something about that a year ago or 6 months ago or something like that. We said it when it was concrete. And the problem with ideas is that you telegraph your attentions to other parties, and without -- and I don't think that's necessarily the right thing to do.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, of your 35% of PAA GP, how much is going as part of this IPO?","Stephen I. Chazen","I've been told I can't answer that. You have to call Barclays to get the prospectus. So maybe they'll send you one.","Operator","Your next question comes from Douglas Leggate of Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve, back to California. So it sounds like what you're seeing by you want the California business to have stable cash flows...","Stephen I. Chazen","Stable and growing cash flows.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. But if go drill a bunch of wells and then you don't have the permitting, let's assume, is that really what's holding you back from stepping up that program? Is it still permitting?","Stephen I. Chazen","It's a combination of permitting and technical evaluation. We could certainly, if we had a different permitting environment, we could spend a lot more money, probably not enough to satisfy you, but certainly spend more money. And so I think that this is not -- this is still a very difficult environment. There are bills in the legislature that will have a negative impact on us. And so I think we want to be cautious about what we promise.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So looking at your slide presentation, you're indicating like a $500 million step-up in spending, maybe going all the way up to...","Stephen I. Chazen","Next year.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And maybe you're going all the way up to spending your cash flow. So what -- where is that...","Stephen I. Chazen","Hopefully, the money we invest will generate more cash flow, so we really won't spend the cash flow.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. But where there is the incremental activity? Is it waterflood, steam flood or is it unconventional?","Stephen I. Chazen","It's probably going to be mostly unconventional.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Final one on California. The rates of return, 25% -- up 20%, 25%, I think that's what you said in the slide pack. Considering you have the royalty and given the numbers you've given to us before, like 350,000 barrels a day -- sorry, 250 barrels a day with 250,000 EOR, on the cost that you give us, those returns sounds conservative. What -- is that -- I mean, am I reading something wrong there? Or those numbers -- something changed from the [indiscernible]...","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, I think first of all, it's not IRRs. It's basically accounting returns. So it won't show up in our financial statements about what's -- as opposed to what shows up in our imagination as IRRs. The IRRs are a lot higher because you get your money back real quick, so they're probably not exactly comparable. We didn't write those numbers to be exact. We just said, well, those are what we have. We're pretty confident being able to deliver.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I see. So it's more like a return on capital type of number.","Stephen I. Chazen","That's right.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Very last one for me. I know you don't want to elaborate probably on the restructuring at this point. But can you help us with frame on order of magnitude for how you see share buybacks when you do get to the point where you're going to do a [indiscernible] auction? An order of magnitude would be great.","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, it just depends on how much is raised. But clearly, as we raise money, a sizable share buyback is an order. I don't think -- I think under 10% wouldn't be viewed as sizable.","Operator","Your next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just following up on California. Given the commentary about spending in terms of the, I guess, call it, more the conventional waterflood, the EOR side, focusing on lower decline rates yet the incremental spending will be on the unconventional side, I mean, how exactly does that reconcile in terms of production growth?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, you build the base from your steam floods and your waterfloods. That's what the 1.5 billion area does. Once you've got the base, you can afford to step up the higher decline drilling.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that's how California ultimately is going to fund itself?","Stephen I. Chazen","That's how you would expect California to fund itself.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And would California, if put as a separate unit, however it does occur, would it be -- would it take a percentage of the debt? Would it take on new debt and that would be a way to raise cash for the parent corporation? Any light you can shed on that?","Stephen I. Chazen","I think it's premature to speculate about what we might do there. That's something that you roll out near the end rather than you start with.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I'm just trying to get kind of a feeling for where it can all come from. And the last...","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, it isn't going to -- I mean, if it were separated, it would have a capital structure similar to E&Ps, not a capital structure similar to ours.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my final question, as you've made progress on lowering the OpEx, is there any help you can give us in terms of understanding how much of that is a function of maybe not spending on the natural gas side and NGLs as opposed to spending on the crude side, just given that the overall investment in drilling is clearly continuing to grow on the crude oil here in the U.S.?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes. The gas workovers are cheaper. So it's more of a struggle to lower it than, given how oily we are, than, say, somebody who's really gassy. So I think that on a BOE basis, gas would clearly be cheaper. So I think it's more of a structure. I mean, even this quarter, the increase is almost entirely due to energy price increases, electricity and that sort of thing. So I mean, to do this in a very oily company is much more a struggle than it is, say, a gas company. If we look at our pure gas production, the areas that are almost pure gas, I mean, they're doing great on this. They've got really low numbers, but they still don't make a lot of money because the gas price is low so, I mean, their operating costs are really nothing. But it's the oil stuff where you struggle because you've got electricity and other costs that make it really out of your control. So I think given oily nature of the company, I think the people in the field have done a great job.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then how much more progress do you expect at this point on the cost reduction front?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, we show you the targets in one of the slides. And so it will be -- it can always be lumpy in any quarter. You can have one more or a few more workovers or you can have a field problem. So operating costs can be lumpy in any one quarter, and, again, there's electricity costs really out of our control. But you can see it in the slide.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, that's kind of what I was trying to get to. I'm wondering, if you've got some of the items are out of your control, what's within your control? How does that line up with the target?","Stephen I. Chazen","We continue to do better on the items that are in our control. If we broke out the stuff within our control, you'd see even more of a sharp improvement.","Operator","Your next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just have a few follow-up questions. On Slide 31, you guys talk about the significant discovery in the San Joaquin Basin. I just want to understand the full development that you guys talk about, 100 wells, what's the -- what would be the cost of each one of these wells? Is this the sort of $250,000 per well or is it the $7 million per well sort of cost that you guys talked about?","Stephen I. Chazen","It's probably neither. Vicki?","Vicki Hollub","Yes, it's more on the $2.5 million to $3 million range for that development. And were starting to drill -- towards the end of this year, we'll be drilling the more appraisal wells.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And if you could help me a little bit to understand how the permitting process kind of works for all these different play types you've discussed in California. I suppose that when you're drilling in areas you're already producing from, those are sort of easier permits to get. But then, as we move out of these areas, it's kind of more difficult to get sort of those permits. So I guess, for this particular discovery, is it pretty easy to get the permits you need to drill up this inventory and realize this discovery? Or how does that work from play to play?","Stephen I. Chazen","Vicki, why won't you tell him where we are in the permitting process there?","Vicki Hollub","Yes, for that particular area, because it is a new area, we are in the permitting process, and you're correct. For new areas, it takes longer, a little more difficult. And that's why our current appraisal program has not already begun. However, we're in that process now. We've submitted our permit applications and expect to have the approvals of those by the end of Q3. And worst case, we're thinking Q4, so we should be able to proceed as we expect. But you're right. It's in the new areas that we have the delays.","Stephen I. Chazen","But we started this a year ago, Vicki? So, I mean, it gives you a feel. So we've got a permit to drill a well or 2 and so once we decided we needed to expand it, it's been more than a year.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So to give you a kind of general sort of rule of thumb, is it from discovery to production of -- or realization of the discovery to production, it's kind of like a year or 2?","Stephen I. Chazen","A year before you can start.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then another year before you can get to full production?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, no. You've got a year of doing nothing or very little, testing the wells that you've got. Then you get -- hopefully, get your permit in a year or a little more than a year. And even that isn't necessarily the full field development but it might be close to where you are. You have maybe some quality issues that you have to deal with depending on the size of facilities you want to build. This can stretch on for a while.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like the incubation period is like about 2 to 3 years from...","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, I think from when you start and as you -- as the field -- if you're unlucky enough in some ways to find more than you thought, you need to go back for more permits because your production facilities aren't big enough. And that will start another period of study by the state. I think the state is doing the best it can, given the environment in the state, the political environment in the state. I think the state government's doing what it can. But no one should underestimate, even when you're successful, how long it takes to convert it into production.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Herrlin of Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Just some quick ones. How much were the well costs at Rose?","Vicki Hollub","The well cost at rose was $3.9 million.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. With respect to your waterfloods, why are you not doing polymer at Wilmington or Huntington Beach? Or you didn't mention that, anyway.","Vicki Hollub","Yes, that's under consideration. Our technical team is looking at the possibility of polymer flooding, not only at Wilmington but also at Elk Hills.","Stephen I. Chazen","The answer is the plain waterflood at Wilmington is working great. And there's no real -- I mean, that's a true technological victory here over the years. And so I think it's -- before you do heroic things, you ought to do stuff that's sort of simple.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay, that's fine, Steve. With respect to your response times, you said 6 to 9 months. I assume water is more -- as layer is more protracted than the steam? Or is that incorrect?","Vicki Hollub","It depends on the type of waterflood. Some are quicker responders than others. But based on what we're trying to develop now, it's looking like 6 to 9 months. But we're, in some areas, we're seeing responses already.","Stephen I. Chazen","His question really is about water versus steam. Is there any difference?","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Right, exactly.","Vicki Hollub","No, the steam, there is a lag there too, because you've got to heat up the reservoir, so that does take a while.","Stephen I. Chazen","Correct.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Last one for me, Steve. Acquisitions, you haven't spent much this year versus the not-too-recent past. Is it an issue of price or dearth of properties or just your current strategic review?","Stephen I. Chazen","I think all 3. There are not a lot of properties for sale. You've got a curve -- oil price curve. I think the average oil price in the curve is like $85 for the next 3 years. Meanwhile, the current price is $105 or $104, whatever it is. So that doesn't actually lead to a lot of deals because as you look forward, you're talking about at least the market's expecting $85. The seller's looking at checks for $105. That doesn't actually lead to a lot of closure. There's really not a lot of oil properties or properties that we would be interested in for sale, and given where we are in the overall process, I'm building -- we're building cash for other uses.","Operator","At this time, I will turn the floor back over to Christopher Stavros for any final comments.","Christopher G.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you, Mr. Stavros, you may now begin.","Christopher Stavros","Thank you, [Tamica]. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for participating in Occidental Petroleum\u2019s third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. On the call with us this morning from Los Angeles are Steve Chazen, Oxy\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Cynthia Walker, our Chief Financial Officer; Willie Chiang, Oxy\u2019s Vice President of Operations and Head of our Midstream Business; Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas Operations; Bill Albrecht, President of Oxy Oil and Gas in the Americas; and Vicki Hollub, Executive Vice President of Oxy\u2019s U.S. Oil and Gas Operations.","In just a moment, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CFO, Cynthia Walker, who will review our financial and operating results for this year\u2019s third quarter and provide some guidance for the current quarter. Sandy Lowe will then provide a brief overview of our Oil and Gas operations in the Middle East focusing on key countries for Oxy, as well as our strategic objectives for the region. Steve Chazen will then follow with a decision of our strategic initiatives and some of our growth opportunities.","As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in these statements and our filings.","Our third quarter 2013 earnings press release, Investor Relations supplemental schedules and conference call presentation slides, which refer to our prepared remarks, can be downloaded off of our website at www.oxy.com.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Cynthia. Cynthia, please go ahead.","Cynthia Walker","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My comments will reference several slides in the conference call materials that, Chris, referenced are available on our website. Overall, in the third quarter, we continued the solid execution seen in the first half.","Total company production was 767,000 BOE per day and importantly, we produced 267,000 barrels of oil domestically. This is on track to achieve our second half growth objectives.","In addition, with three quarters of successful execution behind us, we are confident that we will exceed the goals we set for the year for operating cost and capital efficiency. We had core earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.97 per diluted share and for the first nine months of 2013 we generated $9.4 billion of cash flow from continuing operations before changes in working capital and enter the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet.","If you turn to slide three, you will see a summary of our earnings for the quarter. Core income was approximately $1.6 billion or $1.97 per diluted share. As you can see, this is an improvement over both of the prior quarters.","Compared to the second quarter of 2013, the current quarter results reflected improved Oil and Gas segment earnings, driven by higher realized oil prices and domestic volumes, as well as higher core earnings in the Chemical segment and improve performance in the Midstream segment, driven by higher margins in the marketing and trading businesses, largely due to commodity price movement.","Now I will discuss the segment performance for the Oil and Gas business and begin with earnings on slide four. Oil and Gas earnings for the third quarter of 2013 were $2.4 billion, an increase over both the second quarter of 2013 and the third quarter of 2012.","On a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, improvements came from higher oil prices and domestic volumes. Volume increases resulted largely from higher oil production in California, the Permian and Williston, and improved Columbia liftings.","Moving to slide five, you will see a summary of production changes during the quarter. As I mentioned, total production for the quarter were 767,000 barrels per day, a decrease of 5,000 barrels per day over the second quarter and an increase of 1,000 barrels per day over the year ago quarter.","On a sequential quarterly basis, these results reflect domestic oil production growth as a result of our drilling program, as well as resumption of Permian production following plant turnarounds and weather interruptions in the second quarter.","As you can see, we also experienced an improved environment in Colombia although disruptions continue to impact production in the quarter and we\u2019ve seen the same early in the fourth quarter. MENA production was lower primarily due to the impact of full cost recovery under contract in Yemen, lower spending in Iraq, some maintenance in Qatar and labor issues in Libya.","Excluding certain of these impacts under disruptions in Colombia, our overall international production was in line with our guidance on the last call. On a year-over-year basis, full cost recovery and other adjustments under our production sharing and similar contracts also reduced MENA production by about 7,000 barrels per day.","If you turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll now discuss our domestic production in a bit more detail. Our domestic production was 476,000 barrels per day, an increase of 6,000 barrels per day from the second quarter of 2013, and an increase of 7,000 barrels per day from the third quarter of 2012.","Focusing on our commodity composition, oil production increased 6,000 barrels from the second quarter, driven by California, the Permian and the Williston basin. For the first nine months of 2013, our domestic oil production has increased by 13,000 barrels per day. This is a 5% increase versus the same period in 2012.","NGL production increased 2,000 barrels per day versus the second quarter . Natural gas volumes were lower by about 11 million cubic feet a day compared with the second quarter, almost entirely in the Permian as a result of third-party processing bottlenecks.","Moving to our realized prices for the quarter and the comparison to benchmark prices, you can see the summary on Slide 7. Compared to the second quarter, our worldwide crude oil realized price increased about 6%, primarily reflecting changes in benchmark prices.","We experienced improvement in NGL prices domestically, which contributed to 5% increase in worldwide NGL realized prices, while domestic natural gas realized prices experienced 14% decrease driven by the decline in the benchmark. You\u2019ll note we also included updated price sensitivities.","Next, I will cover production costs on Slide 8. Oil and gas production costs were $13.60 per barrel in the third quarter and $13.64 per barrel for the first nine months of 2013, compared to $14.99 per barrel for the full year of 2012. As you can see, domestic operating expenses increased slightly from the second quarter of 2013. This was due to the timing of certain plant workover activities.","International production costs have remained fairly consistent with 2012 levels, excluding the impacts of the facilities turnarounds in Qatar and Dolphin that affected the first quarter of this year. We are very pleased with our performance on operating cost this year and will be our full-year target.","Taxes other than on income, which are generally related to product prices were $2.61 per barrel for the first nine months of 2013 compared with $2.39 per barrel for the full year of 2012. Third quarter exploration expense was $68 million and we expect fourth quarter exploration expense to be about $100 million.","Turning to chemical segment core earnings on Slide 9. Third quarter earnings of $181 million were $37 million higher than the second quarter, primarily driven by strong caustic soda export volumes and lower energy and ethylene costs.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, demand for chlor-alkali products is typically lower due to seasonal factors. We expect fourth quarter 2013 earnings to decline to approximately $100 million, driven by the seasonal factors coupled with lower Far East demand and lower caustic soda spot and export prices.","Slide 10 is a summary of midstream segment earnings. They were $212 million for the third quarter of 2013, compared to $48 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $156 million in the third quarter of 2012. The 2013 sequential quarterly improvement in earnings resulted mainly from higher marketing and trading performance, driven by commodity price movements during the quarter.","Year-over-year improvement was driven by improved margins in our pipeline and gas processing businesses. The worldwide effective tax rate on core income was 40% for the third quarter. The lower tax rate and guidance resulted from lower volumes in Libya where tax rates are significantly higher than our overall effective tax rate. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2013 to remain in the 40% to 41% range.","Slide 11 summarizes our year-to-date 2013 cash flow. In the first nine months of 2013, we generated $9.4 billion of cash flow from continuing operations before changes in working capital. Working capital changes increased our cash flow from operations by 400 million to 9.8 billion. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2013 were 6.4 billion, of which 2.2 billion was spent on the third quarter. We generated approximately $270 million of cash from the sale of a chemical investment and used 340 million for acquisitions of domestic oil and gas assets. ","After paying dividends of $1 billion and other net flows, our cash balance was 3.8 billion at September 30. Our debt to capitalization ratio remained at 15% at the end of the quarter. Our annualized return on equity for the first nine months of 2013 was 14% and return on capital employed was 12%. ","Last I\u2019ll turn to the fourth quarter outlook. With respect to production, domestically as I mentioned we are on track to achieve our second half oil growth average of 6000 to 8000 barrels per day increase over the first half average. Our natural gas and NGL volumes are expected to decline modestly in the fourth quarter due to lower drilling on gas properties and natural decline coupled with the effect of a major turnaround in the Permian.","Internationally, we expect total production to be about flat with the -- in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, excluding the impact of insurgent activity in Columbia. We expect international sales volume to increase in the fourth quarter -- the deferred listings we experienced earlier in the year.","Our annual capital is expected to be about $9 billion. This is about $600 million lower than the $9.6 billion program we previously discussed. Of this reduction, approximately 200 million resulted from achieving better than plant efficiencies in our oil and gas program, particularly in our drilling costs and additional 200 million resulted primarily from the deferral of certain oil and gas facilities in mid-stream projects into 2014 and the further $100 million from lower than planned spending in Iraq.","We are particularly pleased that we are on track to meet or exceed our planned drilling activity levels for the year while spending less capital than planned as a result of efficiency initiatives. ","I will now turn the call over to Sandy Lowe who will provide an overview of our Middle East, North Africa operations. ","Sandy Lowe","Thank you, Cynthia. As you are aware we\u2019ve had a successful involvement in the Middle East, North Africa region for over 40 years. We are active in key major oil producing countries in the region and have formed excellent relationships with all of them. The countries in which we operate include Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Yemen. ","We have a diverse set of projects in the region and manage all of our projects by safety standards creating local jobs and development opportunities for people in those communities. Our current producing operations have generated over $20 billion net free cash flow in the past 15 years and our currently generating annual free cash flow of around $1.6 billion excluding Al Hosn Gas project capital which is currently running in about $1 billion annually. We recently expected that our Middle East business would generate over $2 billion free cash flow annually once the Al Hosn Gas project becomes operational.","We have invested $9 billion of capital in the Middle East region since 2010. 75% of which has been spent in Oman, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. We have drilled over 2500 wells in the region during this time and currently have 37 drilling rigs running. We have also spent $300 million on exploration since 2010. Our projects make a significant contribution to the economies of these countries employing around 15,000 full time employees and contractors, outstanding workforce at the Al Hosn Gas project which is currently over 34,000.","We have drilled several types of wells throughout the region. These include onshore oil wells in Oman, offshore wells in Qatar and soar wells onshore Abu Dhabi. The production from our wells ranges from 200 to 4500 barrels of oil per day and our gas rates are as high as 120 million standard cubic feet per day.","Our Middle East operations are designed to leverage our technical expertise based in central support groups such as project management, engineering, exploration and drilling. We apply this knowledge locally to successfully execute on our projects. We have used the central support of project effectively in the areas of reservoir characterization, flood implementation, drilling and completion techniques and management of major projects.","This enables us to apply best practices across region, while minimizing the deployment of western expatriates and maximizing opportunities for nationals in each country. We expect net Middle East production for 2013 will exceed 260,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing about 35% of Oxy\u2019s total production worldwide. When the Al Hosn Gas project reaches full operational status in 2015, it should add net production of over 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Our 2013 Middle East development capital is expected to be about $3 billion, with about 44% spent on water flood projects, 34% on the Al Hosn Gas project, 12% on steam floods and 10% on primary production. We will drill over 750 development wells this year and plan on around 665 wells next year.","Our strategic goals for our Middle East business can be summarized as follows. Continue to be a growing, profitable and vibrant business in the Middle East region, continue to be a preferred strategic partner with the host countries where we operate, expand our Middle East area business by partnering with local investors to secure strategically important growth projects, continue to successfully execute projects, achieve returns in an excess of 20% on our invested capital, continue our investment philosophy where our presence makes meaningful contributions to the host economies and makes a positive difference to the lives of the people in the local communities, including increased education and employment opportunities for nationals.","We have a strong track record in each of the goals summarized above and believe we will be able to deliver successfully on each of these going forward. In particular, we have developed and nurtured close relationships with key partners in the countries we operate. We have always been respectful of the interest, expertise and values of the host countries. This philosophy has overtime led to mutual respect and helped us grow our operations\u2019 processes.","I will now provide a brief summary of our operations in three of the countries in the Middle East region, which collectively make up 70% of our current production, 85% of our income from operations and nearly all of our free cash flow. We spent about 75% of our Middle East capital in these three countries as well.","Oman, we\u2019ve been present in Oman for 34 years and operate in Blocks 9, 27 and 62 in the North of Oman and Block 53, which is the Mukhaizna Field. We are the largest independent oil producer in Oman and have a highly skilled and loyal national staff. Our nice staff has grown from 246 in 2005 to 1,858 today. Most of our national employees have developed their skills and experience within Oxy, including opportunities to train and work on Oxy projects in the United States and other countries. As a result, over 81% of our employees are Omani nationals and Omani citizens now hold most of the high levels executive positions, including the President of our Oman business unit.","Oxy\u2019s gross production is expected to be about 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013 with a net of 76,000 in [\u201809]. Our Oman operations are a significant free cash flow generator.","We expect to continue to achieve returns well in excess of 20% from our Oman projects. Northern Oman, in Northern Oman a combination of development wells, exploration success and the application of water flooding techniques has led to an increase in gross production from 92,000 to 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day since 2010. We have a large pipeline hub in gas plant at Safah associating with the producing wells in Northern Oman.","This infrastructure enables us to rapidly and efficiently bring new wells into production. Most wells initially free flow and later having the gas lift or electric submersible pumps installed. We have maintained our gross average operating cost at around $5.50 per barrel with the key drivers being down-hole maintenance, surface operations and support cost. We have drilled 107 out of our 153 plant wells for this year. These are typically horizontal wells with lateral length in between 1,800 and 3,500 feet. Recent production rates have been as high as 3,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day with an average for 2013 of around 550.","During 2014, we\u2019ve planned to drill another 125 development wells. Over the next five years, our plans include drilling 400 development and water injection wells. We expect our annual drilling capital to be between $250 million to $300 million per year. We believe our developments program will increase gross production to about 125,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during this period. Our exploration program in Northern Oman has been one of our most successful ever as a company with the Discovery rig of greater than 60%. We attribute this success to our use of technology such as horizontal drilling, state-of-the-art 3D seismic as wells as the development of new plate concepts.","Our discovery this year mostly coming from horizontal wells have an average production of 3000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and produce over 70% oil. We continue to expand our technical understanding and have a robust inventory of future drilling prospects. In addition, we are nearing completion of a 2000 square mile 3D seismic program which should further enhance our growth portfolio. This new seismic data and over block 927 should yield many attractive prospects and enable us to continue exploring in these areas for many years.","Over the next five years, we expect to drill more than 50 exploration wells, 13 of which are planned for 2014 and could generate more than 250 new development drilling locations. Our Block 62 development is in the early stages of engineering with a number of gas producers already drilled. We are planning to further delineate one of the largest structures by the end of this year allowing an updated development plan to be presented to the government during 2014. ","Mukhaizna, Mukhaizna is one of the world\u2019s largest steam flood projects. At the end of 2012, it ranked third in the world in terms of steam flood production ahead of the large best known U.S. steam floods. Oxy\u2019s involvement in the Mukhaizna field began in 2005. Since that time, we have increased gross production from 8000 to 125,000 barrels of oil per day and produced 160 million barrels of oil from the field. We have drilled over 2000 wells in which 825 are producers. The steam wells enable injection in over 500,000 barrels per day. Waste heat recovery systems on power on power generators account for 20% of our steam.","We continue to optimize the development plan of this field with the government and our partners, and we expect to continue executing our infill drilling program. The anticipated peak production is estimated to be between 135,000 and 140,000 barrels of oil per day.","We expect to drill 340 wells this year. Recent rates have been as high as 830 barrels of oil per day, with an average for 2013 of around 330. We plan to drill another 300 wells in 2014.","We currently have six rigs running in Mukhaizna, in addition to the main Mukhaizna reservoir as we are delineating the extensive Kahmah fractured carbonate heavy-oil reservoir, which lies above the main pay in Mukhaizna. We presently have one rig dedicated to this activity, another milestone will be reached in Mukhaizna next year with the drilling of our first deep exploration well in the field.","Qatar, we presently operate three shallow water offshore oil fields in Qatar. The Idd El Shargi North Dome, Idd El Shargi South Dome and Al Rayyan. We also have an interest in the Dolphin project which has been a great success since its start. Through our plans for various projects in Qatar we expect to achieve returns well in excess of 20%.","In nearly 20 years in Qatar we have invested $4.3 billion and produced 680 million barrels of oil. Our operations in Qatar provide significant free cash flow. Current production is around 106,000 barrels of oil per day for 2013 from the three fields, netting 67,000 barrels of oil per day to Oxy. Dolphin\u2019s current production net to Oxy is about 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In Qatar, as in Oman, we are focused on the development of national staff and have successful national employees in all levels in the company. Oxy has established itself as an active and committed member of the community.","During our presence in Qatar we have forged strong and effective relationships with a number of organizations in the focus areas of health, education, arts and culture and sports.","Examples include, partnering with the Supreme Education Council and the Weill Cornell Medical College in the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, which is aligned with Qatar\u2019s 2030 national vision.","Other initiatives relate to specific causes such as diabetes, cancer, working with the Al Noor Institute for the Blind and partnering with the Qatar Museums Authority and supporting a number of sporting events.","In Idd El Shargi North Dome we will drill 17 wells in 2013 from jack-up rigs in a water depth of around 130 feet. Over the course of our involvement in Qatar since 1994, we have drilled 268 horizontal producing wells and over 100 horizontal water injectors. Recent well production rates in Idd El Shargi North Dome have been as high as 4,500 barrels of oil per day with an average for -- average 2013 around 1,460.","As part of approved Phase -- as part of our recently approved Phase 5 development plan we will drill another 205 wells at the cost of $1.2 billion. We plan to drill 36 of these wells in 2014. The development plan includes the installation of new wellhead platforms, the compression and power platform and various pipelines in related facilities.","We believe that as a result of this development we will be able to continue the plateau of gross production of 100,000 barrels of oil per day for many years to come. We also have new development opportunities being planned for the Idd El Shargi South Dome and Al Rayyan fields.","Dolphin, the Dolphin project remains one of the flagship projects in the region and it has been a great success since coming on the screen in 2007. The project involves production from wells located on two off shore platforms in the north field of Qatar.","Wet gas flows to the onshore gas plant at Rasputin where we\u2019ve process and to Condensate natural gas liquids and Sulfur. The dry gas is exported on under a long term contract to the UAE via a 48 inch, 230 miles subsea pipeline. In addition to the two 2 billion cubic feet a day of contracted gas from Qatar, we transport additional gas on an interruptible basis to customers in the UAE. ","While meeting a significant portion of the UAEs gas needs, Dolphin also provides gas to Oman. We\u2019re currently expanding gas impression facilities in Rasputin to achieve the maximum pipeline capacity of 3.5 billion cubic feet per day to handle additional volumes. We believe substantial opportunities remain in the region to sign up additional customers to provide gas transportation up to the full capacity of the Dolphin pipeline generating additional midstream revenues and cash flows. We expect our 2013 net production from Dolphin to be around 38,000 barrels while equivalent per day with significant free cash flow which we believe will grow overtime as we take on new customers. ","United Arab Emirates. Oxy\u2019s initial experience in the UAE was as a partner in offshore exploration during the 60s. Most recently Oxy has had a presence in the UAE since 2000. Since then our Abu Dhabi office has developed into a regional hub supporting our Middle East assets with engineering, geoscience, business development, operations, supply chain and finance resources. During this time the Dolphin midstream infrastructure has continued to expand and the pipeline system now extends with 475 miles throughout the UAE and into Oman. ","The Al-Hosn gas project where we\u2019re partnering with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company -- ADNOC, involves the development of the Shah Sara gas field in the western region of Abu Dhabi. Production from the field contains natural gas and condensate along with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. A large processing plant currently under construction with an average 34, 000 workers at the site, this is a world scaled mega project with the involvement of major engineering, construction and manufacturing companies from around the world. It remains on schedule and on budget. When completed the plan will be able to process about 1billion cubic feet a day of gas from the field and then separated into sales class condensate, natural gas liquids and sulfur. ","Oxy\u2019s mid share production is expected to be over $200 million in cubic feet a day of sales gas and more than 20,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate. By the end of 2013, the project will be about 92% complete and will start up next year. The 2013, of this year of Al Hosn capital is expected to be about $1 billion. Total project cost is expected to be on budget and about $10 million with Oxy\u2019s share of $4 billion. We expect production from the project to start in the fourth quarter of 2014. Once the field achieves steady state, annual average free cash flow to Oxy should be approximately $600 million at current liquid prices. ","Currently we are spending about $1 billion per year to steady state operation should provide a net cash flow swing of $1.6 billion annually. As we have recently announced we\u2019re currently looking to tell a minority interest in our Middle East, North Africa operations.","We believe this will give us an exciting opportunity to possibly partner with key regional players. This sale will reduce the Middle East\/North Africa share in our overall portfolio. We believe a partnership with regional investors will align us with local interest in our existing operations and on new opportunities throughout the Middle East to achieve future growth from a lower base.","In summary, we believe we are well positioned to meet each of our strategic goals in the region. Specifically, we have a highly profitable, vibrant and growing business. We have developed strong and lasting relationships with host countries where we are welcome and invited to stay.","We will continue to be a preferred strategic partner to them in the years to come. Our plan to sell a minority in our Middle East\/North Africa operations will assure that we will continue to grow our Middle East\/North African business profitably over time by securing strategically important future projects.","Our development and operating plans will ensure continued success in executing our projects. We will continue to achieve returns in excess of 20% of our invested capital.","We are continuing to apply our investment philosophy where our presence makes meaningful contributions to the host economies and makes a positive difference in the lives of the people in the local communities, including increased education and employment opportunities for nationals.","In closing, I would like to emphasize we are very excited about our presence and our opportunities in the Middle East. We believe that our excellent relationships and partnership with key regional players, coupled with our long regional experience and our track record of timely project execution will allow us to continue to enhance our rich growth potential of the region.","I will now turn the call over to Steve Chazen who will discuss our strategic initiatives.","Steve Chazen","Thank you, Sandy. Earlier this month, we announced the initial phase of the company\u2019s strategic review as part of an effort to streamline and focus our operations, in order to better execute the company\u2019s long-term strategy and enhanced value for our shareholders.","As a result of the initial actions, Oxy\u2019s Board of Directors has authorized the following, to pursue a sale of minority interest in the Middle East\/North Africa operations in a financially efficient manner that Sandy just discussed, pursue strategic alternatives for selective Mid-continent assets including our oil and gas interests in the Williston, Hugoton, Piceance Basin and other Rocky Mountain assets and the completed sale of a portion of our 35% interest in general partner of Plains All-American Pipeline.","This resulted in pre-tax proceeds of $1.4 billion. This initial sale process is concluded and we\u2019ve received the proceeds. Our cash balance of $3.8 billion at end of the quarter does not include these proceeds. Oxy\u2019s remaining interest in the Plains All-American Pipeline, based on the IPO price, is valued at approximately $3.3 billion.","As we indicated, these are our first formal steps in our effort to streamline the business, concentrate in areas where we have depth and scale and improve overall profitability. Our goal is to become a somewhat smaller company with more manageable exposure to political risk. We will continue to seek additional strategic alternatives for the company to maximize total returns to our shareholders.","These actions are expected to generate a significant amount of proceeds together with the excess cash on the company\u2019s balance sheet. These funds will largely be used to reduce Oxy\u2019s capitalization. While we expect to use a substantial and a vast majority of these proceeds to repurchase our shares, we also anticipate paying down some of our debt on a proportional basis. We expect to retire $600 million of bonds due in December.","We also expect to reinvest a portion of these proceeds in high-return growth opportunities throughout the business, several of which I will discuss in a moment. We continue to make steady progress and expect to complete the strategic view in the coming months and will disclose material developments as they occur.","Approximately a year ago our oil and gas business embarked on an aggressive plan to improve our operational efficiency across all cost categories, including capital with a view to achieving an appreciable reduction in our operating expenses and drilling costs.","Our teams are to be commended for doing a superb job on this front, exceeding our initial goals, we continue to run ahead of our full year objectives to improve domestic operational and capital efficiencies.","For example, we have reduced our domestic well costs by 22% and operating costs by about 18% relative to last year. This is ahead of our previously stated target of 15% well costs improvement and total oil and gas operating cost below $14 a barrel. ","Total annualized savings from these operating cost and capital efficiency initiatives amount to $1.2 billion compared to last year. We expect these savings to result an additional development opportunities as previously marginal project are now economic. The purpose of these initiatives is to improve our return on capital or continue to execute a focused drilling program in our quarter core areas and grow our domestic oil rates. The benefits of these cost savings cannot be overstated as they will result in a year-over-year improve in our F&D cost leading to a more stable DD&A rate.","We believe we can sustain the benefits realized to date, achieve additional savings in our drilling cost, receive and reach our 2011 operating cost level overtime, barrel loss in production and sacrificing safety. We are particularly pleased that we are on track to meet or achieve our drilling activity levels planned for the year or spending less capital on plan and result of these deficiencies. These achievements have generated higher margins giving us confidence to allocate additional capital for profitable growth opportunities.","As Vicki discussed in last quarter\u2019s call, we\u2019re the largest oil and gas mineral acreage holder in California with more than 2.1 million net acres, we have a large and diverse portfolio of opportunities available to us across-the-state. We\u2019ve reduced our overall operating cost in California by more than $4 a barrel equivalent, you\u2019d expect an average of under $19 for all 2013. Improvement in our operating as well as our drilling costs as exceed our targets and should allow for combined savings at least $300 million this year compared to 2012.","The result of these improvements and combined with more favorable permitting, we planned to increase our capital spending in California by about $500 million to approximately $2.1 billion next year. Most of this increase will be directed towards unconventional drilling opportunities where we have more than $1 million perspectives acreage for unconventional resources. ","In Permian basin we\u2019ve accumulated more than $1.7 million net acres covering both relatively established emerging place anchored by our high, our core free cash generating CO2 flood reservoirs. We\u2019ve recently created an exploitation team, who is mandate is to optimize our drilling capabilities and accelerate the development of unconventional opportunities throughout the basin. ","This year we are focused on delineating incremental opportunities and establish plays as well as to actually (inaudible) with many emerging plays which included the drilling of approximately thirty horizontal wells. We\u2019ve also succeeded in reducing our drilling cost by more than 20%, which increased our ability to enhance our economics utilizing horizontal drilling, multi-stage completions to develop establish unconventional reservoirs. ","As a result of these efforts you can now shift our development strategy, expect to spend an additional $500 million in capital next year largely directed towards increased drilling horizontal wells. The step-up in capital will allow for additional four rigs which will be dedicated to drilling horizontal wells in our focus plays of Wolfcamp both on a bone springs in the Delaware Basin as well as Wolfcamp in the Midland basin. ","As an example, as we recently completed a well in our South Curtis Ranch area, which is near our (inaudible) acreage, it was completed in the Wolfcamp would be in access of just over a 1000 barrels of oil a day, 77% of which is oil, 15% NGLs with a small amount of remaining natural gas. We have over 17,000 net acres that is perspective from this in the area. This represents a major change in our Permian 9 CO2 development strategy with a number of horizontal wells drilled next year, we\u2019ll count it for more than 50% of total wells compared to only 10%, 32013.","Turning to our international operations, our 30 plus year history of operating Columbia as provided us unique insight around heavy oil product, matured oil field development opportunities. Historically, this has been among Oxy\u2019s ,most profitable operations. Experience associated with steam flood development is a core competency at Oxy, a skill that fits well with Colombia\u2019s strategy to grow its crude oil production.","Going forward, we intend to focus our efforts on applying our expertise towards pursuit of high-additional, high-return oil redevelopment projects and we expect to participate in several more steam flood projects in the coming years.","In our Middle East\/North Africa business and as Sandy discussed, the majority of the value of our production, income and cash flow is derived from three key countries, Oman, Qatar and U.A.E. Majority of our regional capital is also deployed in these countries. And we expect our MENA business will generate more than $2 billion of annual free cash flow after the Al Hosn Gas project becomes operational.","We feel fortunate to have many successful years, operating in the region. Part of this we believe is a result of successfully executing on a number of challenging projects. We also feel that it is in part due to the mutual respect we have for our partners, the host countries in which we operate and for the people who reside there.","Although a sale of a minority interest will reduce our share of MENA within our overall portfolio, we expect to remain a major participant in the region with a focused presence. Our track record of success and strong relationships should allow us to compete for new projects and provide us with future growth off of a smaller base. We look forward to forging new partnerships in the region, which will allow us to continue our profitable growth strategy.","Opportunity for high growth is also present in our chemicals business, where we plan to pursue a 50-50 joint venture with Mexichem to build a world scale ethylene cracker at the OxyChem plant in Ingleside. As part of this long-term strategy, strategic supply relationship between the companies, essentially all of the ethylene produced from the cracker will be consumed by Oxy in the manufacture of vinyl chloride monomer, utilizing our existing VCM production capacity.","The VCM will then be delivered to Mexichem to produce polyvinyl chloride, PVC and PVC piping systems. Using the cracker, OxyChem\u2019s overall operations effectively consume more than one-third of Oxy\u2019s domestic natural gas and NGL production. A significant benefit of this project is that it provides higher levels of integration from the wellhead through to VCM production and sales. The project is just one example of several we plan to pursue in our effort to capture greater value in the downstream portion of the natural gas and the NGL chain versus an independent upstream gas producer.","Construction on the Ingleside cracker project is expected to begin in mid-2014 with the facilities becoming commercially operational in 2017, and we expect it will have a material benefit on our chemical earnings. OxyChem is also expected to continue to be free cash flow positive throughout the investment phase of the project.","In the Midstream segment, our investment in the BridgeTex Pipeline continues on track for scheduled start-up in mid-2014. The roughly 450-mile-long pipeline will be capable of transporting approximately 300,000 barrels a day of crude oil between the Permian region and the Gulf Coast refinery markets. We are confident that these and other opportunities to deploy our capital will be meaningful drivers of our earnings growth over the coming years.","I think we\u2019re now ready to take your questions.","Christopher Stavros","Tamica, can you please poll the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Steve, I\u2019ve got a couple if I may. Good morning. Starting with the Middle East, there has been a lot of speculation over the potential value that may or may not be associated with this asset. I know you can\u2019t give specifics, but could you frame for us given the relative lack of transparency in terms of -- you\u2019ve done a good job today of laying out the businesses, but reserve bookings and so on are still somewhat lacking transparency. So, could you help frame for us what you think a realistic acceptable range of volume might be and whether or not the Midstream would be part of that? I\u2019ve got a couple of follow-ups, please.","Steve Chazen","Yeah. The Dolphin Project would be part of the sale process. So that piece of our Midstream business would be part of that sale. There are confidentiality agreements between the three -- in each of the countries. So we can\u2019t actually give you more transparency without violating the confidentiality agreements. So, for example, we can\u2019t tell you the details in Oman or Qatar or Abu Dhabi. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we book only to the life of the lease and as the extensions come obviously more research come. We also appreciate basically over the [lease] of the earnings that someone understated. I think if you look at the cash, we view it as an ongoing business, that is to say it\u2019s not a pile of asset that we\u2019re going to deplete. The extensions on ongoing business we expect receive a price of reflexive value with ongoing business not really price of a depleting asset or the reserves or necessarily the reserves are there. The countries can see the long term reserves, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of issue with them not understanding what the long term outcome is. I don\u2019t really get -- we don\u2019t really want them to negotiate with myself on the values. ","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. A related question then Steve on the buybacks, the potential -- I mean there\u2019s been a number of bond that they run in the pass of $8 billion from Middle East, but like to see the amount is reasonable. I believe there\u2019s some tight issues around what you can bring back as a -- on optimum level, but if you then look at claims on potential mid coincident sale, can you help frame for us what you see the scales, the buyback like would be and (inaudible) coming to this acquisitions in the Permian Basin seems to have slowed down I guess probably in relation (inaudible) to do that, you\u2019re generating a lot of cash. So how should we think about buybacks on a go forward basis to maybe enhance your per share growth?","Steve Chazen","I think buybacks have been important not only though for share growth in the next -- to certainly next few months. We have a lot of cash in the balance sheet. We had $3.8 at the end of the quarter plus the money from the sale of the midstream assets. We would expect to begin a repurchase of some shares too shortly. As far as the scale goes, we\u2019re not going to build cash. We\u2019re not going to pay down the debt reduction to be proportional. So if we sell 10% of the assets maybe the debt will go down 10%. We only have about of $7 billion of debt, so approximately a big looser, these projects will not probably allow us to still stay within our cash from operations next year. ","This is probably not going to drain a lot as far as acquisition is concerned. I think the issue in the Permian is about -- you\u2019re just not allowed for sale and that which is for sale is not that interesting. Companies -- we have a lot of acreage are just highlighted, now just one small area where we\u2019re doing well, a lot of acreage. And so the need to drive the business through large scale acquisitions is pretty modest at this point. So you should expect the bulk of the proceeds to go towards share repurchases and else we\u2019re not going to build cash. ","So I think you should -- I can\u2019t tell you exactly the number and one of the reasons why we\u2019re -- once we could frame this more fairly, as to how much money is involved and we can talk about the last steps in this, but I think we\u2019re going to see where we are. Our goals are really two fold. We\u2019ll make sure we continue to operate well because that\u2019s really good price value and we need to execute the things we\u2019ve announced. So I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do but once we get that leased and safe then we\u2019ll talk about further restructuring stats.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Last one for me so far\u2026","Steve Chazen","(Inaudible) or not.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess we\u2019re locking specific Steve, so obviously I think market is kind of telling you to the locking specific. So I guess we\u2019ll have to wait until you can give more color, but if I could try one final one if I may. In your press release the other day, sales dimension in California, it continues to be a dragon, frankly see it under performer I guess in the end of the market. What are the parameters that you think may or may not contribute to your decision on whether or not California can do better on its own, I think that is clearly one of the key gating items for the mark issue on the restructuring on a go forward basis. I\u2019ll leave it there, thanks.","Steve Chazen","Yeah, I think, if you go back to the question about where we -- you could come up with a very high number without me telling you exactly, what it is or for a share repurchase, I mean, so you might be of a $1 billion or$2 billion. If that\u2019s about all of then you could use the numbers that are floating around up there. If you could guess what the proceeds from the Mid-Continent sale would be or within a few $100 million, then obviously you would we see how much cash we have now. I don\u2019t think anybody should be off very much in computing how much the share repurchased would be as the debt reduction and the other stuff is not large in comparison to that.","As far as California is concerned, the fundamental question is can it operate better as a standalone business with a different model? The different model, if you are just going to operate just like it does now and it might be better off staying where it is. But if it operates better with the different model than as a higher capital model and basically literally no dividends and with a more entrepreneurial background then I think that it would be better separated from the company.","More to the point, I think is that separating California from the rest, could enhance visibility and attractiveness of the remaining business. And I think that\u2019s -- I think they are enough for now. Once we get some slightly better numbers on the proceeds of these two various areas that we are working on now then we can size California. We are going to do it appropriately.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my questions, Steve.","Steve Chazen","Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from the line Doug Terreson with ISI.","Doug Terreson - ISI","Good morning, everybody. Congratulation on your results.","Steve Chazen","Thank you.","Doug Terreson - ISI","Yeah. Steve, you do highlighted on some of the strategic review slides, a major change in strategy in the Permian today. It\u2019s going to be driven by this new exploitation team and on this point I want to say whether you could provide some color or whatever color you might have on this new unconventional drilling group in the Permian. And also -- you also just mentioned a few minutes ago about the Plains All-American position and the question there is, whether there is any strategic or operating rationale as to why the remainder may not be divested in the future? So, two questions.","Steve Chazen","The second one is easier to say. It will be divested in the future.","Doug Terreson - ISI","Thank you.","Steve Chazen","So there is no -- when we entered into it, it was a private business.","Doug Terreson - ISI","Yeah.","Steve Chazen","And I don\u2019t have any problem investing in a private business if shareholders can\u2019t access if I think it makes sense for us. Once it becomes public and you can duplicate the ownership with yourself there is no reason for us to hold it. I\u2019m going to let, Vicki answer the question about the operational group.","Vicki Hollub","Okay. First, I would like to say thanks to our current Permian unconventional team that\u2019s gotten us to where we are today, because currently we are running seven horizontal rigs. We expect to ramp that up to 16 next year. So we are now being more aggressive with our properties in the Permian because we now understand them a little bit better. This exploitations team is going to be one that we have developed to get us into a position where we are more entrepreneurial and much more aggressive in the way that we attack our entrepreneurial opportunities in the Permian.","So this group, we expect to start helping us to more accelerate those opportunities, so within two to three years out in our typical development schedules. This team also will focus on ensuring that we provide the technical support to the business unit to make sure that we are spacing our wells correctly, that we are adequately drilling our horizontal wells and the correct direction and spacing. So the bottom line is we just expect this to be a technical support to help us get more aggressive.","Doug Terreson - ISI","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes. Good morning, Steve.","Steve Chazen","Good morning.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","There is a statement in your slides, on Slide 35, saying, expect to complete strategic review in the coming months. Is that a statement just around the overall thinking about the business, or is that around the timing that you might expect for making some of the disposals in the Mid-Continent and valorization in the Mid-East that you\u2019ve discussed?","Steve Chazen","And the decision about California, right.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay.","Steve Chazen","That\u2019s intended to -- so that\u2019s intended to be as soon as I didn\u2019t get clarity about the proceeds.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","All right. Okay.","Steve Chazen","And then very disruptive and I don\u2019t know people don\u2019t understand it. We put out the announcements so we could go do the work because you can\u2019t go secretly go sell 9% of your assets.","Once that\u2019s done then we\u2019ll look at the next step what we need to do, but you can\u2019t just (inaudible) disrupt the whole organization all at once with sort of this massive idea without some pretty specific numbers.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","And then a question that maybe you\u2019ll be able to answer on the Middle East, obviously, there -- seems like there\u2019s a decent amount of growth still to go for and thanks for the slides? Is there some sort of recovery factors that you can give on these fields at present to give us some kind of a geological understanding, you think you can\u2019t talk about reserve bookings that could help us think about the long-term for these fields, particularly Oman\u2026","Steve Chazen","Yeah. Unfortunately -- yeah, unfortunately that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re supposed to keep secret. They\u2019re very high recoveries by U.S. there or by current U.S. mandates. They\u2019re like fields that we started with the U.S. in the \u201830s not the like fields that were discovered last few years.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then the final one, the (inaudible) chemical cracker, I mean, world scale is sort of $5 billion to $7 billion, is that the right ballpark for your\u2026","Steve Chazen","No, no. Nowhere near that. This is under $1 billion of our share.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Steve Chazen","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Hey. Just question on the Permian here, just looking at your oil production, it\u2019s kind of been flattish there for the last handful of quarters. Clearly, you\u2019re accelerating activity in 2014 talked about an incremental 500 million to drill horizontal largely unconventional. You guys also talked about clearly significant proceeds coming in the door soon, I mean, ballpark it\u2019s probably if it could get to something like 10 billion type of number, should we expect that is, if you guys have success as we get through 2014 that 2015 and \u201816 can see a lot more incremental capital on the Permian given how big your acreage position is here?","Steve Chazen","Yeah. Certainly hope so. If it isn\u2019t then it hasn\u2019t been successful, but we expect Permian to be self-funding because there\u2019s so much cash coming out of CO2 business.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Okay. I guess, in terms of your activity there, you kind of mentioned that acquisitions were didn\u2019t seem like they were as paramount. I mean, do you think there is still potential for that down the road if stuff becomes available that looks more attractive to you guys or do you think you have enough acreage to really drill this aggressively for many years to come?","Steve Chazen","I don\u2019t think we need to do any acquisitions, no, no, obviously something attractive comes along that\u2019s different, but we shall not going to press acquisitions.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Okay.","Steve Chazen","We\u2019re better off, frankly, buying the shares with the money than doing the acquisitions.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Steve do you think you can complete the Middle East deal by the end of the year?","Steve Chazen","Complete, no, there is we got sign a lot of factors, factors probably fill a room. So I think that, we\u2019ll -- I expect we will have clarity as to the proceeds by the end of the year and probably signing on completion in the first quarter.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank","And when you talk about a minority, I think the previous guidance was 25% sale is that still\u2026","Steve Chazen","I think you should think of it as being focused on how much money we can bring back in efficient manner rather than the exact percentage.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank","Yeah. And that\u2019s being reported as sort of\u2026","Steve Chazen","Some amount of money, there is a sizeable number that we can bring back in an efficient manner. The Middle East business generates a sizable amount of foreign tax credits. So we have a probable those that we could use. It will continue to generate foreign tax credits. It\u2019s a shelter of the income going forward. So if you exceed what you have you pay taxes, U.S. taxes on money that you would otherwise not be tax assigned. So we are mindful of that and this rate.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank","I understand.","Steve Chazen","I know that sounds more confusing but","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank","No. I think people have been talking about $8 billion type numbers being the ultimate proceeds in the work around percentage share towards that. And then I think the year-end guidance that you\u2019ve kind of given, at least, what more matters is the numbers is in line with what we\u2019re hoping?","Steve Chazen","We\u2019re not going to give exact numbers. (inaudible) that\u2019s useful, again, negotiate with ourselves on the phone.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank","Yes. I understand and the options of California, is that a spin IPO what are you thinking there? Thanks.","Steve Chazen","We really haven\u2019t decided what the options are. Generally, simpler is better. Increased complexity is probably not something I must up for at this point.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank","So would that imply a spin then?","Steve Chazen","What\u2019s the simplest thing to do. There are two simple things to do. And only two simple -- everything else requires lot of brainpower and we\u2019re perhaps short of that right now.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank","Fair enough. I think I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks Steve.","Steve Chazen","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sven del Pozzo with IHS.","Sven del Pozzo - IHS","Good morning. We\u2019ve seen a big run-up in Delaware Basin stocks over recent months. And I know you guys have lot of acreage there. So do you think that -- I think it is based on a relatively small number of successes in horizontal Wolfcamp such as you had mention on your call. I\u2019m wondering where do you think we stand in making this play more repeatable in the Delaware basin?","Steve Chazen","Vicki, do you want to take a shot at that. That\u2019s true. There are relatively few wells. We are encouraged about what\u2019s going on? So I\u2019ll let Vicki talk here.","Vicki Hollub","And again that\u2019s part of what the exploitation teams will be doing, working with our current business units, that is to look at the data in the Delaware. We do believe that there is potential there and it is repeatable. And one of the things that we\u2019re going to focus on trying to do is determine what drives the variations within the reservoir. This team has the skill sets we believe to work with the business units to accomplished that. And so it\u2019s just a variability that we want to understand a little bit better but we do believe that success is repeatable.","Sven del Pozzo - IHS","In your opinion, is it more upside in the Wolfcamp formation or Bone Springs or equal, just as an idea. And then secondly, Wolfcamp and the Midland Basin, how would you compare the two, kind of, answering the question the same way, just like you did now?","Vicki Hollub","I think that the upside in both Wolfcamp and the Bone Springs will be ultimately pretty equal and the Wolfcamp and the Midland Basin, certainly we\u2019ve had some recent success there that -- but based on information we see from a couple of wells, we\u2019re drilling now and from offset operators where we\u2019re starting that that\u2019s going to be very successful.","Sven del Pozzo - IHS","Thank you. Then moving over to Bakken for a moment, most of your drilling, as I think it\u2019s been in Southwestern Dunn county. Is that to hold the acreage by production or is that just your own choice because you\u2019ve got a lot of acreage outside of that area as well. And I\u2019m just wondering what your plans are. We\u2019re developing that under acreage?","Steve Chazen","We\u2019ve been focused on holding the production -- holding it by production?","Sven del Pozzo - IHS","Okay. And then \u2026.","Steve Chazen","The majority of the drilling is done for that purpose.","Sven del Pozzo - IHS","Okay. Thanks. And then Pronghorn Sand in Bakken, you mentioned that in your last press release, have you had any successful wells in Pronghorn Sand. I know that there is offset operators that have had success there. I\u2019m wondering when you guys plan to drill Pronghorn Sand or if you have already?","Steve Chazen","Bill is going to answer that.","Bill Albrecht","Yes. We\u2019ve build a -- we\u2019ve build a couple of Pronghorn wells. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the success that we\u2019ve seen so far. So I think you could expect more of that.","Sven del Pozzo - IHS","Okay. And then finally, just a little bit of data points, if you could help me what the Dolphin project equity income. I know you have disclosed that in the past, but as a while back and just to bring me up the speed on what that is on an annualized basis and if that equity income number -- if it\u2019s a pre-tax number or post-tax number, and you can get me that later if you want to, if you know, I would appreciate it?","Steve Chazen","Roughly 60% of the income in the Midstream business is split between Dolphin Midstream pipeline and the Plains interest. So if you take our Midstream income for a year, I wouldn\u2019t use any quarter numbers. For a year, about 60% comes from those two and, it\u2019s maybe quite equally divided but something like that.","Sven del Pozzo - IHS","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Hi. Good morning.","Steve Chazen","Good morning.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","On the $2 billion of annual free cash flow, you expect to generate the MENA portfolio after the -- closing the startup, can you discuss if that free cash flow number sort of assumes that you continue to spend the capital on growth projects and if -- you can also discuss if that the CapEx number has embedded in that free cash flow number if that\u2019s enough to sort of replace reserves?","Steve Chazen","The answer is, we continue to expend it on growth projects and it would be enough to replace reserves.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","So it includes that some of the projects you are looking at in the UAE and in Oman, some of the\u2026","Steven Chazen","It includes projects that are in hand now that we think we have. If we want to do something brand new, they might have a different effect. But that\u2019s -- but if you look at what we have in hand and projects in Qatar and Oman and Abu Dhabi, that sort of includes all of that. But if you said well, you can have some projects some other place. It\u2019s radically different than -- maybe different outcome. But this includes enough to replace production.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Understood. And then your comments on the sort of favorable permitting environment in California, is that a result of the law that was signed into or the legislation that was signed to law by Jerry Brown or was it -- is there something else that\u2019s going on in terms of how you are lining up the permitting process in the state?","Steven Chazen ","Vicki, you can answer that, I think.","Vicki Hollub","Yes. I would say that the division of Oil and Gas and Geothermal Resources for the State of California has been trying diligently to ensure that there is more certainty around the permitting process. And so they have been processing permit applications as quickly as they can, granted, it still takes a while in the States because of their personnel resources.","But recently we\u2019ve also been trying to anticipate if the application of details from Senate Bill 4 that was just passed and we are trying to ensure that we stay ahead of the anticipated specific requirements of that bill to ensure that we are not negatively impacted by that.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","So the Senate bill, does it help provide more transparency to the process or does it make the permitting process more difficult?","Vicki Hollub","It will provide more transparency, but it will also require more monitoring from the operator standpoint, also more reporting and we are hoping that the requirements are not so stringent as they overload the staff at DOGGR. And that\u2019s the degradation for us is that increased permitting requirements is going to be a load on their staff.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Okay. Thanks for that color. And just last question from me, could you give us the sort of what you envision the capital cost being for the ethylene plant, the gross cost?","Steven Chazen","Well, as I said that half of that would be under $1 billion dollars.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. And so\u2026","Steven Chazen","And more -- So whether it\u2019s $750 million or $800 million or something like that, that\u2019s sort of the range. We\u2019re half of it.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. And are -- Do you have all the permits in hand, the air permits and the CO2 permits?","Steven Chazen","Yes. I think we are about set to go.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Great. I appreciate the time. Thank you.","Steven Chazen","We will be spending -- we\u2019ll be spending some money this year but it will build up in 2014, \u201815 and \u201816.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Understood. Thank you for the time.","Steven Chazen","Thanks.","Operator","We do have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Hi. Two quick ones. Given more of an unconventional focus, should we expect to see your PUD count go up in the U.S., Steve?","Steve Chazen","PUDs as a percentage of proven\u2026","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","I understood.","Steve Chazen","Okay. The actual PUD count is very large, how much they actually, but there were always very reluctant to book PUDs and you\u2019ve got to put a gun to their head to get them to book PUDs. So I would suggest that the PUDs are likely not to change very much as a percentage. It doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t PUDs but just. They feel, I mean, just to tell you why, they feel they\u2019re borrowing from next year\u2019s program.","So if they book a PUD, they book the barrels now and the money gets funded next year. So they are afraid of just hurting their F&D costs next year. So basically that you have the steady state of PUDs and [PEP] adds and therefore your F&D costs are from perspective of deeply being more predictable.","We can argue with them but there is more PUDs out there but they tend to take a very conservative view of it. I don\u2019t think there is any question about that, not the end of the world or worse things you could do.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay. That\u2019s fine. I just was wondering whether you\u2019re going to be more like your peers because you are more conservative about that?","Steve Chazen","No. I think it requires brain surgery and we are not up for that as part of my liabilities that get older.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay. On the bottom these are peeping, next question. With California you\u2019re spending more on J&J and you said your rent do more unconventionally. Are you going to be outside existing areas for your unconventional activities, what I\u2019m trying to get out is, in terms of volume recruitment will production activities be more protected if you\u2019re not within your existing field areas or TVD?","Steve Chazen","I think we are going to build out from our field areas rather than go off, part of building efficiency is to build out from your existing infrastructure and one keys to the next year or so is to keep the efficiency strong, so we will build out from where we are.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Steve Chazen","Thank you. Chris?","Christopher Stavros","Please give us a call if you have any questions, further questions here in New York and thanks for joining us today.","Steve Chazen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our business results, I'd like to first thank our employees for their efforts to ensure a safe workplace for our employees, contractors and the public. In 2017 we had the best employee and combined employee contractor injury and illness rate than we've ever had. In addition, OXY Oil & Gas had an industry-leading employee IIR \u2013 that's illness and injury rate \u2013 of 0.11. This is a result of a long trend of improving safety performance which indicates that safety is not an initiative for us. It's a part of who we are. It's embedded in our culture, which is a reflection of the quality and commitment of our employees. On behalf of the management team and our board, I want to thank our employees for owning safety.","Today, I'll share some highlights from 2017 and then some key items we consider for disciplined reinvestment and what that means for allocating capital. I'll then conclude with details of our 2018 capital program. Cedric will update our progress on our breakeven plan.","In 2017, we focused on improving our cash flow through value-based growth in Permian resources, enhancing our portfolio, increasing the value of our assets and using technology to drive operational performance. We enhanced our portfolio by increasing cash flow from OxyChem in 2017 with the completion of the Ingleside ethylene cracker, which reached full capacity in 2017. OxyChem will provide additional incremental cash flow in 2018 from the 4CPe plant that was commissioned and put on production in December of 2017.","The plant, located in Geismar, Louisiana, uses an OxyChem patented process to produce 4CPe, which is a raw material used in making next generation climate-friendly refrigerants with low global warming and zero ozone depletion potential. The project was completed on time and on budget and it represents another significant accomplishment within our breakeven plan.","We increased the value of our assets through increased productivity, significant reserves replacement, optimum cash flow from our international operations and increased exports from our Ingleside crude export terminal. Our increased productivity came mostly from our Permian Resources business, where we achieved record initial production rates across eight benches and continued to deliver step change well results in Greater Sand Dunes during the fourth quarter. These results have helped drive our capital intensity down while adding to our long-term reserve potential.","For two years in a row, we've achieved all-in reserve replacement ratios of nearly 190% companywide, with F&D costs of less than $10 per BOE. In Permian Resources, our reserve replacement ratio in 2017 was a record-setting 365% with an F&D of $9.77 per BOE. We've provided additional details on our 2017 reserve data in the appendix and earnings release. We'll continue to focus on optimizing recoveries and F&D costs through our value-based development approach.","Equally important were similar improvements in our international businesses where we generated over $1 billion of free cash flow, and I want to take a moment to recognize our Oman team. We've operated in Oman for almost 35 years and recently achieved a significant milestone with a production of our 1 billionth barrel of oil. With the extension of Block 9 and a new contract in Block 30, we're excited about continuing our long history of success and partnership in Oman.","Lastly, I'd like to emphasize how advancing technologies have improved our operations. Our investment in subsurface characterization has driven progress in both our unconventional EOR assets and our unconventional assets, and we're increasingly finding more synergies between them. Four unconventional EOR technical pilots that we began in 2014 have increased our technical understanding of how these two assets will work together in the future and will provide significant option value across our large Permian position.","This innovative work in combination with our petrophysical advancements to improve primary recoveries positions us to lead the industry in full-cycle value and return on capital employed. We're also advancing our use and sequestration of anthropogenic or manmade CO2. One important step was our work with EPA to develop the first monitoring, reporting and verification, or MRV, plan for CO2 injected in our Denver unit asset in 2016.","Our MRV plan provides transparent and formal accounting for permanent geologic sequestration as a part of our EOR process. During 2017, we applied for and received approval for another MRV plan in our South Hobbs asset, the second ever issued by the EPA. We reported volume sequestered at the Denver unit in 2017 and will report our sequestration amounts for both assets in 2018. These two assets represent two of our 34 CO2 EOR floods in the Permian and through our MRV plans, we'll demonstrate the significant potential that exists in our assets to store CO2.","Another important advancement of CO2 sequestration through EOR occurred last week when Congress passed the FUTURE Act. This legislation can help incentivize the development of new carbon capture projects making more anthropogenic CO2 available for sequestration and EOR operations, operations that have MRV plans.","This policy and technical advancements combined with our significant CO2 EOR position and infrastructure could provide emerging opportunities for OXY and the lower carbon future we must all work to achieve. We look forward to continuing to grow our leadership in this space.","To complement our subsurface advancements, our teams have also worked on innovative solutions to manage costs long term. We continue to make progress on the recently developed technologies and operational differentiators that we introduced to you during 2017, such as SL2, our multi-lateral technology; and our logistics and maintenance hub in Southeast New Mexico, this hub which will ramp up operations through the first half of 2018.","To summarize our key progress in 2017, we showed three key metrics on slide 5. Enhancements to our portfolio enabled us to fund our dividend and sustaining capital with our cash flow from operations and to fund our growth capital with a combination of cash on hand, our tax refund and proceeds from net asset sales. This advanced our plan to break even.","The 20% improvement in the six-month cumulative production volumes we achieved in Permian Resources will significantly increase our resources value. This is a result of several years of excellent subsurface work that is beginning to fully mature and be visible in our results. Finally, our ability to replace our production at close to 190% replacement ratio with high quality, low F&D production makes us very confident that this is sustainable for a long period of time, and will deliver top tier return on capital employed and will provide more total returns to our shareholders.","Turning to slide 6, our value proposition has not changed. When others chose to cut or eliminate their dividends, we developed a plan to continue and strengthen ours. We view our value proposition, which is founded on dividend growth, to be a commitment to our shareholders and not an option. We've been able to pursue this strategy consistently for many years as a result of the quality of our assets and the discipline of our management team.","As you can see on slide 30, over the past 16 years, we've given $30 billion back to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Our scale, combined with the free cash flow generation of our international assets, Permian EOR and Chemicals, along with the growth of our premium Permian Resources position creates a truly unique value proposition, in that we can provide strong dividends and meaningful growth as well.","Our cash flow priorities also have not changed. Sustaining capital and dividends are non-discretionary items. Our first priority is to maintain an operationally and environmentally safe business. Our second priority is to grow our dividend as we've done for the past 15 years. As we look beyond our cash flow breakeven plan, we will consider several key factors for disciplined reinvestment that support dividend and production growth long term.","Our investment decisions are focused on maximizing return on capital employed. We will not invest in projects unless they deliver a minimum return of 15% for domestic and 20% for international. The other factors we consider are, one, pacing growth to maximize net present value; two, improving low cost inventory; three, maintaining an industry-leading decline rate; four, sustaining a secure capital structure for downside protection and upside opportunistic value creation through the inevitable commodity cycles; and five, appraising long-term social and environmental opportunities to risk, like potential carbon pricing.","Now I'll update you on what this means for our next steps immediately beyond achieving our breakeven plan, as on slide 6, where we've illustrated what this looks like at various oil prices. Our first priority is to complete our breakeven plan and we expect to achieve this ahead of schedule. Our breakeven plan will secure our sustaining capital, current dividend and 5% to 8% production growth at $50 WTI.","Beyond these milestones, we believe it's important to improve our dividend payout ratio and reduce our net debt. This means that in the short term at $50 WTI, we'll grow the dividend at a nominal rate similar to last year, while investing in both short and long-cycle projects to deliver 5% to 8% growth. Any additional cash flow will be retained to improve our net debt metrics and be prepared for value-adding growth opportunities. We believe this conservative approach will further strengthen the sustainability of our dividend while giving us flexibility to remain opportunistic.","Beyond these initial steps, we'll manage incremental dividend growth and reinvestment opportunities within the framework I've discussed. At greater than $60 WTI, we're able to accelerate our payout ratio improvement and net debt reduction, and will weigh growing towards the higher end of our 5% to 8% range and growing our dividend more meaningfully.","Turning to slide 7, our capital program was designed to achieve our breakeven plan in the third quarter of this year. We expect this program will generate annual growth of 8% to 12%. Chemicals spending has rolled off significantly, which will enhance free cash flow generation. In Midstream, overall capital will increase modestly versus last year to accommodate an expansion of the Ingleside crude export facility. We recently awarded EPC contracts to expand the capacity of the terminal by 2.5 times, up to 750,000 barrels per day.","Total Oil & Gas capital spend will be approximately $3.3 billion. The international capital is primarily for sustaining purposes as we complete our breakeven plan, but we expect higher investment in our international business in 2019 and beyond.","Similar to the international business, the Permian EOR business will spend capital to sustain current production levels. Permian Resources will receive a total of $1.9 billion in capital, of which $1.2 billion is for growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Cedric to review our progress towards the breakeven plan and our financial results.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Vicki. I will begin with an update on our breakeven plan and then address financial results and 2018 guidance. On slide 9, we have updated our progress towards our breakeven plan at low oil prices. As the chart shows, we've made substantial progress towards this goal, and our business segments are exceeding targets. As noted in last night's press release, we have further accelerated our timeline and now expect to accomplish the plan by the third quarter of this year. As most of you know, once we achieve our remaining milestones, we will have the cash flow necessary for our $40 oil price business sustainability case or our $50 oil price business growth scenarios.","Slide 10 illustrates our progress towards the breakeven plan. In the Chemical business, the 4CPe plant came online in December and will begin contributing towards the breakeven plan next quarter. In the Midstream business, the Midland-to-Gulf Coast spread remained wider than our breakeven plan assumption of $2.10 per barrel, as it averaged $4.61 per barrel during the fourth quarter. Ken Dillon will tell you about the Al Hosn Gas plant debottlenecking that's beginning in the first quarter, and we have provided additional details on the capacity upgrade to our crude export terminal in the appendix.","In the Permian Resources business, we grew 20,000 BOEs per day sequentially, leaving 50,000 BOEs per day to achieve our goal. Jody will give you additional guidance on the timing of new wells online and production. The Chemical and EOR businesses are making operational gains and experiencing market improvements beyond our initial plan. Caustic soda realizations, a key profitability driver for the Chemicals business, improved further in the fourth quarter and solidified $150 million of market improvement shown in the other improvements category of our slide.","In the EOR business, we have achieved the $5 per BOE of cost savings we expected from the integration of the Seminole-San Andres CO2 unit into our network of floods. We have included a slide in our appendix highlighting this progress. We are excited by the progress we have made and we will continue to communicate incremental progress towards our pathway to breakeven.","My next slide illustrates our liquidity needs for 2018, and it has changed markedly in our favor since last quarter. We have adjusted the chart to reflect a commodity price of $50 WTI and our new capital budget of $3.9 billion. At $50 WTI, the cash required to attain our breakeven plan is more than covered by our cash balance, and, at current prices, we would not need a cash flow deficit \u2013 we would not run a cash flow deficit during 2018. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $1.7 billion of cash and the Plains units with a market value of approximately $600 million. In addition, we expect to evaluate and find opportunity to monetize non-core assets to maximize net present value of our portfolio.","Shifting to our quarterly financial and operational results on slide 13, I'd like to start with our production results. Total reported and ongoing production was 621,000 BOEs per day. Permian Resources came in within guidance at 159,000 BOEs per day. Permian EOR increased by 2,000 BOEs per day to 155,000, a result of a full quarter of acquisition volumes. International came in at 302,000 BOEs per day.","I'd like to take a moment to reconcile our fourth quarter production versus guidance. On the international side, our fourth quarter guidance was based on a Brent pricing assumption of $53 per barrel. Production sharing contracts, or PSCs had approximately a 5,000 BOE per day impact on our production, given that Brent averaged over $61 per barrel or an $8 increase versus our guidance assumption. While higher Brent prices are clearly a net positive overall, it does result in reduced production volumes for us.","On the domestic side, the Permian experienced third-party downtime of approximately 4,000 BOEs per day, outside operator production timing of 2,000 BOEs per day and weather impacts of 1,000 BOEs per day. The international and domestic items totaled approximately 12,000 BOEs per day, which reduced our production below our fourth quarter guidance. However, as Ken and Jody will detail, we are confident with our plan for 2018 and the execution fundamentals of our production growth continue to improve.","Earnings improved across all segments in our fourth quarter. Reported EPS was $0.65 and core EPS was $0.41. Reported earnings included about $575-million benefit from the revaluation of deferred taxes related to federal tax reform, which significantly decreased our fourth quarter effective tax rate.","Improvements in the Oil & Gas business segment were mainly attributed to higher oil and NGL prices. Realized oil prices increased 16% and NGL prices increased by 21% from the prior quarter. Operating cash flow before working capital improved sequentially to nearly $1.5 billion due to higher oil and NGL prices, along with higher Permian Resources production. We spent $950 million in our Oil & Gas capital program during the fourth quarter. Total year Oil & Gas capital was $2.9 billion and we met our total capital budget of $3.6 billion.","Chemicals fourth quarter core earnings of $217 million came in above guidance, primarily as a result of higher realized caustic soda pricing. Midstream fourth quarter core earnings of $129 million also came in well above our guidance due to higher marketing margins from improved spreads and exports through our terminal.","With respect to 2018, we are affirming a capital budget of $3.9 billion, which will generate 8% to 12% annual production growth. This equates to a total company production range of 640,000 to 665,000 BOEs per day. Our guidance assumes $60 WTI and $65 Brent for the first quarter and $55 WTI and $60 Brent for the remaining quarters.","The 2018 Permian Resources budget of $1.9 billion will drive a production range of 195,000 to 209,000 BOEs per day. The midpoint of this range equates to an annual production growth rate of more than 40%. Jody will provide additional color on our 2018 Permian plan.","The 2018 international budget of $800 million will maintain a production range of 286,000 to 297,000 BOEs per day, which is sequentially lower due to the impact of higher oil prices on PSC contracts. Ken will provide additional details on the capacity expansion of the Al Hosn Gas plant.","In the first quarter, we expect total production to range from 592,000 to 603,000 BOEs per day. Jody will give additional detail on the Permian Resources outlook. International production in the first quarter will be impacted by turnarounds at Al Hosn Gas and Dolphin. Al Hosn volumes are expected to average 58,000 to 59,000 BOEs per day during the first quarter and will ramp to 83,000 BOEs per day by the third quarter.","In Midstream, we expect the first quarter to generate pre-tax income between breakeven $10 million and $30 million, assuming a Midland-MEH spread of $3 to $3.25\/BOE. The first quarter guidance also accounts for the turnarounds at Al Hosn and Dolphin. On a full year, we expect pre-tax income to range between $200 million and $300 million based on a Gulf Coast spread range of $2.50 to $3\/BOE.","In Chemicals, we anticipate first quarter pre-tax earnings of $250 million as the seasonality of sales for certain products improves in the first quarter. On a full year, we expect pre-tax income to approximate $1 billion, assuming caustic soda prices remain at current levels. As a reminder, a $10-per-ton move in caustic soda price equates to a $30 million in pre-tax income.","Our DD&A expense for Oil & Gas is expected to be approximately $13.50 per BOE for 2018 compared to $14.87 last year, largely as a result of lower finding and development costs. Cash operating costs for the domestic Oil & Gas business are expected to average $12.50 during 2018, compared to $11.73 last year. Lower operating costs in the Permian Resources, which are expected to average under $7 per BOE, are expected to be offset by higher costs in the Permian EOR business for oil price-sensitive purchased injectant and higher energy-related costs.","And, finally, on slide 16, we have provided you with key cash flow sensitivities.","I'll now turn the call over to Jody.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Cedric, and good morning, everyone. 2017 was an incredible year for our domestic business. Our teams leveraged our subsurface workflows and operating capability to drive improvements that derisked our cash flow breakeven plan and added significant long-term value to our assets. We monetized non-strategic assets with three key results. First, we acquired the CO2 EOR Seminole-San Andres unit to enhance our low decline Permian EOR business.","Second, we invested additional capital into our Permian Resources strategic development plan and third, we cored up a Midland Basin multi-bench area we are now developing. We will continue to review our portfolio in 2018 and look for additional value-adding transactions. Our value-based development approach provided outstanding results across our business. Breakthroughs in geomechanics and petrophysical analysis of flow units drove an approximate 20% improvement in Permian Resources well productivity. Permian Resources lowered fourth quarter operating costs to $7.63 per BOE, a 9% improvement from the fourth quarter of 2016.","In Permian EOR we've made significant progress at the recently acquired Seminole-San Andres unit. In just one quarter, we increased production by 3,600 gross BOE per day, reduced OpEx by over $5 per BOE and reduced flaring by 60%. We've also improved the economics of future development by reducing drilling costs by over 30% or $500,000 a well.","I also want to highlight our progress in advancing new technology. As Vicki mentioned, we've implemented four different unconventional EOR pilots across the Midland and Delaware Basins. The initial results are encouraging and we believe that our position, scale and over 40-year history of operating EOR projects provide OXY with an advantage that will be extremely difficult to replicate. Progressing this technology will allow us to incorporate EOR into our future development plans and realize value with this upside option beyond just primary recovery. We're excited about these pilots and the future opportunity they represent.","Turning to slide 19, the Permian Resources team added 750 locations to our less than $50 breakeven inventory in 2017, almost double the target set at the beginning of the year. This represents an additional four years of development at a 10-rig pace. The additional 325 locations added from lower cost and well performance are based on repeated improvements that are sustainable.","Over 17,000 total net acre trades resulted in an additional 125 locations by enabling us to drill longer laterals and consolidate facilities. We are extremely pleased with the progress made improving our inventory in 2017 and believe that our focus on value-based development and innovative technology will continue to grow our breakeven inventory in excess of our drilling pace.","On slide 20, our Greater Sand Dunes area delivered another quarter of play-leading results across multiple benches. In the fourth quarter, we brought online a total of 17 new development wells and one Avalon appraisal well. Our new wells in the fourth quarter had continued step change productivity results as we had achieved in the third quarter.","Our confidence continues to increase in 2018 as in January, brought the Cedar Canyon 27\/28 Fed 44H online that achieved a record 24-hour peak rate of 8,361 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 6,111 BOE per day. As I mentioned in our last call, our understanding of localized production drivers across our position gives us confidence that we'll continue to deliver high rate of return wells across the more than 2,000 undeveloped locations in Greater Sand Dunes. In 2018, we will further integrate 3-D seismic, data analytics and deploy other emerging technologies for continued improvement.","Beyond Greater Sand Dunes, I also want to highlight a new six section modular development area in New Mexico called Turkey Track. The Turkey Track 9-10 State 32H in the 3rd Bone Spring has produced over 200 MBOE in 90 days, and all five wells online in the fourth quarter are performing above expectations. We expect Turkey Track to deliver over a 40% all-in rate of return at $50 per barrel. While Turkey Track is only six sections, OXY has significant acreage in this region of Northern New Mexico Delaware Basin. This modular development approach allows us to leverage scale across multiple smaller development positions.","Innovative facilities design and development sequencing allows us to reduce costs for operations across several sections while using regional subsurface characterization and operating efficiencies to leverage our basin-wide scale advantages.","On slide 21, I'll walk through Permian Resources production for the fourth quarter and discuss the outlook for 2018. The continued improvements in well productivity and development optimization have put us ahead on our breakeven plan milestone. We now expect to achieve the 80,000 BOE per day of growth in the third quarter of 2018. We're extremely confident in our ability to execute this plan as critical resources were secured in 2017.","Looking at the fourth quarter of 2017, good execution and well performance contributed to growing production by 20,000 BOE per day from the prior quarter, and achieving a December exit rate of 172,000 BOE per day. However, during the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately 6,000 BOE per day of downtime due to third-party pipeline and processing disruptions, OBO delays and weather downtime.","In the first quarter, we changed our development plans to move a rig from Turkey Track, a two-well development area, to a Texas Delaware four-well pad development area. This change was made based on the better-than-expected 3rd Bone Spring results in Turkey Track, so we can now pace this development differently to allow multi-bench development with the 2nd Bone Spring and ensure there's no additional cost incurred for facilities or trucking. This change reduces the number of wells online in the first quarter due to the larger pad activity, but is the right value-based decision and enhances our total-year production delivery.","First quarter production has been impacted by early January freezing weather by approximately 2,000 BOE per day. But again, this does not change our strong outlook for the year. We've provided a quarterly production range for 2018 to help follow our progress as we're set to achieve approximately 45% production growth from 4Q 2017 to 4Q 2018.","On slide 22, we provided details on our 2018 Permian Resource capital program. Consistent with our cash flow breakeven plan, our capital for the year is $1.9 billion. We will operate a total of 11 rigs and fund an additional two net non-operated rigs. We plan to appraise at least six new benches across our development areas that will provide future growth opportunities. We will also start realizing the benefits of Aventine, our maintenance and logistics hub, which is now online with sand delivery and will be fully operational by the end of the second quarter.","The partnerships created as part of project Aventine will provide efficiencies and allow better margins for OXY and our partners. Our initial savings target per well from project Aventine is between $500,000 to $750,000 per well, but we believe the full value implications are much higher as we expect improvement in time-to-market, last mile and well site logistics, safety and future operating costs. We will also continue progressing unconventional EOR pilots and implement new pilots in 2018, and will provide updates and share results as we can.","2017 was an incredible year, and we're even more excited and confident about 2018.","Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Jody, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong year in the international business with our achievements summarized on slide 24. The focus of the business during 2017 was twofold. First priority was cash generation which the upstream business delivered to the tune of over $1 billion in free cash flow. Second priority was continuing to develop a pipeline of potential projects in our core countries. This inventory is focused on strong returns for OXY and our partners. It builds upon our operational excellence in our core countries, including the use of the latest 3-D seismic technology and drilling successes in Oman and Colombia.","Our major projects continue to be delivered on-time and on-budget as shown on slide 26. And we did all of this while achieving the best international HES performance in OXY's history. There are a number of topics that I'd like to mention today. First is the debottlenecking of the Al Hosn Gas plant which will begin during the first quarter and be completed in the second quarter 2018. Last year, during our annual turnaround, we were able to optimize the gas plant for no additional capital. This contributed to the increase in production from 64,000 BOE per day in 2016 to 71,000 BOE per day in 2017.","This year during the turnaround, we will debottleneck the plant for an additional 11% in production from fourth quarter 2017 to third quarter 2018 for only $10 million of capital. This debottlenecking will bring the cumulative expansion versus the original plan to approximately 30%, as shown on slide 25.","Production during the first quarter will be approximately 59,000 BOE per day, and we will achieve a peak rate of approximately 83,000 BOE per day in the third quarter. We're able to achieve this by utilizing a new patent-pending process to modify the inlets to the plants absorbers.","Next, I'd like to talk about the continued consolidation of our position in Northern Oman. We successfully renewed our Block 9 contract and we recently signed an exploration and production sharing contract for Block 30, which enhances our position. We see opportunities for gas production in the area and synergies with our adjacent position in Block 62.","I'd like to highlight the performance of several projects in Colombia. In December, we reached a milestone of 45,000 barrels a day at the La Cira-Infantas field. This was achieved just ahead of the 100th anniversary of the discovery well, and we're excited about the continued development of the field. The TECA Steamflood pilot continues to exceed our expectations, and a development project will be moving towards sanction this year. The project exceeds our international economic hurdle rates. Both of these projects are excellent examples of our organization's expertise in enhancing the recoveries of mature and complex fields.","Lastly, we've been successful with our step-out drilling programs in Oman and Colombia, which have added over 50 million barrels of net resource in the two countries. I'd like to thank the team for its disciplined work and commitment to safety. We're very pleased with how the business performed in 2017 and excited about the opportunities in our pipeline.","I will now turn the call back to Vicki.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Ken. I'd like to close by commenting on executive compensation since we've been engaging with the investment community on this topic. We have expanded the use of returns-based metrics for executive incentive compensation. The changes will impact both our short and long-term incentives by incorporating cash return on capital employed as a key performance target, with a short-term target of 18% and a long-term target of 20%.","At our 2018 target compensation level, cash return on capital employed-based compensation will comprise about 20% of the total. This policy is consistent with our historical practices at OXY and improves alignment with our shareholders.","We'll now open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. If we could go to slide 4, the talk about well productivity improvement. And I was curious, is there a way that you could break that out at all between just changes in physical things like lateral length and the number of stages versus \u2013 you've mentioned multiple times, the improvement in well productivity, how much of that is a design change or better rock, or you know, all the opportunities that are there?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yes, Roger. Good morning. This is Jody. It's really a combination of both. If you look at lateral length in 2017, it's about a 10% increase in overall lateral length. But our productivity improvement is on the order of 20%. And you have to remember this is based on a six-month cumulative, so a lot of the good wells that came online in the back half of the year aren't yet included in that improvement number. So it's a little bit lateral length, but a lot about, again, how we land these wells, the flow unit work that we do to optimize where we place them, and then continued completion design changes to increase stimulated rock volume. But it's a combination of both, but more performance-driven than lateral length-driven.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks. Can I get you to hazard a guess on continued improvement on productivity at all or any sort of an internal target?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I don't know if I can throw a number out. I mean, I get surprised every day with the improvements our teams continue to make. And I see some of the technology things we're working, whether it's in the execution side or on the completion side, and I still think there's more ahead. We've got some new frac designs coming out this quarter in Greater Sand Dunes, and I think those are going to lead to even better rates.","And in addition to better rates, I think we're reducing our issues with offset frac hits and having to shut wells in because of doing frac work nearby. So not only are we trying to improve performance, we're trying to minimize the base production that's already online.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Kind of getting rid of the parent\/child issues we've seen elsewhere then.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Exactly.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe just changing direction with my follow-up. I don't know for you, Vicki, or for Cedric. With the company now certainly line of sight to the breakeven at $50 or effectively there at current prices, how do you think about the dividend or share repurchases as the company moves out of 2018 and into 2019? What's the preferred method for shareholder returns here?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Well, we prefer dividends, because the dividends are given directly to the shareholders, and it's often hard to predict the impact of the share repurchases. But we have done a lot of share repurchases over time, as we showed you in the graph, but the way we kind of look at it is we do it when we think it makes the most sense and adds the most value. And we sort of do that calculation by looking at the value of the Chemical and Midstream businesses and taking that from the total value of the company, but including debt and cash levels, then you divide that by your total proved reserves. Then when you compare that to your finding and development cost for the projects that you're in and, in that scenario, we would go today investing more in the projects that we're doing.","But with that said, in those scenarios where we have incremental cash, and we don't want to accelerate our pace of development because that would potentially destroy value, in those scenarios, assuming our stock is a little bit lower than normal, those would be scenarios that we buy shares back into the company, and you've seen us do that. So that would be something that we certainly would consider doing.","We never want to talk about it in advance, because we don't want to let others know that we're doing it. We want to make sure that we eliminate the potential of others buying our stock as we've talked about buying it back. So we think this approach, as we consider that limits our natural bias to think that the stock's always undervalued and it makes the calculation pretty straightforward.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","As we think about the path to achieving that $50 breakeven, I wanted to just focus a bit more on your expectation to reduce well costs in the Delaware, in particular, which I think you have on slide 53. Based on your contracts, how exposed are you to market inflation risk relative to what you have in the slide? And can you also talk a little bit more about the drivers of the design and efficiency improvements and the risk there to the upside and the downside?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Hey, Brian. This is Jody. The slide 53 is one example of a well type in New Mexico. It's a 2nd Bone Spring 10,000-foot well. It's a three-string design, assumes 2,000 pounds per foot in the completion, includes everything, its hookup, flowback, first artificial lift, capitalized overhead, so it's an all-in capital cost.","We see pressure on inflation, obviously. It's probably in the 5% range in the drilling area and more like 10% to 15% in the completion space. But with securing our resources in 2017, we're separating sand from pumping service and now with the startup of Aventine in 2018, we see our ability to offset and even drive down cost in an inflationary period. This is something we started a couple of years ago when we looked back at what really drove our improvements back then, and anticipating an inflationary cycle, what would we do different.","So we focused on maintaining time to market, securing supply, securing resources, working the things that drive time to market because they're a much bigger part of the equation than just unit cost. And I could talk for a long time about Aventine, but there's a lot of things in place not just sand delivery but oil country tubular goods on rail instead of truck, the OxyChem hydrochloric acid facility, our work with Schlumberger there, a new sand delivery system for the last mile logistics that will drive down trucking and reduce the number of people required on location. So I'm just naming off a few. There's a long list of things that we believe continue to improve the cost structure, the capital intensity of our work in the unconventional business.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. And I know this is just one example, but are well cost reductions of this type of magnitude baked into the $1.9 billion capital budget for Permian Resources or would achievement lead to lower capital needs relative to that?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yes, we've baked in kind of flat from where we are today. So I think there's upside opportunity as we work through this next generation of technology. So some of those are in there that's in our flat assumption, but we're just getting started with Aventine.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. And then can you talk a little bit more about the six new benches you're planning to appraise in the Permian in 2018, and how the acreage you plan to evaluate compares to the new acreage that I think you said added 150 locations in 2017?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, it's 1st Bone Spring, Avalon, 2nd Bone Spring Lower in New Mexico, 2nd Bone, 3rd Bone, Wolfcamp C and Greater Barilla Draw. Greater Barilla Draw is 50,000 net acres, so success in those other benches really gives you a lot of scale to work with.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Phil, could you hold just a second? We did have another comment from Ken, international.","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yes, just to follow on from Jody, on the international side, same drivers for us internationally, market forces and OXY in-house technology, we still see deflation continuing in drilling and completion arena at the moment, mainly because of the discipline of the NOCs and IOCs in this market, but also the entry of some new competition in the various product lines.","We rolled out OXY Drilling Dynamics 3.0 at the start of 2018, we're making modifications to our drilling rig fleets and hardware, software and data analytics. If you look year-on-year in Oman North and in Colombia, we've reduced costs in Oman North by 12% and 26% in Colombia in these product lines. And if you look over the last three years for ourselves and our partners, we've saved over $420 million in the drilling and completion side and we're hoping that, that will continue this year.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Okay. Phil, good morning.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. First question coming back to capital spending, this year you're at $3.9 billion, which is towards the upper end of the range you had talked about previously of the $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. Obviously, there's accelerating production growth that comes with that. But I guess I'm kind of wondering as we look ahead, Vicki, you've talked about a commitment to have a meaningful step down in CapEx in 2019 on the back of hitting the breakeven. So just want to get your latest thoughts on that. And you talked a bit about the various tradeoffs in your opening remarks, but is there a specific commitment you're thinking about or a roll-off of infrastructure spending or anything that will be driving CapEx materially lower next year?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Well, once we get to the breakeven plan, we're still going to go back to our original 5% to 8% growth. We're forecasting 8% to 12% this year but next year in 2019, we'll target the 5% to 8% growth. And targeting that growth with our dividend means that we'll certainly be able to reduce our CapEx below where it is today and back more toward the $3.4 billion to $3.45 billion range.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Phil, this is Cedric. I would just add, as I said in my prepared remarks, once we complete the plan, we will be able to live within cash flow, including and cover the dividend, even as low as $40. And so part of the answer to your question depends on what the commodity price environment will be going into 2019. But we will have that ability even at low commodity prices to sustain our base and the dividend all within cash flow.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And if I could just ask maybe a clarification for my second question. There was a comment about higher international spend in 2019, and I heard some of the prepared remarks there, but what's the order of magnitude that would be baked into the $3.4 billion to $3.45 billion?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","So it wouldn't be significant, because what we have in Oman and some of the international operations are these shorter cycle projects that actually could \u2013 we could vary that. We can almost vary like we do the Permian in terms of picking up rigs and activity levels. Ken, did you have an additional comment on that?","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yes. Part of our focus this year is picking up on the exploration wells and step-out wells that we did last year. We've added 50 million barrels of net resource. Our goal is to call these up this year, get them online. So some of the capital in Colombia will go towards that.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then my second question is around the OpEx for the U.S. The guidance of $12.50 a barrel. It's a little bit higher than my model, not hugely so, but given that the incremental \u2013 the resources barrels are coming on I think at $2 to $3 per barrel that you've talked about in the past. And I think 4Q ended sub-$8 a barrel. So I'm just trying to understand maybe some of the moving pieces there, and if you have any color about where the EOR cost is given the higher oil price et cetera?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Phil. It's Jody. So in Resources, we exited fourth quarter with OpEx of $7.63. We expect operating expense in 2018 to be below $7, more like $6.75. We'll exit 2018 below $6. So that additional production growth will continue to drive down Resources OpEx.","On the EOR side there's two components. The fundamental \u2013 the things we control on rig work and those kind of things is pretty flat. The two things that move with oil price, one is there's some CO2 contracts that are indexed to oil price, or part of the contract is indexed to oil price. So as oil price goes up, the cost of CO2 goes up. The other is we're injecting about almost 3% more CO2 this year in 2018 than we will in 2017. As you know we've started a new flood and we've expanded several others, and so that's consuming the CO2 on the front end, and obviously the production comes as you go through the lifecycle of those projects.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. So EOR is closer to $20 then per barrel?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, I don't have the number right here in front of me. We'll get it to you.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead with your question.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Most everything's been covered. I was just curious about the EOR activity in Permian Resources, what you're expecting to get out of the wells by pursuing that. And then the other one is on the Aventine venture. Will this be your only joint venture? Like Schlumberger mentioned the joint venture on their call with you, or working with you, I was wondering are you going to do more of these corporate things to help manage costs in the future? That's it.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Sure. Be glad to talk about both. So the EOR work in the unconventional space, when you look at primary production, you're recovering 8%, 10% of the production. So there's a tremendous resource there. So the objective or the challenge is how can we increase that materially and do it economically.","And so with either CO2 injection or miscible gas injection, both in the lab and in the trials in the field, we've demonstrated we can recover incremental oil. And it doesn't behave like the traditional conventional CO2 flood where you inject then you push oil to the producers and it's a long cycle project. The oil recovery is actually quite quick, so it has a short cycle nature to it. So the objective is to continue to do pilots and understand how we take it from pilot to full scale, and then how that affects development plans in the unconventional space going forward.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","So is this fracture or matrix porosity you're dealing with (54:04)?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Your matrix permeability is micro. It's not matrix. It's a function of the unconventional geology and whether you're in a sandstone or whether you're in a shale, so the behavior's different. That's all part of the learning that we'll talk about more as we're ready to disclose more of the details.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Great.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","With regard to Aventine, Aventine is multiple companies at that site. So Aventine is set up to support Greater New Mexico, all the way from Turkey Track and then our Greater Sand Dunes area. And so it's pumping service, it's oil country tubular goods, it's sand transload, sand delivery. It's a new sand last mile logistics system called SANDSTORM. It's the OxyChem ACL facility, and that's just where we're starting. With Schlumberger, it's frac, it's drilling tools, it's cementing, and it's providing logistics improvements by the location.","In the Texas Delaware \u2013 so you treat each area based on what the current infrastructure is. In the Texas Delaware, it's really more about securing transload. And so we don't have the full scale buildout of an Aventine-like facility, but we have transload secured. It's closer to the regional sands in Texas. Our sand provider has a regional sand mine that will be opening shortly, and so we'll take advantage of that in the Texas Delaware. And in the Midland Basin, really, the infrastructure is pretty good; it's just really securing supply of sand.","To give you just a couple of stats on the New Mexico impact, you think about the proximity of that to the well sites. It's a 60% reduction in the number of miles driven. You go from almost 20 million miles to 8 million miles. And then, when you put in the new SANDSTORM system that we're starting up this year, we can haul 27 tons of sand per load versus 22 tons. You do that math, that drives another 1.3 million miles out of the equation.","So it's 33,000 fewer truckloads over a five-year period. It also reduces 9,000 metric tons of CO2. You think about accident statistics. It will improve our safety. And then, the new SANDSTORM system, that's really the last mile part of this, reduces the number of people required on-site, because of the automated nature of the way it works. So that SANDSTORM technology would apply both in New Mexico, Texas Delaware and Midland. And then, the logistics hub design and complexity varies as you move across those three areas as well.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question. I know you don't generally give guidance by oil versus gas, but as we think about Permian Resources up 40-plus percent this year, is it going to be a broadly parallel increase between liquids and gas? So, in other words, the gas\/oil ratio, is it going to remain broadly stable throughout the year?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. Pavel, this is Jody. In 2017, our oil cuts were kind of on the 60% \u2013 right around 60% and it actually increases a little bit to 61% for total of 2018. So your mix stays about the same.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Helpful. And then, a quick one on Colombia. We've seen a lot of headlines, January in particular, about pipeline attacks affecting a number of the major fields in Colombia. To what extent is your Q1 international guidance affected by that?","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think the best way to answer is to look at our production last year. In Q1 2017 \u2013 since Q1 2017, our production's remained steady quarter-by-quarter. That's thanks to a lot of work in the field and excellent collaboration with our partner Ecopetrol and the full support of the Colombian government, and we're planning to continue with the same approaches in 2018.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. But I guess how many BOE a day have you lost year-to-date, for example, in Colombia, if you can share that?","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think it's basically a variation on the answer I gave a moment ago. Our production from our areas is basically steady at the moment. And it's mainly as a result of the work that we've done with the government and with Ecopetrol. We're not seeing major impacts on our fields at the moment.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leo Mariani from NatAlliance Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","Hey, guys. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the way you're sort of splitting up capital in the Permian Resources division this year, really between just Midland and Delaware. I don't know if I had this right, but I think I was seeing maybe roughly one rig in the Midland and 10 in the Delaware. Is that something you're going to sustain this year, or is that going to move around? Can you just kind of talk about that broadly in terms of how you're thinking about Permian Resources capital over the next couple years with those two sub basins?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, you can kind of look at it two different ways, you can look at wells online, you can look at rig count. If you look at wells online, it's about 55% in New Mexico, 30% in the Texas Delaware, and about 15% of the wells in Midland. And that probably stays fairly consistent throughout the next couple of years. From a rig \u2013 we're running 11 rigs operated, again, that's about 6 in New Mexico, 4 in Texas Delaware and a rig or 2 in Midland, so I don't see that changing drastically.","But again, we're continuing to develop inventory, learn new things. Turkey Track's a great example. We thought we had a single bench 2nd Bone Spring development there. Turns out we've got two. So as we learn more and we change how we think about our inventory, obviously, that could adjust. And I want to go back to Phil's question, he asked about OpEx and EOR. It's about $19 a barrel.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","All right. And then maybe could you talk a little bit about plans for Oman Block 30? I think you guys recently signed that late last year. Are you starting to see incremental capital there in the budget in 2018? When can we start to see some incremental production? Is it going to be largely oil targets? I think you guys had mentioned gas potential as well in Oman. So kind of what can you say about that as it develops over time?","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, I think as you can see from the map on slide 24, Block 30 fits perfectly into the Oman North jigsaw. There's currently three discovery wells on the block and two reservoirs that we're completely familiar with due to the work in the other blocks. We have the same approach internationally as we have domestically. The goal is value, not just driving up production.","So the short-term plans are basically to reprocess the existing seismic on the block, come up with a development plan and start drilling probably towards the end of this year, and have some production next year. So relatively small amounts of capital invested this year, mainly study work and coming up with a value-based development plan.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","All right. That's really helpful. And last thing you mentioned, portfolio management, $0.5 billion to $2 billion. I guess it's kind of an ongoing thing for you guys. Do you see anything on the horizon here in 2018 where you might look to sell down any of your assets or is that just something that's out there and might take several years?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Well, certainly for our core assets, we're satisfied with where we are. The only thing that we're continuing to do is look for things, assets that are way out in the inventory and the Permian. So things that we can't get to any time soon, and when I say soon that's like 10 to 15 years, or that's non-strategic for us, we would certainly consider to sell or monetize, anything that's non-core for us and, of course, we still have the Plains units that we can monetize.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","All right. Thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","So I want to thank you all for your questions, and I'd like to leave you with three takeaways from our call. First, we're ahead of schedule with our breakeven plan, but we're still focused on optimizing delivery across all of our businesses. And second, we're disciplined in our reinvestment and we'll provide additional security to our dividend through net debt reduction. Lastly, our expanded use of returns-based incentive metrics align our executive comp with shareholder priorities.","So we're looking forward to the rest of 2018.

Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone. Despite the current environmental of low and volatile product prices, our Oil and Gas segment has been operating well in all of our core assets. Our third quarter average daily production increased to 689,000 BOE per day from last year's 595,000 BOE per day, an increase of 16%. Our core assets continue to drive production growth with an increase of 39,000 BOE per day from Permian Resources and 50,000 BOE per day from Al Hosn, which reached full capacity in September. We expect Al Hosn to produce 60,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter.","Our capital and operating costs have continued to decline as we've focused our development program and curtailed activity where current product prices do not support further investment. We continue to make progress to optimize our portfolio as a part of the company's strategic review to focus on our core assets in the Permian Basin and the Middle East. We're selling our assets in the Williston Basin and continue to evaluate our positions in non-core assets in the Middle East with the objective of minimizing our activity and exposure. Construction of the ethylene cracker has progressed well and is on schedule to start up in early 2017.","Our principal goal this year is to adjust our business to the current environment of low commodity prices. We're targeting our operating cash flow to cover our dividend and capital investment at realized oil prices of $60 per barrel while continuing to grow our production. We'll achieve this goal through deploying our capital and operating cost savings and to further production and cash flow growth driven mostly by our Permian Resources business unit and the start-up of Al Hosn.","While we don't believe current price levels are sustainable over the long term, we've taken aggressive actions to manage the business for a downturn that may last longer than market participants expect. During the boom period from 2010 to 2014, the industry experienced substantial cost inflation. Royalties and government takes on new projects increased. Service prices, labor costs and overhead all increased as well. There's ample room for us to continue to lower our cost, which will enable us to return the business to profitability at lower prices. These adjustments may be difficult in the short term, but our discipline on reducing costs will lead to a healthier business over the long term.","Through our separation of California Resources in 2014, we reduced our annual G&A budget from $1.8 billion to $1.5 billion as we moved the corporate headquarters to Houston. Over the course of this year and into 2016, we expect to see continued reductions in our corporate overhead with a more focused company and will reduce our total G&A spending to about $1.2 billion in 2016.","Two years ago we began working on strategic initiatives to focus our company and improve its profitability. We've continued to make progress on those initiatives. We reached an agreement to divest our Williston Basin assets and expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter. Due to our curtailed spending in the basin and the nature of unconventional assets, our production declined about 25% quarter over quarter when annualized. We expected the production to continue to decline given our limited capital investments in the basin.","Over the past several years, our efforts at appraising and delineating our acreage in the Permian have provided a large inventory of future development locations that are economic at oil prices under $60 a barrel. With ample takeaway capacity and an extensive midstream business of gathering lines, storage and gas processing, our economies of scale and deep inventory in the Permian Basin make it our top priority for capital allocation for the foreseeable future. Simply put, acreage in North Dakota, whether it's tier one, tier two or tier three cannot compete with our position in the Permian.","We continue to pursue strategies to minimize our activities and exposure in our non-core operations in the Middle East and North Africa, which include Bahrain, Iraq, Libya and Yemen. As a result of these actions, we took impairment charges in the third quarter for our positions in Iraq and Libya. We will comply with our contract terms as we reduced our exposure through negotiations with our partners and host governments and expect capital investments to decline in 2016. These actions will improve the profitability and cash flow of our Middle East business as we focus on our core assets in Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Oman.","Our capital spending in the third quarter declined by about $300 million and will continue to decline. As we capture price savings from suppliers and improve the efficiency of our operations, we're able to do more with less spending. We expect to exit this year at a quarterly spending rate of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. If product prices remain at current levels, our 2016 capital program will be less than the current rate. We're in the midst of our annual budgeting process and we'll provide more detailed guidance on our 2016 program in January.","Over the last few years, we've undertaken multiple long-term investments to drive cash flow and earnings growth. These projects include the Al Hosn gas project, the ethylene cracker joint venture, our export facilities in Ingleside and gas processing infrastructure in the Permian Basin. Capital spending on these investments declined by about $500 million in 2015. We expect these investments to decline by about $300 million in 2016 and $400 million in 2017 as the projects are completed. This decline in capital spending on committed projects gives us a lot of flexibility in setting our capital budget for 2016.","Our Permian business continues to execute a focused development program on low cost wells with high oil content. Permian Resources continues to drive down capital cost through improved execution in drilling and well completions. Our production exceeded expectations due to reduced time to market and better than planned well performance. In the third quarter, Permian Resources achieved daily production of 116,000 BOE per day, a 6% increase from the second quarter and a 51% increase versus the prior year. Oil production increased to 74,000 barrels per day, a 4% increase from the previous quarter and a 72% increase from a year ago. In the fourth quarter we'll drill and complete about 50 horizontal wells. We're currently operating 12 rigs in the basin and evaluating our needs for our 2016 program.","In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500 foot well costs decreased by about 45% from the 2014 cost of $10.9 million to a current cost of $6.3 million. We reduced our drilling time by 24 days from the 2014 average of 43 days to 19 days. We've lowered our completion cost per well and optimized the density of our clusters and proppant loads. We've used some of our cost savings to up-size our frac treatments to drive higher productivity.","Our well performance continues to be strong. We placed 21 wells, horizontal wells, on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the third quarter. The Leigh State 40-11H well achieved a peak rate of 1,790 BOE per day and a 30 day rate of 1,528 BOE per day. Additionally, our Betty Lou 1013H well achieved a peak rate of 1,711 BOE per day and a 30 day rate of 1,310 BOE per day. We drilled the Betty Lou horizontal well in only 15 days. Most of these wells produce around 80% oil.","In the Midland Basin, we've made similar improvements in well cost and drilling days in our Wolfcamp A wells. We reduced the cost of these 7,500 foot horizontal wells by 30% from the 2014 cost of $9.2 million to a current cost of $6.6 million. We reduced our drilling days by more than 60% from 46 days in 2014 to 18 in the third quarter. In Big Spring, which is our new area of the Midland Basin, we brought the Young A 2124 well online in the third quarter at a peak rate of 1,611 BOE per day and 30 day rate at 1,237 BOE per day. We also brought online the Adams 4201 well at a peak rate of 1,698 BOE per day and 30 day rate of 1,495 BOE per day. Both wells are producing at about 90% oil. These Wolfcamp A well results have been outperforming our initial type curves for this emerging play in Howard County. We're continuing to lower our cost structure. Since the fourth quarter of 2014, we've reduced our operating cost per barrel by 18% and expect to make further progress in lowering our costs through the end of this year and into 2016.","In our Permian EOR business, we continue to lower our drilling cost and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. With a resilient base production and low capital requirements, the Permian EOR business continues to generate free cash flow at low product prices. In the third quarter we started Phase 1 of the CO2 injection at South Hobbs, where we expect to develop low cost oil production at about $10.60 per BOE.","In closing, we delivered strong production growth from our core assets in the third quarter. We continued to execute on our strategic initiatives to focus our oil and gas business around our core assets in the Permian Basin and the Middle East. We'll continue to execute a focused development strategy in 2015, and we'll pursue additional step changes in well productivity and cost structure. Strong production growth from our Permian Resources business along with a high volume, a low capital intensive Permian EOR business keeps us well positioned to not only meet the challenges of this lower price environment but also to profitably grow our combined Permian businesses.","Now I'll turn the call over to Chris Stavros.","Christopher G. Stavros - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Vicki, and good morning everyone. Today I'll cover our third quarter results, discuss the actions we have taken that led to the non-core charges we took in the quarter, and close by providing some guidance on the remainder of the year while highlighting key initiatives that will improve the company's financial strength going forward.","We generated core income of $24 million for the third quarter of 2015, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.03, a decrease from $0.21 a share in the second quarter of 2015 and compares to earnings of $1.34 per share in the third quarter of last year. Our net GAAP reported results for the third quarter were a loss of $2.6 billion or $3.42 per diluted share. Our third quarter reported results includes non-cash after-tax net charges of approximately $2.6 billion. Our quarterly core results were negatively impacted by lower worldwide oil and NGL prices, which fell by nearly $7 and $3.50 a barrel respectively in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of this year. US natural gas prices improved slightly, up about $0.15 per Mcf from the second quarter.","Our third quarter capital spending was about $1.2 billion, down 18% from the $1.5 billion in the second quarter and down 30% from first quarter levels. We continued to ramp down our capital program, focusing our development activity primarily in core areas of the Permian Basin, with the intent of curtailing or eliminating spending which is less competitive and imprudent in the current product price environment. Our heightened focus around capital spending is centered on growing our oil production volumes and more importantly our operating cash flow.","Despite the reduction in this year's capital program, efficiency gains and our increased focus around our inventory of drilling opportunities continues to drive growth in oil volumes and cash flow at our Permian Resources operations. Permian Resources grew its oil production 72% in the third quarter, adding 31,000 barrels per day compared to the year-ago period with total production of 116,000 BOE per day, representing growth of 51%. Production from Permian Resources improved by 7,000 BOE per day sequentially, above our previous guidance.","As I mentioned earlier, we took after-tax impairment and other non-cash charges of approximately $2.6 billion in the third quarter. Oxy follows the successful efforts method of accounting where we review our proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the oil and gas properties may not be adequately recovered, such as when there's a significant drop in the futures price curve. As of September 30, the futures curve for product prices had declined sharply yet again and we recorded an after-tax impairment of $1.3 billion related to our domestic gas properties and our oil and gas assets in Libya.","As Vicki mentioned, we continued to make progress in our efforts to optimize our portfolio. In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell our Williston operations, which have been classified as held for sale and resulted in an after-tax impairment charge of approximately $500 million. The sale is expected to close later this quarter, and we expect to receive net proceeds equivalent to approximately eight times free cash flow after acquired capital for facilities and safety.","Additionally, and as part of our effort to focus our capital on opportunities that generate higher financial returns, we intend to minimize our capital allocated to non-core areas. As a result, we recorded an after-tax non-cash charge of $760 million for operations in Iraq. We expect to continue oil liftings out of the country in the fourth quarter.","Our exit from these non-core areas will create a more focused domestic oil and gas organization and mitigate our exposure to areas we deem as having higher political risk. In addition, we expect our capital spending levels to decline and our financial returns to improve as we generate savings from associated overhead reductions that have yet to be captured.","As slide 21 shows, for the first nine months of 2015, our operations in combined Williston, Iraq and Libya had total production of 45,000 BOE per day and generated an aggregate cash flow after capital deficit of approximately $260 million with Brent oil prices of about $56 a barrel. For the full year of 2014, when Brent prices averaged about $100 a barrel, these assets had an even greater cash flow after capital deficit of $340 million. Some of this free cash flow savings could be redirected to our higher return core operations in the Permian Basin.","Turning to specific business segments. Oil and Gas after tax earnings for the third quarter 2015 were $17 million, about $90 million lower than the second quarter of 2015 and $880 million lower than last year's third quarter. Almost all of the impact of the change in year-over-year earnings is due to lower product prices. For the third quarter, total company oil and gas production volumes averaged 689,000 BOE per day, an increase of 31,000 BOE in daily production from the second quarter and 94,000 BOE per day from last year's third quarter. Total company oil volumes were 436,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, 54,000 barrels per day higher than the year-ago period for an increase of 14%. Total domestic oil and gas production averaged 332,000 BOE per day during the third quarter of 2015, about flat sequentially and 17,000 BOE higher on a year-over-year basis with all of the increase coming from Permian Resources. The increase from Permian Resources was partially offset by lower production from our Midcontinent natural gas assets where we have ceased drilling activity.","Domestic oil production was 204,000 barrels per day during the third quarter of 2015, about flat with the second quarter and up 22,000 barrels per day or 12% from the year-ago period. We captured approximately 4,000 BOE per day of incremental NGLs and natural gas volumes in the third quarter due to the installation of compressors and gathering lines in the Delaware Basin.","International oil and gas production volumes averaged 357,000 BOE per day during the third quarter, up 32,000 BOE per day sequentially, and 77,000 BOE per day on a year-over-year basis. Production from Al Hosn was 50,000 BOE per day in the third quarter, an increase of 32,000 BOE per day from the second quarter, and about 15,000 BOE per day above our guidance for the period. Al Hosn is currently running at full capacity, which is approximately 60,000 BOE per day.","Our third quarter oil and gas cash operating costs of $11.15 per BOE declined 8% from the second quarter level of $12.10 per BOE due to higher production volumes, lower surface and downhole maintenance costs and lower energy costs. DD&A for the third quarter was $15.39 per BOE compared to $16.06 per BOE during the second quarter. Taxes other than on income which are directly related to product prices were $1.20 per BOE for the third quarter compared to $1.85 for the second quarter and $2.45 per BOE for the full year of 2014.","Chemicals generated pre-tax core earnings of $174 million in the third quarter of 2015 versus $136 million in the second quarter and $140 million during the year ago period. The most recent quarter results were above our previous guidance and benefited from higher chlorovinyl production volumes, lower ethylene costs partially offset by lower vinyl sales prices.","Midstream pre-tax core earnings were $31 million in the third quarter compared to $84 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $115 million for last year's third quarter. The most recent quarter results reflected lower marketing margins due to the narrowing of Midland and Gulf Coast differentials, and an increase in crude oil supply lowered premiums in the Gulf Coast. The lower marketing margins were partially offset by higher pipeline income from both domestic and foreign pipelines, and higher seasonal margins from power generation operations.","Turning to our cash flow. Operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2015 was approximately $1 billion which was about $200 million higher than the second quarter. Higher oil and gas production volumes combined with better realized oil prices relative to benchmark prices positively impacted our operating cash flows during the third quarter. Working capital changes were minor during the third quarter as our drilling activity and capital spending stabilized from higher levels at the end of last year.","We continued to ramp down our capital spending, with total company expenditures for the third quarter of 2015 of $1.2 billion, a sequential decline of $300 million from the second quarter. Total company capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2015 were $4.4 billion, which is running a little lower than our full year 2015 capital budget of $5.8 billion. Oil and Gas spent $3.6 billion during the first nine months of 2015 with Permian Resources expenditures comprising roughly half of the total Oil and Gas outlays, and the remaining $800 million of capital split nearly evenly between Chemicals and Midstream.","We paid cash dividends of $1.7 billion during the first nine months of 2015. Continued growth in our operating cash flow combined with capital reductions and other cash cost savings should allow us to achieve our goal of being cash flow neutral after capital spending and dividends at oil prices of roughly $60 a barrel. Our cash balance at the end of third quarter was $4.3 billion and our long-term debt to capitalization ratio was 19% the end of the period. The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 90% for the third quarter of 2015.","Beyond the efficiency improvements that have lowered our capital spending, we have also started to recognize the benefit of a reduction in our SG&A costs. Reducing our SG&A is an initiative we began working on ahead of the spinoff of our California assets and operations. Prior to the spin, our SG&A was at approximately $1.8 billion per year. Upon completion of the spinoff late last year, we had reduced our SG&A costs by about $300 million or roughly 17%.","While our work force has come together and made a huge effort to reduce costs, we are still in the early stages of recognizing these benefits. During 2015 we expect to reduce our SG&A by another 10%, or roughly $150 million. We have taken a number of actions and will continue to pursue other initiatives that will serve to reduce our SG&A costs both this year and next, and is highlighted on Slide 30. We expect these initiatives to reduce our SG&A by at least another 10% and expect our total SG&A costs to decline to roughly $1.2 billion in 2016. This represents a one-third reduction in our total SG&A costs compared to levels before the California spin.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, domestically we expect production from Permian Resources to be about 118,000 BOE per day. Production has been a bit lumpier as we have increasingly moved to pad drilling and we expect total Permian Resources production to exit the year in excess of 120,000 BOE per day. Continued growth in the Permian combined with declines in our Midcontinent natural gas production and adjusting for the sale of the Williston assets should result in total US production between 310,000 BOE per day and 320,000 BOE per day. We expect our international production to be between 365,000 BOE per day and 375,000 BOE per day, depending on volumes from Iraq, and assume 60,000 BOE per day of production from Al Hosn.","Price changes at current global prices affect our quarterly earnings before income taxes by $30 million per $1 per barrel change in oil prices, and $7 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGL prices. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices affects quarterly pre-tax earnings by about $15 million.","Our fourth quarter 2015 exploration expense is anticipated to be about $20 million pre-tax.","We expect our fourth quarter 2015 pre-tax Chemical earnings to be about $130 million. Our third quarter Midstream earnings will continue to be principally impacted by Midland to Gulf Coast oil price differentials which have narrowed since the third quarter, as well as weak NGL prices. We expect net cash proceeds from asset sales in the fourth quarter, which includes our assets in the Williston Basin, to be approximately $650 million.","The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 90% for the third quarter of 2015. This rate reflects the mix of domestic source book losses and foreign-sourced income which is taxed at much higher relative rates. Simply put, you cannot utilize US tax losses to offset higher foreign taxes. Based on continued volatility in the mix of pre-tax income sources, we expect our full year 2015 domestic tax rate to be 36% and our international tax rates to remain at about 65%.","To summarize, as we wind down the year, we remain financially strong and well positioned to weather the current low product price environment with $4.3 billion of cash on hand, roughly equal to our annualized capital outlays. We continue to grow our production volumes cost efficiently, and despite the decline in capital spending. We will continue our disciplined approach towards cost control, improving our capital efficiency, focusing and allocating our capital on only the highest return opportunities. Our capital spending run rate has been cut by more than half compared to year-ago levels and we expect to save at least $300 million as a result of initiatives to lower SG&A costs.","I'll now hand the call back over to Chris Degner.","Christopher M. Degner - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Chris. And Emily, could you please open up the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning guys. Your Permian Resources production again beat guidance. You're making progress on costs, efficiencies and you highlighted it as your top priority in your slides, but it's also one of the pieces your of portfolio where you can dial activity up and down. Can you talk about how you balance those factors when you're considering your 2016 Permian activity levels in the current environment?","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","Yes, Evan. As Chris said that our committed capital is coming down but we still do have some committed capital in 2016. So what we'll do is balance our Permian Resources business with the capital requirements elsewhere. As you know, we're trying to reduce our capital requirements in the Middle East and the reason for that is we would prefer to divert \u2013 to move capital to Permian Resources. But we do have the ability to swing it up and down. We're working on several scenarios that we could be ready to implement depending on what market prices are in 2016.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Let me follow up there. I mean, when you mention the potential in MENA (27:29) non-core asset sales, does that imply that the larger interest sell down remains back burnered? And on your G&A guidance, does that \u2013 that these announced assets are sold as well?","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","You're talking about the Middle East?","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, in the MENA. Sorry.","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","Currently we're looking at certainly exiting some of the non-core properties in the Middle East and ramping down activities in some of those areas that we're not going to exit. So that will certainly impact some of our SG&A cost. We expect those to go down as well as some of our operating cost. So that will be a benefit to us. And getting back to the resources question that you had previously, we do expect to, in all of the scenarios that we're looking at, to continue to grow production from our Permian Resources business.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Now on the G&A question, this is Steve. The answer to your question is no. We really haven't baked in the Middle East situation with the decline. So basically what we see now is \u2013 this is what we've said for next year's run rate are costs. We expect to continue to work on this as the portfolio changes.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. And the non-core \u2013 but by focusing on the non-core sales in MENA, I guess I'm saying does that also imply that the larger interest sell-down in that piece of the portfolio remains back burnered given the current environment. Is that fair?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the countries have gone from being flush with cash to being cash users just to fund their own situation. So it's not likely that they're in the mood to \u2013 basically they're selling things. They're not buying things right now.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. And maybe if I could ask one more question, Steve. Can you discuss what drove the Bakken asset sales given your ample liquidity position? I mean, is there a general comment there on your view of prices in the asset market that you see better opportunities to sell versus buy where you've highlighted that you'd potentially be a buyer in the Permian?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we sold the Bakken assets for about $600 million as opposed to the reported number, which I don't know where that came from. Anyway, we sold for about $600 million. We just can't see a situation where we would invest in it given what we have in the Permian. And so I mean, it's really a statement that says okay, we just don't see how it competes for capital inside the company in any reasonable price scenario that we can come up with. Generally it's always generated negative cash flow or at best neutral. It's declining about 1,000 barrels a day a quarter. So a year from now, it would be 13,000 or so a day just doing the arithmetic. So we don't see how the value increases over time.","For us, this $600 million, we could run four rigs in the Permian basin for a year with this money or five, somewhere in that range and generate more production than we would get out of the Bakken with the $600 million. So pretty easy decision. Say well, you could hold on until it goes up in price. By the time it goes up in price you might be making 8,000 barrels a day. So I just don't know when it's going to go up. We believe we received a fair price given the prospects for it under our management.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. I'll leave it for somebody else. Thanks.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning everybody. On the Middle East folks, the non-core areas that you're talking about, I'm trying to reconcile the $60 breakeven number with exiting some of these non-core areas. And I guess my question is, are these areas currently negative free cash flow, and if so, could you quantify what you think the delta would be in the event of an exit and if that's already assumed in your $60 breakeven assumption?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","$60 is just a cartoon. This is basically based on our current situation. The businesses are not cash flow positive.","Christopher G. Stavros - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Doug, we showed you on the slide that I pointed out, slide 21, that under various oil price scenarios, a higher oil price scenario of last year or lower prices this year, we're still running the combination of those assets are still running a sizable cash deficit after capital. So yeah, you were sort of at higher capital in a higher price environment, but still you weren't generating enough money to really see a free cash flow positive event.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we haven't gone back and recomputed what exactly the breakeven would be. So we don't really know whether it's $55 or $60.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. So maybe I could just slip in a macro question there. Could you update us on what you're doing in Iraq currently? Because obviously your partner, our understanding is the Iraqis are asking folks to slow down investment. So what are you actually seeing on your asset? And I've got a more Oxy-specific follow-up please.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sandy can answer that I think.","Edward A. Lowe - Vice President and President, Oil and Gas International Production","The Iraqis have asked us to slow down investment. And the infrastructure investment that we need to really take advantage of these fields that is the responsibility of the government has not taken place. So the production is just trucking along at a fairly stable amount. But not anything that would excite us.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And my final one if I may is, again I want to go back to this $60 breakeven, Steve, because if you look at this current quarter, obviously you're still burning through a fair amount of cash, and the oil price clearly is not $60. It's substantially below that. Although that's not our base case, what would you do in the event that you have another year of sub-$50 oil because that would imply you basically burn through all your cash at this rate?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think we'd burn through all the cash. Maybe we have a different model. But anyway, if you run through all the numbers, I think we'd look at it at the time. But as we cut back on the non-core assets, more cash will be generated. And so you could drill fewer wells in the Permian if that were necessary. We're not counting on -","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","You'd basically slow things down. Right.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we would bring the capital down lower. There's more savings as we go and so we're not exactly sure where we are in this process. So I think as we go through this next year, the large, the cracker basically ends at the end of this next year. The spending on that ends. Some of the stuff in the midstream ends at the end of next year. Al Hosn will be, all the capital will be spent. There's a little bit of capital in the beginning of the year for crew quarters as I recall. And so when now all that ends, the capital will naturally decline and the production goes up. So whether it's $60 or $55, we don't really know right now. But we would expect as we go into 2017 clearly that the capital program would be significantly less than \u2013 could be significantly less than next year even.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. I'll let someone else jump on. Thanks, everybody.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, hey. Good morning. Just first question just on the CapEx side. How would you think about what sustaining capital requirements there are today given all the productivity that you've been seeing in the Permian? And how did that relate to the $60 breakeven for dividend coverage as you move forward? I would assume that that's generally underlying your seeing some improvement there, but any color you could provide would be helpful.","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","Yeah, Phil, we're continuing to see improvements in the Permian Resources business. And as we've just said and said previously, our Resources businesses are swing business with respect to capital, we can, we have the ability to ramp up and ramp down. But we do see a scenario if oil prices improve a little bit for us to be able to continue to grow Resources and to manage some of the capital spend and in international down so that we could be cash flow neutral and grow Resources slightly in 2016.","And part of that's due to the fact that we're continuing to see improvements in our drilling and completion operations. And if you look at kind of the targets that, if you go back and look at our Q1 targets for our drilling and completion activity in Permian Resources, we've actually adjusted our targets a couple of times because our teams keep outperforming and beating our previous targets and setting new best rates. So currently two of the things that we're dealing with in terms of uncertainties is how much better can we get, and also what will prices be. So we're running both of those scenarios and we think we have opportunity to continue to improve.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Follow-up question just on the midstream business. In this lower for longer type of environment, how would you think about the earnings power of that business? I know it's volatile quarter to quarter, but if you think maybe on an annualized basis and you obviously have a couple of different sub-businesses within that. But any thoughts you have there would be helpful.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a difficult business to estimate. It's hodgepodge of different businesses. It's got a power business. It's got a standard transmission business. It also holds the capacity to ship oil out of the Permian. And right now there's more excess capacity in the basin to ship oil because people assume that oil would, the production would go up and it's clearly not for the industry. So we're paying demand charges essentially for that. And that's what's eating into the profitability. So it's really a difficult number to quantify because you have to really have an idea about these demand charges and what's going to happen with that. It has a probably underlying earning power in the $300 million or so area. But there's a lot of volatility on these demand charges.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure. And is that $300 million including the benefits we'll get from sulfur at Al Hosn?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Probably not. Probably not going to include it.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Last question though for me.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sulfur at Al Hosn is also, is makes predicting oil prices easy. I mean the price of sulfur can move $50 a ton overnight.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure. Understood. Last question.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Especially if there's a lot of tons.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On the Middle East you had a significant reduction in the cash operating costs in the third quarter. Any color on the big drivers and the sustainability of that?","Edward A. Lowe - Vice President and President, Oil and Gas International Production","We've had a cost improvement program going for a long time. And we have recently been able to make some breakthroughs on that with various vendors and it's just focusing on it. And same as in the Permian. Everybody in the company's focused on more profit per barrel and less cost per barrel.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think to be \u2013 I mean the way the accounting works in the Middle East on a production sharing contract, the company always bears all of the cost, all of the operating costs. So when oil prices are high, you get fewer barrels to cover that operating cost.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And higher, and lower oil prices you've got a lot more barrels to cover the exact same operating cost even if they don't change. So I mean that's -","Edward A. Lowe - Vice President and President, Oil and Gas International Production","It's a combination.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it's a little different than comparing to the US or something like that because you always have all of the, 100% of the operating costs essentially there. And so whether you produce 10,000 barrels a day or 20 net, operating cost is the same.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Rezvan of Sterne, Agee CRT. Please go ahead.","Timothy A. Rezvan - CRT Capital Group LLC","Hi. Good morning folks. First question I guess was on the US cash OpEx numbers that you reported in the third quarter, kind of flattish from 2Q. I know that you've had some big improvements early in the year. I guess you've talked qualitatively about bringing that down more, but maybe can you talk about what happened in the third quarter and kind of how we should think about the trajectory of that into 2016?","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","Yes. We've continued to improve our operating costs and basically we're focusing on the OpEx in Permian Resources and Permian EOR because in Williston we had some high OpEx there just because of the fact that our production was lower. But in the Permian, what we're doing is, we see the biggest opportunities in our Resources business where initially we had difficulty pumping from the deeper unconventional wells. We were trying to use either ESPs or beam pumps.","With both of those there were issues because of the depth of those wells and the initial very high volumes that then becomes lower volume pretty quickly in the life of the well. So now we've gotten to a point where we understand that better. We're addressing that better. We're actually ensuring that we installed a lift that's the right kind of lift for the full life cycle of the well so that we don't have high initial repair costs. So that's part of what's driving down our OpEx in the US.","In Permian EOR, those guys are continuing to optimize what they do with respect to well maintenance. They have a lot more wells over there. So they've been able to reduce quarter over quarter the cost per barrel in the EOR business by improving the well service rig performance, and improving how they deal with replacement of pumps and things like that, the materials they use and what they're doing there to extend the life of the wells. So we do expect continued improvement in both of those business units.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think the short answer is that the Williston operating costs went up and it dragged the average up.","Timothy A. Rezvan - CRT Capital Group LLC","Okay. Okay. I appreciate that comprehensive answer. Next question I guess on the repurchase program. Your average shares outstanding were down 3.3 million. You only spent $50 million in the third quarter. So I guess that's a factor, the timing of your 2Q activities. Should we expect in a $50 or sub-$50 oil environment that you will kind of run at a much lower pace on the repurchases? Or I guess what's your philosophy on that?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, if I had more confident in the oil price, we'd be more aggressive in the share repurchase. At this point it depends on two things; sort of a calculation of what's in the stock which is favorable to repurchase; and how fearful we are about the volatility in the oil price. So I think the fear overcame the calculation this past quarter. We keep on reading these analyst reports so that generates enormous fear.","Timothy A. Rezvan - CRT Capital Group LLC","I appreciate that commentary.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","You clearly shouldn't read analyst reports.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Clearly. I just read the headlines.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. No worries. Question on the Middle East. I mean you talk about ramping down activities, maybe non-core asset sales. I mean of the countries that you list there, Bahrain looks like one which might have a buyer in the sense of the production as opposed to those other countries. Is that what you're talking about?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Selling assets or just reducing activity?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just reducing activity I think is the way to say it. There's a significant amount of, call them receivables or whatever you want to call it, where we produce the oil and gas but haven't been paid in some of these places. And basically you're effectively building up a liability over time and basically we can't afford to do that currently. And so we'll reduce the activity until we can catch up with that accrual if you will. It doesn't show up on a balance sheet. It's simply the difference between production and liftings.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then on Block 9 you said on the last call, we'll look for a contract extension that's as least as good as what we could get back in the Permian. Any progress on how the other side of the table view that?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a difficult negotiation I think is the best way to describe it.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And ongoing?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And ongoing. I think it will go \u2013 it will go on until \u2013 all these things go on until there's no more time left.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And as a reminder, just in terms of now as we get down to end 2015 what the actual drop dead date is or...?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's in December.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, and then just moving to the midstream, the Ingleside cracker and the export facility for LPG should be fairly profitable in terms of EBITDA and free cash flow when they're on-stream.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's right.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just an update as to when you'd sort of -","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Towards the end of next year.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right, okay.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mid \u2013 second to third quarter as I recall.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Good. So CapEx comes down. Cash flow goes up and that helps balance.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah and the same thing, when the cracker is the end of \u2013 be done the end of next year and then the cash flow really in 2017. Same sort of dynamic except probably larger.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Gammel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yes. Thanks very much. I was hoping to just get a little more understanding on what led to the write-down on Iraq. Because my understanding was that it was an acceptable place to invest because you never really had a lot of capital exposed. And if you're reducing investment activity even more and you're still lifting oil, does that imply that you got into a situation of a big arrears with the government that you don't think you'll actually ever be able to get paid back?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There's clearly \u2013 I really don't want to get into a discussion about the contract terms there, except to say that in theory, you got your money back on a small profit pretty much as you spent the money, maybe a quarter or two off. And that really \u2013 and that hasn't exactly happened.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. I think that's a fair enough explanation. I think I get what's going on there. Now, at the risk of picking nits here, the Permian Resource production overall in the quarter, obviously very good, but it did seem to be a little more swung towards NGLs and gas and away from oil than what I would have normally expected. Vicki talked about moving to pad drilling and making it a more manufacturing process which makes it more lumpy. Is that the explanation for that or is there something else going on?","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","In addition to the pad drilling, we were able to capture some stranded gas in the last quarter and we were able to put that online and through processing and that's what drove some of that.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","So should we still think about this as 5,000 barrels a day of oil growth out of Permian Resources on a move forward basis with recognizing there could be variation from quarter to quarter?","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","There's going be lumpy production. So it could vary from quarter to quarter, but in terms of the differential with the gas with respect to oil this time, it was again \u2013 it was due to a one-time event to get some gas production on that we didn't previously have on.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, as you reduce the capital, have fewer rigs, the effect of this lumpiness is more obvious because you got these rigs working in one place and if you're in five places, well it sort of averages out. But as you reduce the number of rigs at work, the effect of the lumpiness from a quarter to quarter basis is a lot more obvious. So you might expect some more. You'll be able to see it in a normal environment. With a somewhat higher rig count, you wouldn't see it really. It would just smooth out.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yeah, okay. That makes sense to me. Okay. Thanks very much, folks.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. With respect to the Permian Resources unit, can you describe what you're doing in terms of the well completions that are different, or are you doing anything materially different than your peer group?","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","On the well completions, we've continued to try to find the exact mix of when to use slick water, when to use hybrid fluid systems and also what the cluster spacing should be, what the volume of the proppant should be. So what we've done is we've experimented a little bit trying to ensure that we get all of that optimized. And some of that we have enough data that we can optimize it and we know what to do. For example in cluster spacing, we can take the pressures that we see during the frac jobs and kind of get to a point where we know what that should be for a given area. So it's still really the proppant size and the fluid volumes and fluid types that we're experimenting with.","We did some experimentation with using some of the sleeves and things like that versus plug and perf. And we found that while the sleeves are somewhat effective in being able to isolate and frac, they're not as good when we try to flow the wells back because the sleeves actually cause variations in the flow back which drops out proppant, causes cleanup issues later.","So we're moving more toward now ensuring that what we do is we'll have optimum impact on not just recovery but the life of the well. So I think it's just still experimenting with those things that others do. We're waiting for our seismic. We should be done acquiring that in the Barilla Draw area soon, and we'll be processing that. And we hope that will lead to actual more improvements next year.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. With your EOR operations in the Permian, at current prices how much free cash flow are you generating from that?","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","At current prices, I can tell you, I can give you what we were generating. We were generating a couple of billion dollars when prices were in the $90 environment.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay.","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","Probably about -","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","About a margin, Chris.","Christopher G. Stavros - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Probably cash margins of about $20 a barrel or so.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Last one for me. You took a big impairment on gas. Did you really kitchen sink it in terms of pricing?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We hope so.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. My first question is a quick macro question. Steve, as you are doing your business in the Middle East, are you seeing any tangible signs of stress or second thoughts regarding OPEC's current production strategy by any of the countries in the region?","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If they had stress, they wouldn't share it with us. I think that's fair to say. What you do see of course is a lot of talk about raising money and that sort of thing. So if you want to view that as stress, you can. But they all say that they're aligned, whatever that means.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. You provided helpful color on non-core asset sales in MENA. As you continue to high grade your portfolio, how do you think about Colombia.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Vicki can answer that.","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","In Colombia, we recently signed an agreement with the government to implement a couple more water floods in Colombia. We see that as our asset there is the opportunity to continue to maintain our production. We'd like at some point to be able to grow the production a little bit. But currently we have a great relationship with the government and with Ecopetrol. We have a team down there that's incredibly efficient and knows the area very well. And our operating teams are very good there. So we see it as a place that, we've been there for over 30 year, would like to continue to be there another 30 years. The country itself has some opportunities outside of what we currently have. And certainly, any opportunity that comes up in Colombia is something we'd want to take a look at.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. And my last question is thinking about Permian capital allocation, with the results that you showed in East Midland, is it possible that capital in the Midland Basin can increase relative to the Delaware in 2016?","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","Currently, we were thinking that we would move more activity to the Delaware Basin. But you're right. Our Midland Basin team has been performing so well, and especially with this Big Spring area in Howard County, the performance there and in Merchant is getting to the point where those wells are really becoming very competitive with what we're doing in the Delaware.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to dig in a little bit on the broader Delaware and Midland Basin well performance to understand whether the strong wells you highlight here on slides 13 and 15 are trending relative to your broader acreage and drilling program and whether they're reflective of what we should expect going forward. I'm not sure if it's apples-to-apples, but if we look at the BOE a day per thousand feet of lateral you have for the 2015 averages, they both, on slides 13 and 15, appear to be below what was reported for the first half in the second quarter presentation. And so what I'm trying to get to is whether the specific wells you're highlighting here with much better rates are reflective of the wells we should expect going forward for specific portions of your acreage, whether they're good averages we should assume for your broader acreage or they're highlights of your best wells.","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","I think the 2015 average is not exactly representative of what we'll see going forward, but it's indicative of a trend that we'll see. What you're talking about, the trend downward was certainly impacted by the Peck State and the Buzzard State because initially we had incredible rates from the Peck State. It was about 2,400 BOE per day, 24-hour rate for the Peck State. About over 2,000 barrels a day for the Buzzard State. Those wells were two of our best wells in the Delaware Basin.","What we're trying to do and the reason we're still, and in answer to John's question, the reason I said we're still trying to tweak things and work things is that we feel like we should have the ability to continue to increase our performance per well. And we're still, we think that with the seismic, we'll be able to figure out what made the Peck State and the Buzzard State so good. And then we'll target trying to hit either the interval that was so good in there or the area, or types of areas like that. And so that's exactly the reason for the seismic is to try to determine whether their reservoir, whether there are areas that are driven by reservoir quality or characteristics that we can move toward in our development program toward the end of 2016. Because by the time we have the seismic processed and evaluated, it would not start impacting the program until the end of next year.","But that's exactly what it's designed to do, is look for whether or not those wells were in a particular area that's limited, or whether it's broader and we just aren't getting the chemistry of the frac jobs right or the location within the interval. That's not to say we're not having great wells. We're having great wells, but we do want to continue to improve them. We'd love to see more of those types.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. And my follow-up is also on slide 13 where you have the nice map of your focus acreage. Can you just refresh us on how many acres that focus area represents and what it would take and any plans to turn some of the other acreage we see there of Oxy's into focus acreage?","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","Well, we have as you know 1.5 million net acres in the unconventional business and our inventory of wells really, the appraisal wells that we've shown you, that 8,300 well inventory was really based on an appraisal of about half of that. And then our development areas, we're trying to keep at an even lower acreage percentage than that because what we're trying to do is ensure that we completely build out as we build our infrastructure. So probably the Barilla Draw area represents an acreage, at least what we're really concentrating on developing, probably two or three pods that would total up to be about 40,000 or 50,000 in the Delaware Basin.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons. Please go ahead.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thank you all for fitting me in here. I had a follow-up question on some of the earlier questions around capital spending flexibility into 2016. And I apologize if I missed this earlier, but can you just help us understand the amount of capital spending currently being dedicated to the portion of your MENA program that you deem as non-core? Just trying to understand the opportunity set for the potential spending reductions there that you might be pursuing.","Vicki A. Hollub - Senior Executive Vice President and President, Oxy Oil and Gas","It's $400 million, $400 million.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's $400 million.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Thanks. And then Al Hosn ramping up faster than expected on the production front. Can you discuss that outperformance? And then also can you address the contributions during the quarter from a cash flow perspective? And really trying to understand the timing of the cash flow contributions there and what the peak cash flow contributions are in this environment. Obviously it's difficult to predict given the sulfur exposure and the less transparency on some of the pricing.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think the cash has normal settlement with it. So the production is actually doing pretty much the way it's said. I mean the 60,000 is what we talked about. Cash flow before capital settles like others and so it was a little back end loaded in the third quarter. So there was less of it in the third quarter than we'll see in the fourth quarter. There's some capital that needs to be spent in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter for some things which we'll use some of the money. The business just depends on really oil prices, the volatility in the business. So I think we're talking about $300 million of free cash. And then it could be as much as $1 billion depending on oil prices sort of in the $70s.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay, great. That's helpful, Steve. And then last one for me. You mentioned exiting 2015 with Permian Resources production of around 120,000 barrels a day. So on over $2 billion of CapEx this year, you're obviously growing that business very significantly. Do you have an estimate of the level of spending that could hold that 120,000 flat through next year? Just trying to understand how that compares to the $2 billion plus you're spending this year that's driving considerable growth.","Stephen I. Chazen - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're now discussing among ourselves as to what that number might be. So under $1 billion I think. But we don't know whether it's $700 million or $800 million or $900 million. Because things keep getting better, that's why we're slow in giving you these answers because we just don't know, and we don't want to mislead you.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Got it, understood. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Degner for any closing remarks.","Christopher M.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental Petroleum's fourth quarter 2016 conference call. On the call with us today are: Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jody Elliott, President of Domestic Oil & Gas; Sandy Lowe, Group Chairman, Middle East; Ken Dillon, President of International Operations; Chris Stavros, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Peterson, President of OxyChem.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause results to differ is available on the company's most recent Form 10-K.","Our fourth quarter 2016 earnings press release, the Investor Relations supplemental schedules, our non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations, and the conference call presentation slides can be downloaded off of our website at www.oxy.com.","I'll now turn the call over to Vicki Hollub. Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today we'll provide you a summary of our 2016 results, a high-level preview of 2017, and a more detailed update of our Permian inventory.","But the key message I'd like to convey is that we will continue to provide value to our shareholders through an attractive dividend and an ability to grow our cash flow and earnings through moderate production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. This has been our strategy for a long time and it has not changed. What has changed is that we have dramatically derisked the delivery of that value proposition. The quality of our portfolio today enables us to achieve our corporate goals through organic growth.","Our exit from non-core areas along with proving up our Permian Resources inventory provides us with a good blend of low-decline long-term cash flow generating assets that are important to support our dividends, along with significant short-cycle growth opportunities.","We can now provide all of our targeted cash flow and earnings growth through organic development. In fact, Permian Resources can do it alone. From 2013 to 2016, we've doubled Permian Resources production. We can more than double it again over the next four years in a moderate commodity price environment. We can do this because we are a more geographically-focused company today. This focus has led to technical and operational improvements in all of our core areas. We have long been recognized as a global leader in enhanced recovery technology.","As shown on slides 6 through 8, with our more focused approach, we have built on our historical successes and are achieving even greater success today in our core international operations. A recent example is the Al Hosn gas team, who increased the rated capacity of the gas plant to 110% of its original nameplate.","We have now achieved the same level of success in our unconventional operations in the Permian. In late 2013, we began the transformation of our unconventional business by restructuring into smaller strategic teams with greater emphasis on subsurface technical excellence and operational execution efficiency. This has paid off as we executed an aggressive appraisal program in 2014 followed by focused development plans in 2015 and 2016.","Our expanded subsurface expertise along with our innovative drilling and completion practices has resulted in step-change improvements in our unconventional operations. We can now generate play-leading returns that are robust, even with lower oil prices. Jody will provide more detail on our Permian business.","As excited as we are about Permian Resources, the powerful combination of our long-term resource potential, our technical capability, and our partner relationships is even more compelling. The Permian, our Middle East countries, and Colombia all have one thing in common. They have significant remaining resource potential waiting to be unlocked by our technical expertise, from primary to secondary to tertiary recovery. Unlike some of our competition, we don't have to look elsewhere for opportunities, and we believe the Middle East and the Permian will continue to play a critical role in supplying the energy needed to meet the world's ever-increasing needs. We are unique in providing this opportunity to investors.","In 2016, our oil and gas operations continued to lower total cost structure and increase recoveries from our reservoirs. You'll see the impact of this later in our reserve statistics.","Slides 10 through 12 show highlights of key 2016 accomplishments in all of our areas. I won't read them all, but I would like to point out that we ended 2016 with $2.2 billion in cash, and we were able to achieve the higher end of our production guidance with less capital than expected. This is due to our capital execution efficiencies and is reflected in our F&D costs.","We replaced nearly 190% of our production at a cost of $9.65 per BOE. As a result, our total proved reserves increased from 2.2 billion BOE to 2.4 billion BOE, mostly due to Al Hosn and Permian Resources. Al Hosn reserves increased due to better than expected reservoir performance. The increased reserves in Permian Resources were driven by a successful development program and higher well productivity. Based on our Permian Resources current inventory of 11,650 wells, we'll be able to continue to replace reserves for the foreseeable future. Our current proved reserves are limited only by the five-year SEC rule.","Last year's drilling program in Permian Resources delivered strong reserve replacement at an F&D cost of less than $9 per BOE. When combined with our total cash costs of approximately $11 per BOE, an incremental dollar investment in our Permian Resources business delivers pre-tax margins in excess of 50% at $55 WTI.","As we go into 2017, we have more confidence in the stability of the oil markets and increased flexibility in our capital plan, as we have completed most of our multiyear investment programs. We are encouraged by the recent OPEC decision to lower production quotas, and we've seen the read-through in our operations and an increased demand for our crude in international markets. Our capital plan will prepare the business for an improved commodity price environment heading into 2018 while maintaining the flexibility to adjust activity if market conditions warrant. We'll continue improving our operational and technical excellence to further reduce our cost structure and improve recoveries.","Based on our available cash and market conditions, we'll execute a capital plan of between $3 billion and $3.6 billion in 2017. In addition to cash flow from operations, our capital program will be supported by cash flow from a sizable tax refund and the monetization of non-core assets.","We're reducing capital in Permian EOR and Chemicals while holding capital flat in the Middle East and Midstream. We'll increase capital moderately in Colombia and significantly in Permian Resources. Our plan anticipates oil prices to remain approximately as reflected in the futures markets. In the Permian Basin, the increase in capital spending will be mostly directed to increased activity in southeast New Mexico and the Greater Barilla Draw area.","As I mentioned previously, the short-cycle nature of our development programs provide us the flexibility necessary in an uncertain market environment. If we see declines in oil prices, we will adjust our capital program down.","With increased spending in our oil and gas business, we expect production from our core assets to grow 4% to 7% in 2017 adjusted for production-sharing contract effects. Most of the increase in production will be driven by Permian Resources.","In closing, I'd like to reiterate that our cash flow priorities have not changed. Our top priority for cash flow is and always will be the safety of our employees, contractors, and public along with the maintenance of our operations. The next priority is to support the growth of our dividend. Any remaining available cash will be used to fund growth opportunities, primarily through organic growth and Permian Resources.","All of our decisions are driven by a focus on returns and our strategy to continue to grow the dividend over the long term. As you know, this puts us in a unique position in the industry. We are more similar to majors with respect to our dividend, cash flow, and balance sheet objectives. But unlike majors, we have a greater growth potential because we have an incredible portfolio. To maximize the value of this unique position, we must be technically excellent and have a high level of operational efficiency. Focus will do this for us, allowing us to widen our competitive advantage. And, we'll continue to make deliberate decisions with respect to capital allocation. Keeping our capital allocation decisions consistent with our long-term strategy we believe will result in increased stock market value.","Now I'll turn the call to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results.","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Vicki, and good morning everyone. Today I'll focus on the following items: a brief review of the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial results; cash flow and liquidity items into 2017; and guidance for oil and gas production and specific business segment items for the first quarter and full year.","As Vicki noted, we ended last year with improved results in our core operations. We anticipate this momentum carrying into 2017 as a result of higher commodity prices, continued growth in our production volumes, and vigorous cost management. This is expected to lead to improved profitability and cash flow this year.","Fourth quarter 2016 reported financial results for GAAP purposes were a loss of $0.36 per diluted share. Our fourth quarter reported results included a non-cash accounting adjustment to book an allowance for doubtful accounts. Our core financial results for the fourth quarter of 2016 were a loss of $97 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to a loss of $112 million or $0.15 a share during the third quarter. Oil and gas pre-tax core income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $2 million compared to losses of $49 million in the third quarter and $106 million during last year's fourth quarter.","For the fourth quarter of 2016, total company oil and gas production volumes averaged 607,000 BOE per day, coming in at the high end of our guidance. Full-year 2016 production of 602,000 BOE per day from ongoing operations grew 7% and was better than expected due to stronger growth in Permian Resources and improved operations at Al Hosn gas.","Permian Resources production of 123,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter improved sequentially due to our recent acquisition and increased drilling activity in the Delaware Basin. Resources production for the full year of 2016 grew 13% to 124,000 BOE per day despite a two-thirds reduction in year-over-year capital. These results were achieved due through a combination of better management around our base production and greater productivity from new wells. Higher fourth quarter volumes marks a turning point for Permian Resources, as accelerated drilling activity and improved well performance is expected to lead to stronger growth in 2017.","Full-year 2016 cash operating costs in Permian Resources were $8.43 per BOE, a 25% improvement compared to full-year 2015 costs.","Our overall Permian oil and gas operations generated more than $130 million of free cash flow after capital during the fourth quarter, a sequential quarterly improvement of over $100 million.","International production for the fourth quarter was 311,000 BOE per day, flat with the third quarter. Cash operating costs for our ongoing international oil and gas operations declined by 11% to approximately $10 per BOE for all of 2016. Our international oil and gas operations from our core four countries generated more than $200 million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter.","Chemicals fourth quarter 2016 pre-tax core earnings of $152 million increased from $117 million on a sequential quarterly basis, well above our guidance of $100 million for the quarter. Improvement in caustic soda prices was the single largest driver of higher profitability, as firm global demand and reduced supply tightened markets. Higher vinyl margins, driven by lower ethylene costs, also boosted quarterly results. Our Chemicals business generated roughly $140 million of free cash flow after capital during the fourth quarter.","Midstream pre-tax core results were a loss of $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $20 million in the third quarter. The lower sequential earnings reflected a decrease in equity income from our PAGP interest following their recent simplification, lower seasonal margins in our power and foreign pipeline assets, and mark-to-market impacts in our marketing business due to volatility in crude oil prices during the quarter.","Turning to our cash flows for the 12 months of 2016, we generated $3.6 billion of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital. Changes in working capital consumed $400 million of cash, most of which occurred during the first half of the year. Capital expenditures for 2016 were $2.9 billion, approximately half the prior year's outlay and below our original budget of $3 billion. Total oil and gas spending for the year was nearly $2 billion, a 55% decline compared to 2015. Despite the sharp drop in year-over-year capital spending, we managed to grow our production volume 7% during 2016.","Last year we spent approximately $1.7 billion on asset acquisitions net of divestitures, primarily on oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin. We received $1.5 billion of net proceeds from debt issuance last year and have no material amount of debt maturities until 2021. We also received $880 million of cash from our settlement with Ecuador.","In November, the major rating agencies affirmed our single-A credit rating along with a stable outlook. We also returned $2.3 billion to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends.","For 2017, we have more than ample liquidity to execute our business plan. We started the year with $2.2 billion of cash, as Vicki mentioned, after generating $1 billion of cash from operations before working capital in the fourth quarter at WTI prices slightly under $50 a barrel.","We anticipate oil prices rising moderately through the year, and everyone $1 per barrel change in oil price impacts our cash flow by about $100 million annually. Higher oil prices together with growing production from Permian Resources should improve free cash flow after capital by more than $500 million from our combined Permian operations.","Better pricing as well as improved production and cost reductions at Al Hosn and in Oman should increase free cash flow from our international oil and gas operations by more than $400 million compared to last year.","Improved crude oil marketing economics, better NGL pricing, and the ramp-up of the Ingleside oil storage and export facility is expected to contribute approximately $150 million to $200 million of additional cash flow this year.","Free cash flow from our Chemicals business is expected to increase by about $400 million in 2017 due to higher caustic soda prices, the startup of the joint venture ethylene cracker, and lower capital spending. The combination of a continued favorable global supply\/demand balance and low inventories are expected to support further improvement in caustic soda prices in the market. Each $10 per ton increase in our realized price for caustic soda results in approximately $30 million of additional cash flow.","We expect to receive a cash tax refund in excess of $700 million sometime during the second quarter of this year. We also plan to monetize some non-core and non-strategic assets, including our investment in the Plains General Partnership, which should generate proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion this year.","Beyond our immediate needs to fund our dividend and stated range of capital spending, excess cash would be reinvested in high-return opportunities and to accelerate growth, primarily in Permian Resources.","In terms of our capital spending, we adjusted our capital program last year in response to the sharp decline in product prices, especially during the first three quarters, with our full-year 2016 outlays of $2.9 billion at roughly half the prior year. For 2017, our plan is to remain disciplined with our capital within the current product price environment. We will focus on allocating our capital where we have the highest return and opportunities for growth, and will harvest cash flow from assets where longer-term capital requirements are largely complete.","As Vicki mentioned, we estimate our 2017 total capital program to be between $3 billion and $3.6 billion. The range of capital will depend on continued gradual improvement in market fundamentals and stability around product prices. Our committed project capital is expected to decline by more than $1 billion from our 2014 outlays to an estimated $200 million this year. The reduction in capital for committed projects provides greater flexibility in our budget to pursue shorter-cycle growth opportunities.","With respect to guidance and as Vicki mentioned, we expect our full-year 2017 production growth from ongoing operations to be in the range of 4% to 7%, between 625,000 to 645,000 BOE per day, slightly impacted by OPEC quota constraints and volume impacts under our production-sharing contracts due to higher oil prices. Our production growth expectations over the long term remain at 5% to 8%.","Increased spending and drilling activity in Permian Resources is expected to provide production growth of 13% to 20% this year, with total volumes in a range of between 140,000 and 150,000 BOE per day. Production in Permian Resources is anticipated to exit this year nearly 25% higher than year-end 2016 levels. Operational improvements at Al Hosn are expected to account for an additional 8,000 BOE per day of production this year compared to 2016.","For the first quarter, we expect our companywide production volumes to be in the range of 590,000 to 595,000 BOE per day. Seasonal maintenance turnarounds associated with gas-related projects at Al Hosn and Dolphin are expected to reduce volumes by about 15,000 BOE per day in the quarter and are expected to return to full capacity for the remainder of the year. Higher oil prices should slightly reduce our Middle East volumes under our production-sharing contracts, although better prices would also generate higher cash flow. Production at Permian Resources is expected to be between 127,000 a day and 132,000 BOE per day in the first quarter.","In Midstream, we expect the first quarter to generate a pre-tax loss of between $60 million and $70 million. The lower anticipated sequential result is mainly attributed to annual planned maintenance in our foreign pipeline business. We expect spreads between Midland and the Gulf Coast to be fairly consistent with the fourth quarter and anticipate receiving a slight uplift from our Ingleside crude terminal, which is now fully operational. As 2017 progresses, we expect Midstream earnings to gradually improve, generating positive income in the second half of the year. A large portion of the improvement should be driven by increased spreads between Midland of the Gulf Coast as a result of rising production in the Permian Basin.","In Chemicals, we anticipate pre-tax earnings of about $150 million for the first quarter on continued strength in caustic soda prices, partly offset by higher energy and ethylene costs impacting our margins. Construction of the Ingleside ethylene cracker is nearly complete and we anticipate startup this quarter.","Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is expected to be about $15 per BOE for 2017 compared to $15.44 per BOE last year, partially as a result of lower finding and development costs last year. The combined depreciation for the Chemicals and Midstream segments should be approximately $685 million.","Cash operating costs for the domestic oil and gas business should be about $13 per BOE during 2017 compared to $12.12 per BOE last year, with much of the increase due to higher costs for purchased injectant and higher energy-related costs. Exploration expense for the full year is estimated to be about $100 million pre-tax, with $25 million of the anticipated cost in the first quarter.","Every $1 per barrel change in WTI affects our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million. A swing of $0.50 per 1 million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $45 million.","Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our full-year 2017 domestic tax rate to be about 36%. Our international tax rate should be about 55%.","I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who will provide more specific details around our 2017 plans for increased drilling activity in Permian Resources and a fresh update around our high-quality drilling inventory.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.","During 2016 we asked our teams to outperform many demanding operational and financial targets. Our teams rose to the occasion and exceeded our expectations during an extremely challenging time in our industry's history. Our team showed their resolve and ingenuity by staying focused on the priority needs of the business while developing new ideas and innovative technologies. In particular, I'd like to acknowledge our field employees, who maintained a safe and productive environment every day across our operational locations.","Our four main accomplishments in the Permian Basin during 2016 were: continued reduction in our operating expenses; additional gains in drilling and completion efficiencies; further increases in the productivity of our wells; and continued improvement of our base production.","During the two-year downturn we reduced our operating expenses by over 27% on a per-BOE basis and reduced our drilling and completion costs 33%. We decreased our F&D costs by 25% while realizing 10% compounded annual growth in our production. We continue to build our improvements for long-term sustainability and believe we're positioned to continue this progress into 2017 and beyond.","With over 2.5 million acres of diverse and growing opportunities, we believe we're uniquely positioned to be the long-term leader in the Permian Basin. Today we'd like to share more insight into our acreage position, our priorities, and our key development areas.","One of the highlights of our position and the focus of much of our development and growing inventories is our 650,000 net acres in the Delaware and Midland Basins. Permian Resources had another successful year of understanding our resource base and improving our development inventory value. We increased the number of under-$50 WTI breakeven locations by approximately 1,250 wells, while at the same time increasing the average lateral length of each well by 20% to 7,100 feet. These accomplishments along with many more give us the ability to drive double-digit growth from these assets for the foreseeable future.","Additionally, we will share an update from our Permian EOR business, where our inventory of less than $6.00 BOE future development cost opportunities have now grown to over 870 million BOE.","The Resources and EOR assets and capabilities along with our dominant acreage position in the greater Permian set OXY up for a successful future. And finally, as Vicki mentioned, we continue to stay focused on our capital-efficient return-based development approach by seeking additional ways to maximize the net present value of the portfolio.","As we've communicated in the past, our entire Permian acreage position encompasses 2.5 million net acres, with 1.4 million in our unconventional business area and 1.1 million in our Enhanced Oil Recovery business. Approximately 650,000 net acres of the 1.4 million lies within the Delaware and Midland Basin boundary lines, as indicated on the map on slide 31. We consider these our core unconventional acres.","Of the 650,000 core unconventional acres, we've evaluated approximately 300,000 acres and have moved them into our development portfolio. The updated inventory count of 11,650 locations is associated with these 300,000 net acres. We will continue to evaluate the remaining 350,000 net core unconventional acres, as we have a high degree of confidence in the potential and value of this acreage. Much of this acreage is already being appraised and will be part of a growing inventory over the next few years.","Our New Mexico Delaware Basin position encompasses 290,000 net acres and includes the Greater Sand Dunes area, a key development position which I will speak to shortly. In the Texas Delaware Basin, we have 150,000 net acres, which includes 35,000 net acres from our recent acquisition in the Greater Barilla Draw, a development area which is now over 100,000 acres. In the Midland Basin, OXY holds approximately 210,000 net unconventional acres. Other unconventional opportunities include 215,000 net acres in the Central Basin Platform and 150,000 high-potential net acres in the New Mexico Northwest Shelf.","Finally, we continue to advance development potential across many areas, including 50,000 net acres within our emerging unconventional position, and another 335,000 net acres are in the appraisal queue. We believe these opportunities can be exploited using our unconventional appraisal and disciplined development approach.","Turning to slide 32, we've provided an update to the breakeven economics of our drilling locations associated with the 300,000 net development portfolio acres. Before speaking to the year-over-year changes, I would like to reemphasize. The average lateral length of the locations represented in the chart has increased from 5,950 feet to 7,100 feet. In total, we added 3,150 locations, an increase of 37%. Nearly half of our drilling inventory or 5,300 locations are economic under $70 WTI.","But what is most important in today's price environment is that our team nearly doubled our breakeven under-$50 WTI inventory to 2,500 locations. Furthermore, we believe our inventory will continue to move towards a lower breakeven as we improve our efficiencies and increase our well productivity through continued subsurface evaluation, integration of 3-D seismic, and data analytics.","Moving on to growth potential through disciplined capital-efficient development on slide 34, we illustrate our ability to accelerate growth through the end of the decade. Under a moderate scenario of a ramp to nine rigs by 2019, we conservatively believe we can drive a production CAGR of 20%. In an upside scenario with a ramp to 15 rigs by 2019, we conservatively believe that we can drive a production CAGR of 30%. Our intention with this graph is to demonstrate the capabilities of these two core development-ready assets rather than indicating any particular future capital spend.","On the next slide, we'd like to highlight the two areas that will drive our growth at low-breakevens for many years to come, the Greater Barilla Draw and the Greater Sand Dunes. We've spoken quite a bit about our industry-leading position in the Greater Barilla Draw. Equally as important is our position we've identified as the Greater Sand Dunes. We have four proven economic zones in this region and are delineating four other zones, with a combined potential of over 2,000 wells. This is one of our most prolific positions in our portfolio and has continued to improve. There are several key value drivers I'll highlight on the next few slides.","The majority of our $1 billion to $1.4 billion capital budget will be allocated to these two areas, with approximately 80% in reserve-adding capital investment. This will fund roughly six operated rigs and two equivalent non-operated rigs during 2017. We expect to drill and complete 117 operated wells, which does not include the wells from our non-operated investments. While we prioritize development to these positions in the short term, we expect similar breakthroughs in other areas of our acreage position that will continue to improve through our subsurface characterization efforts and innovative technologies.","Turning to the next slide, we demonstrate how our wells have improved from prior performance and are also industry-leading in the area. In the top chart, our Second Bone Spring six-month cumulative results have improved 150% from our old design in 2014 to our most recent wells in the second half of 2016. This was a result of improved wellbore placement through our subsurface characterization efforts and continued stimulation design improvements that include increased proppant loading from 1,000 to 2,100 pounds per foot and decreased cluster spacing from about 100 feet to about 50 feet.","In the bottom chart, our most recent well results continue to improve, with average 30-day rates of 1,479 barrels of oil per day.","On slide 37, you'll see why we're so excited about this area of our portfolio. With 6,000 feet of gross interval and multiple zones enabling returns greater than 50%, we're developing this area to produce for many years to come. Our three most recent Cedar Canyon wells averaged a 30-day BOE per day rate of over 2,200 with 80% oil cuts. And similarly, a recent well in the Wolfcamp XY IP-ed at a rate higher than 2,100 with a 71% oil cut.","As we look forward and continue our improvement in well costs, we continue to focus on all three areas for progress, design, operational performance, and managing our market or contractual cost. As we show with the New Mexico Second Bone Spring well cost example, most of our cost performance gains have come through our efforts in operational performance. We see opportunities in both design and operational performance as we continue into 2017. And we'll be focused on reducing our drilling times, improving our execution of our evolving frac designs, and continuing to use technological advancements like produced water fracs. Areas like New Mexico, where we will be entering into our manufacturing mode phase, will help us progress this quickly.","Further, as we move into a potential upward cycle of industry activity and cost inflation, we believe taking actions to sustain execution performance gains is the key. To support this, we are working with our service contractors to target areas and partnerships to allow us advantages with joint logistics and operational performance capabilities. We believe this proactive and collaborative work focused on overall supply chain and operational efficiency provides us the ability to sustain and even improve our well cost over the long term.","Moving to our Permian EOR business, I'd like to highlight the vast inventory of low F&D projects that stretch across the Permian Basin. Our industry-leading expertise in secondary and tertiary recovery, vast infrastructure, and secured CO2 sourcing provide us with a unique portfolio to maximize recoveries across our acreage position. We're currently recovering hydrocarbons from the Grayburg down to the Devonian and realizing recovery factors above 60% in some of our CO2 floods. The EOR assets have been the foundation for our Permian business and will continue to play a role in our portfolio as we invest in low F&D projects that provide significant cash flow for growth.","2016 was a great year for our EOR business. We made additional improvements in operating and capital efficiency while continuing to improve recoveries and maintain our base production. At the end of 2015, we began Phase 1 of the CO2 flood in South Hobbs. We're extremely pleased with the response from the reservoir, as results have been better than expected, and we're planning to implement Phase 2 in 2017.","Our combined portfolio of unconventional and conventional acreage differentiates our position from that of our competitors. Our Permian Basin assets and our unconventional and EOR development capabilities and technology give us a unique perspective on creating long-term shareholder value. With over 40 years operating large field manufacturing-like CO2 operations, our workforce is skilled in managing diverse reservoirs for improved recoveries and value. Our Resources teams have continued to enhance our subsurface characterization, development capabilities, and technology as well. We believe the combination of these businesses and capabilities in addition to our vast Permian acreage position provides the ability to generate valuable growth opportunities for OXY. We are well positioned to find new and innovative ways to increase ultimate recovery in areas with massive resource potential but with low primary recoveries.","To close, we believe we've come a long way in leveraging the potential of the combination of the unconventional and EOR businesses in our Permian position. The importance of running these two businesses together will grow even more over time. We also understand that having the resource matters little without pulling forward value in the near term. To achieve this, we will pursue opportunities to continue to increase net present value for our shareholders.","I'll now turn the call back to Chris Degner.","Christopher M. Degner - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Jody. We will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody, and thanks a lot for the new disclosure this morning. My question is your relative capital allocation in 2017, it's increasing for the Permian Resources up to the mid-30s following these positive well results and inventory update. That appears to be a shift in the strategy towards the Permian. So how should we think about relative capital allocation within this growth bucket? Is it the high end of your Permian guidance, the first call on incremental capital above the dividend and maintenance? And would asset sales like those mentioned in Chris's opening comments, would that drive activity upside in 2017 on the strip, or how do you plan that?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Evan. First of all, going back to our cash flow priorities, when we're looking at the use of cash flow from operations, as I said in my script, we first allocate to our maintenance capital, our HES [Health, Environment, Safety] safety and sustainability capital. Then we fund the dividend. Beyond that, what we consider the growth capital, to allocate that, what we really look at is the combination of what it can provide for us in terms of returns, and also what it does for us in terms of long-term cash flow. So when we make the allocation decisions, it's a combination of those two that we need to support our objectives and to continue to support the dividend.","But within the portfolio now in terms of what we see in the Permian Resources business, that has been and will continue to be generally our highest return business. And we had this past year \u2013 it was really a focus for us. We've said for a long time that the Permian Basin is pretty much the foundation of our company, and so Permian Resources is the main growth engine. However, as you can see from the slide 23, of our free cash flow swing in 2017, $400 million we're expecting to come from our international operations. And of that $400 million, about two-thirds of that will come from our Block 9 contract, which we re-signed last month. So the rest will come from Colombia and Al Hosn. So it's critically important for us to continue to work on growing our cash flow while at the same time ensuring that we invest as much as we can in the Permian Resources business, which for now for us is generating really good returns.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Maybe just a point of clarification, does the asset sales that were mentioned earlier, do asset sales then drive upside to what you've provided in the guidance today?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Today's guidance was based on the liquidity that we expect to have available to us for 2017. So we don't expect any increase in our capital spend for 2017. We expect $3.6 billion to be the upper end. We'll go into 2018 with what we believe is a pretty strong cash balance, and we'll plan accordingly for increases in capital in 2018 should the market conditions warrant. So what we will look at is we'll look at the prices for not only oil, but in our Chemicals business, and we'll see what the market conditions look like.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, my second question, if I could. If we go to the new updated inventory data, can you provide color on what \u2013 I think you did in some of your prepared comments, but color on what the 300,000 acres that the location count is based upon represents? Meaning I just want to understand potential location upside from what's been analyzed and understand better your cash priority statement that includes acquisitions, if that reflects a desire to add acreage in the Permian.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Okay, we'll let Jody answer the first part of that.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Evan, good morning. The 300,000 acres, I think the way to think about that is it's really development-ready. We've been through that appraisal, subsurface evaluation, infrastructure investment, precursor to getting it to our development team. So that's the 300,000. The difference between that and the 650,000 is that's now in the appraisal queue, being worked. A lot of that is being derisked by competitor activity and our OBO [Operated by Others] activity. So that's the difference between the 300,000 and the 650,000 acres.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","And, Evan, with respect to the monetization of assets, we're continually looking at opportunities too in our portfolio and prioritizing the projects that we have, and we'll always do that. And there may be opportunities down the road where we may find things that would be better monetized today rather than waiting on development.","The issue in the Permian Basin is that everywhere we look, as we look deeper, we find more opportunities. So the Permian is a place where we think that it's first of all very difficult to drill a dry hole there. Secondly, the more you learn about it and the more you engineer it, the better your wells get. And so we value that portfolio, but we're still very conscious of the fact that we need to optimize the net present value. So we'll continually look at that. It's this process that we've gone through that's driven us to exit the non-core areas that we've exited in the last couple years. So we'll continue that process.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Mr. Westlake, your line is open. Next we have Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you. I'll take Ed's question for him. Actually, we could go back to the discussion, Jody, at the end there, the 2,500 locations, and then I guess the discussion of the 650,000 acres. What should we think of as the key items that get analyzed and changed such that you are able to double the number of locations and then think about and increase the number of below-$50 breakeven locations going forward? What are the critical path items we should be paying attention to here?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Roger, for us it's really probably two things. It's better execution efficiency. So we're drilling more wells with the same number of rigs at a lower cost. So our time to market is faster. That changes your economics. The other is subsurface characterization combined with stimulation design. So we're landing our wells in places that we believe give us the highest stimulated rock volume. We're staying in zone at a much, much higher percentage through our drilling technologies. And our stimulation designs, in general you're seeing larger, per-sand volumes tighter cluster spacing. But those are really custom designed by each area. So that's really created a lot of the increase as well as we continue to appraise and derisk new acreage.","The 2,500 locations below $50, I would think that's a pretty conservative number given that our approach to spacing we think about in that capital-efficient return-based approach. We don't want to overcapitalize these assets, and so we look hard at what spacing ought to be. We evaluate that. We test different spacing scenarios, and then continue to look at spacing scenarios from our OBO exposure and learn from those as well.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. And then along those lines, as we think about on slide 34 the nine-rig baseline of 20% CAGR and the higher rig count for 30%, does that require those 2,500 well sites going up, or is it an oil price-driven event? Or maybe another way of thinking about it, if all these efficiencies come through maybe quicker than you think, do we get 15 rigs and a 30% CAGR, even if crude stays, say, $50 to $55, where it's been here year to date?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Roger, there's plenty of inventory. That projection of the 20% and 30% CAGR is from those core development areas. So there's over 14 years of rig activity if you were at 10 rigs to drill up that inventory. So it's not an inventory question at all to drive those kind of growth rates. And the capital requirement for both the 20% and the 30% growth rates are pretty moderate.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So I guess then my final question is why not something \u2013 and maybe this goes more to Vicki \u2013 but why not something a little more aggressive here if the numbers work fairly well?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","It goes back to being capital-efficient and return-focused. We want to make sure we have the subsurface understanding, our execution efficiency, our technology and the infrastructure all timed properly so that you get the best rate of returns. And then the amount of capital that gets allocated goes back to the priorities that Vicki mentioned earlier.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, all right. I think I get that. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hello. Can you hear me now?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Yes, we can.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Oh, thank God, okay. So just on the international production and CapEx, I was thinking that CapEx would come down a bit this year. The $900 million still feels flat year over year. But maybe talk about how long you can keep the international production flat or the growth outlook, say, out through the next few years and how much CapEx it would take to do so.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","So, Ed, we have lots of opportunities in both \u2013 especially in Oman, where we just recently obtained some seismic over Block 9. So we're doing infill drilling that's very successful. We've got Block 62 gas development. We also see opportunities above and below our current steam flood interval in Mukhaizna. And so we have a lot of potential there, and that's why I mentioned it in my comments.","I think people don't realize that actually Oman and Qatar have stacked pay, not exactly as obvious to most of the industry as the Permian is. But they're stacked pay intervals, and we're having success developing outside of what our traditional and original completion intervals were. So we're really excited about what the seismic is showing us. We're also pretty excited about our cost-cutting in Qatar, where our team has been able to develop a modular platform that will be able to enable us to expand what we're doing there at a much lower cost.","And I'll pass it to Ken Dillon to talk a little bit more about those, but we have opportunities both in Oman and Qatar to continue to keep production flat, or slightly grow.","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Good morning, it's Ken here. As you can see from the slides, we've increased the Al Hosn gas plant capacity by 10%. That was done by very detailed technical reviews both by engineers and operational staff. And then controlled trials were done throughout the process before running the whole plant at capacity. That's an increase in capacity of 10% with virtually no capital at all. If you look at Qatar and you look at the new jacket design there, we basically eliminated the lift barge. We've eliminated going to large fabricators in the region, so we've dramatically dropped drilling costs in Qatar, which opens up all sorts of opportunities there.","In terms of Block 9, as Vicki said, we last month signed the new Block 9 contract with His Excellency the Oil Minister. That's a 15-year contract where we see substantial growth opportunities both in oil and gas and in exploration. We think there are other opportunities in Oman that are a good fit long term for us, so overall very positive. Mukhaizna you can see from the slide, the growth trajectory that's possible with investment there. And we've also been trying to build on the Permian experience of assembly line processes in drilling, rolling out OXY drilling dynamics around the world. We're making significant savings, significant reductions in time to market. So in terms of opportunities, our goal is to try and compete with Jody and also deliver long-term cash flow for the corporation.","In terms of how much capital you would need to keep it going, that's really a capital allocation point for Vicki, I believe. But our goal is to continue to get better for our international and continue to offer alternatives for the corporation.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then on the theme of competing with Jody, on slide 34 you've laid out a Permian growth trajectory at different rig counts. Maybe just a little bit of color on how you've risked the EURs or the well performance behind that because obviously, your first half wells in the Sand Dunes area were better than your \u2013 third quarter was better than the first half, fourth quarter was better than the third quarter. Maybe just give a sense of how much of that improvement have you baked into that production forecast. Thank you.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","It's a good question. I don't think we baked a lot of that improvement in the forward look, so I think there's upside potential. Our type curves represent the production from full-section development. So your first wells may be better than the last well on a section. So our type curves are based on the average, and that forward look is based on the average. So throughout this year, just like we did last year, we expect continued improvement in both cost and well productivity. So I think there's upside to that production plot, both from a pace standpoint, number of wells you drill per rig line, and productivity.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Asit Sen of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you, good morning. I have two questions. One, on slide 14, Permian Resources gas margin looks like greater than $30 per BOE. When compared with EOR, which has a low cash cost, it looks like the cash flow profile of OXY Permian as a whole has improved. So, Chris, could you frame for us at what price given improvement are we cash flow neutral? And interest of cash flow overall, Permian for OXY, what happens at $60 or $70 oil?","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","At $60 or $70 oil, things change fairly significantly based on the numbers we gave you on our sensitivity around oil prices obviously. But keep in mind that what we said was that there's a lot of flexibility in the capital program. As Vicki pointed out, we'll see how things go in terms of commodity prices through the year. Obviously, we'd be more encouraged to maybe spend a little bit more money at the higher end of the range, better prices. So we'll just see how things go.","We gave you all sorts of points in terms of cash flow changes and deltas from the different business segments. So I think I have a high degree of confidence in your modeling ability, so you should probably be able to come to some sense of what's going on. The Permian business as a whole, as I mentioned, generated quite a bit of free cash flow, and Permian EOR is there largely to harvest the free cash flow to redeploy into Permian Resources.","So on cash neutrality, it could be whatever you want it to be. We were under $50 WTI in the fourth quarter. We're spending \u2013 so you're almost there now if you wanted to spend lower amounts of capital to keep production flat. But it's largely dependent on how much you'd like to grow, and we think we have a lot of opportunities, as Jody pointed out, 11,650 places to park the money at good returns. So I think that is the best way to frame it.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And then given the new information, I was just wondering your thoughts on balancing the opportunity to sell some Permian acreage that's not in your core development areas and potentially use the proceeds to accelerate development drilling. And I didn't hear on asset sales the Texas gas assets. Has anything changed there?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","As I said previously, we're continuing to look at our opportunities to monetize things where it makes sense, where we think that would increase the net present value for our shareholders. And while we're not prepared to talk about specific assets today, we'll continue that process. And as we make decisions, certainly we will share that with you. But it's something that we think about and evaluate pretty much on an evergreen basis.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks, a follow-up for Jody please. Jody, average lateral lengths have gone up 20% to 7,100 feet. Could you talk about the ability to drill longer laterals in this development mode? And could you remind us what percent of your Permian acreage, that focus area, is operated versus non-operated?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","So the operated versus non-operated in that core 300,000, you can think 75% to 80% operating position there.","With regard to the longer laterals, that's been a great effort by our business unit and our land organization to continue to core up, so doing swaps, doing trades, picking up pieces of acreage to drive that lateral length longer. So I expect us to continue to do that. The majority of our wells will be longer laterals. That's just an average of the whole inventory. Technically there's not a problem. 10,000 feet early on in horizontal development was a bit of a challenge. 10,000 feet is no longer a challenge. We're looking at even the option of 15,000 feet now.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning, a couple of follow-up questions to what's been asked. First with regards to the Permian, to clarify on the longer laterals, can you talk about what the lateral length is that you expect for the 2017 program as it regards to the 300,000 acres your focused on?","And then with regards to the 350,000 acres where you don't have identified locations, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that you are delineating that. Can you talk more specifically about those plans and whether you see scale-enhancing acquisitions as likely in that part of the Permian?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","So, Brian, the bulk of the development this year will be 7,500-foot or 10,000-foot laterals. If we have to drill a 4,500-foot lateral, it's because we've already developed or started developing a section that way and we really can't change. So most of our wells will be the longer version.","On the 350,000 acres we're delineating, it's really multiple things. We're drilling appraisal wells on our own acreage. We're evaluating 3-D seismic. Again, those two equivalent non-operated rigs really are six to eight actual rigs any day of the year. So we get a lot of information from that non-operated position that helps derisk, plus just watching what other competitors do offset of this acreage.","So with regard to acquisition, it's going to be a function of what we think about that acreage, what the current position is, what trade opportunities there are to core up before you go down the acquisition path.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, thanks. And then going to the point on free cash flow, I just wanted to also get just a clarification between slides 23 and 17. We see on slide 23 the $950 million to $1 billion incremental free cash flow you expect. And I think in your prepared comments you said you expect an incremental $500 million from the Permian, which I think was Resources and CO2. If you could, maybe just verify if that was the case. So is that essentially the incremental free cash flow you expect overall in 2017?","And then more broadly, are you trying to reflect some greater comfort about spending cash flow relative to the dividend assuming the balance sheet doesn't go out of control, or is there still a more specific objective to try to stay within cash flow after dividend?","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","No, we provided the delta to free cash flow that we expect and some of the pieces of the business based on prior investments that we've made that are now completed, so there's to some extent that specifically around Chemicals. The Permian, a lot of that is driven by the production growth and the volume improvements that we've seen at good returns. And part of it obviously in oil and gas is some view around a little bit better price, but not much.","And going forward, I would tell you that not sort of \u2013 we started the year with $2.2 billion of cash, and the capital program remains quite flexible. So we'll see how it goes as far as the spending. But again, the number one priority, as Vicki said, right after maintenance is really to continue to be able to fund and grow the dividend over time based on our ability to grow volumes.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys. Like many companies, you've been finding ways to squeeze out cost from the CapEx budget. But since the original budget last November, of course we've seen an escalation in U.S. service costs, particularly pressure pumping, et cetera. So what is the underlying assumption in your new budget for service cost inflation, whether it's by geography or by segment?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","So we do believe there will be inflation pressure, and you mentioned pumping service. That's probably one of the areas where you'll see it the strongest. But to counter that, we're really working two approaches. One is to continue to get better technically, some innovations that are happening in the drilling space and in the completion s space. We can drill our wells faster and better over time. That will help offset that inflation pressure. But on the commercial side, we're working very closely with a group of suppliers to create the ability for them to have greater margins without just a price increase, more efficiency, better utilization, better logistics management. And so we think the combination of those two things can hold our overall well costs flat or continue to improve it.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And supposing that second half commodity pricing ends up being better than the current strip suggests, would the incremental dollar go back to the buyback program that you formerly had active, or would it go directly into the drill bit again?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We'll have to see how conditions look in the second half of the year. But currently our plan would be not to increase our capital for this year but to go with the plan that we have in place and to look at what our program next year would look like. But it really is going to depend on how we feel about oil prices.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right, I appreciate it.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Degner for closing remarks.","Christopher M. Degner - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, everyone, for participating today.

On the call with us today are: Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Cedric Burgher, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jody Elliott, President of Domestic Oil and Gas; Ken Dillon, President of International Oil and Gas Operations; and B.J. Hebert, President of OxyChem. In just a moment, I will turn the call over to Vicki Hollub.","As a reminder, today's conference call contains certain projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements, as more fully described in our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on slide 2.","Our earnings press release, the Investor Relations supplemental guides and our non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations, and the conference call presentation slides can be downloaded off our website at www.oxy.com.","I'll now turn the call over to Vicki. Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.","During the call, we'll cover three key topics: first, completion of the Breakeven Plan that's ahead of schedule due to business outperformance across all segments; second, the recently announced Midstream transaction; third, the use of excess cash to enhance shareholder returns.","I'm excited to announce the completion of our cash flow neutral and breakeven goals. On slides 6 and 7, we have summarized the achievement of this Breakeven Plan that we initiated in early 2017. During the quarter, we exceeded the 80,000 BOE per day growth target we set for the Permian Resources team in early 2017. All of our business segments contributed to the success of our Breakeven Plan and continued to perform better than expected. This outperformance helped us to achieve the milestones listed on slide 5 well ahead of schedule and helped to generate approximately $2.5 billion more cash flow than our original 2018 plan, which was based on a WTI oil price of $50 per barrel. This achievement strengthens our ability to provide a meaningful dividend with growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet at low prices.","We're extremely proud of the execution of this plan. When others chose to cut or eliminate their dividends or pay scripts, we executed this plan to continue to grow and strengthen our dividend. We can now sustain our dividend and base production with oil prices as low as $40 per barrel. And at $50, we can add meaningful production growth for years to come. We're very happy with what we've achieved, but not satisfied with where we are. We're continually striving to increase shareholder value. And to that end, our intent is to regain a leading position with respect to return on capital employed. I'll provide more details on this later in my remarks.","In addition to the incremental $2.5 billion of cash flow from operations this year, we'll receive proceeds of $2.6 billion from the sale of non-core domestic midstream assets in the third quarter. Slide 8 highlights the assets that will be sold in the gray box in the upper right-hand corner of the slide. The sale of these non-core domestic midstream assets fits with our Midstream and marketing strategy for three reasons.","First, our marketing business remains unchanged, which ensures our primary objective of long-term flow assurance and maximum realized prices. This includes retaining our oil and gas takeaway capacity along with export capacity for our barrels through the Ingleside export terminal to world markets. Second, we preserved our organizational capability to build and invest in strategic midstream projects as needed to achieve our marketing objectives. Finally, we retained midstream assets that are strategically integrated into our Oil & Gas and Chemicals businesses. An example of this is our Permian EOR infrastructure, which is highly integral to the daily operations and success of our enhanced oil recovery projects. This transaction preserves all of these objectives while bringing in significant proceeds at a premium valuation.","The combination of the incremental $2.5 billion in cash flow from operations and the $2.6 billion in proceeds from the midstream sales will be deployed to drive the highest shareholder returns. Approximately 80% of this incremental cash will be allocated to share repurchases and strengthening our balance sheet.","Additionally, we'll capitalize on our unique market-leading position in Permian Resources by investing an additional $900 million in 2018 into projects that generate full-cycle returns in excess of 75%. This will require only a modest increase in activity from our original plan, which contemplated a ramp down in activity during the second half of the year based on an oil price assumption of $50 WTI that we used for the plan. Another $200 million will be invested in our highest-returning organic development projects in our international and Permian EOR businesses.","Our competitive position is truly unique in the industry, and we recognize this is a differentiated approach, so we'll spend a large portion of the call sharing the strategic rationale for our decisions.","Slides 9 through 13 provide the criteria we used for the reinvestment of the incremental $5 billion. We have for a long time believed that the measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term through return on capital employed leadership. Our market leadership will provide high revenues at lower cost and faster capital cycle times which will deliver stronger returns on capital, helping us to achieve our ultimate benchmark.","As slide 9 shows, our decision to reinvest incremental capital back into the business will improve our cash return on capital employed by 10% in 2019 compared to our previous plan.","We believe this improvement will be best in class and will generate amongst the highest returns in our peer group.","On the right hand of slide 10, we list what we mean by market-leading in the Permian. There are some significant bottlenecks and barriers to growing production economically in the Permian right now, and OXY has unique assets and solutions that enable us to overcome the most significant ones. We know of no other E&P in the Permian that can check all of these boxes or is better positioned to deploy capital, and our cycle of improvement is happening faster now than ever before. We have a window of opportunity to further improve our operational execution, strengthen our cash flow, and increase our returns. While others are playing defense, we'll be playing offense by investing a portion of the additional cash back into our business to accelerate returns.","Turning to slide 11, spending within cash flow over time is imperative for our dividend growth model. As I remarked in my opening statements, OXY is generating far greater cash flow than we anticipated this year. As the graph depicts, we more than cover our dividend and new capital guidance, leaving significant excess cash to repurchase shares and strengthen the balance sheet. We are targeting more than $2 billion of share repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months.","On the next slide, I'd like to discuss the flexibility of our capital program, which is now dominated by short-cycle investments. Within six months, we can ramp down spending to our sustaining capital level if the environment requires. Similarly, our payback times for projects have improved considerably. At $50 WTI, the majority of our capital pays back within two years. This means that we are less exposed to changes in commodity prices and not exposed to long-term spending commitments.","On my last slide, I would like to address what our plans mean for the dividend. Over the last 16 years, we've raised the dividend every year at an average annual rate of 12%, which is at a rate of 60% greater than the S&P 500 over the same time period. We are constantly optimizing the balance between growth and capital management to ensure the highest returns for our shareholders. As the graph shows, we are above historical levels of payouts for our dividend. The Breakeven Plan improved our payout ratio substantially, and our relentless focus on returns will continue to drive this lower, allowing for meaningful dividend growth in the future.","I'll now hand the call over to Cedric to review our financial results and guidance details.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Vicki. I'll begin with commentary on the Midstream transaction and follow with our financial results and update to our 2018 guidance.","Referring back to slide 8, we are divesting a package of domestic midstream assets for $2.6 billion that were not integral to our operations, which include the Centurion oil gathering system and long-haul pipeline, our southeast New Mexico oil gathering system, and the Ingleside export terminal. OXY is retaining its long-term flow assurance, its pipeline takeaway, and most of its export capacity through its retained marketing business.","After the Ingleside export terminal expansion, we have secured the rights to market 450,000 barrels of oil per day through 2030, with options to extend for an additional seven years. The divested assets generated $180 million in EBITDA and required capital of $140 million during 2017. Our guidance for 2018 has been updated to reflect the transaction close at the end of the third quarter.","As Vicki highlighted, we now expect to have an additional $5 billion of cash this year to allocate to increasing shareholder returns. We will deploy approximately 20% of the $5 billion in 2018 into our highest-returning organic opportunities, which will contribute an additional 17,000 barrels equivalent per day to Permian Resources in 2019. Approximately 80% of the $5 billion will go to opportunistic share repurchases and to strengthen the balance sheet. The share repurchase target has been set at more than $2 billion over the next 12 to 18 months.","On slide 15, I'd like to start with our production results. Total reported production for the second quarter was 639,000 BOEs per day, coming in above the midpoint of our guidance. Adjusted for PSC impact, we would have come in at the top end of the production range we guided last quarter. This was driven by strong execution and well productivity in Permian Resources, which exceeded the top end of the guidance range by 3,000 BOEs per day, representing a year-over-year increase of 46%.","Total international production came in at 281,000 BOEs per day, with Al Hosn, Dolphin, and Qatar all within our guidance. The increase in international production from the first quarter reflected the completed turnarounds at Al Hosn and Dolphin, partially offset by a decrease in production in Qatar due to its planned turnaround that was successfully completed.","Earnings improved across all segments, with our second quarter reported and core EPS at $1.10 per diluted share. Results were adversely impacted by approximately $90 million or $0.12 per diluted share due to the timing of crude oil liftings in Oman and the non-cash mark-to-market impact on crude oil volumes. A typhoon in Oman delayed the lifting ships from June into July, and our growing crude oil export business is increasing our barrels in transit, and therefore our mark-to-market exposure has increased.","The improvements in the Oil & Gas segment were mainly attributable to higher Permian Resources production and higher oil prices in our international operations, partially offset by lower international sales volumes due to the timing of the crude oil liftings in Oman. Second quarter realized oil prices increased by 3% from the prior quarter, and our DD&A rate for the second quarter was 9% lower than the average rate for 2017.","Operating cash flow before working capital improved sequentially to nearly $2 billion. We spent $1.3 billion in capital during the quarter. Working capital changes for the second quarter mainly reflect the increase in crude oil inventories due to the timing of the international liftings and domestic export cargoes in transit.","Chemicals core earnings of $317 million came in above our guidance of $300 million, primarily due to favorable product pricing across most product lines. Plant margins were also favorable, as ethylene costs were significantly lower than anticipated.","Midstream core earnings of $250 million came in within guidance and reflected improved marketing margins due to an increase in the Midland-to-MEH differential from $3.12 to $7.86 quarter over quarter. Results included the aforementioned non-cash mark-to-market pre-tax loss of $67 million, which is due to rising oil prices and an increase in domestic export cargoes in transit.","We declared an increase to the dividend in July and paid close to $600 million in dividends during the quarter. Total shareholder distributions approximated $700 million when considering the $73 million worth of share repurchases we made during the quarter.","Slides 16 and 17 detail our updated guidance. We raised our total year production guidance from 650,000 to 664,000 BOEs per day. Excluding the impact of higher Brent price assumptions on PSCs, total year production guidance would be 655,000 to 669,000 BOEs per day.","We increased Permian Resources production range by more than 3% to 207,000 to 215,000 BOEs per day, mainly attributable to the improved well productivity and an increase in well count. The midpoint of this range equates to an exit-to-exit Permian Resources production growth rate of 54%. Our international production range of 285,000 to 290,000 BOEs per day was adjusted lower for the PSC impacts of higher Brent prices, assumed at $75 per barrel for the remainder of the year, partially offset by improved production.","We have increased our total year capital to $5 billion, with the majority of the increase allocated to Permian Resources. This is for high-return short-cycle projects that Jody will go into more detail in a minute.","In Midstream, we expect the third quarter to generate pre-tax income between $600 million and $700 million, assuming a Midland-to-MEH spread of $15 to $17. On a full year, we expect pre-tax income to range between $1.650 billion and $1.850 billion based on a Midland-to-MEH spread range of $10.25 to $11.25.","In Chemicals, we anticipate third quarter pre-tax earnings of $315 million, and total year guidance remains at $1.1 billion.","Domestic operating expense per BOE of $12.80 was 4% lower than the prior quarter. Cash operating cost for the domestic Oil & Gas business are expected to continue to decline and average approximately $12.50 for 2018.","We continue to forecast lower operating costs in Permian Resources for the second half of 2018, which are expected to average under $7 per BOE. We have updated our guidance for total company tax rate to 29% in 2018, which reflects higher earnings from our domestic businesses.","On my last slide, we have provided you with key cash flow sensitivities. Our cash flow sensitivity to the Midland-to-MEH spread has not changed in the marketing business as we are retaining all of the previously secured Permian takeaway capacity.","To close, we are very pleased with our performance so far this year, including the completion of our Breakeven Plan ahead of schedule. We have a tremendous opportunity in front of us, and we are working hard with a relentless focus on returns.","I will now turn the call over to Jody.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Cedric, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll provide an update on the industry-leading returns our Permian Resources assets are generating and details on how we will continue to invest in these projects to provide our shareholders with value-based growth. I'll start on slide 20 to highlight some of our achievements year to date.","First, we achieved 213,000 BOE per day production in June which was above the 209,000 BOE per day breakeven target we set at the beginning of the year. We achieved the 80,000 BOE per day growth target six months earlier than planned through our step change in well productivity and steadfast execution. We continue to deliver record wells in our Greater Sand Dunes area and achieved an OXY record for the Texas Delaware, with the Lyda 13H delivering a peak 24-hour rate of almost 5,700 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of over 3,700 BOE per day.","Our high-quality Permian Resources assets combined with our subsurface expertise are generating high double-digit full-cycle returns in many of the best wells in the Permian Basin. Our appraisal program is also delivering great results and continues to provide low breakeven inventory replenishment for sustainable high-return growth. Year to date, we've added 218 gross locations to our less than $50 WTI breakeven inventory and created additional value by increasing working interest and average lateral length through acreage trades.","Our Permian Resources business is generating high full-cycle returns as we develop our assets in the most prolific areas of the Permian Basin. Our margins are protected through Aventine, our maintenance and logistics hub, and our Midstream business is ensuring we get maximum product realizations. We believe our Resources business is positioned to provide some of the highest-return growth in the industry.","We're also generating excellent returns in our Permian EOR assets. We continued our progress at the Seminole-San Andres unit by lowering OpEx an additional $2 per BOE, for a total reduction of $7 per BOE since the acquisition. This $7 improvement is expected to generate over $400 million in NPV, which is two-thirds of the acquisition cost.","In June we announced a feasibility study for a carbon capture, utilization, and storage project with White Energy. The project will capture carbon dioxide at White Energy's ethanol facilities in Hereford and Plainview, Texas and transport it to the Permian Basin for use and sequestration in our Permian EOR business. Our Permian EOR business provides us with a unique carbon emissions reduction opportunity that will also generate returns for our business. We look forward to advancing these important projects, and we'll update you as we move forward.","On slide 21, we show the well performance results of our extended lateral program in our two core development areas and how both areas are outperforming other operators. In the second quarter, we continued our basin-leading results in the Greater Sand Dunes, with 32 Second Bone Spring wells online averaging 2,500 BOE per day over 30 days. Our wells in this area are generating industry-leading and are outperforming the average operator by 24% on a six-month cumulative production basis. Our Greater Sand Dunes area continues to generate great well results with multiple stack benches and will be a corner stone of our development for many years to come.","In our Barilla Draw area, we're seeing similar improvements in 2018 and recently implemented a new well design that is delivering record results and lowering costs. Our 2017 Barilla Draw wells are outperforming the average operator by 26%, and our more recent wells are trending even better. We expect this gap to grow as we progress our subsurface characterization to optimize landing and continue to customize our well designs to ensure we are maximizing the net present value of each section developed.","On slide 22, I'll provide details on how we're deploying additional capital into our high-return development areas. We began 2018 with an 11 operated rig plan that would achieve three primary goals: provide the additional high-margin growth required to complete the Breakeven Plan; maintain flexibility to ramp down to a $50 activity level after the Breakeven Plan was achieved; and continue to improve results and appraise new areas for future development.","We have now achieved the Breakeven Plan milestone. But as we evaluated the plan ramp down in activity, we realized high-return projects in the second half of the year and into 2019 would be eliminated. We continue to improve in all of our major areas as we progress our subsurface knowledge and apply innovative technologies to our development programs. We've also protected our full-cycle margins through our advantaged midstream position that is providing high product realizations at 98% of WTI, and our logistics hub that is protecting our program from market inflation.","Our development program is delivering many of the best wells in the Permian Basin, and we expect full-cycle returns in excess of 75% at current strip prices. Our appraisal program delivered great results in Turkey Track and Red Tank in New Mexico and in the Hoban bench in Greater Barilla Draw. We expect these appraisal areas to deliver returns similar to our current development area.","Given higher commodity prices than in our original plan, the basin-leading results from our development and appraisal programs, and our advantaged Midstream and logistics position, we have decided to accelerate NPV by deploying additional capital into these high-return projects. A portion of the increased capital is allocated to cover acceleration of time-to-market on the original plan and additional working interest we gain through acreage trades in our core development areas. These are both high-value opportunities that enhance our development program.","We've also allocated additional capital to maintain an activity level similar to our current development pace. Instead of ramping down to a $50 rig activity level in the second half of the year, we now expect to operate an average of just over 12 rigs in 2018 and exit the year at 13 operated rigs. We'll also deploy additional value-added appraisal capital to progress emerging plays and technology and additional facilities capital to support production in 2019 and beyond.","Our outside operated program is also delivering great results and strategic insights into the areas across the basin. As we reviewed and evaluated ballots this year, we had more high-value opportunities than we expected, as WTI prices remained strong and supported higher activity levels from many operators. The additional $200 million in outside operated will support another one to two net operated rigs for the year, where we will receive high returns and science appraisal data on the emerging plays across the basin.","On slide 23, we've updated our Permian Resources production guidance and increased the midpoint for total year by 7,000 BOE per day. Starting with the second quarter, we beat the high range of the guidance by 3,000 BOE per day due to continued improvement from our wedge wells and strong results from our base optimization projects. We're increasing our guidance for third quarter and fourth quarter to account for the better results in the first half of the year, operating efficiencies reducing time to market, and additional activity we've added to our capital program. The 2018 production increase from the additional activity provides a modest increase to this year's production, but we expect it will add over 17,000 BOE per day in 2019.","As I close, I'd like to recognize our employees for their dedication making OXY the best operator in the Permian Basin. For decades we've demonstrated our ability to maximize recovery of mature fields at low cost in our EOR business, and now we're a leading operator of Permian unconventional assets. The capability and energy of our employees has never been better, and I want to thank them for their hard work.","I'll now turn the call back over to Vicki.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Jody.","As you can see, our business performance has put us in a remarkable position. We provide an industry-leading shareholder distribution yield through our dividend and buyback programs while delivering valuable long-term growth from incremental investment in high-return organic projects. We're committed to delivering this value proposition to our shareholders within cash flow. We've built a leading position in the Permian with the best wells, technology, excess takeaway capacity, export capabilities, and supply and services security. This combined with the outperformance of our other businesses is why we're so confident that our actions will enable us to extend our industry leadership and shareholder returns.","We'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Vicki, the market seems to be taking a fairly dim view of the increase in spending this morning, so I wanted to ask you. What's behind your decision to step up the pace? And I really want to think about it in the context of your peer group of similar size in terms of the Resource business because it would seem to us at least the pace of spending has been substantially lagging peers. It looks like you're catching up, but I'm just curious how you feel about the right investment pace and whether you would agree with that assessment.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Doug, for the question. The reality is and the way we do our business is we try to pace our developments so that we maximize net present value and return on capital employed. So as you guys have seen, we've had developments going on in certain areas. And for each development area, we build to ensure that we can maximize the value over the long term, which means that we don't build infrastructure for peak production. We build it for the life of the development area.","We wanted to get to our Breakeven Plan to get to that milestone as quickly as we could. That was a key milestone for us, so we accelerated our pace to a level that we felt was the maximum before we started to destroy value. So the pace that we've been on up to this point was a pace that was driven by our commitment to return on capital employed. That's why we haven't gone faster getting to this Breakeven Plan.","Now, however, we have some additional development areas which is driving the pace that we're going to increase to in the second half of this year. So rather than ramp down, we'll increase to ensure that we can cover these new development areas that Jody is going to talk about probably in a little more detail later.","So the pace for us is always driven by ensuring we never get out in front of our technology, that we never go at too fast a pace, we never overbuild infrastructure, and that has always dictated our pace. And so we feel like that with lower capital than some of our peers, we've actually delivered more. And we've not only delivered more in terms of production in some cases, but also in terms of value, and we're going to continue to stay focused on value. Going forward, our additional development areas as they come into play, that could increase our capital as we go forward, but it's always going to be at a pace that maximizes returns.","And you're right, not only about our Permian peers, but if you look at the companies that are operating that maybe don't even have Permian production, that have development in our areas, our total capital now, not only is our capital in the Permian Resources now more similar to our peers, but our capital overall is similar to our proxy peers that are of close size to us. So we think that we started the year a little bit under capital, but at the pace that we felt would maximize our returns.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's what I was getting at, thank you for that. I guess my follow-up then is really the impact on the philosophy of the business going forward because the growth in Permian has obviously been key to getting you back to breakeven, so has by definition been generating free cash flow. Do you expect the business at the new pace, the Permian Resources business specifically, to also continue to generate free cash flow under your updated commodity deck I guess? And if so, can you give us some idea how you see the exit-to-exit as you go into 2019? So exit 2018 going into exit 2019, what would you expect that growth pace to look like? And I'll leave it there, thanks.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We expect growth that would be similar to the activity level that you'll see in Permian Resources in the second half of this year, so the growth levels should be for our Permian Resources business probably in the high 30s.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's year-over-year or exit-to-exit?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","That's year-over-year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And still free cash flow positive or no?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We should be free cash flow positive. I think it would be around 54% exit-to-exit.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's helpful, thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Sankey with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi, everyone. On the CapEx increase again, the magnitude is what surprised us. It really is a large number. Can you talk a little bit about how come we were not forewarned that you could make a move as big as this? Thanks.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","One thing we were doing is watching commodity prices, watching the volatility around the world, and staying and getting pretty comfortable with the incremental development areas that we're going to expand into. So a lot of it is around ensuring that as we go into the second half that we'll still be able to see returns that are at least where we were and maybe in excess now, because we've done a lot of really good work. We feel comfortable with what we're doing.","We've always talked about and tried to share with people that the plan we put together was based on a $50 plan. We actually start our planning process usually midyear, and then by December, we're ready to present it to the board. And as we were doing that last year, we were seeing $50, and it wasn't really until toward December or January that prices started to go up a bit.","And so starting at that pace, we were, as I mentioned earlier, a bit under capital versus our peers. And then accelerating and getting to the Breakeven Plan early was driven by the efficiency improvements that we saw. So it was a combination of seeing the efficiency improvements, getting comfortable that we were going to be in a better than $60 environment for the full year, and gaining some confidence that 2019 is also going to be in a similar environment, because the reason for the ramp down, as we said, was to ensure that we always spend within cash flow. And so thinking that, when we prepared the plan at $50 that we didn't know what 2019 would look like, so we didn't want to go into 2019 at a higher pace and risk outspending cash flow because that is our commitment beyond the achievement of the Breakeven Plan.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. And then I guess the other thing that was different about 2018 versus initial expectations was the basin differentials. And I assume a large part of what you're doing here is to fill your own capacity, presumably to the detriment of your competitors. Is that the correct way of thinking about what you're planning to do?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","That was not a driver for us. The driver really is to develop \u2013 to do the upstream development that delivers better than 75%. So first we plan based on what the development itself will deliver. Secondarily, we look at what's happening with the takeaway capacity. So we have, as you know, so much that we weren't really trying to fill it to move others out.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. And the final one, thank you, for me, would be in terms of you said you want to keep your CapEx and dividend covered by your cash flow. Can you just remind us what your aspiration is for cash return to shareholders because I think the other side here is that you could have done an awful lot more buyback? If you could, just talk about that balance. And I'll leave it there, thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","The reason that we want to buy back shares is we want to reduce our share count. We want to have the capability and capacity over time to grow our dividend in a more meaningful way, while at the same time we have to be conscious of the fact that investment in our Permian Resources business, our organic growth delivers better returns than the buybacks. So the buybacks really are specifically to help us with our dividend growth over time.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Thank you.","Jeff Alvarez - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","As you've highlighted, the Delaware Basin well performance has been very strong over the last year. With the accelerated CapEx, you're now on the hook to deliver more growth. As you move into development mode, do you expect the level of well productivity we've seen the last couple of quarters to be sustained or improved, or do you see the impact of tighter spacing moderating those productivity gains? What do you see as the risk to the upside or the downside?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Hey, Brian. This is Jody. We see continued improvement in well performance. We continue to do more and more integration of seismic activity into our targeting and our well designs. We've got a new well design in the Texas Delaware area that's allowing us to both drill faster and complete in a more optimum way. So we expect the wells to continue to get better.","With regard to spacing, we're probably more conservative than most in our spacing assumptions because we're so focused on returns and the net present value of each of these sections that we develop. And so we do a lot of modeling. We've done a lot of testing on spacing. So this isn't about downsizing and having parent\/child interference issues. We take that into account and design for that as we go in. So hopefully, that answers your question, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","It does, thanks. And then just going back a little bit to the capital allocation and then thinking even more strategically, two follow-ups. The first is you talked about your flexibility to pull back on CapEx in the event of unfavorable commodity prices. What, if anything, would you need to see to pull back to allocate more towards share repurchase? And then from a use of excess capital perspective, given that you're increasing activity in the Permian, does the potential increase to your decline rate increase your interest in low decline rate M&A or new projects on the EOR side?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Over time, we do want to pick up more conventional activity and projects. We actually have some of the incremental in our capital allocation is going to the Central Basin platform in EOR to drill horizontal wells and conventional reservoirs. So we'll do some things to work on mitigating the decline of the Permian Resources business. Some of our work in international, which I'll let Ken describe here in a minute, is also going to address that same thing. So we'll let Ken address that, and then we'll come back to the share buyback issue.","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","As I mentioned in a previous call, one of the projects we're working on is the Teca steam flood in Colombia. So far, the pilot appraisal is performing above expectations, and it's a classical OXY international project implementing EOR techniques to an existing field discovered in 1963. We expect the green light before year end and expect to reach 30,000 barrels a day gross in Phase 1. Initial response shows wells going from 6 barrels a day to 58 barrels a day with the impact of the steam flood.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Brian, this is Cedric. I'm going to chime in for a second on the buyback. We're excited to be re-engaging in a more meaningful way with respect to the buyback. As you know, we have a long history of doing that, took a hiatus during the downturn, but we're excited to be in a position to do that. We've put out there $2 billion-plus as a target over the next 12 to 18 months.","As we've said before, we like an opportunistic approach, so we're looking at value and we're looking at returns. We've got good models that we think, certainly not perfect stock pickers, but we like the idea of choosing the timing of when we invest in our stock. We think we have a good track record there, and we look forward to deploying some capital there. And as you know, the numbers we've given you don't add up to the $5 billion. We've got a lot that we're able to put on the balance sheet.","We do want to keep a strong balance sheet. However, that also gives us more flexibility to go beyond the $2 billion over time should we choose, but we're going to pace ourselves. Maybe days like today are going to give us a good opportunity to be in the market buying our shares, and we look forward to doing that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Please go ahead","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. So first question is just a bit of a follow-up. Vicki, you talked about the Permian Resources growth rate for 2019. As we think about this step-function change and the spending to the $5 billion level not just this year but also next year, maybe you could just refresh us on how you think that will drive the overall company growth not just in 2019 but also beyond.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","In 2019, we expect to exceed the growth rate we're seeing this year with a strong program. That's assuming that commodity prices stay where they are today. The slide that we have in the deck is not telling you that that's exactly what we'll do in 2019. But if we see the same market situation and all other things are similar, then we could spend in a $60 environment between $5 billion and $5.3 billion. We expect that would deliver a better growth rate than what we're seeing this year overall for the corporation.","I think we're going to see healthy growth beyond that as well because of what we see in the Permian Basin. Having the inventory that we do, we've recently signaled that we do expect to be able to grow better than the 8% on average on an annual basis. So you could start to model out what you'll see next year from that sort of program, and going forward would be better than 8%.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. Second question is for Cedric. With this asset sale, if you could, just refresh us on the use of the NOLs and the impact it will have on you being a U.S. cash taxpayer. I think you're not expecting to for a couple of years. And if you could, just comment on whether you see additional assets that you would consider monetizing at this point. Or should we think that this is the majority of what you're looking to monetize?","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Okay, sure. On the tax, we do expect to gain. We'll have more on that. Of course, it's expected to close in the third quarter and we've got some things to finalize there to get a precise amount. But if you look at our 10-Q, you can see assets held for sale, it's predominantly the Midstream assets. It's not exact, but it's close if you're just trying to get ballpark. But we're going to have \u2013 we have continued NOLs or tax attributes we can use to offset the gain, and we won't be in a cash tax position for some time, as you correctly stated.","Our effective rate also, we've outlined that in my earlier remarks, but expect it to be in the back half of the year in the high 20s. And over time, we would expect to use up those tax attributes and then go to a cash tax position, but it still looks like it's going to be several years out. It obviously depends on commodity prices and a lot of other variables.","In terms of other assets for sale, we're always looking to refine our portfolio, but we don't have any new news for you. We've given you the news of the day. And I'd say at this point, we have a really good core business on all the verticals that you can look at. And we're reinvesting in that and think we can grow within the business that we have.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, I guess my last question would just be on the buyback commitment. If we move to a lower price environment, and I know you've talked about the flexibility on capital spending to pull back. But if we move to a lower price environment, is there a strong commitment that either way we should expect the $2 billion of buybacks over the next 12 to 18 months? I know it's opportunistic, but it's also the flywheel. I'm just looking at slide 27, and it feels like it's the flywheel, so just any color on that. Thanks.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","So obviously a lower price environment is, especially if that means lower share price environment, I certainly like the idea of investing our capital then. That's really what we're thinking about. If it's a lower commodity price environment, obviously those two tend to track together somewhat. But on a lower commodity price, we have, as Vicki mentioned, the ability to ramp down, and our plan works at $40. We think that is the answer for the industry. You need to be a low-cost producer, and I think very few can make those statements. But at $40-plus, we can ramp down within a six-month plus or minus time period and be within cash flow.","So really, now that we've achieved that Breakeven Plan, we're in a position to balance our spending within cash flow pretty much at any commodity price. And then so the excess cash we're seeing for this year is really what we're targeting for reinvestment in shares, that $2 billion or so. That's cash that's not in the bank today but it's darn close. Beyond that, talking about a lower price environment, we've got that flexibility to make those share repurchases in a lower price environment.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question. We've talked a lot about the buyback on this call. Let me ask about the dividend. One of the charts on the slides highlights the long-term 12% dividend growth. But obviously of late, it's been nowhere near that, only low single digits in recent years. Is that because implicitly you're saying the yield is high enough on the stock as it is, or what's the reason for the very slow upticks?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","What we're trying to do is drive toward increasing our cash flow so we can increase our dividend. Currently, the payout ratio is still at a higher level than what we've seen historically. So part of the reason for ensuring that we increase our cash flow, increase our return on capital employed, is to continue to build on our value proposition and make sure that we strengthen all aspects of that. As I said earlier, getting to the breakeven milestone \u2013 breakeven and neutral milestones really were to get us to a point where we can do exactly what we're doing now, further strengthen not only the balance sheet but our cash flow, our returns. And through doing that, we think that we could then start to grow the dividend again.","We don't want to get to a payout ratio that gets us away from being able to be cash flow neutral at $40 and breakeven at $50. So that's really the parameters that are driving what we do with it. So buying back shares, increasing cash flow gives us the ability to start growing it more than we've done over the last few years.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, one more about the Permian. You've talked about having or maintaining the liquids midstream access that you will need. What about natural gas? We hear more and more about the risk of flaring having to run up against the regulatory limits in the Permian. Is that an issue on any portion of your acreage today, gas bottlenecks?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","No, we don't feel like it's an issue. We currently are getting all of our gas out. We occasionally have short-term bottlenecks, as the industry has faced in the Permian. The way we've addressed that in the past, though, is with the enterprise 50:50 joint venture plant construction that we had a few years ago. When we see that there are going to be long-term issues for us, what we'll do is we have the capability \u2013 retained the capability to build infrastructure or to partner with others to ensure that the infrastructure is installed to be able to manage all of our products, so not just oil but gas and NGLs as well.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right, I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about your firm transportation, which obviously extends pretty far into the future. We're in a period now where differentials are blowing out a bit. So I guess the question is twofold. Would you have any interest in potentially terming that out, the firm transportation out with another party, maybe at a level that is lower than differentials today but that would extend for a multiyear period to turn it into an annuity? And then I suppose are you being approached by other parties for that type of arrangement?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We've done a little bit of that. And what we try to do is balance a little bit of long-term to ensure that we can manage the downside risk. But we also feel that over the long term, we want to keep some of that flexible so that we can take advantage of periods like this where the differentials are high. We think we're going to continue to see cycles where both situations will exist, where we'll reap strong benefits as we're doing now, but there will also be times when we see the other side of that. So we have put together some contracts during this period that will protect us on the downside but without value destruction.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay, great, and then if I could ask a second one please. You've highlighted two new areas within the Permian that you've been delineating. I was hoping you could just provide a little more detail on the Barilla Draw Hoban bench and also on New Mexico Red Tank just in terms of prospectivity, potential drilling locations, et cetera.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Jason, this is Jody. Both of those areas we're seeing really positive results. The Hoban is associated with the Wolfcamp A. We've done a lot of delineation work, seismic work to understand is that one big thick area that we can prosecute with a single well in a large frac, or do we need to put two wells and two different flow units and then optimize the frac to that. So what we're seeing, very good results, and I think it will add inventory in that area.","In New Mexico, I think there's even a stronger story in the Red Tank\/Lost Tank area. That's proximal to a few wells that here recently in the Permian are probably the largest that have been drilled. We see multiple benches. We've had some appraisal wells drilled there. We're very encouraged both in the Sand Dunes proper area. And in Red Tank\/Lost Tank, we see continued improvement in Tier 1, both the quality of the existing wells that are in the inventory and adding more inventory. So we're very excited about that.","In that capital spend increase that we talked about, about $400 million this year of the $900 million is going toward that kind of activity. That activity is the portion that will generate most of the production increase starting in \u2013 showing up in 2019 of approximately 17,000 barrels a day.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","That's great. Thanks, Jody.","Operator","The next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, thanks. Maybe to follow up on Pavel's question about ultimate dividend growth, do you have, Vicki, an idea, or Cedric, of maybe where production needs to be to support dividend growth? And let's just say assuming recent or current oil prices as the paradigm there.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I'll start out and let Cedric finish it. But it really goes back to basing it around being cash flow breakeven at $50 and cash flow neutral at $40. As we continue to grow our cash flow through increased production, we will be able to start to lower those breakeven and neutral points. As we start to lower those and buy back shares, that gives us the capacity to continue to grow the dividend. We've looked at that, and that's part of the reason for what we're doing today and where we're trying to head, but it's going to be dictated by that and can be modeled.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","The other thing I'd mention on that, Roger, is on slide 13, which we've talked about, we put on there the dividend payout ratio in those little boxes above the bars, and it just shows a couple of things. One is we aren't where we were historically, well below 20%. And so, however, it also shows how much progress we've made in just the last year or so, so it's doing everything that we've talked about. It's focusing on returns. That trumps everything. But by doing that, you're allowing yourself to grow and grow your coverage ratio, improve your payout ratio.","And so we don't have an exact number. We're not going to put ourselves in a box that way. We'd love to degree the dividend. We do grow it; we grow it every year. It's just at a modest rate in the last few years. We look forward to growing it more meaningfully, as we've done in the past. But the buybacks will help on that as will reinvesting at high returns. And the combination over time will get that payout ratio more like it has been in the past, and that will set us up for more meaningful dividend growth.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then, Jody, if I could change direction to you, you mentioned as part of the CapEx increase some of the efficiencies that you've recognized this year. Can you give us an idea of maybe some of the things specifically you've seen in the way of efficiencies and how those are carrying along? I'm thinking not just on the drilling side, but well completions and maybe the impacts of Aventine at this point.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Aventine is a big part of this. We went live with Aventine earlier in the year. We have probably about 50% penetration of the sand and the sand delivery systems in our business, so there's still more opportunity to improve the other frac cores that are operating. Schlumberger finishes their facility end of September or early October, so we'll begin taking full advantage of that relationship on multiple product lines. On the drilling side, there's slide 36 in the back that talks about our feet-per-day improvements from 2017 to 2018.","So just a couple of facts on Aventine, we've moved 230,000 tons of sand through there since we've started, but it's also helped us with ensuring we've got supply, so it's both cost and supply. The sand delivery system, Sandstorm that we talk about, has really had a big impact on trucking. The sand system hauls more sand per truck. We've avoided 450,000 miles already of trucking. So you think about the tightness in labor, that really helps in that area. The amount of time it takes to unload sand when your location has been reduced by 50%, and again, we still have more cores that will take advantage of this system as we finish out the year.","So we're real excited about how not just Aventine but the work our drilling and completion engineers are doing to optimize wells, and the process will continue to drive efficiency. And any inflation or tariff impacts, those kinds of things get offset with this efficiency improvement.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Nothing quite like tariffs, maybe a very specific question on the productivity. There was another company that doesn't operate in the Permian but mentioned on their call earlier that the amount of stages they were getting done on a daily basis were running ahead of their budget. And I was just curious in the Permian relative to budget on stage completions per day or per well if you were seeing an improvement in productivity there.","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think we highlighted one of the cores in New Mexico pumped 240 stages in a month, so we are seeing that improvement. Again, when you look back at the capital increase we're talking about, if you go through slide 22, some of that additional spending is exactly what you're talking about. We've improved time-to-market. We're getting more done with the same resources. That just brings capital forward. So we are seeing that kind of impact. And if you spend some time on that slide, you'll see that there are positive things that are driving the increased capital, more working interest, better time-to-market. And so it's really a cash return on capital employed accretive activity by spending this additional capital in Permian Resources.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I appreciate that. I was just going to try to get you to draw it out between budget and actual, but we've got to try what we've got to try.","Operator","The next question comes from Leo Mariani with NatAlliance Securities. Please go ahead.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Hey, guys. I was hoping you could add a little bit of color around the new well design. You guys mentioned in the Texas Delaware. I was just trying to get a sense of some of the moving pieces here. Does this add a little bit of cost, but maybe just give you a much better result in terms of productivity? What can you tell us about that?","Joseph C. Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Leo, the simple answer is it's a tapered well design. But I won't go into a whole lot of specifics there, but it allows us to drill faster, run pipe faster, complete the well faster, have larger flowback in artificial lift equipment, which improves drawdown over the life of the well, but it's framed around a tapered production string design.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just back to the Midstream divestiture here, I'm just trying to get a sense of what you guys saw out there on the market. Did you guys view this as an opportunistic time to go out and sell these assets here? Did you just feel like it was the right time where it was a seller's market where folks were looking for export infrastructure and Permian infrastructure? I'm just trying to get a sense of the dynamics of the deal.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","The Centurion pipeline and the Ingleside export terminal, Southeast New Mexico gathering system, we've never considered those necessarily to be core to our business. We just need the capacity on those. Similar to what we did with BridgeTex a few years ago, we partnered with Magellan to build the BridgeTex line. Prior to that, differentials were going up to $10. We did that to ensure that we could manage the differentials back down. We didn't need to own the line to get the benefit of it, but we had to help build it to make sure it happened. We've done that in some of our international locations as well to build pipelines to ensure we could get our products to market.","We've really never felt that we had to own Centurion or the export terminal. We happened into an opportunity where it was a win-win for us and the buyers. The buyers get quality assets that deliver solid returns. We get cash flow that we can now use to get even better returns for our upstream business and to buy back some shares. So it was opportunistic in that there was a buyer that had a need and got that, and we had the opportunity to do something that can help us to achieve our goals on both ends, organic growth and buybacks.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay, so it sounds like just the bottom line is that getting the 75% full-cycle returns of the wells is just a far better use of capital. Is that just the simple way to think about it?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","It is. Those returns are \u2013 they're certainly the best in our business. We do have some international projects that compete with that as well, and that's why we're doing some of those. But the returns we're getting in the Permian, especially with the way the teams have increased efficiencies and increased well productivity, this is just an opportunity to get and to rebuild our return on capital employed back to the point where we're a leader in that.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay, thanks.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vicki Hollub for any closing remarks.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I just wanted to build on the last question because of the fact that I think it's critically important for people to know where we've been, the path we've been on, and why we're doing what we do, that this all ties together. I won't repeat our story again about our portfolio optimization. But back in 2013, we had a really good history of delivering return on capital employed. From 2008 to 2013, we averaged close to 15%. That was the third best in our proxy peer group and the only two that beat us were major oil companies. There were no E&P companies that were beating the returns we were getting.","We saw that we had some projects in our portfolio that could never meet our metrics, so we made the decision that, since it was a part of our value proposition, very important to us, the key metric that we use, we started the process of optimizing that portfolio, exiting those, and focusing on the Permian Resources business, which we had begun to realize was of a huge scale, high-quality, high-return projects.","So we exited 40% of our production from 2013 to 2015. And to rebuild that cash flow that we lost from those lower-margin lower-return projects, we depended on the Permian Resources business to do that. It has done that. It's gotten us to what we consider to be just the first milestone; that is, the cash flow neutrality at $40 and breakeven at $50.","We went at a pace that we felt was appropriate to maximize return on capital employed as we were doing that and replacing our cash flow. That worked out well for us. But to get it really where we need it to be, this is the next phase. The next phase is this year's capital program is a key part of getting us to where we need to be.","Going into 2019, if market conditions are similar, we'll have a similar program. That will get us back in a leadership role. We will then be able to, I believe, exceed what any of our peers are doing, and that's what this is all about. It has nothing to do with price. It's back to our value proposition. It's back to ensuring that ultimately by focusing our return on capital employed, we can grow our cash flow, value-adding cash flow, and that we can then begin to grow our dividend again in a more meaningful way.","This all fits together. It's all about the value proposition. And this is an opportunity that we have worked hard for the last five years to get to. We're there now and we're ready to execute on it, and it's an opportunity that we just can't miss. And I think for our shareholders, it's certainly the right thing to do. And I appreciate all your questions today to help us get our story out, and we'll be talking with all of you over the next month or so, and then we'll see you at Barclays. So I very much appreciate it. Thank you, bye.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Cedric Burgher, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ken Dillon, President, International Oil and Gas Operations; BJ Hebert, President of OxyChem; and Oscar Brown, Senior Vice President, Strategy, Business Development and Integrated Supply. In just a moment, I will turn the call over to Vicki.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements or more fully described in our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on Slide 2. Our earnings press release, the Investor Relations supplemental schedules and our non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations and the conference call presentation slides can be downloaded off our website at www.oxy.com. ","I'll now turn the call over to Vicki. Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to welcome you to our first earnings call since closing the acquisition of Anadarko on August 8. I'd like to thank our employees who are hard at work updating our development and capital spending plans and implementing our team-based structure across the combined organization with an emphasis on safety, collaboration, creativity and results. Our integration and value capture team is working with our business units to capture synergies at an early stage so we can deliver the full potential of this transaction for our shareholders. As we work through the integration process, we become more confident every day in our ability to fully realize annual capital overhead and OpEx synergies of $2 billion, which I'll provide more detail on in a few minutes. ","For those of you who know Oxy well, you'll see our third quarter financial statements include a number of changes due to the completion of the Anadarko acquisition mid-quarter. Our income and cash flow statements capture legacy Oxy results for a full quarter and include Legacy Anadarko results as well as consolidated WES results for only 53 days. WES is now consolidated in our financial statements as a fourth operating segment, and our balance sheet reflects the consolidated company, including WES as of September 30. For transparency for our shareholders, we have provided a schedule in our earnings release, breaking out key financial and operational information from Oxy and WES on a stand-alone basis. As our financial statements do not include a full quarter of Legacy Anadarko and WES results, we understand that Street consensus was not able to reconcile all of the line items affected by the acquisition this quarter, for example, DD&A, tax and interest. ","Going to Slide 4. Oxy's complementary assets and the alignment of our Upstream, Chemical and Midstream businesses, including our ability to compete in a low-carbon world, position us for a full cycle success. Our leadership in each area where we operate, combined with our enhanced portfolio of high-return, short-cycle cash-flow-generating assets will facilitate profitable free cash flow growth, which we will utilize to reduce debt and also to return additional cash to shareholders. The substantial free cash flow we will generate in higher price environments, combined with our ability to pay a sector-leading dividend throughout lower commodity price environments, is unmatched. ","Post-acquisition, Oxy's diversified portfolio provides numerous competitive advantages. Oxy is now the largest oil and gas leaseholder in the United States on a net acreage basis, providing us with ample opportunities in the Permian, DJ, Powder River and the Gulf of Mexico to selectively deploy capital in a way that optimizes capital intensity. Oxy was the largest U.S. producer of oil and liquids on a combined company basis in the first half of 2019. This will allow us to maximize cash margins on a BOE basis, especially when taking our advantaged Midstream position into account. Through the acquisition, we acquired approximately 450,000 square miles of modern 3D seismic data in our core domestic development areas. This included a 40% increase in our already extensive Permian seismic inventory. The advantages that Oxy's diversified portfolio provides, coupled with our unmatched subsurface characterization ability and the execution excellence that Oxy is known for, ensures that we are positioned for full cycle success in the years ahead. ","As we continue our integration efforts, we are aligning WES to work seamlessly with Oxy's Upstream business. We're standing WES up as a more independent operation and to improve operating performance to benefit both Oxy's Upstream business and WES, inclusive of enabling WES to be more competitive for third-party business. We're also evaluating alternatives that could result in the deconsolidation of WES in the future. However, we expect to retain a significant economic interest in WES for the foreseeable future as we recognize their tremendous value that WES provides, and we plan to drive long-term value for both companies. ","Before providing additional details on synergy capture, I want to turn to the excellent operational results that our businesses continue to deliver. Since completing the acquisition of Anadarko, we continue to make quick progress towards fully achieving our post-acquisition divestiture and deleveraging goals. During the third quarter, we divested our Plains interest for net proceeds of $650 million and closed the sale of our Mozambique LNG stake for $3.9 billion. Upon completion of the divestitures contracted since May 2019, we will have essentially reached the lower end of our $10 billion to $15 billion divestiture goal net of taxes. We applied the proceeds from our closed divestitures toward reducing debt and have already eliminated our 2020 debt maturities. I'm very proud of the progress our teams have made over the last few months. We know that we have more to do on the deleveraging front, and I look forward to being able to make that additional announcement as we move forward towards the top end of our goal. ","Our integration and value capture efforts are proceeding exceptionally well without shifting focus away from our core business, which is evident from our strong third quarter operational results. Oxy continues to deliver the best wells in the basin, having delivered 25 of the top 100 wells in the Delaware Basin while drilling less than 7% of the total wells. We accomplished this using less proppant than peers, which results in lower cost for us. We also designed our developments with a full cycle -- with our life cycle approach using appropriate well spacing that we expect to deliver optimal results now and in the future. ","While we tend to highlight the Permian as it is a growth asset for us, all of our businesses continue to perform well. Since the close of the Anadarko acquisition, single day or monthly production records have been set in the Gulf of Mexico, DJ, Al Hosn and Permian resources for both legacy Anadarko and Oxy assets. This demonstrates the quality and expertise of both the former Oxy and Anadarko employees as they stay laser-focused on delivering superior results even during this integration process. ","As proud as I am of all of our teams for the operational excellence they have maintained during integration, I'm even more pleased with our outstanding safety record. Our teams are continuing to look for ways to further improve our safety performance as operating safely is and will continue to be a core value for us. ","Our consistent industry-leading operational results, combined with our ability to fully deliver on value capture, positions us for a full cycle success and enhances our ability to generate increased excess free cash flow to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders. Returning excess capital to our shareholders is a part of Oxy's DNA. In the third quarter, we returned approximately $600 million to shareholders. ","Going to Slide 7. I'm thankful to have had the opportunity to engage with many of our shareholders over the past few months to discuss the free cash flow potential of the new Oxy. Interest in our 2020 capital plan is high. While we typically do not release our full year capital budget until our fourth quarter earnings call, we're able to provide many details of our 2020 capital plan this morning. Our 2020 capital budget of $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion will deliver expected annual total company production growth of 2%. This represents an approximate reduction of $3.6 billion from Anadarko's and Oxy's combined 2019 capital budgets. ","When we communicated our annual synergy target of $2 billion, we also stated that capital spending would be reduced by $1.5 billion, lowering our company-wide annual production growth from approximately 10% to 5%. We have gone further than this for 2020. We anticipate that the combination of lower capital spending and production growth will generate greater free cash flow, enhanced by our industry-leading capital efficiency, which I'll touch on shortly. ","2020 production growth on the company level will be driven by Permian resources, while we expect production from other areas to be flat or grow at a reduced rate compared to 2019. We expect Permian Resources production to grow by approximately 5% in 2020, operating 15 gross rigs and 8 net rigs. The rough breakout for specific areas is 5 rigs in new Mexico; 6 to 7 in Legacy Anadarko, Texas Delaware; and 3 to 4 in the Midland Basin JV. In the DJ, our plan represents approximately three operated rigs. ","As Permian resources shelf production becomes a larger portion of our total oil and gas production, we expect our oil and gas base decline rate to increase to 25% in 2020. However, we do not expect our base decline rate to continue to increase in future years given our moderated growth rate. Similar to 2019, our 2020 capital program is dominated by short-cycle investments. At approximately $35 WTI, our 2020 program would generate a double-digit rate of return. Oxy remains flexible throughout the commodity cycle. And if necessary, in less than 6 months, we can reduce capital spending to sustaining levels. ","Looking past 2020, we know that capital discipline will continue to be important to investors. Our intent is to cap our annual production growth at an average of 5% as we balance the vast opportunities in our portfolio with growing free cash flow. Our planned activity in 2020 should enable us to grow production by 5% annually in 2021 with a capital budget of $6.6 billion. As for 2019, capital discipline, as always, is intact at Oxy as we remain on track to spend within our combined capital budget of $8.6 billion, excluding Africa. ","Since the acquisition closed, we've had the opportunity to take a deeper dive into the company that's combined, Oxy\/Anadarko, and are as excited today as we have been at any time during the last 2 years about the opportunities in front of us. Through the strength of our combined companies, we've identified approximately 150 specific capital synergy initiatives across our enhanced portfolio, which we plan to incorporate into our development plans. Applying these initiatives will lower well costs by $3.1 million per well in Texas Delaware and by $600,000 per well in the DJ Basin. ","In drilling and completions, we are implementing efficient development concepts utilizing Oxy drilling dynamics to improve the trajectory of the bid and wellbore, which reduces drill times and costs. For example, we expect to improve our drilling rates or footage drilled per day in the Texas Delaware about 35%. The technical work completed by all of our teams to identify savings initiatives and to improve well productivity has been outstanding, and I'm extremely confident in our ability to execute and realize the full synergy targets. ","On Slide 10, we provide a bottom-up view of the $605 million of drilling and completion synergies based on expected savings per well and estimated 2021 net well counts to achieve annual production growth of 5% in 2021. ","On Slide 11, in addition to realizing $900 million in capital synergies, Oxy's best-in-class capital intensity is expected to continue to improve. This often underappreciated measure of operational excellence and competitive advantage truly sets Oxy's capabilities in the Permian apart from other operators. As a reminder, capital intensity is defined as the total net annual capital required for 1,000 net barrels per day of average annual ledge production. ","Fully capturing our capital synergies and improving our overall capital intensity through faster time to market and better well performance will contribute to driving efficient wedge growth, enabling Oxy to deliver expected production growth of 5% in 2021 with $6.6 billion in capital. We've been a top performer in capital intensity for multiple years, and we will substantially improve the capital efficiency of our newly combined Permian resource portfolio. We expect the largest improvement in intensity to originate from legacy Anadarko Delaware acreage, along with continued improvements from legacy Oxy acreage. Our unmatched Permian capital intensity reflects significant improvements in time-to-market through our efficient operations and SIMOPS planning, applying Oxy's advanced subsurface characterization to improve well results and limited inference to reduce infrastructure costs in our legacy acreage from the reuse of existing facilities and the high grading of inventory as well as implementing our Midland Basin joint venture with EcoPetrol. ","In 2020, improvement in capital intensity is aided by the deceleration in capital spending. Moving into 2021, we will maintain our intensity in the low 20s -- $20 million range, even when production grows from Permian Resources is increased to support annual company production growth of 5%. While this example applies to our Permian Resources business, we continue to make notable productivity and efficiency gains across all business segments. We will highlight some of the exciting initiatives in our other areas in next quarter's earnings call. ","On Slide 12, overhead synergies will be derived from aligning our workforce to meet the current needs of our company and carving out costs related to assets that will be divested in reducing real estate and other costs. In terms of reducing OpEx, Permian cash operating costs continue to be at the lowest they've been in a decade, driven by our long-term, high-return investments, including facilities and infrastructure. We expect this trend to continue, especially with our large footprint in the Permian. ","On Slide 13, as I mentioned earlier, we have had many initiatives underway to fully capture the synergies promised. You can see on our energy tracker, we've already made progress in adding both overhead and capital synergies. While our progress in realizing synergies may not be linear, we will continue to provide updates so investors are able to clearly see our progress each quarter. ","Turning to Permian Resources. We again delivered the highest number of top wells in the Delaware Basin on a 6- and 12-month cumulative basis, and we continue to drive significant productivity improvements. We also continued to reach new milestones, including a record 10,000-foot lateral drilled in only 10.7 days and a record 267 completion stages in 1 month completed by one frac team. This is a record for Oxy and also for our main frac provider in the Permian. ","Following my earlier comment on safety, I'd like to draw attention to our new Mexico completions team, which went in an entire year without a single OSHA recordable incident for employees and contractors. That includes over 2 million work hours, conducting high-pressure frac operations without an incident. This is a remarkable achievement. ","The next slide reinforces our unique development approach and subsurface expertise, one of the key factors that continuously enables us to deliver the best wells while using less proppant than others, resulting in significant capital savings. Oxy's combined acreage portfolio supports nearly 1\/3 of the top wells in the Delaware Basin, including Anadarko's 6 record wells. The subsurface potential in the acquired acreage is prolific, and we can't wait to unlock more top wells using our development expertise, combined with Anadarko's best practices. ","I'll now hand the call over to Cedric, who will walk you through our financial results and updated guidance.","Cedric Burgher","Thanks, Vicki. As we move forward as a combined company, our commitment to capital discipline and returning capital to shareholders remains unchanged. We remain on track to spend within our full year pro forma combined capital budget of $8.6 billion, excluding Africa. Furthermore, we have an established -- we have established a capital budget for 2020 that we expect will fully optimize free cash flow and position us to grow production in a capital-efficient manner while maintaining the safety of our dividend. In the third quarter, we returned $660 million of cash to shareholders through our dividend, protecting our dividend as a top priority, and we look forward to continuing to return significant capital to our shareholders. ","Continuing with our third quarter results, taking into account the mid-quarter completion of the acquisition, we announced adjusted earnings of $0.11 per diluted share and reported a loss of $1.08 per diluted share. The difference between adjusted and reported results is mainly due to the $969 million of onetime costs related to the Anadarko acquisition and $325 million of oil and gas impairment charges. ","With respect to our segments, oil and gas adjusted income decreased in the third quarter compared to the prior quarter, mainly due to lower international production and lower realized oil prices. Total third quarter reported production from continuing operations of 1.1 million BOEs per day included contributions from legacy Anadarko operations of 377,000 BOEs per day. As Vicki mentioned, all of our U.S. upstream businesses are performing exceptionally well, with several single day or monthly average production records having been set since completion of the acquisition. Oxy's legacy Permian resources operations exceeded guidance with production of 300,000 BOEs per day due to best-in-class well results and execution. Actual production of 655,000 BOEs per day for Anadarko's legacy U.S. businesses exceeded guidance of 585,000 to 630,000 BOEs per day due to improved operability in the DJ, Permian and Gulf of Mexico. ","To assist investors with reconciling reported and pro forma production for the third quarter, we have included a table in the appendix of this presentation, breaking down actual total company production of 1.4 million BOEs per day by operating area. ","OxyChem surpassed guidance with income of $207 million for the third quarter despite vinyl margins coming under pressure from increased ethylene costs, which were driven higher by industry-wide ethylene cracker downtime. Higher ethylene costs were offset by stronger sales and production across most product lines. Our Marketing and other Midstream business reported third quarter adjusted income of $155 million, excluding $111 million gain on the sale of our Plains interest driven by a Midland to MEH differential of approximately $5.30. Compared to the second quarter, the decrease in earnings was largely driven by the narrowing of the Midland to MEH differential impacting Marketing margins. As the differential compresses and impacts Marketing income, currently, 70% of the impact will be realized as an income benefit to the Upstream business. ","For the fourth quarter, we have provided guidance on a combined company basis and expect Permian Resources growth to slow as we have begun moderating our capital spend going into 2020. Fourth quarter international guidance reflects the termination of the Idd El Shargi North and South Dome contracts in Qatar in early October. The continuous improvements we are making are evident in our operational results and outlook. Our revised fourth quarter production guidance represents an increase of 28,000 MBOEs per day compared to the implied fourth quarter guidance provided in Oxy's second quarter earnings call and the updated guidance we released for legacy Anadarko operations in early August. Pro forma production guidance for full year 2019 is included in a table in the appendix to this presentation. As has been the case in previous years, fourth quarter guidance for Oxychem is not representative of our full year outlook as chloro vinyls -- as the chloro vinyls market is typically subject to seasonal factors in the fourth quarter each year. ","In the third quarter, we applied the proceeds from our sale of Mozambique asset and Plains interest as well as free cash flow from Algeria and Ghana, to pay down $4.9 billion in debt. We have now retired all of our debt maturities for 2020 and will apply proceeds from future sales to retire debt due in 2021 and beyond. ","As we continue to apply asset divestiture proceeds and free cash flow to debt reduction, we will update the debt-reduction tracker shown on Slide 20 so that investors can see our progress in meeting our divestiture target of $10 billion to $15 billion net of taxes and in deleveraging. I look forward to continuing to provide updates on our progress on both of these fronts. ","I will now turn the call back over to Vicki.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you, Cedric. As a leader in our industry, Oxy must drive improvement on all fronts, including reducing emissions. In the coming quarters, we will provide updates on the progress our Low Carbon Ventures business is making and supplying anthropogenic or man-made CO2 to the Permian for the purpose of carbon utilization and sequestration. While Low Carbon Ventures is leading our strategy to produce the lowest carbon barrel of oil, we are also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We are doing so by working to eliminate routine flaring, monitoring infrastructure for methane emissions and reducing miles driven by transporting supplies into the Permian via rail through our Aventine Logistics Hub. On an annualized basis, we reduced 1.9 million truck miles per year, which is equivalent to 1,700 metric tons of CO2 reductions. ","Also in this quarter, in the Permian Basin, we brought online the largest solar facility in the state of Texas that directly supports oil and gas operations. The latest publicly available emissions data shows that on a like-for-like basis, Oxy is a leader in greenhouse gas emission intensity in the Permian. While we are pleased to be ahead of peers on this metric, we are not satisfied with where we are, and we're committed to continue working on reducing emissions across all of our assets. ","Going to Slide 23. To Oxy, being an innovative and sustainable energy leader means maintaining leadership in each area that we operate. Our teams are relentlessly focused on value creation through the application of advanced technical excellence, applied technology, breakthrough innovation and operations and capital execution, all of which helped to make us a lower-cost operator and will translate into higher-margin free cash flow growth. The cash will be used to delever the near term and to return more cash to shareholders through a balance of our dividend and share repurchases in the future. ","Sustainability also means planning for the future, which we do through the lens of a best-in-class operator with an unmatched portfolio of world-class assets. Our focused portfolio includes multiple decades of high-return, short-to-medium cycle development opportunities that will include primary, secondary and tertiary recovery options. The diversity of our enhanced portfolio strengthens our strategy to operate profitably in a low-carbon world. The combination of technical and operations excellence applied over a vast set of diverse assets and a strategy to lower our carbon footprint sets us apart from other energy companies. This will enable us to further strengthen our value proposition and ensure our success and sustainability long into the future. ","In closing, I want to stress how much potential our newly combined company now has in terms of what we can achieve both financially and operationally. There is much to look forward to for our shareholders and for Oxy. ","And now we'll open it up for questions, and while we're lining up the questions, I do want to give a shout-out to our DJ Basin team for also achieving record production. Our DJ Basin team achieved almost 301,000 barrels a day just here recently, so we're excited about what they're doing and the improvements they're making and the commitment they have to operational excellence. ","Now we'll move to the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.","Devin McDermott","So my first question is on the synergy targets, and it seems like you've made some really good progress so far post the integration. I think the additional detail on the specific drivers of synergies is definitely helpful. It seems like you identified a lot of clear items that get you to the overall targets. My question is more on -- now that we're a few months into the deal post close, what you identified or what opportunities you've seen that might be incremental to or different than your expectations going into the deal, and specifically, if those might drive upside over time? And as part of that, I was hoping you could address some of the difference in capital efficiency between some of the legacy Anadarko, Permian wells and Oxy. And how much, if any, improvement in that productivity is baked into the synergy targets and also 2020 guidance?","Vicki Hollub","Well, what we baked into our synergy targets were the things that we knew about, the things that we could see. And in the Permian Basin, we had the data there so we knew that we had the opportunity to significantly lower cost and to do that through a combination of our drilling expertise and our subsurface characterization. So we've looked at that. Our teams have delved into that. That's why we're very, very confident of the Permian resources synergies that we've outlined. We know that we can achieve those there. ","In the DJ, not only based on what we knew with respect to our Oxy drilling dynamics, we've been incredibly impressed with what the team up there is doing from a drilling perspective. They're -- and also completions. They have started to work their completions differently, and they are bringing some best practices that we believe are really advanced. We think that we can still improve that with the subsurface characterization that we've applied to the resources business. But I would say on an operational perspective, from drilling and completing, those guys are doing a great job, and they're doing a great job operationally, which is how they achieved their record production of almost 301,000 barrels here in the last couple of weeks. ","So what we're really excited about is that now that we've had a chance to work together, the 2 teams, we're coming up with more synergies. The ones that we identified in my script and the ones that we had counted on initially to deliver what we expected are -- we already had a little bit more than those because we wanted a little bit of cushion to ensure that we did deliver what we said we would. But now I'm really excited about what Anadarko's expertise is bringing to the table for us. And I believe that, that's going to be exciting news when we could roll it out. What we need to do first is quantify the value that it's going to add, but we know that they have some best practices that are really important to us. One, I can tell you that's not even related to the shale is their seismic interpretation. Some of the things they're doing there are very, very impressive, and we're going to be applying that to some of our international operations.","Devin McDermott","Got it. Great. And just to clarify on the Permian operation. So as we think about the 2020 plan, how quickly can you implement some of the Oxy best practices, subsurface characterization, drilling techniques into the Anadarko development program. When might we see some of those productivity improvements show up as we move through 2020 and beyond?","Vicki Hollub","Well, what we have found is that the subsurface work, that's going to be pretty immediate because those guys are starting to work that now. So from a completion cost perspective, that will start happening right away. Now the results of that, the improved recovery per well, you'll see that have a bigger impact from a production standpoint next year, but we'll see the efficiency improvements in using less proppant to still manage to frac and complete more effectively. That will start happening as we start drilling on the Anadarko acreage in a big way. ","The Oxy drilling dynamics, everywhere we've rolled it out, even internally, it takes a little while to get the teams used to it so that they can start to make it happen and work for them. There's always a little bit of a learning curve with that, but we do expect that we will achieve that process by the first quarter of 2020 for it to start taking hold. And so by the mid to later part of 2020, you'll start seeing, I believe, some improved drilling in the Permian, along with the efficiencies of the completions by midyear. So that by the end of the year, I'm quite confident that, that drilling and completion program will be much improved.","Devin McDermott","Excellent. I look forward to seeing the progress there. And I have one more on a separate topic, and that's just on some of the asset sale and leverage reduction targets. So I mean, you've achieved the lower end of the $10 billion to $15 billion target so far. I was wondering if you could comment just on the overall market or backdrop for these additional divestitures, what your thinking is on the opportunities there. ","And then I understand it might be hard to comment, but any additional color on how you see that deconsolidation of WES potentially playing out with the intention of, as you mentioned, containing or retaining a large economic ownership but deconsolidating some of the debt and overall financials there.","Vicki Hollub","Okay. I'll just say that one thing that we really want people to understand is that we are very focused. We're very intense on ensuring that we get the asset sales done because we believe we must get our debt down. That's an internal target. We talk about it every day. We're getting help throughout the entire organization because I don't think there are very many of our employees that you wouldn't walk up to and that they wouldn't be able to tell you that the highest priority we have as a company is to save every dollar that we can save and to become as efficient as we can be, as quickly as we can be, because making sure that we have the dollars either from cash flow or asset sales to lower the debt is critically important for us. ","And just as when we first rolled out our plan to achieve cash flow neutrality at $40, we had a plan to do that in 2 years, and we made that promise to the shareholders. As you all know, we achieved that 6 months ahead of schedule, and we did that because our teams are incredibly focused and determined to deliver results and to deliver what we say we'll deliver. We're taking that same intensity to this debt reduction. So we are approaching asset sales very aggressively and intently. But with that said, one of the things that we're not doing is we're not compromising on the value that we can get from those assets, and so we're balancing both of those. And I feel confident that with, not only the intensity that we're approaching it, but the creativity that I hope we've shown you all in the way that we've approached the asset divestitures thus far. So we will -- there will be some creativity. There will be some things that you might not expect, but none of those we can talk about or we compromise our ability to make it happen. So I appreciate you recognizing that. ","With respect to WES, I'm going to hand it over to Oscar to tell you a little bit more about how we're thinking about that.","Oscar Brown","Sure. And as Vicki made earlier comments, obviously, we're focused on the integration right now and helping WES improve operations and really become more competitive, not only with the supporter of Oxy's upstream operations, but with third-party operations. So all that's ongoing. We've been working with our auditors to focus on the accounting deconsolidation of WES. So there's some work to do, but we think we can do that pretty quickly. That really not changed too much our ownership interest in WES. And so as Vicki said, we have the option to retain a substantial stake in WES economically both in terms of ownership, but also, obviously, we're tied together as their largest customer going forward. So all that's progressing just fine, and we hope to have some news on that in the near future.","Vicki Hollub","I will add to that. I'm really excited about the new management team at WES. They're very operationally focused, and they're working on -- that's why I said the part about picking up third-party volumes, they're really focused on improving operations and efficiencies and being a really strong competitor to other midstream businesses in the Permian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy.","Ryan Todd","Great. Maybe to follow-up. At a high level, is it fair to characterize the large cuts to the 2020 program as an effort to demonstrate your priorities in terms of deleveraging in dividend and the 2021 plus outlook as a normalization of the business? And if that's the case, what sort of checkpoints would you have to see to normalize things again versus staying in belt-tightening mode? Is commodity price hitting certain checkpoint on debt metrics? What would you have to see to kind of renormalize in 2021? Or not?","Vicki Hollub","Todd, thank you. You just answered the question for me. So thank you for that, but it really goes more beyond just trying to get back to normal. What we really would need to look at and evaluate when we get closer to 2021 is how oil prices look, what we've achieved on the debt reduction and what we've achieved with respect to the synergies and also how well our teams are performing from an efficiency standpoint. All of those factors will be considered as we go and move toward 2021 because the reality is that we don't have to be at the 5% right away. What we wanted people to know is that, over time, the 5% is what we believe is the right growth percentage to enable us to, not only start to grow our dividend more meaningfully again, but to also be able to, at the same time, return cash to our shareholders through buybacks.","Ryan Todd","Okay. And on the leverage side, is there anything that you're looking at to say kind of until we get to this place, we'll probably keep things tight.","Vicki Hollub","I would say that we have aggressive internal targets, and if we haven't met those, then that would play a big role in what we do in 2021.","Ryan Todd","Okay. And maybe a follow-up on the 2020 plan. I mean, should we think about everything outside of the Permian resources as being held roughly flat from a production point of view with all the growth coming from the Permian Resources? And if that's the case, under a normalization to $6.6 billion in 2021, do some of these other assets, Rockies, EOR, et cetera, kind of return to growth? Or does the majority of that incremental capital will just go back to Permian? I guess on a multi-year view, should we think of ex Permian resources as being largely held flat? Or will we see growth outside of the Permian?","Vicki Hollub","What we like to do with our teams internally is let them compete for capital, and they have to compete for capital by submitting projects that can beat the Permian. And actually, we have -- we believe that some of those projects, both in Oman, Abu Dhabi, Colombia, the DJ and probably in about 2 to 3 years, the Powder River, we believe -- and Gulf of Mexico. Looking at the data that we see now and the performance that we see, the margins and the returns, our returns from almost -- from everything that we have the opportunity to invest dollars in is double digits at $40 or above. And so we have -- this is what -- this is the value of this tremendous portfolio we have today. We have lots of options. We have lots of flexibility. And what the teams have to do is they just have to make their projects competitive enough to get the dollars. And ultimately, the way I see it now, in a $6.6 billion environment and by 2021, essentially, we would be potentially growing all of our areas, except Gulf of Mexico and maybe Powder River. But certainly, all the other areas would have the opportunity to grow because of the projects that they have in their inventory today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.","Paul Cheng","Vicki, earlier, you said that -- from your standpoint, 5% is the wide growth rate. Can you elaborate why 5%? I mean, given the size of the company, today and long-term or demand growth looks like it's going to be 1% or below. I think the market is actually will be more happy if you grow at 3% instead of 5%.","Vicki Hollub","It would be -- commodity prices always come into play when we're deciding what our growth rate would be. And what I -- a better way for me to say it is that we're going to average a 5% growth rate on the average over time. So in those times when commodity prices because of weaker demand, we would grow at a lower rate. So we're going to adjust. ","And I think at one time, we showed a chart that showed that we would potentially grow from a certain oil price to a different oil price above which that our growth would be capped. We'll have that same scenario going forward. And as we delever and get back to the scenario where we'll start taking into account the opportunities to grow at that 5% cap, then we'll start looking at those metrics and providing those to you again. But it really depends on commodity prices, efficiencies, where we are from a leverage standpoint. ","And I guess, what I'm really trying to say is that once we put all the variables in our model and we run the various scenarios, it's -- at the end of the day, it's a value calculation. And whatever creates the most value is -- and then delivers the most return to the shareholders is what we'll do.","Paul Cheng","But just my two cents is that given the increasing number of the journalists, there's a concern about the long-term oil demand outlook and correspondingly, that the longer-term commodity prices. The notion saying that we grow at 5%, I think the easy way to look at it is that most investors today probably one burn on hand and 2 burn in the bushes. ","The second question, quick one on Permian, how much is your percent of your land position, just in the federal land? And how much of your production today is in the federal land?","Vicki Hollub","So in the Permian Resources business, we have a very low percentage of what is total federal lands. I can't remember overall. I think our overall percentage is about 2%. Let me hand this to Jeff. He's got those numbers.","Jeff Alvarez","Yes. So domestically, of our 14 million acres, 2 million of that is federal, but half of that is offshore. So if you think of onshore, about 1 million acres is federal. And if you go to the Permian, about 270,000 acres across the Permian. And then if you continue to narrow that down into the Delaware Basin, that's where people want to talk about the most, approximately 20% of our acreage in the Delaware Basin is on federal land. And if you look at the DJ, it's less than 1%. It's very, very small there.","Operator","Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","On the low-carbon initiatives, as I look at the slide breaking out your 2020 CapEx, if it's there, it seems awfully small so I thought I would just ask. What level of funding you're planning to allocate to the low-carbon effort this coming year?","Vicki Hollub","Our strategy for Low Carbon Ventures is more around a target and goal of the activities and what we need to accomplish. And how we accomplish that with respect to a capital standpoint is a part of the Low Carbon Ventures team. Strategic initiatives is to look at the best way to fund those. I -- ultimately, I'm so excited about this business because this is a win-win-win business in that we are going to be able to lower emissions both in the United States and in the other areas that we operate while also taking the anthropogenic CO2 and using it to increase oil production, thereby creating value for royalty owners, for the states and for the country in which we operate, wherever it is. And in addition to that, we're going to be able to ultimately, in my view, make -- and our team's view, make a business of this in that we will be able to build this into a business that generates cash flow and earnings for our shareholders. ","So the way we intend to do that is a bit -- at this point, something that's proprietary in terms of how we want to -- how we think about it and how we're building that to happen. But it's a win-win-win, and it's a great -- the team is doing just a great job in making this happen. ","And we've made some investments in some new technologies. Those have been direct investments. We have a -- one of those was net power, which generates a lower cost of electricity and still provides a CO2 stream, almost pure CO2 stream for use in enhanced oil recovery. And the other thing we've invested in, and we've even announced that we will build, we're evaluating building one of the largest or the largest direct air capture unit in the world in the Permian. And what that will do is take CO2 from the atmosphere, and we can then use that in our enhanced oil recovery projects. ","And the reason all of this is so important to use in enhanced oil recovery rather than sequestration is that using it in an oil reservoir still sequesters about 40% of what you're cycling every time you cycle through the reservoir, so you get the sequestration part of it. But what you also do is by using that, you're able to generate a lower-carbon intensity barrel of oil. And so the -- I believe that for the world, the last barrel of oil produced in the world, whenever that happens, should come from a CO2-enhanced oil recovery reservoir because then it will be a net lower emission barrel. And our teams are working toward that, and they've got some very creative commercial ways to deal with it.","Pavel Molchanov","That's helpful. And then lastly, on the Board changes or the changes in the charter that you outlined at the very end of your slides today. Do these proposals that will be voted on next year potentially settle the disagreement with Icahn?","Vicki Hollub","I'll say that when Mr. Icahn brought up the concerns he had, these were a part of his concerns. And that's one of the things that is -- a result of him bringing up is the reason we looked at it. We're not out to settle anything with this. What we're out to do is just to do the right thing for our shareholders, and we felt like he brought up an issue that we needed to address, and the Board did that. ","And the Board has actually gone further than that. We -- I'm -- not only are we responding to shareholder feedback on the 2 proposals to lower the percentage required for a special meeting, but also the procedure lowering the requirement for the written consent vote as well. But what I'm even more excited about is what the Board has done with respect to the creation of a committee now that specifically addresses ESG, and specifically addresses it in a way that engages the Board more with the shareholders. So what's sometimes missed in what that proposal was is it's yet to -- they're going to focus on the ESG things that fall sort of in between the Health, Environmental and Safety Committee and the Governance Committee. So there are some things that we were struggling with, where do we include that, who takes the ownership of that. So creating this committee clearly has a committee on our Board focused on our specific ESG initiatives that are not really so much safety- or environmental-related, and those that are not specifically governance-related puts them in this committee. So this committee is going to be focused on that. ","But the other things that our Chairman wants this committee to do is be a lot more engaged with the shareholders, both on the ESG side and on the portfolio management side to ensure that they are more engaged to know how our shareholders think, what are the topics that are top of mind for them. And if there are issues that we need to address, they're getting that feedback now directly. And so I think that's been a huge change for us, and I think it's going to be a positive thing for all of our shareholders going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","With regards to the Permian, you talked about the rig split earlier. But can you talk a little bit more with regards to how you view the Anadarko Permian properties competing relative to the legacy Oxy Permian properties? And to the degree that you were to ramp back post 2020 to deliver a 5% growth rate, would that ramp-up occur more from Anadarko side versus the Oxy side?","Vicki Hollub","I think our Southeast New Mexico area still remains, I believe, the top and the best that we have. And I believe the legacy Anadarko acreage is going to be very close in line, not even a second, maybe a 1B in terms of the priority. The acreage is really, really good. Subsurface is excellent. So I would say that our Texas Barilla Draw area would be probably second. And so behind 1A in Southeast New Mexico, 1B in legacy Anadarko acreage.","Brian Singer","Great. And then to follow-up on the earlier question with regards to WES, I think in the past, Oxy said that the process to improve performance operationally could be done by early 2020. Is that still the case? Or what do you see -- and what do you see as the scope of the improvement and how you would measure success? And then one additional one on that thread is I think you commented on the potential for deconsolidation, but retention of economic interest. Does that mean that you would divest a portion, but not all of your interest in seed control? Sorry, I know there were a lot of questions in there.","Vicki Hollub","I would say I'll address the operations one and throw it to Oscar for the structural one. But from an operations standpoint, what has been, I think, a huge change is the collaboration between the field upstream operations and the facilities guys and the WES team. I think that what they did early on is they decided to have a team approach, how we're doing business today, how Wes is doing their business, how we're interacting and where -- how we connect with them, and to look at ways to [indiscernible] and improve efficiencies. They've already outlined some specific things that they're addressing. One of the deals was that we were a bit surprised by the downtime that WES had, and it's just kind of unacceptable to us to have that level of downtime. ","And so combining the current management team's perspective with their designee, working with the Oxy side of it, these teams now have come up with ways to specifically address the downtime and get the downtime much lower. And that's -- those are inexpensive barrels of just making sure that your uptime is the best that it can be. That's the quickest and easiest way to get barrels, and I think we'll start seeing -- we have to change some infrastructure first to make that happen. So I think you'll start to see that happening in Q1 of 2020. And Oscar?","Oscar Brown","Sure. It's Oscar. So on the deconsolidation front, one of the key things is the business -- WES has matured greatly over the years. And then everything that Vicki is talking about to improve operations and, most importantly, set up this company to really be aggressive in its ability to win third-party business, I think all those things are aligned with a company that can stand on its own, and being an independent company, and ultimately, a convenience for us is the deconsolidation on the accounting front. So all those things align. ","In terms of the specifics on how much control Oxy would need to give up and is there a related need to sell down some interest -- economic interest in the company, we're still working that with our auditors. But the key is that the company can -- is getting the company to a place that has its own employees that can stand-alone its own officers, great operations, it's a complement to our businesses. And then again, the real growth upside, the next stage for WES, beyond what we can do and we'll continue to do with Oxy to support WES is the third-party business, which is one of the great opportunities there. So again, more to come on that, but that's where we stand today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","I just wanted to, I guess, review a little bit on the capital efficiency or intensity disclosures you provided on the Permian Resources business. I'm just curious how you think about the ability to maintain that level of capital intensity, the 2020 level, as you think about kind of reentering more of a normalized or growth-type scenario in 2021. Is that a kind of a sustainable level? Or is that being kind of dragged down by the slowdown in 2020?","Vicki Hollub","Well, that was one of the things that we took into account, is that -- and when we decided to lower our capital, how it would impact 2021 was a factor that we thought about and considered. And so we do have a plan to on-board rigs, should we go back up in 2021. We would make that decision at a point where it would give our teams the time to make that happen. Because every time you shut down a rig and you release crews, you have the issue of bringing those crews back, getting them back to the efficiency level that they were when they shut down. Obviously, you recognize that, and that's what your question is centered around. ","We have a more robust process around doing that because it's always irritated us that even though we know it happens, that it always happens. And so we try to -- we're trying to figure out now and have some people that are involved in trying to make that -- the reboot and the start-up, again, of a rig that's been idled to make that more efficient. And so as we go toward 2021 and see how that's looking, we'll take the steps to try to get the -- that rig, whatever rigs that we bring on, up and running and without too much loss of efficiency initially. Did you have anything to add on that, Ken -- Jeff?","Jeff Alvarez","Yes. So to add, Michael, I mean to your point, and Vicki commented in our script, we do expect 2021 plus the capital intensity to be in the low 20s. So as synergies flow through and all that, we expect that to be in that level as we go forward. And if you spend time -- I know going through with our Permian resources leadership, they've got very, very definitive goals to drive it down from there. So I do think that is our new normal.","Michael Hall","That's helpful. And then I guess, continuing on this thread. What's the base decline on the Permian Resources business, I guess, exiting 2019 pro forma, the combined businesses? And then how that looks coming out of 2020 as you look at it in these capital intensity figures?","Jeff Alvarez","Yes. So without doing decline curve analysis on how it applies at cap intensity, I'll give you a couple of quick numbers. So the base decline exit-to-exit for Permian Resources is in the mid- to high 30s. So say, about 37%. But as you know, that's an exit-to-exit number. And when we do the capital intensity calculation, we use the real decline, which is exponential. So it's not straight. It's kind of concave. So just for easy math, if you think about the wedge we're adding in Permian Resources next year, there's about 105,000 barrels a day. So if you take the 2.2 billion, 105,000, that's what gets you to the $21 million capital intensity number. Is that answer what you're looking for, Michael?","Michael Hall","Yes. And I guess I was also trying to understand like how that changes as you exit 2020 into 2021. It seems that, that would be a tailwind to the...","Jeff Alvarez","Actually, it improved.","Michael Hall","Yes, that's kind of what I was getting at. I'm just trying to understand how...","Jeff Alvarez","Yes. So that's the point. As the base gets bigger and that you have less of those new high-decline barrels coming on, that base decline actually improves as you head into 2020.","Operator","In the interest of time, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vicki Hollub for any closing remarks.","Vicki Hollub","Yes, there's another couple of things we'd like to address before we go. But first, I wanted to pass it to Ken to -- there've been some questions offline about Gulf of Mexico. I'd like for him to share some mental on that.","Kenneth Dillon","Good morning. Thanks, Vicki. So far, we're really excited about both the people and the assets. The subsurface characterization opportunities, we believe, can lead to being able to extend the plateau with modest cost over a long period. Our latest K2 well come in with really good logs, and it'll be on stream in Q1. Next year, we plan to spend $100 million on near-field exploration and also drill development wells from platforms. ","Artificial lift synergies are something we didn't build into our thoughts, and it's something we're working on together as a team here, and we see that as real potential upside to come. We see Ghana [ph] as a long-term steady cash flow business that has great significance, and everything we've seen so far supports that.","Vicki Hollub","Okay. Then lastly, I'd like to say that in closing, that we are really positioning Oxy for long-term success. The acquisition of Anadarko has positioned us to more effectively address what I think are the 3 most critical issues facing our industry today. Those are climate change, geopolitical volatility and the regulatory environment in the U.S. So with the position that we have now, building on the fact that we're the largest handler of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery in the world, we intend to utilize now our position as the largest acreage holder in the United States, and with a vast amount of that being shale play to execute CO2 enhanced oil recovery in the shale. That will fit perfectly into our Low Carbon Ventures strategy and enables us to continue to grow and get the most out of the shale than anyone else over time. And we think these -- that these assets sit perfectly, and they're perfectly compatible with the conventional assets that we'll be developing in Oman and the UAE over time. So I think I'm really excited about our portfolio. We have an opportunity to continue to go into the future with the portfolio, the structure, the people and the sustainability to withstand oil price cycles while also maintaining a social license to operate globally in a low-carbon world. So thank you all for your questions and for joining our call. Have a good day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Degner. Mr. Degner, please go ahead.","Chris Degner","Thank you, Emily. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in Occidental Petroleum's fourth quarter 2014 conference call. On the call with us today are Steve Chazen, Oxy's President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Stavros, Chief Financial Officer, Vicki Hollub, President, Oil and Gas in the Americas, Willie Chiang, Executive Vice President of Operations and Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas Operation.","In just a moment I will turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Chazen who will review our achievements in 2014 and provide an outlook for 2015. Our CFO, Chris Stavros will review our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and also provide guidance for 2015. Then, Willie Chiang will review our 2015 capital plan followed by Vicki Hollub, who will provide an update of our activities in the Permian Basin. As a reminder, today's conference call contains certain projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws.","These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause results to differ is available on the company's most recent Form 10-K. Our fourth quarter 2014 earnings press release and the investor relations supplemental schedules, our non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation and the conference call presentation slides can be downloaded off of our website at www.oxy.com.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen. Steve, please go ahead.","Steve Chazen","Thanks, Chris. I would like to start with some highlights from our accomplishments in the past year. We executed many of our strategic initiatives including the spin-off of California Resources, the sale of our Hugoton gas properties, BridgeTex pipeline and PAGP units. At the end of the year, our cash balance of $7.8 billion exceeded our total debt of $6.8 billion. We grew our domestic oil production by 11,000 barrels a day over 2013 to 181,000 a day. We grew our Permian resources production from 65,000 barrel equivalents a day over 2013 to 75,000 barrels a day this year.","The 2004 capital program added 395 million barrels of proved reserves, replacement ratio of 181% before dispositions. Our costs incurred with these reserve additions were about $6.7 billion, resulted in an apparent finding and development cost of under $17 a BOE. We added 363 million barrels of liquid proved reserves, a replacement ratio of 223%, before dispositions.","We completed the Al Hosn gas project on budget and on time which started production in early January. I have two comments about the macro environment. The confluence of U.S. supply growth, weaker Asian demand and extreme currency movements have led to significant decline in product prices. Our company is resilient and built to weather price shocks typical to this industry. Obviously, we have the financial resource to continue drilling at the 2004 rate.","However, the current service company cost structure is more reflective of a $100 oil price environment, rather than the $50 environment we have today. While service companies have offered modest price reductions, they still do not reflect the current reality. We're focused on reducing our costs which include renegotiating our supplier contracts that are not reflective of weaker oil prices. We expect these efforts to result in a reduction in the cost of executing our capital program as well as reducing our operating expense.","It makes little sense for us to push production so as to sell our oil at $50 or less. I would like to talk briefly about the impairments. We have virtually eliminated our capital spending in the Williston Basin, on domestic gas properties, in the Bahrain and Joslyn oil sands projects, as these have unacceptable returns in the current price environment. As a result of a thorough portfolio review, we have reduced the carrying value of the assets in the areas where we're minimizing development activity.","This resulted in an after tax charge of $5.1 billion. These charges do not affect our cash position. Chris will detail the charges.","Our policy has been and will continue to be to write-down assets to approximately fair market value when we believe that the impairment is other than temporary. In 2015, we will focus our capital spending on the core areas we operate, principally the Permian Basin. Our capital budget is $5.8 billion which is a 33% decline from 2014, 2\/3rds of the capital budget will be allocated to maintenance capital and 1\/3rd allocated to growth capital.","To the start of the several long term projects, notably the Al Hosn gas project and the BridgeTex pipeline, our to 2015 capital program was on course to decline before the recent fall in product prices. Our capital run-rate in the first quarter will be higher than the $5.8 billion level and will decline all year unless product prices significantly improve. Given our large acreage position, deep inventory, we have the flexibility to defer drilling and appraisal activity.","Although we will likely outspend our cash flow during the first half of the year, we expect that by the end of the year our operating cash flow will cover our capital expenditures and dividend payments, assuming a recovery to $60 oil price environment. Willie Chiang will provide more details on our capital program later in the call.","Despite the lower capital program, we expect to deliver 6% to 10% annual production growth in 2015 driven by the startup of the Al Hosn gas project and the focused development program we will run in the Permian resources business. In the United States, we expect oil production to grow about 6% partially offset by declines in NGLs and natural gas production. Vicki Hollub will provide further details on the outlook for the U.S. oil and gas business.","We had a successful year in growing the company's reserve base by adding substantially more reserves than we produced. Company-wide, we replaced 174% of our production before asset sales. We ended the year based on a preliminary estimate with about 2.8 billion BOEs of reserves. Through our organic development program, we replaced 181% of our production. This estimate excludes acquisitions, asset sales and revisions of prior period estimates.","Our reserve replacement ratio for liquids from all categories before asset sales was 223%. This reflects our emphasis on oil drilling. Our total costs incurred related to the reserve additions for the year on a preliminary basis were approximately $8.3 billion. As a result of our organic development program, we estimate an apparent finding cost of under $17 a barrel. Our 2004 acquisitions were approximately $1.6 billion and we booked a conservative amount of proved, developed reserves. We expect to add incremental reserves as we exploit this acreage.","At the end of the year, we estimate that 76% of our total proved reserves were liquids increasing from 71% in 2013. Of the total reserves about 71% were proved, developed reserves compared to 70% in 2013. Over the past several years we have built a large portfolio of growth-oriented assets in the United States. In 2014, we spent a larger proportion of our investment dollars on these resources. Our organic reserve replacement for the year reflects the positive results of the appraisal and development efforts, capitalizing on the large portfolio built over time. In the United States, we replaced 266% of our production before asset sales.","We ended the year based on a preliminary estimate with about 1.8 BOE of reserves. Through our organic development program, we replaced 286% of our production. The estimate excludes acquisitions, asset sales and revisions of prior estimates. Our reserve replacement ratio for liquids from all categories before asset sales was 306%. Our total costs incurred related to domestic reserve additions for the year on a preliminary basis were approximately 5.7 billion. As a result of our organic development program, we estimate an apparent finding and development cost of about $12 a BOE.","Through the success of our drilling program and capital efficiency initiative, we have lowered our finding and development costs over recent years. As a result, we expect our DD&A expense to be approximately $15 a barrel in 2015, a decrease from $17 a barrel in 2014. This is consistent with our expectations and DD&A rate of growth should flatten out as recent investments come online and finding and development costs come down.","The success of our organic reserve additions and the efficiencies we\u2019ve achieved in our operation demonstrate the significant progress we have made in turning the company into a competitive domestic producer. Through the execution of our strategic initiative, we have raised enough cash to exceed our debt at year-end. Slide 14 outlines priorities of our use of cash. This is the same slide we have shown for at least a decade.","After spending on maintenance capital, the top priority for our cash flow is to continue to increase the dividend. We have increased the dividend for 12 consecutive years and are committed to annual increases. Given the uncertainty in product price, decision on the size of the increase will be made on the declaration of third quarter dividend. Our remaining cash flow will be allocated to growth capital, share repurchases and acquisitions.","In 2014, we repurchased $2.5 billion of shares. We have approximately 71 million shares remaining under our current authorization. We will continue to repurchase shares subject to the stock price and market conditions and expect to ultimately repurchase the entire amount. Now, I will turn the call over to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results.","Chris Stavros","Thanks, Steve and good morning everyone. Oxy completed the spin-off of California resources at the end of November. Accordingly, we have reclassified the financial and operational results for discontinued operations for our core results disclosure. As such, our fourth quarter 2014 core income excludes all the California results and income on a reported basis includes two months of California results.","Total year 2014 results on a reported basis include 11 months contribution from the California operations classified as discontinued. We generated core income of $560 million for the fourth quarter 2014 resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.72, a decrease from both the year ago quarter and the third quarter of 2014. The decline in core earnings was attributable mainly to sharply lower realized oil prices on our worldwide production. Net results for the quarter were a loss of $3.4 billion or $4.41 per diluted share.","In accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting which Oxy follows, we review our proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the oil and gas properties may not be adequately recovered, such as when there is a significant drop in the futures price curve. Under the successful efforts method, if an oil and gas property's estimated future net cash flows are not sufficient to recover its carrying amount using the period end's future curve, an impairment charge must be recorded.","As of December 31, Oxy recorded property impairments due to the fall in the futures curve for oil as of that date. The 2014 fourth quarter includes after tax, non-core net charges of $4 billion. Approximately $2.7 billion of this was a result of the sharp decline in the year-end WTI price curve that affected our domestic properties. Most notably this included a charge of $1.7 billion in the Williston Basin, $600 million related to our gas and gas condensate assets and $350 million for other domestic acreage.","Foreign impairments amounted to $1.1 billion principally related to our operations in Bahrain. Additional charges included $700 million for our interest in the Joslyn oil sands project and a $550 million mark-to-market adjustment for the carrying value related to our remaining 19% interest in California resources. The fourth quarter also included after tax gains of $900 million from the sale of a portion of our investment in the Plains All American Pipeline GP and $400 million from the sale of our 50% interest in the BridgeTex pipeline.","We continued our strong domestic oil production growth and achieved a year-over-year quarterly production increase of 19,000 BOE per day or about 11% led by our Permian resources assets. We also purchased 4.8 million shares of our stock during the fourth quarter and ended the period with $7.8 billion of total cash on our balance sheet. In oil and gas, our core after tax earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $368 million, $549 million lower than the third quarter of this year and $731 million lower than last year's fourth quarter.","For the fourth quarter of 2014, total company oil and gas production volumes from continuing operations averaged 616,000 BOE per day, an increase of 21,000 BOE per day in daily production from the third quarter and 41,000 BOE per day from the same period a year ago. This excludes production from the Hugoton and the California assets for all periods disclosed. Our fourth quarter 2014 worldwide realized oil price of $71.58 per barrel fell by $22.68 or 24% compared to the third quarter realizations of $94.26 per barrel.","In the fourth quarter of 2014 after tax core income for our domestic oil and gas operations was $59 million compared with $310 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $391 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. On both a sequential quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, results at our domestic operations were mainly impacted by lower realized oil prices and to a lesser degree, lower NGL prices. Higher oil production had a meaningful positive impact to both earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to both periods.","In the fourth quarter of 2014, we experienced a narrowing of the differentials in the Permian Basin from what we realized in the third quarter of last year. Total domestic oil and gas production averaged 321,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter of 2014, up 6000 BOE per day sequentially and 26,000 BOE on a year-over-year basis. Domestic oil production was 189,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter, an increase of 19,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period with our Permian resources business growing its oil production by 42% to 51,000 barrels per day.","On a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, total domestic oil production growth was 7000 barrels per day. International after tax core income was $355 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, a decline of 43% from the third quarter of last year and 50% lower on a year-over-year basis. The decline for both periods was driven mainly by lower realized oil prices with the sequential quarter-over-quarter period favorably impacted by higher liftings in both Iraq and Columbia.","International oil and gas sales volumes rose by 39,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis. The improvement was largely due to higher volumes in Iraq, resulting from liftings that slipped from prior periods, as well as higher spending levels, higher production volumes in Columbia along with increased volumes in the Middle East resulting from lower prices affecting our production sharing contracts.","Oil and gas cash operating costs were $13.50 per barrel for the total year 2014 compared to $12.56 per barrel for full year 2013 and reclassified to exclude California. The increase in costs reflects increased activity in downhole maintenance and higher cost for purchased injectants. The DD&A rate for full year 2014 was $17 per barrel. Taxes other than on income which are directly related to product prices were $2.45 per barrel for the 12 months of 2014 compared to $2.48 for the same period of 2013.","Fourth quarter exploration expense was $59 million. Chemical fourth quarter 2014 pretax core earnings were $160 million compared with third quarter results of $140 million and $128 million in the year-ago quarter. The sequential improvement primarily reflected lower ethylene and energy costs, partially offset by lower vinyls pricing and a reduction of volumes across most product lines, due to a combination of maintenance outages, holiday shutdowns and customer initiatives to reduce year-end inventories.","Midstream pretax core earnings were $168 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $155 million in the third quarter and $106 million in the same period a year ago. Phibro's domestic trading book was closed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and we expect to wind down the remainder of the business in the current quarter. As such, Phibro's results have been eliminated from all core income periods.","In the 12 months of 2014, we generated $9.4 billion of cash from continuing operations, a decline of approximately $1 billion compared to the year-ago period. Capital expenditures for 2014 were $8.7 billion, net of partner contributions. Last year's capital outlays included $1.1 billion associated with the Al Hosn gas project including $470 million related to the rail and sulfur handling facilities and $285 million for the BridgeTex pipeline. We received proceeds of $4.2 billion from the sale of assets which included fourth quarter proceeds of $1.1 billion from the sale of our investment in BridgeTex, $1.7 billion from the sale of a portion of our investment in Plains All American Pipeline GP, as well as $1.3 billion from the sale of our [inaudible] assets in the first quarter of last year. We spent about $1.7 billion on bolt-on property acquisitions, of which $1.3 billion was spent in the fourth quarter on a single acquisition in the Permian totaling 100,000 net acres and including a modest amount of oil production.","In October, we received cash proceeds of $4.95 billion from the bond offering completed by California resources. IRS rules mandate that the use of these proceeds be restricted to share repurchase, dividend payments or debt retirement. We paid the fourth quarter dividend and repurchased our shares in December using the restricted cash, resulting in a $4 billion balance at December 31.","We received an additional $1.15 billion of cash from California resources concurrent with the spin-off in late November. The use of those proceeds is unrestricted. We returned $4.7 billion of cash to our shareholders by paying $2.2 billion in dividends and repurchasing 25.8 million of our shares for $2.5 billion. Last year's share repurchase activity has the benefit of reducing our current dividend outlays by approximately $75 million. Our cash balance including restricted cash was $7.8 billion at December 31. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 16% at year end.","After excluding the impact of non-core adjustments and discontinued California operations, our 2014 return on equity was 9% and return on capital employed was 8%. The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 39% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 41% for the total year. Focusing on 2015, our capital program this year is expected to be about $5.8 billion, a decrease of 33% from our 2014 spending level of $8.7 billion. Willie Chiang will discuss the specifics of the 2015 capital program in a moment.","Using a $55 WTI and $60 Brent price curve, we expect total company production to be between 630,000 BOE and 650,000 BOE per day in 2015 or an increase of roughly 6% to 10%. Domestically, we expect our oil production for the total year to grow in the 6% range with the increase coming from the Permian resources business. We expect gas volumes to decline modestly as we cease development activities in our gas properties.","In the first quarter, we expect to lose approximately 4000 BOE per day production in our Permian Basin operations due to weather-related shutdowns and freezing conditions that occurred during January. Domestic gas production is expected to decline from the fourth quarter levels resulting in a slight sequential production decline on a BOE basis. We expect our international volumes to increase in the first quarter with the Al Hosn gas project having started up earlier this month.","Volumes from Al Hosn should average roughly 20,000 BOE per day in the first quarter as the facilities ramp up through the first half of the year. Full year 2015 volumes from Al Hosn should average about 50,000 BOE per day with more than 40% of the production coming from NGLs and condensate. Production volumes should also be positively impacted from our production sharing contracts that are sensitive to the decline in oil prices.","Oil and gas DD&A expense is expected to be approximately $15 per BOE this year. Combined depreciation for the midstream and chemical segments should be approximately $675 million. Price changes at current global prices affect our quarterly earnings before income taxes by $32 million for a $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices and $7 million for a $1.00 per barrel change in NGL prices. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices affects quarterly pretax earnings by about $15 million.","These price change sensitivities include the impact of production sharing contract volumes changes on income. Our first quarter 2015 exploration expense is anticipated to be about $30 million pretax. We expect our first quarter 2015 pretax chemical earnings to be about $140 million.","Lower [inaudible] vinyl margins are the primary driver for the sequential decrease in earnings. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our 2015 domestic tax rate to be at 36% and our international tax rates to be about 65%.","I will now turn the call over to Willie Chiang who will provide more detail on our 2015 capital program.","Willie Chiang","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As you now know, our 2015 capital program is expected to be $5.8 billion, a 33% reduction from our 2014 capital program. All business segments will see cuts in capital spending versus the 2014 levels with the exception of chemicals which is in the peak year of spending for the Ingleside ethylene cracker JV project. Despite the lower capital program, we expect to deliver the production growth in 2015, as Steve has said.","Now let me expand on the 2015 program of which 80% is in the oil and gas segment and 10% each is in the chemicals and midstream segments. Domestic oil and gas capital will be about $2.5 billion or 43% of our total capital program, a decline of about $1 billion from 2014 levels. Overall spending levels in the Permian will decline slightly and significant reductions will come from Williston and south Texas which are most impacted by the sharp declines in product prices. Vicki Hollub will provide more details on that later in the call.","International development capital will be about $2 billion or 33% of our total capital program. Spending levels in the Middle East, North Africa MENA region will decline by approximately $1.4 billion mostly from the Al Hosn gas project completion, Qatar and other mature projects. Exploration capital is expected to decrease significantly from the 2014 levels to roughly $150 million.","Our 2014 exploration program was successful in supporting the appraisal and delineation of a strong inventory of drilling locations which is the basis of our development program this year. Chemical segment capital will be about $600 million which includes the Ingleside cracker project that we expect to complete late 2016 and commission in the first quarter of 2017. We expect OxyChem to be free cash flow positive through the construction of this project. U.S. midstream capital will be about $600 million, a decrease of about $150 million from the 2014 levels, driven primarily by the completion of BridgeTex pipeline.","Key projects include the continued development of the Ingleside terminal for both propane and crude export terminaling as well as gas processing infrastructure in support of our key development programs in the Delaware basin. The 2015 capital program I have described ramps down over this year and where we expect to end the year at a balanced free cash flow run-rate which will cover capital, interest and dividend payments at the $60 oil environment. It also allows us to develop profitable production growth and allows us to continue to develop the key strategic projects in our chemicals and midstream segments. I would like to take a few minutes to share with you the status on our reductions of our cost structure.","Clearly, lower oil price environments require lower cost structures to be competitive. Our 2015 plan assumes a very conservative amount of pricing concessions from our suppliers of roughly $250 million for key services. If the market environment remains where it is, we expect to see this increase to $500 million or more which will give us the flexibility to increase activity. We have been very engaged with our suppliers and service providers to capture immediate reductions in costs, ranging from 10% to 40%. In many cases, we have amended existing agreements to tie discounts to oil price. The lower the oil price, the greater the discount needed to meet the market environment. We're in the early stages of this process and have finalized agreements with about half of our key suppliers to date.","Most of the cost savings that we have incorporated are capital costs, but we also expect operating cost reductions from the $15 per BOE domestic operating cost level. Beyond what we normally look at pure lifting costs of the business, there are a number of cost categories that comprise the total operating costs. Some of these categories are fairly consistent year to year and include labor, generally operating support and staff, plan expenses, pipeline transportation costs, surface maintenance.","This activity allows us to produce our product reliably, safely and responsibly. Now, highlighted are a number of categories where we do expect to see significant reductions and are much more discretionary in nature. These include well workovers, well enhancements, downhole maintenance and purchased injectant costs, primarily CO2. Clearly, in a low product price environment many of these activities are just not economic to pursue.","We also expect to see energy cost reductions which are linked to oil and gas prices, so they too will come down in this price environment. This should give more perspective on another key area of opportunity that we're working hard on and we will share more specifics with you as we develop more certainty around market environment and other optimization and efficiency improvements.","I will conclude my remarks by emphasizing that our capital allocation is very dynamic in nature. We will proactively manage our program and we have ample flexibility to respond to both stronger and weaker conditions.","I will turn the call over now to Vicki Hollub, who will review our 2015 domestic oil and gas plans.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you, Willie. Today I will review the highlights of our Permian resources activities in the fourth quarter and then I will provide more details about the 2015 capital programs in our U.S. operations. In the fourth quarter, Permian resources achieved daily production of 84,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which is a 9% increase from the 77,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day that were produced in the third quarter.","With regard to oil, we produced 51,000 barrels of oil per day for the fourth quarter. This is a 42% increase from a year ago and a 19% increase from the previous quarter. During the fourth quarter, our capital expenditures were $791 million. We operated 29 rigs and drilled 85 wells including 56 horizontals. We placed 70 wells on production including 44 horizontals.","At year-end, 11 wells were on flow-back and 61 were not yet completed. In the Delaware basin, we operated 14 horizontal drilling rigs and one vertical drilling rig in the fourth quarter. We drilled 47 wells and placed 39 wells on production. In our Barilla Draw area we placed 7 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A and B benches. These wells achieved an average peak rate of 1500 BOE per day and a 30 day rate of 1,190. We're extremely excited by the results achieved on the Peck state 258 number 6H, where we optimized the landing point and cluster spacing. This well achieved a peak rate of 2400 BOE per day and a 30 day rate of 1760. Additionally, we placed our first two 7500-foot lateral wells, the Buzzard state number 9H and number 10H on production with excellent results. Both were completed in the Wolfcamp A.","The Buzzard state number 9H achieved a peak rate of 2020 BOE per day and a 30 day rate of 1780. We're achieving excellent initial results on our wells with sand concentrations ranging from 1750 to 2250 pounds per foot. For example, our Chevron Mineral 17-5 well achieved a peak rate of 1800 BOE per day. In New Mexico, we continue to be pleased by the performance of our Bone Spring wells. Recently, our Cedar Canyon 27 state 4H was placed online with an average peak rate of 1790 and a 30 day rate of 1030 BOE per day.","In the Midland basin we operated 10 horizontal drilling rigs and four vertical drilling rigs during the fourth quarter. We drilled 38 wells and placed 31 on production. In the Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B benches, we placed 17 horizontal wells online with an average peak rate of 950 BOE per day and a 30 day rate of 790. To-date, we have placed 10 Spraberry wells online with an average peak rate of 900 BOE per day and a 30 day rate of 850.","Last quarter we discussed our South Curtis Ranch 3526H well in the lower Spraberry. We're excited to report the six-month average production for this well was 740 BOE per day. In one of our new development areas, the [inaudible] 1411 well achieved a peak rate of 1560 BOE per day and a 30 day rate of 1,140 from the Wolfcamp A. The aggressive exploration and appraisal programs we completed in 2014 have helped us to clearly identify our best benches and to achieve significant improvements in well productivity and operational efficiency. We will continue to improve these results in 2015.","Now I will provide additional details about our 2015 capital plans at our domestic operations. Our most significant capital reduction will come in our Mid-Continent business unit which includes our Williston operations and our gas properties in the Piceance in south Texas. We plan to spend $285 million in 2015 versus $570 million spent in 2014. The 2015 capital program will focus on maintenance activities along with high return workovers. This fits with our strategy to focus capital on higher margin oil production. In the Permian Basin we have two distinct, but synergistic businesses; resources and enhanced oil recovery.","Our resources business provides the unconventional portfolio and expertise to achieve accelerated growth supported by our EOR business which provides the cash flow from efficient high volume production. In Permian resources our capital expenditures will be approximately $1.7 billion. This is a $200 million reduction from 2014 expenditures. We plan to operate an average of 19 rigs and drill approximately 167 horizontal wells which is equal to the number of horizontal wells we drilled in 2014.","Additionally, we will drill only 48 vertical wells versus the 137 vertical wells drilled in 2014. Vertical wells are drilled to hold acreage or to appraise new benches. Our 2015 capital program will focus on the development of our best benches in concentrated geographic areas. In the Midland basin our development activity will be mainly in South Curtis Ranch and Mirchett [ph].","Here we plan to drill 45 Spraberry wells, where our performance is matching a 750,000 BOE type curve. In the Delaware basin, we plan to drill 67 Wolfcamp A wells and a concentrated number of leases in the greater Barilla Draw area. Our Wolfcamp A wells in the Delaware are exceeding a 900,000 BOE type curve. In New Mexico, we plan to drill 22 Bone Spring wells.","We will execute this targeted capital program utilizing a manufacturing approach which will include the efficiencies of pad drilling, batch drilling of the vertical and lateral selections of the well, along with zipper fracs. This strategy will enable us to grow our production at a higher rate with less capital than in our 2014 appraisal program. In the first quarter of 2015, we plan to operate an average of 29 rigs.","We expect to drill 85 wells and place 108 wells on production including 63 horizontal wells. We're on pace to have 42 wells on flow-back or on production in January. Permian resources has a sufficient inventory of wells to continue profitable development in a low price environment. Based on our current cost structure, we have the ability to continue drilling profitable wells for several years. We're taking the following actions to ensure we can deliver even more locations in this low price environment.","First, we will continue our investment in reservoir characterization and optimization of key variables such as well bore spacing, lateral length, proppant concentration, surfactants, cluster count and spacing. These investments drive resource recovery and are fundamental at any price. Second, we will continue to apply enhanced manufacturing principals to our development program. This will enable us to achieve efficiencies at an accelerated pace.","Third, we will continue our efforts to enhance our base management and maintenance activities. This will ensure optimized production levels while minimizing associated operating costs. Lastly, we continue to aggressively work with our suppliers to improve operating productivity, eliminate constraints and lower costs. These actions are consistent with the long term strategy I have discussed in previous calls.","I'm encouraged by the urgency and actions our employees and contractors have already demonstrated in delivering on these initiatives. I will now discuss our Permian EOR business. While it hasn't drawn much attention in the last couple years with the industry focused on high growth resource programs, our Permian EOR business remains very profitable. Oxy is the leader in Permian basin CO2 flooding with over 30 active floods and 40 years of experience.","This business has weathered prior downturns with resilience and the low decline of these large properties provides a stable base for our production at an advantaged cost. The Permian EOR business has the agility, scale and cost structure to operate in an ultra-low pricing environment. Currently, our total cash costs in Permian EOR is $30 a BOE as shown on the slide. This takes into account the cost reductions that we have already achieved.","If prices stabilize at today's level or continue to decline, all costs that are linked to oil prices would also decline including energy CO2, production taxes and discretionary well maintenance activities. For example, in a $35 per barrel oil price scenario, our total cost would reduce to approximately $22 a BOE. Our DD&A cost is approximately $10 a BOE. We continue to see opportunity for investment in CO2 projects in the current oil price environment.","Last year we drilled 277 infill wells and continued construction of facilities for new CO2 projects. When completed, our new project at South Hobbs will develop 28 million barrels of oil equivalent of reserves at a cost of $10.60 per BOE. The CO2 floods have remained a strong business through technology advancement that improves recovery from our large portfolio of conventional reservoirs. In the Permian, Oxy operates reservoirs that collectively contained approximately 18 billion barrels of original oil in place. Hence, even small improvements in recovery efficiency can add significant reserves.","An example of this has been the recent trend towards vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval into residual oil zones or ROZ targets. Over the last few years, we have had an ongoing program of deepening wells with 109 wells deepened in 2014 and 81 wells planned in 2015.","This activity escapes much attention because we utilize work-over rigs to drill the extra depth into additional CO2 floodable sections of the reservoir. These low cost projects add reserves at development rates ranging from $3 to $7 per BOE. These opportunities exist under many of our CO2 projects and thus far only a fraction of the CO2 flood wells has been deepened. The Permian EOR 2015 capital expenditures will be approximately $500 million to continue expansion of CO2 floods and water floods.","The EOR business is expected to generate free cash flow this year even in the current oil price environment. We will complete construction and begin injection at the new South Hobbs project. Additionally, we'll also start construction of a significant expansion at the successful North Hobbs CO2 flood, where CO2 flooding has added a sustained 5,300 barrels of oil per day to the unit's production since this project began in 2003.","Our EOR business has unrisked gross resource potential of up to 1.9 billion barrels providing us with a vast inventory of future CO2 projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated, depending on market conditions. Our current strategy for this business is to investment sufficient capital to maintain current production thereby providing cash flow to support growth in our Permian resources business. By exploiting natural synergies between our EOR and resources businesses, Oxy is able to deliver unique advantages, efficiencies and expertise across our Permian Basin operations.","In closing, our 2014 exploration and appraisal programs have successfully set us up for a strong 2015 development program in Permian resources. Our portfolio of high quality assets combined with our value-oriented discipline enables us to deliver efficient growth. We will execute a focused development strategy in 2015 and continue to pursue step changes in well productivity and cost structure. Our first quarter production of 2015 will be negatively impacted by approximately 4000 BOE per day due to the winter weather events that occurred in the Permian Basin in January.","But we do expect to deliver our previously stated target of 100,000 BOE per day from Permian resources in 2015. Our combined EOR and resources production is significant and accounts for 15% of the production from the Permian basin. Our development program, along with the synergies delivered by our resources, EOR and midstream businesses have us well-positioned to the meet the challenges of this lower price environment.","Now I'll turn the call back to Chris.","Chris Degner","Thank you, Vicki. Now we will open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","I wonder if I could take two, please. Vicky, this one is profitability for you. I guess just to be absolutely clear in this current oil price environment, not the $55 that you have put in the plan I guess, has the Permian program delivering positive returns? And if you could maybe give some color as to what royalty ownership or what royalty rates you might have in the program for the current year of gas in the Delaware basin.","Vicki Hollub","Yes, Doug, currently our program at today's prices will deliver about 15% to 20% rates of return and the reason for that is, we had an aggressive program, appraisal program in 2014, so we have - we're targeting in 2015 our best benches in our best areas. And we have had really good success recently with improving our completion design. So we expect the returns to be in the 15% to 20% range. And if you will refer back to the chart I included in the presentation in Q3, you will see that if you look at the areas where we're developing, I think I have some numbers there that generally would enable you to get to the net interest.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Maybe just not to belabor the point, Vicki but what kind of inventory in terms of what the current pace, the wells would achieve, the program would achieve that kind of return of $45 oil, is that like high grading the portfolio or is that a multi-year inventory that you believe to achieve there?","Vicki Hollub","We have high graded the portfolio but we expect to be able to at least at this pace go at least 3 to 5 years with the inventory that we have and if prices continue to improve with respect to the cost structure and I don't mean oil prices, oil prices, I mean if our cost structure continues to improve based on prices, we expect that inventory should increase. So we expect over time to be able to increase the inventory that we have today. But at today's pace, it would be about 3 to 5 years.","Doug Leggate","My follow-up is I guess and not a lot of other questions with new operations, but Steve, I wonder if I could go back, just to the progress on the asset sales in the Middle East. Any updates you can provide, especially now that Al Hosn is on-stream and given that the [inaudible] contract expires this year, could you help us with how you see maybe things changing in this oil price environment?","Steve Chazen","Well of course, the countries are saying that the prices will quickly rebound once the evil shale producers stop producing. But I think until that happens, I think it's going to be slow. I mean obviously, the countries are affected by this. I mean they are actually affected more by the decline in oil prices than anybody really. So I suspect that it will be slow. I think Oman will move along all year. We just don't know what is going on in Abu Dhabi at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Steve, talking again back to the CapEx program, it seems that you have used the strip to come up with the 2015 number. I just wondered how much lower would you have to take CapEx if we stay at the smaller $45 environment for let's say another year?","Steve Chazen","Well for another year, it a little more complicated. The capital spending on the chemicals and the midstream stuff will fall out naturally, going into next year. So the capital would come down any anyway. We have only built in the cost savings that have sort of been achieved at this point. And there is at least another 250 million and maybe another $500 million in savings if - just from the suppliers, if prices continue to be low because we basically we provide index how much we're paying to the oil price.","So I don't really know exactly what it would be, but I would guess it would be used - if it's 60, we're covering everything at the end of the year. There is some other stuff that would be reduced and it's probably a little lower than the 60 actually and so if you said okay, it is going to be $10 less, $10 less is a billion dollars. So we would have to reduce the capital by a billion dollars. Most of that we would get from suppliers, but there would be some things that would have to be cut.","Paul Sankey","And then a follow-up would be, have you considered selling Oxy and have you considered any major acquisitions? Thank you.","Steve Chazen","Right now, people are cash flow challenged so I suspect selling Oxy is probably not real likely. But I looked at Chevron, it looks like they don\u2019t have any free cash. So anyway, if you look at - we have 690 major acquisitions. It's way too early to be talking about acquisitions. I think there is still a lot of whistling in the grave yard going on. And way too early to consider any kind of acquisitions. Again, we generally are not interested in public acquisitions.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson","I had a question about divestures as well, there is some commentary in the market about possible divestiture of the Al Hosn project which you guys have just completed and so just wanted to ask you, is that a possibility? Just if you could provide some color on that and again it wasn't your commentary, it was that from others but can you give us an update on the strategic position attractiveness of that position?","Steve Chazen","Well let's talk about what it is. We have already spent the money. So there is not really much capital going forward. There might be an expansion which is really cheap capital out a year or so, but putting that aside in a crappy oil price environment, probably generate about $300 million of free cash and sort of a decent run, about $600 million of free cash a year. So if you multiply it out by the 25 years that remain roughly, you multiply it, you get Sr. between $7.5 billion and it is $12.5 billion of cash generated over the 25 year period. So from our perspective, for a company that pays a lot of dividends and that sort of thing, having that sort of asset makes good sense to us. If on the other hand, for a variety of reasons, somebody wanted to buy 20%, 30% of it, to free up cash, for something that maybe works better, I guess we're open to that. But you know, only in a - if you just look at intrinsically, for somebody who pays a lot of dividends, you know, I think it's a pretty good asset over time.","Doug Terreson","And then also, there is a lot of commentary about Oxy's historical proficiency and recovery so I wanted to see how are you thinking about the opportunity in Mexico, potential opportunity, meaning do you consider this to be kind of an area of natural alignment for Oxy? And if you do, how do you think about the opportunity in Mexico?","Steve Chazen","I mean there's two issues always in foreign activities. One is the quality of the asset being offered. And I think if intrinsically they have some enhanced oil recovery assets on offer. The other part of it what's the financial arrangements. If you look at some of the other places, I won't say where, but look at some of the other places where intrinsically the asset might work at $20 a barrel or something like that, but if you lay the contract over it doesn't really work at today's prices. And I think that\u2019s the issue in Mexico. While the asset may be attractive and you can get a lot of - if you had 100% of it would be something that would work pretty well, but they have taken a pretty aggressive view about the contract terms. I think they took the Chinese menu approach where they pick one from every column and everybody's contract. So I think they got a pretty difficult contract to want to do it and we're not doing it for advertising expense. I think we would rather frankly put the money into the CO2 projects in the United States where we have low royalties and in fact in some cases we owe the royalties than to fool around with some ridiculous contract in hopes it gets better over time.","Operator","Our next question is from Leo Mariani of RBC. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani","Obviously, a lot of focus here in terms of how you guys can kind of conservatively manage things. Wanted to kind of flip the question around and just get a sense, if we do start to see an oil price recovery in the second half of the year, in 2016, kind of how quickly you can bring rigs back in the Permian and then just additionally, is there any kind of loose price framework we should think about, where if we do get to 70 is that the number where you start adding rigs? Anything you can help in terms of price would be great.","Steve Chazen","I think the answer to your question is there's a lot of rigs around in the Permian and there's more available every day. So I don't think bringing rigs back is going to be a problem. I think the program has to be somewhat disciplined and so we will be cautious in adding rigs, because oil prices may rebound, may go back down again. I'm more concerned really about the demand issues in the world than I am how much the U.S. business is producing. But I think if you look at it and said - clearly, if we hit the $60, the program will be the way we\u2019ve described it. As you get to $70 and maybe a little more aggressive and as you get north of $70, I think we would be somewhat more aggressive. But I really think that, if you look at - if you were able to see the layers, inside the company, we've got it all matrix, if we can actually figure what makes sense at whatever price you want and so our program going forward would reflect that expectation, but right now, our expectation is conservative, I would guess.","Leo Mariani","All right. Maybe could you just talk a little bit about the importance of returns on the drilling program, plus kind of versus desire to stay cash flow positive or cash flow neutral when you include dividends. Obviously you focused on getting back to this cash flow neutrality, exiting the year at 60. So as we think about a recovery case in 2016, how much are you focused on making sure you don't outspend versus hey if the returns are good at 70 we're willing to outspend. Can you talk to that?","Steve Chazen","You got to be pretty certain about your returns before you outspend. No offense to any oil engineers, but they tend to be a little more optimistic than the actual outcome. And so the corporate management will be fairly conservative about things. So we need some margin of error. A lot of damage has being done in the business, I think people underestimate the amount of damage being done, when this cycle when this current down cycle is complete whether it's a year or two years, everybody's balance sheet is going to be not quite as good as when they started.","We're starting at a good spot, but I think even the large companies will have more debt-laden balance sheets and not really much to show for it. So I think you just got to be pretty careful in this environment about what you are doing. No one really, even though the price may recover in the back half of the year, I'm still concerned about world demand for oil, although I'm heartened to see that in the United States at least the lower gasoline prices have created more people riding around in big cars. So we're doing all right. We're rides around the corner.","Leo Mariani","And I guess just lastly, in terms of M&A, I just wanted to kind of clarify some of the comments, you certainly talked about sort of a challenging market, you know for acquisitions at this point in time, it sounds like bid\/ask spreads having a reset but they are also here in the prepared comments that you had made an acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2014 of 120,000 acres in the Permian of around for $1.3 billion. Can you give us more color on what you picked up there and what you think about it?","Steve Chazen","It was early in the quarter, probably a little early in the acquisition I think, the acquisition cycle. We got we think a price that works in this environment. It's good acreage. And we picked up a modest amount of production. So the goal of the acquisition program in the Permian is to add to our current position, so we can drill more efficiently and it's not really to get more acreage. We have got plenty of acres. I mean the question really is can we fill in our play, what we currently own and allow us to drill more efficiently without moving the rigs so much. So this sort of acquisition was designed with that intent that we could - that would allow us to be more efficient. Without efficiency gains, I think acquisitions are not very interesting.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","First, just a couple of quick Vicki questions. I noticed that the Delaware basin second spring had been re-rated from appraisal to development from last quarter to this one. Is that the zone that you\u2019re focusing on in New Mexico?","Vicki Hollub","Yes, it is. We're only going to drill second Bone Springs wells in New Mexico in 2015.","Jeffrey Campbell","It sounded like the reduced vertical drilling is tied to less appraisal work. Can you identify which appraisal zones are likely to be most affected by the reduced 2015 CapEx?","Vicki Hollub","It would really be the zones, the benches that are away from our current development areas. So for example we appraised the benches at South Curtis Ranch and several in the Barilla Draw area, so what we're really going to try to do now is focus on the development in those areas. And our appraisal program is so far ahead, we still know a lot about some of our other areas. We just wanted to get to manufacturing mode so that we can improve our cost efficiency. So we're still - we're pretty much way ahead with our appraisal program right now. The thing that we want to do next is to continue to improve on our completion efficiency.","Jeffrey Campbell","And Steve, this is the last question, you have spoken some about concerns on demand. Can you outline where you look for signs of improvement? Particularly as we all can expect that U.S. oil production is going to increase as oil prices begin some kind of recovery?","Steve Chazen","Well, you know, I think if I look at U.S. oil production, it will probably increase in the first and second quarter and maybe the rate of increase in the third quarter will fall off and maybe it will be some decline in the fourth quarter. You know, the main consumer of oil today is China. Any recovery in Europe would be helpful, but it's not a driver and so it's China and maybe India. Also the Middle East has been a large consumer of oil recently and the current environment is - it's just hard to say whether that growth will continue or not. And I think the world economy, I think, that\u2019s the big question mark going forward. If we get demand growth, lower oil prices stimulate demand, this current situation will be over fairly quickly. If we don't, this could drag on quite a while.","Operator","Our next question is from [inaudible] of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","I wanted to ask the question about the importance of operational momentum in the Permian Basin and really where I am coming from here is you are generating very acceptable returns at current prices, but that could potentially be significantly higher rates of return assuming a recovery in the oil price. So given that you are more or less flat on horizontal drilling activity, what stops you from let's say having the rig count in the first half of the year and then moving up to a much higher count in the back half of the year?","Steve Chazen","It's basically the contractual position we have. We have contracted for some rigs that basically come off at mid-year. And by the time you drill - I mean think about the timing. Let's say you actually drill a well in the first quarter. It's the third quarter before it actually produces, you know, you actually get the revenue, so the stuff in the first quarter will basically be a third and fourth quarter production for us. But I think we have some contracts that need to roll off and that's really controlling the timing more than anything right now.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So there is nothing related to utilization of the work force and efficiencies that could be elastic, but if you did have a shutdown or anything of it--","Steve Chazen","It's always inefficient - if just always stop in the middle it's always going to be a problem. It's got to be a phase-down, but it's contractual and a notion that may be there will be some recovery in the back half of the year and you need to drill the wells sort in this first and second quarter to have production in the back half of the year. We're pretty cautious about the whole thing. You just can't send things to zero, it's just an impractical thing to do right now. We're doing the best we can to manage through it and I think we will be all right.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And if I could ask one more, completely unrelated topic, you mentioned that the restricted cash was used to pay the dividend in the 4Q, should we think in a low price environment restricted cash essentially funding the dividend and how does that affect then the pace of share repurchases? You said that the 71 million, you still ultimately expect to buy in on the share repurchase program, but would that be a five-year period or are you thinking more like a two-year period?","Steve Chazen","We will start with - I wouldn't get wrapped around the axle on this restricted cash stuff. Cash is reasonably fungible and all we\u2019re doing is showing you the account paying down. It's not really - rather than keep more restricted, we just say the dividend comes out of that bank account. So it has to come from somewhere. We don't really know about the pace. We're price sensitive. You know, I point out that really the domestic program last year had an F&D, if you cut through all of the BS of $13, $14 and we expect to bring that down some more. So we're running a pretty profitable program. Maybe not at $25 oil but certainly in the 50s.","So as far as the pace of the share repurchase, the stocks are volatile and when there is negative volatility, I guess volatility is always used negatively, but nobody ever talks about upside volatility, but down side volatility which I'm sure will come at some point in this, that's almost a step up and buy a lot of shares rather than just treat it as a constant flow. So I don't really know. We set aside a fair amount of money for that this year, but if prices are more attractive, we will spend more. I don't really have a budget in the usual sense of the word.","Unidentified Analyst","And would you want to comment on what you would find an attractive price to?","Steve Chazen","No I wouldn't want to.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, I figured that. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","I wanted to follow up on a couple of the earlier questions. First, you mentioned that you would have flexibility to increase activity if you can get another $250 million in savings. Can you just talk more to what that scenario looks like? Would that mean your portfolio would achieve attractive returns at $60 Brent and you would ramp back up in the areas that you are currently ramping down, i.e., you would recommit to MidCon or would you just ultimately look to focus more on the incrementally--","Steve Chazen","It would be all Permian. The MidCon is, well, putting aside South Dakota, is basically gas. So the Brent price is sort of irrelevant. And it really can't compete for dollars for quite a while against the Permian. North Dakota has this huge differential to price right now. So that's really what's discouraging us up there. So I think you should plan that in the $60 environment or $65 environment, whatever you are thinking that we would spend more in the Permian. The savings, $250 million, we could add about 3 rigs on an annual basis to cover that. So it was running about 100 million a year or so, it would probably run a little less now. So that is a way to think about how much more we would do. But we got a fair inventory and as prices move up, the inventory obviously expands.","Brian Singer","And then back to the Permian acquisition in looking at that 100,000 acre deal you mentioned the strength was the efficiency that it has with existing positions. Based on the placement of your existing acreage within the Permian can you just talk to the scope for how many more fill-in acres would be optimal for you with your acreage positions and whether you see those opportunities becoming available?","Steve Chazen","We don't know about opportunities because some people may have debt and they probably don't want to sell it for less than their debt. We just don't have any way of pacing that at this point. We don't really know. If we found more in the Barilla Draw, that would be really interesting and there is acreage around there that\u2019s held by others. And some a little bit in the Midland basin, but that is what we have. I don't know whether it's 300,000 acres or 200,000, it's not millions of acres.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Maybe a couple more follow-up questions on the Permian. Can talk a little bit what you're seeing from a well performance point of view in 2015 and 2016 production targets [inaudible] despite CapEx cuts, is this the efficiency gains? Better well performance? Combination of both?","Vicki Hollub","It is. We haven't changed our 2016 target yet, because we're still anticipating that. If prices were to go up, we would have the flexibility to add rigs. We may have to adjust that a little bit toward the end of this year if prices remain where they are, but one of the things we're encouraged is we certainly are seeing better performance particularly in the Barilla Draw area and particularly with the last well that I mentioned in the call today. We're seeing not only opportunities to improve our landing point within the benches but our completion efficiencies are improving and so we're really encouraged with what we're seeing there and what we're see from the Spraberry in the Midland basin.","Ryan Todd","And then maybe on cost at this point, the 2015 budget, your approval budget costs in the Permian in 2015, what is it relative to 2014 costs and is it that mostly efficiency gains or do you have anything for price deflation or is that additional upside?","Chris Stavros","We priced about 250 million for cost reductions that we pretty much achieved. And we expect to get some more, but we certainly do price that in already and efficiency gains are built in. Efficiency gains really come from focusing on a few places rather than going all over creation. That's really what causes it and we built that in.","Ryan Todd","So I guess in additional $250 million that you had highlighted on the slide, there is certainly potential down side from a price deflation point of view but efficiency gains at least mark-to-market from where you guys are right now, I guess.","Chris Stavros","I guess that's right.","Operator","Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio","A few quick follow-ups for me. First on the buyback I presume most of the buyback in 4Q was executed after or in December after the spin?","Steve Chazen","Yes.","Evan Calio","And the second, I know that you're price sensitive and\/or I would say price aware, so do you see the flexibility to use your currency for adding assets, if your view it were to be expensive relative?","Steve Chazen","We have never - I think I used stock once in the last 20 years and regretted it ever since. So maybe I have been doing this too long. So too good of a memory about bad outcomes. If you are going to use your stock, you really have to make sure that whatever you are doing is significantly accretive. Cash, at least cash, you are you only paying 3% or whatever it is interest, but if you're using stock, we're paying almost 4% in dividends by putting even putting that aside, we don't want to dilute the quality of your portfolio with some whacky deal. And so if you are going to gamble on wackiness, you probably ought to gamble with cash rather than stock.","Evan Calio","So maybe a follow-up on the Permian acquisition that you made in the quarter, any color in terms of location, well inventory--","Steve Chazen","It's a Midland basin acquisition. And there is a - I mean just a matter of price. When you talk about locations, you also got to factor in price. I think going in, I thought it was about 2700 locations.","Evan Calio","Okay. And will you expect activity there in 2015 or will that be part of your focus area?","Steve Chazen","Yes, we do.","Evan Calio","Is that due to economics or because it is non-HBP?","Steve Chazen","It is economics principally. There is some non-HBP. We will probably use a vertical rig there to keep some of the acreage.","Operator","Our last question is from Matt Portillo of TPH. Please go ahead.","Matt Portillo","Just a quick follow-up question in regards to your Permian rig count and spending program. I believe you mentioned you're running roughly 29 rigs coming into the first quarter. Was curious if you could give us a little bit of color on the cadence of kind of that rig drop as you move through the year, to average the 19 rigs in 2015? And then I have a follow-up question with regards to your overall capital program.","Vicki Hollub","Currently, we're going to average also 29 rigs in Q1 and then toward the end of Q1, we start to ramp down and by Q3, the beginning of Q3 we will be at 15 rigs. And at 15 through the rest of the year.","Matt Portillo","And then in regards to your corporate capital program, you mentioned the first quarter will be a bit heavier in terms of CapEx versus the--","Steve Chazen","You can see that in the rig count. It just flows out of the rig count.","Matt Portillo","Right. And I guess just to maybe try to get a little bit of color around how we should think about the magnitude of the change on cap ex, is there any color you can provide as we think about kind of the exit capital program you have talked about in the fourth quarter of 2015, how you would kind of think about the magnitude of the change over the year?","Willie Chiang","I would say directionally, we're starting off at about a 1.8 billion in Q1 and ramping down to about a 1.2 billion rough numbers.","Operator","This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Stavros for any closing remarks.","Chris Degner","Thank you, Emily and thanks everyone for participating today. Bye.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"16324":["Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Alvarez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jeff Alvarez - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental Petroleum's third quarter 2018 conference call. On the call with us today are: Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Cedric Burgher, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ken Dillon, President, International Oil and Gas Operations; and B.J. Hebert, President of OxyChem. In just a moment, I will turn the call over to Vicki Hollub.","As a reminder, today's conference call contains certain projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements, as more fully described in our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on slide 2.","Our earnings press release, the Investor Relations supplemental schedules and our non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations, and the conference call presentation slides can be downloaded off our website at www.oxy.com.","I'll now turn the call over to Vicki. Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.","Today I'd like to begin by highlighting the results we've achieved over the last 12 months, during which our focus on value growth and our high-quality assets delivered a cash return on capital employed of 26%. Combined with a double-digit return on capital employed over the same period, we have clearly demonstrated our ability to deliver industry-leading returns and have aligned our executive compensation to this principle.","Our integrated business model provides us with numerous opportunities in which to invest and grow free cash flow in a sustainable manner well into the future. We remain disciplined and will continue to allocate capital to investments that generate the highest returns for our shareholders. This approach enabled us to deliver $3.3 billion of cash to shareholders over the last year through a combination of our dividend and share repurchases while also growing production by 14%.","This morning, Cedric will walk you through our financial results and updated guidance. Jeff will detail the sustainable and value-creating improvements we continue to create in the Permian. And prior to leading our Investor Relations, I just wanted to let you know that Jeff served as President and General Manager for two of our Resources business units, Texas Delaware and Midland Basin. He also has significant prior experience in our Enhanced Oil Recovery businesses. After Jeff, Ken will provide an update on operations and opportunities in our international businesses.","Before covering our third quarter highlights, I would like to mention an organizational update and congratulate Jeff Bennett and Barbara Bergesen. They have recently taken on heightened roles within our Domestic Oil and Gas business. Jeff is leading our three Permian business units in the Midland Basin, Texas Delaware, and Southeast New Mexico. And Barb is leading our Permian Enhanced Oil Recovery business.","I'd also like to congratulate Richard Jackson in his new role, which includes leading our new Low Carbon Ventures team along with our Permian competitor analysis, land, and regulatory teams. The Low Carbon Ventures team will work across all of our businesses. These changes will enable us to focus more intensely on the Permian and to develop unique corporate strategies that address the key challenges facing our industry.","As noted on slide 5, we delivered an exceptional quarter both financially and operationally. Our operating cash flow of $2.6 billion exceeded capital and dividends by $700 million. And during the third quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders. Our earnings per share of $1.77 is the highest quarterly EPS we have achieved since the second quarter of 2014, when the average WTI oil price was over $100. All of our business segments exceeded key performance targets through production growth in the most profitable areas, lower unit cost, and better price realizations.","In Permian Resources, we brought our best well to date online in the Greater Sand Dunes area. And in Barilla Draw, we brought online the best Texas Permian well to date for the industry. These achievements were made possible through the investments we've made in our people and the advances they have achieved in subsurface modeling and characterization.","In Oman, we have three new blocks that will provide us long-term, short-cycle, lower-decline growth opportunities. Ken will provide additional information on these later in the presentation.","Our Chemicals segment produced another record quarter of earnings as a result of our integrated business model, which allows us to take full advantage of favorable market conditions. Our Midstream and Marketing business continues to deliver high realizations from our advantaged Permian takeaway position. And as expected, we closed on the previously announced $2.6 billion Midstream transactions.","Our priority continues to be the allocation of free cash flow towards investments that generate the highest returns, along with returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. This includes investing in high-return assets across our integrated businesses. With the additional three blocks in Oman and new opportunities in Colombia, we now have an even larger inventory of short-cycle high-return long-term growth options in our Oil & Gas business.","OXY approaches each opportunity we consider with a disciplined focus on returns. Every project must create value for our shareholders, period. This is one of our core principles. Our priority now is to replace the cash flow from ISND [Idd El-Sharghi North Dome], and we're confident we'll do so in 2020, both from our ongoing development program and reallocation of capital from the North Dome. We will invest in our highest-return projects, with Permian Resources serving as a returns benchmark.","Slide 6 shows the depth of opportunities across our portfolio from which we grow our high-return cash flow. Our integrated business provides domestic and international, conventional and unconventional opportunities from which to grow value from our oil and gas production. And our Chemicals segment also has opportunities to grow cash flow. As we communicated our plan for 2019, we'll provide further details of our capital allocation.","Looking past next year, we will continue to focus on our highest-return opportunities and expect to increase cash flow to between $9 billion and $9.5 billion by 2022, as shown on slide 7. This level of cash flow is achievable through investments in short-cycle high-return projects and is sustainable with an annual capital investment of $5 billion to $5.3 billion in a $60 price environment. We will deliver higher rates of production growth in 2018 and 2019 to replace the cash flow from ISND in 2020 and to return to higher dividend growth, but our long-term production growth target remains at 5% to 8%-plus.","Before I turn the call over to Cedric, I want to talk about what discipline means to OXY. We have honored our commitment to shareholders by returning capital and will continue to do so. We're one of only a few companies in our sector that did not cut our dividend in the downturn or dilute our shareholders. We continue to increase our dividend and plan to return to more meaningful growth in the future, which is one of the key reasons we're investing in our highest-return assets, so that we can increase cash flow and return more cash flow to shareholders.","As shown on slide 8, we have increased our dividend each year since 2002 and repurchased a significant number of shares in a higher oil price environment. Also, since 2006, we have returned a total of $31 billion, or over half of our current market cap, to shareholders. Returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and share repurchases is not new to us and will continue to be a key part of the value we provide.","I'll now hand the call over to Cedric.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Vicki.","As Vicki highlighted, we are pleased to have continued repurchasing shares, allowing us to return $1.5 billion of cash to shareholders during the quarter. On slide 10, I'd like to start with our earnings, which improved across all segments, with our third quarter reported earnings per share at $2.44 and core EPS at $1.77 per diluted share. The main difference between reported and core income is the gain on sale of our non-core domestic Midstream assets, which resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $700 million. Improvements in the Oil & Gas segment income were mainly attributed to higher Permian Resources production and Middle East oil sales volumes. Third quarter realized oil prices were approximately flat compared to the second quarter.","Total reported production for the third quarter was 681,000 BOEs a day, coming in above the midpoint of our guidance. This was driven by strong execution and well productivity in Permian Resources, which came in at the top end of the guidance range at 225,000 BOEs per day, representing a year-over-year increase of over 60%.","Total international production came in at 297,000 BOEs a day, which is at the midpoint of our guidance. The increase in international production from the second quarter reflected the first full quarter following the successful debottlenecking and expansion of capacity at Al Hosn.","The Chemicals segment had another quarter of record earnings. Chemical pre-tax income for the third quarter was $321 million, which came in above guidance of $315 million. Compared to the second quarter of 2018 earnings of $317 million, third quarter earnings were relatively flat, as vinyl margins came under pressure from higher ethylene costs, resulting in increased ethane costs. Export caustic soda demand helped offset the decline in vinyl margins.","Midstream core earnings of $796 million reflected improved marketing margins due to an increase in the Midland to MEH differential from $7.86 to $16.67 quarter over quarter and exceeded the high end of our guidance due to the marketed market improvements, stronger gas processing results driven by higher NGL prices, and one-off items from the Midstream transaction that closed in the quarter.","Third quarter revenue and cost of sales were both grossed up by $327 million due to the accounting related to certain Midstream contracts where we've used our excess takeaway capacity by purchasing and reselling third-party barrels. The second quarter gross-up amount was $85 million.","Operating cash flow before working capital improved to nearly $2.6 billion, as all of our segments continued to outperform cash flow expectations, representing year-on-year growth of 136%.","We spent $1.3 billion in capital during the quarter, and our total year capital budget remains at $5 billion. Starting in 2019, we will begin to redeploy approximately $200 million of capital per year that would have been invested in Qatar.","Slide 11 details our updated guidance, which we have narrowed for the full year. We expect total production for 2018 to be 655,000 to 659,000 BOEs per day and Permian Resources production to be 211,000 to 213,000 BOEs per day. The midpoint of this range equates to an exit-to-exit Permian Resources production growth rate of 54% from Q4 2017 to Q4 2018. We have also narrowed our international production guidance range to 286,000 to 287,000 BOEs per day and assuming a $75 per barrel Brent pricing for the remainder of the year.","In Midstream, we expect the fourth quarter to generate pre-tax income between $450 million and $550 million, assuming a Midland-to-MEH spread of $13 to $15.","In our Chemical business, we anticipate fourth quarter pre-tax earnings of $220 million and are raising the full-year guidance to $1.155 billion based on the strong results delivered year to date.","To close, we are very pleased with our performance so far this year, including the continuation and expansion of our share repurchase program. As we have shown, our focus is on returns, and our Permian operations set a very high bar for our company and, frankly, for the industry.","We have a pipeline of projects across our integrated business that meet our hurdle rates and that have long-term potential. We continue to have the discipline to hold to these principles and occasionally take tough decisions. We believe this is what it takes to lead with respect to capital stewardship. We have aligned compensation in this regard, and we continue to demonstrate our long-time commitment to returns-driven reinvestment, a robust dividend, and share repurchases.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Alvarez - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Cedric.","Our Permian teams have delivered another great quarter by continuing to find innovative ways to improve and increase the value of our assets, and I'm excited to share these results with you today.","Production for the quarter was outstanding, with Permian Resources exceeding the midpoint of production guidance by 5,000 BOEs per day. Continued improvements in well results along with great execution of our operational plan is resulting in high-value production growth. Permian Resources production guidance has now increased by 10,000 BOEs per day from the initial guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. These high-margin barrels have generated additional cash and added significant value to the returns of the underlying assets.","Looking at our highlights on slide 13, we continued investments in the appraisal program to delineate our acreage and optimize development plans. In Greater Barilla Draw, we integrated the results of our Hoban appraisal efforts into our field development plans and expect to be more active in this bench in 2019.","We also drilled two Avalon appraisal wells in Greater Sand Dunes that each averaged approximately 2,700 BOEs per day over 30 days. Our appraisal program continues to provide us confidence that Permian Resources will generate returns and sustainable cash flow growth for many years to come.","As Vicki mentioned earlier, the third quarter was another record-breaking quarter for well results in both of our core development areas. We brought online our best Permian Basin well ever. The Corral Fly 21H in Greater Sand Dunes peaked at over 8,900 BOEs per day, with an average over 6,700 BOEs per day for 30 days.","We also broke the industry record for the best well in the Texas Permian Basin with a Greater Barilla Draw well, the Peck 11H, which peaked at over 6,500 BOEs per day and averaged 4,900 BOEs per day over 30 days, a 30% increase over the prior record well for this area that we shared with you last quarter.","These repeatable record-breaking results are a testament to our subsurface capability, value-based development approach, and leading acreage position. While we are excited about these results and the associated returns, we believe there is still more to come as we continue to progress our subsurface characterization work and apply innovative technologies to our development plans.","In addition to the productivity improvements, we lowered our field operating cost in Permian Resources to an all-time low of $7.03 per BOE in the quarter and expect to exit the year at less than $6 per BOE.","Returns in Permian EOR are also improving. We continue to demonstrate our unique ability to maximize recovery of the reservoir by capturing oil that would otherwise not be recoverable. As the largest EOR operator in the Permian, we continue to implement new CO2 expansions across our portfolio. We initiated initial development of the residual oil zone at the Seminole-San Andres unit, which is providing encouraging results that will further enhance the returns from this asset. Our expertise and position in enhanced oil recovery differentiates OXY. We plan to leverage this core capability to generate enhanced returns in many areas of our business.","I'll close on slide 14 by summarizing our returns-focused investment approach and the resulting production growth. While the industry has been confronted with many challenges in the Permian this year, our Permian Resources business is delivering its best year ever due to our returns-focused approach. We have delivered 52% of the top Permian wells over the last 12 months, while only drilling less than 5% of the total Permian wells over that time period.","Our Midstream business is providing flow assurance and exposure to the best pricing through our marketing arrangements, and we are protecting our development program from inflation and execution disruptions through our maintenance and logistics hub. Our inventory continues to improve as we advance and execute our development strategy, which provides us with sustainable high-return investment options for the future. We expect Permian Resources to grow at over 35% next year, which is an outcome of our disciplined approach and the high-return investments that our assets provide.","I will now turn the call over to Ken to discuss International.","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.","Let me start by saying how honored we are today to be able to announce three new blocks in Oman, which I will discuss in more detail in a minute. Overall, we had an excellent quarter from a financial and operational standpoint with world-class HES performance. Our International Upstream business is on target to realize $1.4 billion of free cash flow for 2018. In the third quarter, we produced 297,000 BOE per day. We expect this high level of performance to continue as we deliver strong return projects for OXY and our partners.","The plan we outlined for 2018 is progressing well. Our innovative debottlenecking at Al Hosn has increased production by 11% to a peak rate of 83,000 BOE per day net. This is one example of how we create value and enhanced returns for our existing assets, as we executed the debottlenecking for only $10 million.","The TECA Steamflood project was sanctioned this month with our partner Ecopetrol. We will begin ramping up production in 2020 and reach a gross rate of 30,000 BOE per day in 2025. We are starting to identify additional areas of high potential in the field, which we can develop at attractive returns for both parties. With our disciplined approach to major projects, the TECA Steamflood exceeds our hurdle rate with a breakeven price under $40 WTI. This is just one example of how our assets in Colombia will continue to generate long-term cash flow growth.","Internationally, our step-out drilling programs are on track to add approximately 20 million barrels of resources this year at low finding costs. This is in addition to the 50 million barrels of resources added last year. Overall, since 2014, using OXY drilling dynamics and working with our suppliers, we have improved our drilling performance by 17% and reduced costs by 30%.","Moving now to Oman, we as the Cities Service drilled the very first exploration wells in Oman in 1955 and made the first discovery in 1957. In 2017 we produced our 1 billionth barrel of oil in Oman, with two-thirds of that production coming in the last 10 years. We're excited today to announce three new blocks in Oman, which will more than double our land position to approximately 6 million acres and fit perfectly with our expertise in generating returns from water flood and EOR development.","As you can see from the maps on slide 18 (sic) [17], in Northern Oman our acreage will stretch over 225 contiguous miles, allowing us to leverage existing infrastructure as we explore, appraise, and develop Blocks 65 and 51. Block 72 greatly expands our acreage position in central Oman, where we see opportunities to expand upon the success of our Mukhaizna development next door.","In our existing blocks, as shown on slide 19 (sic) [18], with the use of OXY subsurface reservoir characterization workflows, we've helped redefine the stratigraphy. This has enabled us over a short period of time to move from five productive horizons to 17 producing and appraisal horizons. We will apply the same disciplined approach to the new blocks.","We will shift 3D seismic and invest in targeted appraisal programs. Capital for next year will be modest as we acquire data and optimize future development profiles. These blocks have significant potential, especially when combined with our excellent Omani staff, exceptional partners, and inspirational leadership in the country. We expect our proven track record of value-based development and rapid time to market to continue.","In closing, I'd like to say that our regional subsurface experience is now being fully leveraged. We believe that in the long term when combined with our approach to operational excellence and value creation, it will bring future potential opportunities.","I will now turn the call back to Vicki. Thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Ken.","Before we move to the Q&A, I'd like to reiterate OXY's sustainable value proposition, through which we'll continue to deliver industry-leading returns. Our integrated business model enables us to take advantage of opportunities across the value chain and generate high returns in the Permian and internationally, while benefiting from the stable cash flows generated from our Midstream and Chemicals segments.","We will continue to invest in our human capital and empower our employees with the culture and facilities, innovation and excellence. This is what their exceptional performance has enabled us to accomplish over the last couple of years. We've more than exceeded our targets, in addition to delivering the best wells in the Permian, our experience in operating wells beyond the initial development and through their entire life cycle, including enhanced recovery, that's second to none.","Our Low Carbon Ventures business is making advances toward capturing and sequestering anthropogenic CO2, which will reduce carbon emissions while enhancing the economic development of our reserves. OXY is uniquely positioned to realize cost efficiencies, not only in developing and operating wells, but also through our capability to deliver our products to market at maximized realized prices. We remain committed to developing our resources in a sustainable manner while spending within cash flow.","Last quarter we achieved our breakeven plan, meaning we will be cash flow neutral and pay our dividend at $40 WTI. And at $50 WTI, we can pay our dividend and grow production by 5% to 8%-plus. This plan remains in place. Our relentless focus remains on allocating free cash flow to investments with the highest returns across our integrated business and returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. Since resuming our share repurchases program this year, we will have returned over $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases by the end of 2019.","Lastly, across our businesses, we continue to focus on creating long-term value through industry-leading technical work, life cycle planning, and operations focused on maximizing margins.","We'll now open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, everybody. Excuse me, I wasn't expecting to be first. I apologize. Guys, I've got two questions, if I may. My first one is actually on the Middle East. Obviously, I understand the comment about reallocating capital from Shah \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 from Qatar, but my question is really around Shah Al Hosn. About a year or so ago, the government had talked about a project pre-FEED for something like a 50% expansion of that development. I understand you've done the debottlenecking project, but the secondary piece of that appears to have gone somewhat quiet. And I'm just wondering if you can give us an update as to where that stands, please?","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Good morning, Doug. It's Ken. We've successfully debottlenecked the plant. We continue to look for ways to tweak the plant overall. But at the moment, there are no full-scale debottlenecking plans in the near future. We will continue to work all different aspects of the project, but at the moment there's no commitment.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We're really happy with being able to expand it from 1 BCF to 1.3 BCF a day with only a $10 million investment. So with that accomplishment, that put the other project a bit on hold.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, I understand. Thank you for that. My follow-up is if I could turn it back to the Permian, and I don't know who wants to take this one. But with Jeff moving to take over I guess the other regions, it begs the question what assumptions lie behind your 35% in fact longer-term growth profile. And to be clear, what I'm asking is Red Tank is obviously in a much, I guess, more over-pressured area. The transition of some of the things you've done in Eddy and Lea going over to Midland and I guess Southern Reeves, what does all this mean for the assumptions that were embedded in your growth? Are you using 2018 productivity? Are you using data productivity? I'm just trying to understand what the well trajectory looks like that's embedded in your forecast? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Jeff Alvarez - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Doug, this is Jeff. I think when you look to next year, we've built in some of our recent performance. Definitely the improvement in performance we've seen in New Mexico starting in 2017 into 2018, we've built that in. We've talked about before, where we tend to be a little conservative is just additional improvements that are going to come in the future. We definitely expect to see additional improvements across our development areas. You can see that through not just New Mexico but what we've done in Greater Barilla Draw and beyond that.","So the teams continue to work the subsurface methodology, which is the foundation of all the improvements we're making, so we expect those improvements to continue. But when you look at next year and the 35-plus percent growth that we've given out, we have built in many of those improvements that we're currently aware of. Where we are a little conservative is the things we just haven't figured out but we expect to when we get to that point.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just to be clear, is that trajectory on a flat rig count, or is there a rig count trajectory you can give us that goes along with that 2022 outlook?","Jeff Alvarez - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","It's a flat rig count.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great stuff. Thanks so much, everybody.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning. Can you talk more to the specific drivers of getting Permian Resources operating cash cost down below $6 per BOE in the fourth quarter from slightly above $7 in the third quarter, especially as that would be an acceleration in cost reduction relative to what we saw in Q3 versus Q2?","Jeff Alvarez - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Brian, this is Jeff, and I appreciate the question. So the big drivers of that, there are two components. Obviously, cost per BOE, there's the cost side. And so if you look at the details, you can see things like our downhole maintenance, the things we're doing from an artificial lift standpoint to finding effective artificial lift systems for very high-rate horizontal wells. We're seeing our downhole maintenance cost come down because we're getting much better at finding the right lift systems. And then when things do fail, which they do from artificial lift, getting them fixed cheaper and faster. So that's one area.","If you look at what we're doing on the water recycling side, the chemicals side, getting trucks off the road, infrastructure in place, so all the things that we do from our initial developments to where we start planning, how do we need to operate these fields, start to translate into the cost side.","The second part of that component is obviously the barrels. We're making a lot more barrels. We're making a lot more lower-cost barrels. So when you look at the cost per BOE of these new barrels we're bringing on, the high-rate unconventional barrels, they're much lower than the legacy barrels, so that helps drive that cost down as well. And Vicki mentioned it, but that's one area we're very excited about. As the unconventional business matures, that's one area where we think based on what we've done in our EOR business and the core capabilities we've built, we'll be able to use that and further differentiate ourselves when it comes to getting margin, by not just good development cost but excellent operating cost, and I think this is a testament to that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. And then my follow-up is with regards to the allocation of free cash flow. You've highlighted the case for free cash flow well in excess of dividends out to 2022. And when you think about the needs for allocation, what if any is needed to advance the portfolio, either from new projects or via M&A versus what you see as returnable to shareholders?","And then tangentially, Cedric mentioned $200 million that would have been invested in Qatar is going to be redeployed. Can you just talk more to where that's going, or maybe that was the point that you were making with regards to Colombia and Oman?","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Brian, this is Cedric. A whole lot there in the question, but it's a good question. It's at the heart of what we're trying to do, which is to allocate capital to the very, very best places. As you know, we have a long history of a fairly diverse approach, which we are continuing today between dividends, buybacks, and reinvestment. M&A also is something that has certainly been a part of OXY's DNA and continues, and we look at opportunities there.","So our organic plan is very strong, and that's really what we've touched on here so far on the call. But we've got lots of opportunities, and Ken touched on it. Internationally, you see what we're doing with EOR and our Low Carbon Ventures. And of course, the Permian is fantastic and even getting better each quarter.","But that's how we're going to approach it. It's consistent with what we've been doing. But we'll just continue to look for the very best places to put the money and make those decisions as we go each year. We do look forward to growing the dividend at a faster rate and buying more shares, but it will be opportunistic in those cases.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","And I'll just add to that. We've shown before that up to $50 we can actually grow 5% to 8%. So when we lean from $50 to $60, we have the opportunity to continue to either grow or use funds to buy back shares or to increase our dividend. And over time, the reason for the accelerated growth, what some consider accelerated growth, early is to try to put ourselves in a position with respect to cash flow that we can grow the dividend more meaningfully.","But I will say that the international projects that we've just picked up in Oman are very good. The seismic analysis and the interpretation is showing good prospects. That's why Ken showed the stratigraph of the horizons that we had to choose from. This is stacked pay and it's quality stacked pay.","So I'm really excited in that Oman provides us so many more opportunities now. And I feel a lot better today than I've ever felt about where we are with respect to the organic growth prospects and the ability to grow the cash flow. That's why we wanted to provide you the numbers for 2022. We're very confident in being able to achieve that with the assets that we have and hopefully continue to advance technology to improve upon that. But it's certain that we have \u2013 I think we're in a better position today than we've ever been. I'm excited about it. It's certainly taken a lot of pressure really off of our ability to continue to fund and develop and even improve projects within our portfolio.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Good morning, everyone. Vicki, you provided an illustration here of the company at $60 through 2022. It feels like you're planning at $50, and this is an upside illustration of the kind of cash flows you'd generate. In that regard, I was wondering. The dividend growth in the past you've talked about in line with production growth, I think. Can you illustrate or indicate to us what kind of dividend growth you'd be aspiring to? Do I assume that you would grow the dividend assuming $50 and do the rest as buyback? Thanks.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","The way we're trying to model this, and it's a little bit difficult to explain, but this $40 cash neutrality is really the point that we want to maintain into the future. What that means is as we continue to grow our cash flow, our cash flow neutrality price actually will go down. As it goes down, we intend to grow the dividend accordingly so that we maintain the $40 cash flow neutrality. So that's what we're trying to come back to.","That's why our model really shows that above $60 that providing cash back to the shareholders through buybacks is an option that for us will continue to be a part of our proposition. We don't want to increase the dividend so significantly that we put ourselves way above that cash flow neutrality, so we're targeting to keep that in place over time. And growing the cash flow to what we proposed in 2022 will enable us to grow the dividend more meaningfully than we've done in the past few years.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Yes, so if we would triangulate that, would we be looking for something around a 5% dividend increase annually at a $50 assumption?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Potentially. But again, it depends on the cash flow. When you model that out and you see what your free cash flow is from that model, that free cash flow is something that we would be able to sustain beyond 2022, so that would be what we would then allocate to dividend growth over that time period.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Got it. And can you just remind us? It's a separate subject with my final question. On risks such as we saw with Qatar in the past quarter, which I understand you couldn't pre-warn about insofar as you were still in negotiation, can you just highlight anything else that is in that realm of a potential shift that could happen over the period through 2022 in terms of PSCs and other contracts? Thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","No, we don't have anything that would be expiring in terms of PSCs. Everything else we have is long term. The nearest term one that we would have would be ISSD, which is South Dome in Qatar. That expires in 2022, but that's very low production and that's really not even material to us. But everything else we're in good shape about.","That's why I made the comment I really feel good about where we are. Qatar was ISND. We worked hard to get that and to extend that. But we're actually \u2013 this has turned into a win-win for us in that we've been able now to pick up in Oman those three projects, which are onshore, lower cost, and they're right next to the bolt-ons, so they're right next to what we know we have in the blocks that we have today. And with what we see on the seismic, we feel really good about that potential. So we went from a mature asset and higher cost to lower cost new field development, but near infrastructure. So, we're in a really good situation today.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Great, thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leo Mariani of National Alliance Securities. Please go ahead.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Hi, guys. I wanted to explore a little bit further on Oman here. Obviously, you guys had some interesting prepared remarks on it. You certainly talked about some enhanced recoveries and some EOR opportunities. But I'm just trying to get a high-level sense here. Is there already production on some of these blocks? Are there some maybe lower-producing mature fields, or is this more of a rank exploration play in certain areas? Maybe you can just try to better characterize this a little bit just to get a sense of the risk profile of the opportunity here.","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Hi, Leo. It's Ken. If you look at the blocks individually, Block 65 is very close to our Block 27, so we see that as step-out wells for formations that we're used to dealing with. If you look at Block 72, it's beside Block 53 with the giant Mukhaizna field. We're also seeing recent discoveries with our step-out wells in Block 53 with a Buah trend running north. There are also blocks in the north, further north in Block 72 that have a Buah trend running south.","The 2D seismic lines that we've seen over Block 72 look really, really appealing, and we've got the areas divided into clusters running north. Cluster 1, we plan on drilling a well late this year, and we'll start 3D seismic as quickly as possible, so we can get a crew next year. Low dollars in terms of capital, but we see really, really high potential in these blocks.","And then if you look at the stratigraphy, we've done some recent seismic work in one of our existing blocks, where it looked like we saw something, so we put some pails very cheaply on development wells, a few hundred thousand dollars, and we've now got a 1,000 barrel a day well producing in a zone that has not been produced in Oman before. The question is how do we calibrate that, and does it run everywhere? And what we've got there is essentially a zone that's got 25 penetrations in an area the size of the Delaware Basin.","So we see real opportunities with our step-out program, and we see real opportunities because of the proximity to existing facilities. We can get stuff on really, really quickly. And great familiarity with our Omani staff there, and our partners are really committed to these projects too. So we see holistically huge opportunities here for us.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","All right, that's very helpful color. Just switching gears a little bit to the Permian Basin, a bit of a high-level characterization I was looking for here. But I guess you guys just continue to make better and better wells here in the Permian. It's just very impressive results again here this quarter, more record wells. I'm just trying to get a sense. You certainly mentioned that there could be further improvements down the road. Where do you guys think you sit if I was to use a baseball analogy? Is this the fourth or fifth inning? Are we more towards the later innings of improvement? I was just trying to get a high-level perspective.","Jeff Alvarez - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Hey, Leo. This is Jeff. That's a good question and one we continually ask ourselves, especially the leaders of these businesses, because we always think these great results, they've got to stop at some point. But the thing I'll take you back to, you almost have to go back. Vicki initiated this transformation probably four years ago. So if you look at where we've come over the last four years, it's truly amazing. Inside the company, we really saw us turn the corner a couple years ago, but then now I think over the last couple quarters you're seeing that more externally.","And the thing I'd tell you is while the foundation is built in subsurface technical excellence, which was always the primary building block for what we're doing, there are many other elements that allow us to take subsurface technical excellence and turn that into economic value and sustainable returns: things like the long-term development planning, what we've done with Aventine; things like data analytics, which we're finding new improvements every day; things like developing the culture and the human capital to really be successful in a business like this. We continue to see improvements in all those areas.","So the ability to predict when do those improvements stop is very difficult, but we definitely don't think that's anytime in the near future. And what makes us feel so strongly about that is all you have to do is go to the people actually doing this work, and you see the improvements that they see that they want to go capture that they haven't been able to capture yet, and those continue to happen at a very rapid pace.","So I think the improvements may happen in different areas. I doubt we'll be talking about a record well in Sand Dunes every quarter. You'll start to see where that may plateau, and the improvements maybe come in a different area of New Mexico or a different area of Barilla Draw or the Midland Basin, wherever that is, or it may come on well costs instead of productivity. But they'll all be returns and value-driven. So I think when you look at it from a returns and value creation standpoint, the improvements are going to happen for a very long period of time.","And then Vicki mentioned after initial development EOR operating capability, all that. I think the improvements will shift to that. But they'll all be centered around how do we create more value, how do we get higher returns, and I don't think they're going to stop anytime in the near future.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I'd just like to add to that that during the downturn, another thing that we didn't do that others did is we didn't lay off employees. We took that opportunity to engage and empower our employees and let some of our team work on things that were longer-term so that we could start to impact our cost structure and with the subsurface, our characterization, and dramatically change how we view our subsurface now.","But the credit for this all goes to our employees. We've empowered them to do the things that they need to do, take risks, do things differently, try some things that we haven't tried before, but most importantly when they felt the need, to do what they needed to do from a technical expertise standpoint to not only develop themselves and use the incredible mentors that we have internally but also to go external and to get the data that we need.","On top of all this too is our really aggressive data analytics team that by working directly with the business units, the business units guide them through the questions and the problems that they need to solve, and the analytics group gets with them and works on those issues. And so it's a combination of a lot of things. But most importantly, it's the collaboration of our people to drive toward success, not just solving a problem that's not meaningful but driving toward the things that really improve the value of our portfolio and the production and value that we can deliver.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","All right, thanks a lot for the color.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, just one for me. One of the investor concerns about the story is the rising proportion of high decline rate production in your mix, one-third this past quarter, probably reaching 40% next year. Can you just address how high that proportion can get in your mind and still keep the dividend be sustainable?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We were managing both the growth of the dividend with what we know that we can deliver or think we can deliver over time with the assets that we have. But that's what's so valuable about our Colombia and our Oman and our Abu Dhabi assets is that they are essentially very low decline. Or when they are higher decline, there's the opportunity \u2013 these are conventional reservoirs mostly, so there's the opportunity for enhanced oil recovery. Some of is just going to be waterflooding. Others will be maybe perhaps either miscible gas or more specifically CO2.","But these opportunities \u2013 and again, this gets back to why I'm saying I'm so comfortable and happy with where we are today. This is the part that I was referring to when I said it's taken some of the stress off the business for the growth potential. These three blocks along with what we have to develop on the existing blocks based on what we see with the seismic, these will deliver the conventional component of our growth going forward that's critically important to help us manage our base decline.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. Yes, go ahead.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I just wanted to add to that. A part of what's going to help the Permian Basin too with respect to the decline there is in our Resources business. We have performed multiple tests and pilots on CO2 injection into the shale, and that is technically successful. We're working now on establishing what that would look like from a full field development. So we do believe that that along with gas injection are two opportunities for us to offset decline going forward in the Resources business on a larger scale.","Part of what will support that is our Low Carbon Ventures team, which is out looking for opportunities and actually have one in hand already, one where we're currently injecting anthropogenic CO2 but another that will come online. And this team will give us opportunities to take CO2 that is captured from industry, bring it to the Permian, and use not just in our conventional reservoirs but in our shale play as well. So that will work. That's another way that we can continue to lower our decline.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I appreciate the color, thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first question is just around the guidance for 2022. How do you think about the amount of lost CFO between now and then from Qatar and Midstream and from Chemicals?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","This is why we put the plan in place, because really now Qatar was a headwind, but we design our programs and our plans knowing that we're going to have cycles with respect to differentials in the Permian, we're going to have variations in caustic soda prices, variations in sulfur prices. So we plan around that, and we generally plan to be pretty conservative with those things that cycle up and down. So the program that we've put forth for 2022 we feel that certainly we can achieve that at $60 and with conservative assumptions on pricing.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, so I guess I was trying to run some numbers on this. Qatar you said there's $200 million of CapEx and you said it's $300 million of free cash flow, so I just assume that's about $500 million CFO. And with your Midstream sensitivities, it seemed like there's maybe $1.3 billion going from the 2018 differential down to the $3 differential in your assumptions. So I was calculating it might be approaching $2 billion of CFO backfill between that and chemicals to get you back to a normalized place, and then the CFO growth on top of that.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","No, we're assuming the differential will be $3 starting in 2020 to 2022. The differential for next year we assume to be essentially what it averaged this year.","But with respect to the replacement of the cash flow, what's important for us is the cash flow not only from operations but the cash flow pre-capital and post-capital. The reality is that had we proceeded with the ISND, the capital would have gone up, the take would have gone down. So in our models, we didn't have to replace that. So there was not going to be for us what we saw going forward as big a gap as you're calculating. So essentially, though, the replacement of that comes from the growth in Resources and the international growth. And again, conservative assumptions for Marketing and also Midstream and Chemicals.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. If I can just follow up on some of the prior questions, if you put it all together where the growth is coming from between now and 2022, embedded in your cash flow guidance, are you assuming basically all of the growth will come from the Permian, or should we be thinking that there will be with the blocks in Oman, et cetera, that there will be some international or other growth in the portfolio?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","What we can say is that for Resources, you could assume that over the four-year period, there would be about a 25% CAGR plus or minus a couple percent. So that would be what would come from Resources. And then assume that the rest of the production growth would come from a combination of enhanced oil recovery in the Permian plus Oman and Colombia opportunities.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Morris of Citi. Please go ahead.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you, a question for either I guess Vicki or Jeff. As you look at the Permian Basin, your growth forecast for next year assumes that the rig counts being flat basically on what it is currently and assumes about $60 WTI. This year you started out the year with a $50 WTI assumption with a higher cash flow, were able to land a few rigs versus what was the original plan to accelerate growth in 2019. And you're already looking at double-digit growth in 2019 now for the total company. But if oil prices end up being much higher than your assumption of $60 per barrel WTI, would you again look to perhaps add rigs later in the year to accelerate into 2020, or are you pretty dead-set on keeping the rig count flat through 2019 and dialing back that 5% to 8% growth then in 2020?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We're going to be dead flat with respect to our rigs in 2019 because we're going to stay within the $5 billion to $5.3 billion cash flow. We're putting together our capital plan now. We'll roll that out in the next quarter, so we'll provide you more information on it. But from what we're seeing right now, unless the board directs something else, we would go with the same rig count into 2019 that we have today.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, so even with a lot higher oil prices, that incremental cash is definitely going to go to dividend increases or share buybacks and not to accelerating activity in 2019?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","In 2019, our capital is set for $5 billion to $5.3 billion.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Vicki, on Oman, I know it's early days. Can you give us some idea? Did it work out as you expected? How big is the program that they can support?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I'll go ahead and let Ken take that. I think that Ken has modeled out some opportunities for growth, which really depends on what we find from the extension of our appraisal program. I think our capability is going to well exceed what will fit within our capital budgets, but I'm sure Ken is going to lobby for more. Ken, do you want to address that?","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think that's a fair assessment. As you can see from one of the slides, we showed a number of wells in the inventory that is fairly substantial. Drilling Cluster 1 as soon as possible in Block 72 will open up that area very quickly. It's very close to our existing block; same with Block 65, close to Block 27. So I think we have to compete with Permian Resources, and I feel we've got the inventory to do so. So as Vicki said, we'll be coming along knocking on our door trying to drive the performance there.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Ken, I think you guys mentioned that you're going to acquire more 3D seismic next year, so spending on the program will be pretty slow next year. So what kind of timeline \u2013 or is there any \u2013 maybe the benchmark that we can use or milestone we can use on how that progress?","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think if you look at it that we have some existing 2D seismic over most of the areas, which we'll quickly reprocess. We also have some overlapping 3D seismic that other operators have shot in the area. So we're able to access those particularly around Cluster 1. Frankly, next year is appraisal, reprocessing, seismic, obtaining new 3D seismic, moderate to low drilling next year, and then the following year being in a position where we can expand the drilling program if we can obtain some capital. So a thoughtful disciplined approach, we want to add value to what are returns not only for us but for our partners and for the government also.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So do you think that by the end of next year that you will have a much better idea on how big is the program that you could support from a resource standpoint?","Kenneth Dillon - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Absolutely, absolutely.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And that in terms of the Permian, Vicki or Jeff, have you guys ever provided, say, by 2025, if we're going to maintain the same rig program as it is today, what kind of production that we may be talking about?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We know we have the capability to continue to grow the Resources business at pretty much the same CAGR we would see between now and 2022. Whether or not we do that really depends on the other international projects and opportunities. So I can tell you we have the capability, but whether that's what we're going to do would depend on what we see at that time.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And will you be trying to maintain that, say, $5 billion to $5.5 billion over the next several years in terms of CapEx, or that will also be subject to change?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Our CapEx between now and 2022 we expect to be between $5 billion and $5.3 billion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","That of course assumes a $60 or better environment or call it $60. As we've said many times, prices are very volatile. And if it falls, we intend to keep our spending and our dividend within cash flow, and we can take that all the way down to $40 oil. And if that happens, the growth will moderate. But we intend to be disciplined to spending within cash flow.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I understand. But I guess a lot of people are asking that if the prices end up staying substantially above the say $60 range, does that mean that you guys will also be looking at the opportunity to survey the growth, or Vicki already said that 2019 program is pretty dead set. So how about beyond 2019, if the commodity price environment is better, does that mean that you're going to spend more than the $5.3 billion, or that you're still going to stick to that program?","Cedric W. Burgher - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We've given a broad outline of how we would see things in a $60 environment further out. I think it's too early to speculate on wildly different price environments. I would say, certainly, like you've seen us already, in a price environment above $60, and we weren't that far above it this last quarter, we would certainly look to complement our spending with a much more substantial buyback program. But to go with a lot greater definition, I think it's just too early to do that today.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","In the interest of time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vicki Hollub for any closing remarks.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I just want to say thank you all for your questions today.

Chris, please go ahead.","Chris Stavros","Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. Beginning with this quarter, the disclosure and discussion related to our oil and gas segment results will be both on a before and after tax basis. With the oil and gas results also segregated between our domestic and international producing operations and exploration program.","Oxy generated core income of $1.4 billion resulting in the alluded earnings per share of $1.79 for the second quarter of 2014, an improvement of both the year ago quarter and the first quarter of 2014.","For the fourth consecutive quarter, we continued our strong domestic oil production growth with increases coming from both our Permian and California assets. Domestic oil production for the second quarter of 2014 was 278,000 barrels per day, a new quarterly record for Oxy.","Excluding the effect of the Hugoton asset sale, domestic oil production increased 21,000 barrels per day from the year ago quarter, with our Permian resources business growing it\u2019s oil production by 21%. On a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, the growth was 8,000 barrels per day or about 3%.","Oil and gas core after tax earnings for the second quarter 2014 were $1.2 billion essentially flat with both the first quarter of this and the second quarter of last year. In the second quarter of 2014, after tax core income for domestic business was $679 million.","On a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, results at our domestic operations were roughly unchanged as improvement from higher oil volumes and realized prices were offset by lower prices for natural gas and NGLs and higher operating expenses, mainly it\u2019s a result of increased down-hole maintenance and surface operation costs.","International after tax core income was $576 million for the second quarter of 2014 and results improved about 4% sequentially due to a lifting in Libya which had none in the first quarter and also increased sales volumes in both Oman and Yemen.","On a year-over-year basis, domestic operations improved by $44 million after tax and international operations declined by $65 million as our Latin American result were meaningfully impacted by insurgent activity in Colombia.","For the six months, year-over-year comparison, domestic operations, after tax income was $1.4 billion, an increase of almost 13%. In the same six-month period, international operations core income was $1.1 billion, a decline of 4%.","For the second quarter of this year, total company production volumes excluding the Hugoton production averaged 736,000 BOE per day, an increase of 9,000 BOE in daily production from the first quarter and down 17,000 BOE from the quarter a year ago.","Excluding Hugoton, domestic daily production improved 8,000 BOEs from the first quarter this year, with half of the increase coming from the Permian and the remainder from the Williston Basin in California.","On a commodity specific basis, our domestic oil production grew by 8,000 barrels per day, with 3,000 barrels per day each coming from the Permian and mid-Continent and the remainder from California. Domestic NGL and natural gas production volumes were virtually flat for the quarter.","International production increased by 1,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis. MENA production grew 11,000 BOE per day sequentially primarily due to the scheduled first quarter plant turnaround at Dolphin, higher production in Oman due to new wells coming online in the Northern blocks and in Iraq, which reflected increased cost recovery barrels. These increases were offset by 10,000 barrels per day of lower production Colombia did to pipeline disruptions from insurgent activity.","Our second quarter 2014 worldwide realized oil prices of $100.38 per barrels improved slightly compared to the first quarter realizations of $99 a barrel.","Our domestic oil price realizations were about 2% higher on a sequential basis despite continued widening differentials the Permian Basin. Realized prices for domestic for NGL and natural gas production fell at 6% and 7% sequentially reflecting declines in benchmark prices.","Price changes at current global prices affect our quarterly earnings before income taxes by $37 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $7 million for $1 per barrel change in NGL prices, a swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices that\u2019s quarterly pre-tax earnings by $25 million. These prices change sensitivities include the impact of production sharing contract volume changes on our income.","Our oil and gas cash operating costs were $14.68 per barrel in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $14.33 per barrel in the first quarter. Domestic operating expenses were higher in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter of this year due to higher downhaul maintenance and surface operation costs primarily in the Permian Basin.","MENA production costs increased in the second quarter due to higher costs related to the Libya lifting, partially offset by lower surface operations and maintenance costs.","Taxes other than on income which are directly related to product prices were $2.83 per barrel for the second quarter of 2014 and $2.88 for the first six months of this year. And our second quarter exploration expense was $54 million.","In Chemicals, our second quarter 2014 pre-tax earnings of $133 million were slightly lower than the first quarter results of $136 million and $144 million in the year ago quarter. The seasonal up-tick in demand in construction and agriculture markets in the second quarter were more than offset by routine planned plant outages and unplanned customer outages. We expect our third quarter pre-tax earnings to be about $150 million reflecting anticipated increases in sales and production volumes.","In Midstream, pre-tax segment earnings were $219 million for the second quarter of this year compared to $170 million in the first quarter of this year, and $48 million in the second quarter of last year. The 2014 sequential quarterly improvement in earnings resulted mainly from higher marketing and trading performance driven by commodity price movements during the period and higher income from the Dolphin pipeline which was negatively impacted by plant turnarounds in the first quarter of this year.","For the six months of 2014, we generated $5.7 billion of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital. Working capital changes decreased our cash flow from operations by $100 million to $5.6 billion.","During the first six months of 2014, cash flow from operations declined approximately $650 million compared to the same period a year ago. The first half of 2014 included a tax payment related to the gain on the sale of the PAGP units in the first six months of 2013 included a collection of a tax receivable.","On a normalized basis, cash flow from operations during both periods would have been similar at roughly $5.8 billion.","Capital expenditures for the first six months of 2014 were $4.7 billion net of partner contributions. In the second quarter we received proceeds of $1.3 billion from the sale of our Hugoton assets that\u2019s been about $240 million towards domestic Bolton acquisitions.","After paying dividends of $1.1 billion, buying back $1.6 billion of our company stock and other net flows, our cash balance was $2.4 billion at June 30. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 13% at the end of the quarter.","Our 2014 annualized return on equity was 13% and return on capital employed was around 11%. The worldwide effective tax rate on core income was 40% for the second quarter of 2014 and we expect to combine worldwide tax rate in the third quarter to remain about the same.","Lastly, I\u2019ll outline some guidance for the third quarter. In the domestic business, on April 30, we closed on the sale of our Hugoton assets. The Hugoton operations produced 18,000 BOE per day in the first quarter and 6,000 BOE per day in the second quarter. For the third quarter, excluding Hugoton, we expect our domestic oil production to grow 6,000 and 8,000 barrels per day sequentially, roughly 10% on an annualized basis. We would expect this domestic oil production growth rate to accelerate over time.","Domestic NGL productions should see a modest increase, although this should be somewhat offset or equally offset by lower natural gas production volumes. We expect our total domestic production to grow between 5,000 to 7,000 BOE per day.","For the international business, the current prices and assuming normalized operations in Colombia, we expect total international production in sales volumes to increase by about 10,000 BOE per day from the second quarter levels.","Excluding the Hugoton, total company-wide production in the third quarter is expected to increase by 15,000 to 17,000 BOE per day sequentially for an annualized rate of about 8%. We expect third quarter 2014 exploration expense to be about $100 million pre-tax.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen, who will provide an update on some of our strategic initiatives.","Steve Chazen","Thank you, Chris. We recently announced new executive management teams and responsibilities for both the California Resources Corporation or CRC and Occidental Petroleum. Todd Stevens, the President and CEO of CRC and Bill Albright, Executive Chairman bring proven leadership abilities and both have played an important part in building and managing our California operations.","Mark Smith, the former CFO of Ultra Petroleum was hired as Chief Financial Officer at CRC and brings an extensive background in corporate finance and deep understanding of operations, had an independent oil and gas producer.","With these appointments, most of the key roles in the organization have been filled. And we\u2019re confident that their ability to succeed as a standalone public company.","In addition to the developments regarding personnel, we continue to make progress in the plant spin-off of the California Company. During the second quarter we filed the initial Form 10 registration statement and have already responded to the comments received in the SEC.","CRC has initiated steps to secure its debt financing which we expect to be completed in the third quarter. We anticipate $6 billion of proceeds from total funded debt. The cash proceeds from CRC\u2019s debt financing will transfer to Occidental, it\u2019s a tax free dividend and shortly prior to completion of the spin-off, which we expected to occur in the fourth quarter.","On the spin-off of CRC, Occidental will retain ownership of approximately 19.9% of CRC for a period lasting up to 18 months. During that period, we intend to conduct an offer to exchange the CRC shares we retained for Occidental shares.","The California business continues to perform well and its executing on its oil and gas production growth strategy. The second quarter of 2014 oil production grew 10% compared to the second quarter of last year and the business generated approximately $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations during the first six months of 2014.","We expect the CRC management team to present a more detailed view of the business and its growth strategy to investors as it commences its road show in the fourth quarter.","At Occidental Petroleum, each of the seven members, the new executive team have made significant contributions to the company. Their individual strengths and combined leadership will shape the future of Oxy as we embark on a new chapter in the company\u2019s history.","Following the execution of CRC spin-off Oxy\u2019s philosophy of disciplined capital allocation and living within its cash flow continue. Oxy\u2019s core businesses and we focused on delivering moderate volume growth, generating higher earnings and cash flow per share and leading to improved financial returns.","And for completion of the strategic initiatives, we laid out last fall our area focus will consist of a significant and leading position in the Permian Basin. Our Permian resources unit will represent the key area of oil growth within our domestic business with annual production growth expected to easily exceed 20% per year over the next several years as we accelerate our horizontal drilling program.","We also expect margins in the Permian to improve as we focus on additional drilling efficiencies, losing our well cost and further enhancing our oil price realizations. Vicki Hollub will provide a further update on the Permian resources business shortly.","Our Permian Basin operation with Barilla Draw with other domestic oil and gas operations in South Texas, are 24.5% interest in Dolphin project and a smaller and improved business in the rest of Middle East North America, our operations in Colombia as well as our Midstream operations in the Chemical business.","Each of these businesses identified opportunities to drive earnings and cash flow growth also supported our ability to grow our dividends for our shareholders. Operations with our profitable growth will see minimal capital spending or will be disposed of.","After several years of significant capital investment two significant projects are nearing their completion. As Willie Chiang will describe more details shortly, we expect to BridgeTex\u2019s pipeline to start-up later this quarter, provide with an advantaged access to the Gulf Coast for our Permian crude oil production.","We also expect start-up of the Al Hosn Gas Project in the fourth quarter. Assuming similar product prices these two key projects combined with growing oil volumes in the Permian resources development program should provide us with a meaningful earnings and cash flow per share growth in the 2015.","Finally, as a part of our strategic initiatives, we\u2019ll continue to focus on raising cash from our lower growth and lower margin assets.","In the Middle East we continue to make progress and negotiations with our partners, we will reduce our exposure to the region. Our goal here is to improve the businesses\u2019 ability to grow profitably. Over time we expect to achieve a similar balance in our asset mix with at least 60% of our oil and gas production coming from the United States. We\u2019re continuing to explore strategic alternatives for assets and the Piceance in Williston Basin.","We expect to monetize our remaining interest in general partner Plains all American which is valued at approximately $4.5 billion as well as possibly some other mid-stream assets when market conditions warrant.","Since the end of the third quarter of 2013, we have repurchased more than 26 million shares of the company stock of roughly $2.5 billion and approximately 20.5 million shares remain available under the current share repurchase authorization.","We expect that we\u2019ll be able to further reduce our share count by roughly 60 million shares for the cash dividend from the CRC separation and about 25 million shares to monetization of our remaining interest in the Plains pipeline. Coupled with 20.5 million shares in our current repurchase program, we should be able to reduce our total share count by more than 100 million shares or about 13% of the current outstanding shares.","Most of this share repurchase-ability will occur after the spin-off of CRC. These amounts do not include the ability to repurchase additional shares through proceeds we\u2019re seeing from the sale, a portion of our interest in the Middle East, share reductions in exchange of our remaining interest in CRC or the monetization of other assets.","We expect Oxy\u2019s remaining businesses deliver moderate volume growth result the expanded Permian resource development program and shift towards horizontal drilling to start-up the Al-Hosn gas project and our participation of several other attractive international growth projects.","These identified an intermediate growth opportunities and projects capable of more than replacing the production from the spin-off of CRC by the end of 2015. And Oxy shareholders will still retain the value created from the spin-off as owners of CRC shares.","We expect to generate higher financial returns going forward as a result of our investment strategic initiatives. Our improved capital efficiency and operating cost structure, start-up of operations for BridgeTex\u2019s, the Al-Hosn gas projects along the separation of our California business provide a natural up-lift to our return on capital employed. Return on capital employed was 12.2% in 2013 we expect it to rise to around 15% as we exit 2015.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Vicki Hollub, for an update on our activities in Permian Resources.","Vicki Hollub","Thank you, Steve. This morning I\u2019d like to continue the discussion of our Permian Resources business. In the second quarter, Permian Resources produced an average of 72,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is an increase of over 7% from last year this is 28% on an annualized basis.","We produced 40,000 barrels of oil per day for the second quarter, this is a 21% increase from a year ago and an 8% increase from last quarter. During the second quarter, our capital expenditures were $490 million we averaged 24 operated rigs of which 17 were horizontal. We drilled 87 wells including 42 horizontals.","Year-to-date we have drilled a total 67 horizontal wells of which 43 have been completed and put on production. 38 wells are currently waiting on completion or a hook-up. In the third quarter we planned to drill 54 horizontal wells and place an additional 54 wells on production.","I\u2019ll first discuss how our Permian Resources teams are well positioned to deliver long-term growth and then I\u2019ll review the quarterly operations in more detail. We\u2019ve been operating in the Permian Basin for more than 30 years and have considerable knowledge of the depositional history of geology.","With that base knowledge we have been and are continuing to make significant investments to assess the rock and fluid properties in our own conventional reservoirs across our acreage. This is helping us to develop a better understanding of the key geologic parameters that drive productivity, such as porosity, saturation, brittleness, total organic content, mineral and geochemical composition, rock and fluid compatibility, fracture distribution and stress regimes.","Our Permian resources and exploitation teams are applying this appraisal work to construct calibrated Petro-physical models to characterize perspective benches and target landing zones within each bench.","As a result of our work today, we have now identified over 7,000 drilling locations across our 2 million net perspective acres. This is an increase more than 2,500 since the beginning of this year. We expect to continue to grow the number of locations through our successful exploitation efforts.","We\u2019re also conducting an extensive appraisal of high-potential benches to optimize our well designs and development plans. This appraisal work includes collection and analysis of hole cores, cuttings, advanced log sweeps, micro-size mixed surveys and 3D-siesmic surveys.","We\u2019re leveraging our learnings from our participation in more than 450 outside operated wells along with data from some of the existing 4,400 outside operated wells in which we have a working interest.","Based on our findings, we\u2019re testing various still development and well design alternatives including optimization of well spacing, lateral length and cluster spacing. Additionally we have also increased profit concentrations and are evaluating various frac fluids.","Our results are exceeding expectations indicating that we are quickly moving toward optimal design for the Wolfcamp A and B benches in the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin.","For example, at South Curtis Ranch in the Midland Basin, we completed and put on production six wells which had average initial rates of 850 BOE per day versus prior initial rates of 750.","Our recent South Curtis Ranch 2818 well achieved a peak rate of approximately 1,100 BOE per day on gas lift. At Barilla Draw in the Delaware Basin, our recent Eagle State 28-5 well achieved peak production of 1,620 BOE per day and a 30-day average production of 1,120 BOE per day, significantly higher than our average 30-day production of 830 of prior wells in the Wolfcamp A and B benches.","With respect to supply services and logistics, we have secured key resources to efficiently accelerate full field development and product growth. We have ordered long lead-time equipment and figured favorable material and service contracts by leveraging our position across our Permian resources and EOR businesses.","These contracts ensure the availability of productive resources at competitive cost in strategic areas such as drilling rigs, simulation, tubing, casing, cementing, directional drilling and artificial lift.","We have contracts or options in place to expand our fit for purpose drilling rig fleet to 54 rigs in 2016. We have expanded our completion capacity to four 24-hour frac crews and plan to further expand the fleet as we accelerate development.","On the efficiency front, we intensified our efforts to improve operational execution and compressed cycle time. In early 2014, we implemented a batch drilling program to accelerate and improve the cycle time on our horizontal wells.","In our batch drilling program, we do all the vertical section of the well with a smaller fit for purpose drilling rig. And following the vertical section, we use a higher capacity directional drilling rig with specialized services to complete the more complex curve in lateral sections of the well.","This approach has allowed Permian Resources to transition our existing lower cost vertical rigs into our horizontal development programs to improve our overall cost structure. This method enhances the utilization of specialized services to achieve reliability and improved cost. We have reduced drilling cost in South Curtis Ranch by 24% since the end of last year.","Now, for a quick update of our water management strategy. The Barilla Draw system has been pressured up and is operational. Today we have completed six fracs including one zipper frac using this new system. We\u2019re achieving a cost savings of $2.50 per barrel of water.","In the Midland Basin, we are duplicating this effort by installing a water distribution system at West Merchant with delivery rates up to 90,000 barrels per day. The system will be fully operational by September and we expect similar cost savings from this investment. These two systems are the first phases of our comprehensive water management strategy which we will discuss in more detail in future calls.","I would now like to share a few more details of our activity in each of our geographic areas. In the Texas Delaware, specifically in the Barilla Draw and Reeves County, I\u2019m pleased to report that in the second quarter we drilled 10 horizontal wells and completed 7 wells with initial production rate for the Wolfcamp A and B, match the 1,150 BOE per day achieved in the first quarter.","In the area highlighted on the map where we held over 35,000 net surface acres, we\u2019ll drill an additional 27 horizontal wells in the second half of 2014. We continue to increase efficiency and expect our average well cost of $8.5 million to improve an additional 5% by the end of this year.","We are encouraged by our success in this appraisal program. As a result, we are transitioning into an accelerated development phase in Barilla Draw.","In the Midland Basin, where we held approximately 90,000 net surface acres, we\u2019re continuing our appraisal and development drilling efforts. We drilled 14 horizontal wells in the second quarter and placed 21 horizontal wells on production. We will drill an additional 55 horizontal wells in the second half of 2014.","Our average drill time for the horizontals is 27 days per well with total drilling and completion cost averaging $7 million per well. With the knowledge gained, we are transitioning from appraisal to accelerated development in our Merchant field.","As a result of the strong performance this year, we\u2019re increasing our 2014 production growth expectations to be between 15% and 18% from the previous 13% to 15%. In addition, we are increasing Permian Resources\u2019 capital by $200 million to $1.9 billion. The total number of wells drilled will remain roughly the same with a greater percentage of horizontal wells. The result in production increase from the incremental capital will primarily impact 2015.","In closing, our 2014 program is designed to delineate and appraise our acreage in order to maximize both ultimate recovery and financial returns. We\u2019re on track to exceed expectations in 2014, and we have the required resources and infrastructure in place to meet our 2016 production target of more than 120,000 BOE per day.","In addition, Oxy has several exciting Midstream projects related to our Permian infrastructure and takeaway capacities that is a unique competitive advantage.","I will now turn the call over to Willie to discuss in more detail.","Willie Chiang","Thanks, Vicki. Good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to give you a very quick overview of our Midstream and marketing segment and describe how it literally connects our oil and gas production to market. And then spend the majority of my time to share our strategies to support Permian Basin growth that you just heard about from Vicki.","We strongly believe in having multiple perspectives in house, those of a large Permian producer, a significant Midstream infrastructure operator and a crude NGL and gas marketer gives us a very unique advantage that differentiates us from others.","The Midstream operations, not only enables us to unlock and preserve value for our core business, it also allows us to utilize our assets to move third party volumes to market.","Further we have the scale to drive key strategies in the Permian Basin. First, let me provide a quick overview of our Midstream marketing segment. The role of the Midstream group is to maximize realized value for Oxy production by ensuring access to markets, optimizing existing assets and building out key assets across the value chain.","This is increasingly important with the U.S. moving to an abundance of resource and a significant shifting of global supply and demand.","Our Oxy owned domestic Midstream assets are shown in slide 33, these are supplemented with contracted capacity on third party assets, all of which allows to market substantially all of Oxy\u2019s domestic oil, NGLs and gas production, comprise of roughly 470 BOE per day, 278,000 barrels a day of crude, 72,000 barrels a day of NGL and over 700 million cubic feet a day of gas.","We also market third party crude and NGL volumes focusing on parties whose supply is located near our transportation and storage assets. These third party volumes are significant and add an excess of 200,000 barrels a day for third party, crude and NGL volumes.","This aggregation of volume, both service a need for producers and end-users and allows us to better utilize and optimize our assets. We also have gas processing plants to CO2 fields and facilities. We process equity and third party domestic wet gas to extract NGLs and other gas byproducts including CO2 and deliver dry gas to pipelines. We produce approximately half of our CO2 requirements.","Currently we operate 1,800 megawatts of power generation, the majority of these power plants are located next to our OxyChem and oil and gas facilities in order for us to share infrastructure, act as a steam host and to consume power with the remaining power sold to the power grid.","Now, let me go back to our key Permian Basin assets, where our Midstream operations are focused on providing access to multiple markets for our Permian production.","Our equity production is roughly 150,000 barrels a day and is expected to grow significantly. Additionally, we purchase and market over 200,000 barrels a day of third party crude production.","Turning to slide 34, Centurion is a large gathering in mainline system in the Permian that we continue to optimize and significantly expand. Our Centurion system has roughly 2,900 miles of pipeline over 100 truck stations, 6 million barrels of storage and has access to most third party transportation assets that enable us to deliver crude to all Permian refineries as well as to the origin point of key pipelines taking production out of the Permian Basin.","We\u2019re focusing on two new takeaway points, Colorado City, which is the origin of our BridgeTex\u2019s pipeline which we\u2019re jointly developing with Magellan. In the Midland South exit which is the origin to third party pipelines Long-Horn and Cactus. When at full capacity BridgeTex and Cactus will add an additional 500,000 barrels a day of takeaway capacity from the Permian Basin.","These new pipelines give us access to the Houston and Corps refining centers and to our own Ingleside Terminal in Corpus Christi. It also supplements our existing access to Cushing.","We\u2019re working on options to handle the growing light crude production in the Delaware Basin in Southeast New Mexico in order to preserve the Permian crude qualities in the Midland Basin.","Currently Oxy and Magellan are in the final phases of construction on the BridgeTex pipeline which is expected to start up later this quarter.","The 450-mile pipeline will be capable of transporting approximately 300,000 barrels a day of crude between the Permian region and Gulf Coast refinery markets, Oxy has a significant committed takeaway capacity on BridgeTex as well as other third party pipelines exiting from the basin.","When all planned pipelines are in operation by mid-2015, our Midstream unit will have access to long-term cost advantage takeaway capacity. As a major producer in the Permian Basin, we\u2019ve been a driving force behind the construction of new infrastructure adding transportation capacity from the basin in order to benefit Permian production and avoid production constraints.","Now, I want to highlight how important adequate takeaway capacity is to market value. On slide 35 I\u2019ve shown Midland WTI pricing compared to Cushing WTI in the U.S. Gulf Coast LLS markers for the period of 2009 through today.","You can see how the differentials were transportation parity in a market with adequate takeaway capacity. Now, note the differentials in the widening significantly as the supply and demand balance tighten in a takeaway constrained market. We have seen Midland LLS differentials as wide as $30 a barrel in January 2012, in January 2013 during the winter refinery maintenance periods.","This year, we\u2019ve seen wide differentials throughout the entire year as increases in production have further tightened the supply and demand balance. The Midland LLS discount this year has averaged just over $10 a barrel versus just under $6 a barrel during the second half of 2013.","With the upcoming completion of BridgeTex, in the start-up of Cactus pipeline in mid 2015, we expect differentials to return to levels that reflect incremental cost of transportation between the Permian and Cushing or the Gulf Coast.","As you\u2019ve heard in Vicki\u2019s comments Oxy\u2019s production growth will be significant in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. With our long-term capacity on multiple pipelines, we will have security of placement with takeaway capacity of roughly three times our current equity production from the Permian Basin. We\u2019ll also have access to key markets and options to protect our Permian crude premiums.","Let me give you an update on our Ingleside Energy Center in Corpus Christi. This is the formal Naval Station that we purchased in late 2012 which is located outside of the congested ship channel near the mouth of Corpus Christi Bay.","We\u2019re developing a terminal facility that will be able to handle up to 100,000 barrels a day of propane and 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day of condensate and crude. The site will contain 2 million to 4 million barrels of storage and also provides flexibility to accommodate future processing facility options, on-site or at a nearby OxyChem complex.","We have sanctioned both projects and expect the LPG propane terminal to be complete mid-2015 in the first phase of the crude condensate terminal to be completed in the first half of 2016.","Our Midstream business has demonstrated steady earnings growth over the last few years, slide 37 shows the premium or the value add from our Permian crude logistics and our marketing business. This is in terms of dollars per barrel on equity production adjusted.","This is versus a group of six Permian producers based on the available public information we were able to pull. You can see we\u2019ve added approximately $1.50 a barrel better than the group average.","On the same basis we expect to capture an additional $2 plus of value once the BridgeTex and Cactus pipeline startup as a result of our long-term advantaged takeaway capacity.","This reinforces the importance of key infrastructure, if these new pipelines were not sanctioned, the entire basin would suffer continued significant discounts to market due to the infrastructure constraints. You can see the reasons we\u2019ve moved forward on these key pipeline initiatives.","I hope this gives you a better view of our Midstream business and in particular its key role in supporting our domestic oil and gas business. This is an exciting time for our Midstream business as we continue to build out a strong platform for future opportunities. Thanks for your attention.","I\u2019ll turn the call back now to Chris Degner.","Chris Degner","Thank you, Willie. Operator, we\u2019ll now pull for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning everyone and thanks for all the additional color in the Permian. Steve or Vicki, I don\u2019t know who wants to take this, if I could have one question on the Permian and then one on the restructuring process please.","Specific to the Permian, my understanding is that when we look at the publicly available information, your well results have been wagging what we would expect for peers in the area. And my understanding is that some kind of reporting issues with you guys. I wonder if you could share something with us.","And as it relates to the wells that you have drilled prior the presentation today, can you isolate where in the Permian you\u2019re drilling in terms of which horizon out of these averages that you feel you\u2019ve de-risked multiple sections across your acreage. Just a little bit more color as to what your confidence level is and the repeatability of these kinds of results across the 2,000 plus locations? And I\u2019ve got a follow-up please.","Vicki Hollub","Yes, Doug. Some of our reporting issues have been associated with what point in the flow back and production process of the well that we take the test. And some of our teams have been turning in 24-hour completion, initial completion rates to the railroad commission in the State of Texas that are not \u2013 when the well is fully cleaned up and not necessarily at its peak.","With that said, I\u2019m going to just be honest with you that in some areas we still are lagging behind our competitors in terms of our initial rates in production. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been aggressively here recently trying to try new things with respect of our frac designs to improve our performance.","In the Midland Basin, South Curtis Ranch, we are getting better and we\u2019re testing not only frac designs in terms of fluids and profit volumes rates and things like that. All of which are helping us to improve. But we are \u2013 we have discovered that our cluster spacing was not optimal for the initial fracs that we\u2019ve done there.","So, we\u2019re confident that going forward our South Curtis Ranch performance is going to improve. Now certainly the best area that we have right now is our Wolfcamp production in the Texas Delaware. That\u2019s where we\u2019re doing best and we\u2019re actually outperforming some of our competitors in the Texas Delaware.","So, we\u2019re confident that there we\u2019ve gotten closer to figuring out the right completion technology. And the right, not only profit concentrations, sand, total volumes and rates but also the design of the total job. So, in the Texas Delaware, we\u2019ve actually increased our profit volumes by about 20% and our fluid injection volumes by about 50%. We\u2019ve also increased our rate there.","So, we expect continuing good performance and maybe even better performance there. And in fact, it\u2019s in the Texas Delaware where we\u2019ve added most of the 2,500 new well locations that we\u2019ve added since the beginning of the year.","So, while in Texas Delaware, we feel like we\u2019re doing a great job. We know we still could improve it. We see opportunities for that. South Curtis Ranch, in the Midland Basin, we\u2019ve changed some things and we expect to see better results here coming pretty soon.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On de-risking Vicki, of the locations on multiple benches or horizons I should say?","Vicki Hollub","Yes, most of our, about \u2013 right now about 45% of the 7,000 wells are in the Wolfcamp. And as you know we probably as an industry know more about the Wolfcamp than any other. About 20% of our inventory right now is in the Bone Spring in Southeast New Mexico.","Those wells as you know are also doing pretty good, where we\u2019re seeing, in Texas Delaware we\u2019re seeing payout time periods of one and half years or less. And in Southeast New Mexico we\u2019re starting to see some good performance there in the Bone Spring.","So, I\u2019d say that right now 65% of our inventory is probably minimal risk in terms of economics and the ability to profitably grow it. The others are in benches that we still have some work to do.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And Steve, my follow-up hopefully quickly is, in the Middle Eastern process, you have a pretty major material contract expiring in Oman next year. And obviously things are kind of moving on this year in terms of obvious of news flow and the disposal process.","My understanding as you may have things maybe moving a little quicker than perhaps you\u2019ve been prepared to see previously. I just wonder if you could give us an update on your company as where everyone maybe getting the three separate transactions completed over the next let\u2019s say 12 months?","Steve Chazen","Yes, I think one of the transactions is moving on very well. And I think we\u2019ll get to resolution here in the easily foreseeable future. There is the contract extension in Oman which will have to be part and parcel of whatever goes on there because otherwise it expires in 2015. So I think they take a little longer but pretty confident there.","The third one is, I think more challenging. And we\u2019ll see what can be done there. But there are some issues that are not related to us that I hope work their way out but I think that\u2019s probably into next year.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I\u2019ll let someone else jump. Thanks very much.","Steve Chazen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Leo Mariani of RBC. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC","Hi guys, you referred a little bit some other projects where you may be able to grow international production outside of Al Hosn. Is that kind of part and parcel with your many negotiations? Could you guys just elaborate on that a little bit?","Steve Chazen","I think there is two parts there. We have some new contracts in Colombia for heavy oil which I think we\u2019re pretty enthused about. And I think those are pretty much there. So, I think those will be \u2013 they\u2019re away from some of the areas where we\u2019ve had political difficulties I want to call them that.","So, I think those are I think in pretty good shape. And then, obviously we\u2019re principally, one of the principal objectives of the program is either large scale reductions in areas where there is no growth or smaller reductions in areas where there is growth and a partnership with the local government.","So, I think some of the growth will come out of the partnership with the local government in those areas where there is potential for that.","Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess just in the Permian you guys clearly have a dramatic acceleration of the rig-count over the next couple of years here. Just trying to get a sense of how much of that maybe secured at this time by contract and what are you kind of seeing there in terms of service cost?","Vicki Hollub","We\u2019re definitely going to be able to get up to at least 54 rigs and by 2016. That\u2019s \u2013 but our current plan is to go to 45, however we can \u2013 we have the options in place to go to 54. So that\u2019s not really at risk for us right now. We know we can achieve it on the drilling rig side.","And the reason we have that range there, we\u2019ve got 47 in our plan for 2016 and the reason on the slide that the seven additional are grade. We have the option to get them. So we know we can. What we\u2019ll be doing between now and 2016 is trying to ensure that all the rest of the support services in the Permian area available and that we can secure that to get to the 54.","We feel like we\u2019ve already secured the services \u2013 support services outside the drilling rig that can support 47, it\u2019s just a matter of can we get to the 54 and we\u2019re working on that plan now.","Surface cost, we\u2019re still trying to manage that cost in the basin are going up as demand increases. But we\u2019re trying to leverage our size to minimize the increases that we\u2019re seeing.","Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC","Okay.","Steve Chazen","There is, also productivity gains from this too. So, I think we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve saved \u2013 we saved about 10% from last year\u2019s cost already. That\u2019s not driven primarily by reducing the day rate but by drilling more wells per day essentially. So I think with the productivity gains should more than offset whatever modest inflation there is in the cost.","Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC","Okay, that\u2019s helpful for sure. And can you guys just elaborate on other assets that you might be thinking about disposing we guys made a comment that said that anything that\u2019s not profitable could be up for sale. Any more color you have around any of those processes?","Steve Chazen","I think we\u2019ve said that \u2013 reiterated this morning that we\u2019re still looking at options for the Piceance in the Williston Basin, might be a little more activity in one of those, we don\u2019t know yet.","And we also said that buried in the comments was if we can get the right arrangement, perhaps some of the Midstream assets where we retain the contract so we can continue to move our crude and get the margins from the trading but perhaps dispose of the underlying asset. And let somebody else take the tariff.","Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC","Okay. Thanks, that\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great, thanks. If I could ask maybe a little bit more on the Delaware Basin, and I appreciate all the detail. Can you talk a little bit about your use of long laterals, I mean, have you drilled two-mile laterals or are you extending the lateral lengths. And if so, how much of your acreage there in the basin do you think would be conducive to longer laterals?","Vicki Hollub","Currently in the Delaware Basin, we\u2019re drilling lateral lengths of between 3,300 and 4,200 feet. What we\u2019re doing right now is some modeling with respect to the optimum lateral lengths in the basin. As you know, the Wolfcamp productivity in the Texas Delaware is much better than in the Midland Basin.","And thus far we\u2019re seeing some good productivity from the lateral lengths that we\u2019re drilling. We haven\u2019t really drilled much yet over 4,200 feet to the challenges there as I said, at what point have you drilled so much that you start destroying value in terms of the just the friction effects of the longer laterals.","And the other thing is that you have the challenges of the acreage positions with respect to ensuring that you\u2019ve setup your opportunities to go with longer laterals.","But currently, we\u2019re seeing that probably it\u2019s more likely to meet the longer laterals in the Midland Basin rather than in the Texas Delaware. However with that said we are trying a lot of things. We haven\u2019t gotten to that point yet. We\u2019re trying to minimize the variations that we have per stage of evaluation to ensure that we understand what impact each thing that we change is having on our productivity.","Steve Chazen","I mean, maybe a little focus than some other people. I think we focus on our sort of our finding cost sort of calculation rather than the IP calculation. So, from our perspective in order to lengthen the laterals may cost us more money. You might get more IP but maybe at a cost of a higher finding cost. We\u2019re just \u2013 it\u2019s not the way we think about things. Some small producer may be more interested in IT.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And have you seen \u2013 I guess still on the Delaware, have you seen, where are you seeing from an oil and gas mix in your Wolfcamp well there and you\u2019re seeing much variation across the extent of your acreage?","Vicki Hollub","We\u2019re seeing a little bit of variation but typically we\u2019re seeing anywhere from 72% to 80% oil in the Texas Delaware. And in most cases, we\u2019re seeing above 75%.","Steve Chazen","We\u2019re a little pickier and maybe we have better acreage to some other people who are doing a fair amount, they get gassier results.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Steve Chazen","You can see that our oil is rising and our gas isn\u2019t if you just looked at the numbers we\u2019ve given you. So, we\u2019re basically a little pickier than some other people who are maybe that\u2019s all I got, so they\u2019re drilling gassier wells.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And on the pace, the outlook in terms of \u2013 obviously your ramp is pretty significant over the next few years. Is the pace of development there broadly going to be governed by your view of the entire logistical system and how much capital you can put into the Basin without destroying returns? What\u2019s going to be the primary I guess governing factors on the potential to maybe even show upside over that three-year window?","Steve Chazen","We think on the production numbers we\u2019ve given, we have considerable upside just with the drilling we\u2019re showing. But putting that aside, it\u2019s a return based business. And we\u2019ve just assumed, learned lot of people make mistakes and learned from them before we expand our footprint. But there is, also other logistical issues in the basin.","And yes, we want to make sure that we have takeaway capacity for the oil, and more concerned frankly about takeaway capacity for gas. You\u2019re not going to be able to flare the gas. And the gas production, the base is likely to grow sharply in the next year or two as people drill these gassier wells. And so you could wind up with a bad situation.","So, one of our major focus is just to make sure that we have gas takeaway capacity so that we don\u2019t drill wells we have to have shut in, because clearly you\u2019re not going to be able to flare.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great. Well, thanks, I appreciate the help. I\u2019ll leave it there.","Steve Chazen","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gammel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jason Gammel \u2013 Jefferies","Yes, thanks. Maybe I\u2019ll take another stab at this Permian drilling situation more in terms of managing the drilling inventory. And I\u2019m just going to use some very simplistic numbers, at the current rig count and the number of wells that you drilled last. You have about 20-year inventory, obviously doubling the rig-count we\u2019ll take that back to a 10-year inventory.","But I also assume you\u2019re probably going to be adding locations over time. So how do you actually then balance the amount of drilling inventory that you have from an MPV basis, and what I\u2019m really getting out more broadly, do you see divestiture opportunities within the Permian Basin as well as potential acquisitions?","Steve Chazen","Yes. If I look at the list of mistakes I\u2019ve made over the last 20 years, the mistake I\u2019ve made most is investing anything into Permian Basin. And because there is so many horizons, there are so much layer, there is so much oil available to the system. So we didn\u2019t divest that much but I regret every acre. So I think that while I\u2019m here we\u2019re not going to be divesting anything.","I do think that \u2013 I think the program that Vicki has outlined is sort of the minimum program that\u2019s what we think we could achieve over the next couple of years without wasting money. As we get better at this and the basin matures there will be more opportunities because we\u2019re sort of everywhere. I think that \u2013 I think we could accelerate the program further. This is what we\u2019re talking about right now. As the basin matures, we find more stuff to do. The results maybe turn out a little better. I think we\u2019ll go ahead.","I am concerned about infrastructure constraints over the next two or three years. While we have, as Willie pointed out, lots of oil takeaway capacity, lot better positioned than most people I think. And so, I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape for that. And we do control the gathering system so we can gather our own stuff.","I\u2019m little concerned about gas and so we\u2019re probably going to take steps to make the gas more certain. I think that\u2019s probably more my deeding concern is that the crowding in the business, I\u2019m not really worried about cost because I think productivity improvements are more lost at the cost.","Jason Gammel \u2013 Jefferies","Great, that\u2019s pretty clear. If I could just ask one more on the CRC spin-out process. It looks to me and maybe I\u2019ve just missed something but I think that your estimate on the amount of shares that you\u2019ll be able to repurchase from the transaction has went to 60 million from the range of 40 million to 50 million.","And my question is, is this going to be related to the just under 20%, retention of equity and the exchange over time and do you still expect to take a $5 billion dividend out?","Steve Chazen","No, dividend $ billion.","Jason Gammel \u2013 Jefferies","Okay.","Steve Chazen","And so we haven\u2019t counted the shares and the exchange. So we\u2019re simply, our \u2013 we got our modelers out and so they divide $6 billion by $100 mop it to 60 million shares. We didn\u2019t pay a lot for that advice.","Jason Gammel \u2013 Jefferies","Very good, I think I understand now.","Steve Chazen","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hi everyone, and congratulations to those who have new roles. I see, I kind of didn\u2019t understand Steve that last point, believe it or not, the exchange of it has be completed within 18 months and any proceeds from that I guess is the word would be used for buyback \u2013 additional buyback?","Steve Chazen","No, it\u2019s actually just so you understand the shares the 19.9% shares that we own. Our options are sort of limited because it\u2019s part of a tactual link. So, if we exchange it for Oxy shares, now it was \u2013 ad in the paper it says, anybody who wants to can get CRC shares and they give us back Oxy-shares for it, okay. We can do that without paying any tax.","In theory, if we had that kind of debt around we could exchange it for debt, but there isn\u2019t that kind of munch there around to do that. If we do anything \u2013 the third alternative would be simply distributed the shares to the shareholders if we couldn\u2019t do that \u2013 that also would be tax free.","If we sold it for money, we would have to pay tax on it. So, our preference would be to do the exchange offer. So basically, it\u2019s a split off of the 19.9% in terms. So I think those are \u2013 so what we did was we sort of guessed it how much it might, we haven\u2019t included that number in our 60 million shares. But there would be some number of shares that we\u2019ll exchange the CRC shares for Oxy shares and we do that without paying any tax.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. And the follow-on slide which is 21, where you show that the same as 60 million says clearly that you don\u2019t include anything from MENA. I was just wondering why is that does not reflect that reduction, does that mean that you\u2019re going to pay down debt as well?","Steve Chazen","Well, there is a small amount of debt reduction probably.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay.","Steve Chazen","It\u2019s just in the rounding.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Yes, I figured that I just wanted to confirm that. So, the fact that your list of mistakes just maybe think of Lindsay Lohan I see funny enough. But there you go, would that involve you potentially making an acquisition in the permit further acquisitions of there? Thanks.","Steve Chazen","Actually the Permian acquisition scale is now \u2013 you have to speak to the next round of management about that. But I sure wouldn\u2019t do that. The prices are ridiculous far above what we traded six or seven times wherever we want to say the cash flow.","And the acquisitions are very dilutive and I can\u2019t imagine doing one. I suppose if there is a collapse in oil price or something like that that would be a different story. But actually a huge reduction in the public market values for these companies, I can\u2019t even imagine doing one, I don\u2019t imagine that hopefully my successors are well trained enough not to do anything stupid too.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Yes. And then finally from me, thank you. And then finally from me, in the past you\u2019ve sort of openly debated the buyback as the benefits and the merits of a buyback. Is there some sort of price sensitivity to this or is this going to be a fairly blind part? And I\u2019ll leave it there.","Steve Chazen","No, hopefully it won\u2019t be a stupid process I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re blind I guess another word for stupid.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Well, I think you\u2019ve said in the past that there is a fair value that you believe?","Steve Chazen","There is a fair value we believe in. And we\u2019ll do what we \u2013 yes, we\u2019re going to buy back the shares ultimately but it also depends on the price. We would expect that during the process of divesting of California company, the stock will during the confusion will trade at the Oxy stock will trade at some what we would view as discounted value. And we would expect that a \u2013 we could buy a lot of shares during that period. And we\u2019re pleased to be wrong but that would be a reasonable expectation during that period.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","I guess what I was driving at partly as well as the potential for you to spend more money organically to grow faster probably as to buyback?","Steve Chazen","More but not materially more I think is the answer. Could you put another $1 billion to work, yes, could you put $2 billion to work, maybe, could you put $3 billion to work, no. I think we got a plan that we can execute efficiently, we could probably do a little better as things progress. So I think the answer is yes, we could do that but not for very long.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Thanks very much.","Steve Chazen","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, one question on the Permian Vicki, just obviously you\u2019ve broken out your current vertical and horizontal and then you\u2019ve explained how doing the two-activity separately makes sense. As you look at that rig count chart, should we assume you\u2019re still going to have the same sort of ratio or maybe help us understand how many vertical rigs are going to be in that 47 plus 7?","Vicki Hollub","I don\u2019t see us having more than about 6 or 7 vertical rigs at any given time in the future. So the bulk of the 47 to 54 that we\u2019ll have only, I would expect only about 6 or 7 of those to be vertical.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right. And obviously you\u2019ve given us 7,000 locations and Jason was prepping on that. But as you ramp up the rigs, your inventory is going to drop I think perhaps a little bit faster. So, at least on a forward-looking basis when we get to 2016 which is obviously a bit further in the future, where would you then go next after the initial inventory?","I mean, it seems like you\u2019ve got some good sweet spots in the Midland and fantastic sweet spot in the Texas Delaware. It feels like a lot of your equity is over in the Bone Springs and so to maybe talk about how the returns would change as you shifted those rigs around through the program?","Vicki Hollub","Yes, let me say that 7,000 is based on the appraisal work and the evaluations that we have done to date. We fully expect that 7,000 to grow. As you know, we have a huge acreage position. And what we\u2019re trying to do is go to our initial step of exploration and then appraisal before we\u2019re adding, and some appraisal work has to be done before we add locations to our current inventory.","So, I\u2019m almost thinking with what we\u2019re seeing, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see that, our inventory increases by the amount of wells that we drill. So I expect that inventory to grow fairly significantly over the next couple of years. And I expect it to grow mostly in the Texas Delaware, Southeast New Mexico, although we still haven\u2019t done a lot with some of the areas within the Midland Basin.","What we\u2019re trying to do is stay very focused on limiting our focus area so that we can make sure that we accelerate efficiently. And then we\u2019re also limiting our appraisal areas too to make sure that we go in, we get our appraisal work done and then we transition to development mode.","So, some appraisal work, there are some areas where we haven\u2019t even begun our appraisal work.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then just a question on the Midstream, I mean, I know you sort of signaled you\u2019re going to be selling the Plains All-American GP. Well, it seems like it\u2019s time to build another one given the amount of Midstream assets that you are still building. So, I mean, would you think of about creating a new Oxy MLP down the road to help fund the infrastructure that will be required for you and for others in the Permian?","Steve Chazen","Yes, I think that you just have to split the revenue streams that come out of us into two. One is the Terra streams and those are once you build the pipeline they\u2019re sort of not very interesting.","And the other is sort of the trading or stream\u2019s ability to move the oil at different spots. We would just assume to retain the contracted volume streams and ultimately dispose of the Terra streams if you will.","So, I think as far as building another line, I think we got plenty for us, we\u2019re three times what we currently produce. So we got plenty for us. We\u2019ll see how it goes. Again, I\u2019m focused about putting the Midstream money right now in the movement gas to make sure that\u2019s not an issue.","When you run an MLP or any kind of Midstream business you\u2019re thinking about $1 or $0.50 a barrel. When we look at a barrel of oil, we\u2019re thinking about $100. And so our view is, we need to make sure that our $100 oil gets moved. And worry a little less about the $0.50 fee. So, we\u2019re focused on making sure that the \u2013 by building this stuff out, we made it better for everybody in the Basin. And then, on the gas we expect to do the same thing.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then just a final question. You\u2019ve seen these I guess royalty interest, mineral interest stream start to get traded independently of the companies or maybe just a reminder of where your royalty position is in some of your legacy acreage?","Steve Chazen","It\u2019s a complicated number to put it mildly. First of all, the king of this royalty stuff is in the California business, so you probably can ask them about it when they show up. But putting that aside, we \u2013 there is, royalties let\u2019s say under one of our EOR fields that we own the royalty interest there or a large piece of the royalty interest.","So, if we were to dispose that in some way, that would hurt our finding costs and our margins would shrink, our present worth would shrink, that may not make in that \u2013 and our reserves will go down because you\u2019re economic limit is reached sooner.","On the other hand, we have a fair amount of production where we just get checks from third parties. And we don\u2019t really know the number at this point, I mean, it\u2019s not \u2013 they\u2019re counting the checks I think they try to figure it out. But for the \u2013 excluding California, the royalty income is somewhere in the range of $300 million a year and to find some way. We just have to go through it and figure it out.","I think where it doesn\u2019t affect our ability to manage our base business because our royalties are scattered in a number of places, somebody like the basis team times cash flow. I think we\u2019re game. On the other hand, where it affects our base business, we just don\u2019t keep it because I think it will hurt us in our finding cost going forward.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks, very clear and helpful. Thank you.","Steve Chazen","Thanks.","Operator","Our last question comes from John Harlan of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","John Harlan \u2013 Societe Generale","Close enough.","Steve Chazen","The operator is not French obviously.","John Harlan \u2013 Societe Generale","Yes, thanks Steve. In the Permian, how much of your drilling activity is pad based at this stage?","Steve Chazen","Vicki.","Vicki Hollub","Because of the early stage that we\u2019re in and with respect to our drilling, we\u2019re not doing a lot of pad drilling at this point. But the pad drilling will come, it\u2019s already built into the development plan. What we\u2019re doing is appraisal work and we expect to be very heavily independent drilling in 2015.","John Harlan \u2013 Societe Generale","Which will also help, okay.","Vicki Hollub","And as you know, we do a lot of pad drilling elsewhere so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re opposed to it. But we\u2019re in the process of drilling the appraisal parts of some of these programs. And we will definitely go to not only pad drilling but manufacturing mode once we get beyond the appraisal stages.","John Harlan \u2013 Societe Generale","Right. I was just wondering how quickly you\u2019d be improving efficiencies. What about staffing, given the ramp in the Permian, do you think you have enough people?","Vicki Hollub","We\u2019re adding people. We\u2019re ramping up and we are going to have to add a few more people to our Permian resources and exploitation teams and our field execution teams. But so far we\u2019ve been able to add the people that we need as we progress.","John Harlan \u2013 Societe Generale","Okay, great. Last one from me, Steve, you talked about addressing the Midstream. Does this mean MLP or just outright sale?","Steve Chazen","Well, I mean, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 if somebody would give you MLP multiple and all cash, I think that\u2019s for us probably a better option. On the other hand, if you can\u2019t do it that way and we get some other way, I think we can do an MLP.","John Harlan \u2013 Societe Generale","Great.

Vicki, please go ahead.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by summarizing our key accomplishments in the third quarter. First, cost reduction efficiencies combined with improvement in new well productivity and better base management have enabled us to further reduce our total spend per barrel of production this year compared to 2015.","Second, we again increased year-over-year production in our core areas, and we're on target to exceed the higher end of our guidance for 2016. Third, we remain prudent with our capital allocation as we focus on returns and maintain disciplined to stay within our $3 billion capital budget.","Fourth, to further increase our low-decline production and improve efficiencies, we have acquired additional working interest in enhanced oil recovery projects and unconventional acreage in the Permian. Last, our aggressive appraisal and development efforts in our Permian Resources business have resulted in an improvement in the number and quality of wells in our inventory.","As I've previously mentioned, our total spend per barrel of production metric includes our overhead, operating and capital cost per barrel of production. This metric is designed to drive cost reduction, increased well productivity and optimize base production. To align employees with this metric, we have linked this to incentive compensation.","Our efforts to focus on efficiency and capital discipline are paying off, as we continued to lower our total spend per barrel of production. We averaged close to $62 per barrel in 2014, about $40 per barrel in 2015, and have targeted $28.50 per barrel in 2016. Year to date, we've beaten our target, with average total spend of about $27.50 per barrel.","In the third quarter, total company production from our ongoing operations was about 605,000 BOE per day, an increase of 5% year over year driven by Al Hosn gas in Abu Dhabi, a new gas project in Oman and resilient base production in Permian Resources. The performance of the Al Hosn team continues to exceed our expectations as they optimize deliverability. They have again achieved record production of 74,000 BOE per day for the quarter.","It's even more impressive that the plant operated well during the summer months, where temperatures can reach 120 degrees. We're optimistic that the plant can continue to deliver from 65,000 BOE per day to 75,000 BOE per day, depending on seasonal maintenance. We have commenced engineering studies for a potential expansion of the plant and expect to reach an investment decision in the second half of 2017.","Permian Resources production this quarter was 121,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 4%. As per our original development plans, Permian Resources production will decline slightly in the fourth quarter. We are adding rigs now to stabilize production and restart growth in early 2017. We continue to see improvements in well productivity in all of our areas.","The increases in production from Al Hosn, Oman's Block 62, along with strong year-over-year production growth from Permian Resources will help us exceed the higher end of our production growth guidance for 2016. As we look forward to 2017, we expect to deliver 5% to 8% production growth, with the variance subject to our activity levels in the Permian. Longer term, we have a deep inventory of well locations in the Permian with the capability to drive direction growth above this range.","Additionally, we have focused our international business on the core four areas: Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Oman and Colombia, where we have a track record of operational success, free cash flow generation and strong financial returns as well as growth opportunities that can provide the capability to drive production growth higher than our long-term 5% to 8% target. I have emphasized to our partners in those areas that the returns on any new project or capital investment must compete with the Permian Basin.","I'm pleased to announce that we have formally completed the exit of our contracts in Bahrain and Iraq. We have no meaningful liabilities related to those contracts, nor will we incur any material spending on capital or overhead to manage those terminated contracts. We've also made solid progress toward a formal exit from our contract in Libya.","Our capital spending in the third quarter declined slightly as we maintained our drilling program in the Permian and shifted timing on spending for certain midstream and chemicals projects. The Permian drilling program is consistent with plans we put in place at the beginning of this year and with our strategy to remain relatively conservative in this price environment.","Continued improvements in project design and capital execution have helped us do more than expected with our $3 billion capital budget. These along with improved production performance in many of our areas are the reasons we will achieve the upper end of our production guidance for the year.","The construction of the OxyChem joint venture ethylene cracker in Ingleside is on budget and on schedule. We have targeted to finish the commissioning of the plant by mid-January and expect ethylene production in the first quarter of 2017.","In addition, the crude oil export terminal in Ingleside has started operations and successfully loaded and dispatched three ships. The terminal has oil storage capacity of 2 million barrels and throughput capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels of oil per day. The export facility will have the flexibility to take various gravities of crude oil to both domestic and foreign markets. As the production from the Permian Basin grows in coming years, we would expect increased demand for access to multiple markets. The ship channel in Corpus Christi has clear advantages to Houston and should allow for shorter transportation times to market.","With the completion of long-term projects in both our Chemical and Midstream segments, we expect to have increased flexibility with our capital program in 2017. As we enter the fourth quarter, we have increased our activity in the Permian to prepare the business for growth in 2017. While we plan to release a more detailed budget early next year, at this point it's our expectation that capital will increase modestly from a little under $3 billion in 2016 to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion in 2017.","The progress this year on multi-year committed capital will allow for more of our 2017 capital to be devoted to upstream oil and gas development. Our program in the Permian Resources business will receive the largest increase in capital and, due to the shorter-cycle nature of the asset base, can be adjusted depending on the extent of commodity price recovery.","As we announced yesterday, we have made several strategic acquisitions of producing properties and non-producing leasehold in the Permian. As we've said previously, we already have a very large inventory in our Resources business. The main reason to acquire additional acreage is to improve the value of the inventory we currently have.","The selection criteria we use to evaluate acquisition opportunities are: the proximity of the acreage to our existing infrastructure, the quality of the subsurface reservoirs and, in most cases, we need to have multi-bench development potential, and the ability to optimize recovery per well by drilling longer laterals. The acquisition we just made met all of these objectives, with the added bonus that we already had a working interest in the property, making the overall acreage investment lower than current market. In fact, all the assets we just purchased in both Resources and EOR are in fields where we currently operate or own a working interest.","The Resources acquisition is in the Texas Delaware Basin. Increasing our working interest enables us to become operator of this area, which we believe to be among the most prospective areas in the Permian. Current production is 7,000 BOE per day. The acreage is mostly contiguous, which will enable us to drill longer laterals. It has high oil content and at least five prospective benches, three of which have a high level of certainty and two that are currently being appraised.","The properties also have infrastructure that fits well with the infrastructure and takeaway capacity that we have already have built in the area. Including our previous acquisitions, our aggregate investment in this area totals $2 billion and increases our working interest in 59,000 acres. The $2 billion includes a cost of $100 million for the infrastructure on the acquired acreage.","From an operating standpoint, this area will become part of what we will call the Greater Barilla Draw Development. This enables us to utilize and control shared infrastructure to reduce development capital and operating cost, thus increasing our margins as we grow our production. We will leverage this infrastructure along with our knowledge of the subsurface to drive improved financial returns and production growth. We expect to add a rig or two to the acreage early next year to accelerate the development of the resource.","As with the Resources acquisition, we also acquired additional working interest in enhanced oil recovery projects in Permian, mostly in areas that we operate. This acquisition provides low-decline net production of 4,000 BOE per day and has additional development upside.","Going forward, we will continue to actively evaluate our acquisition opportunities. Due to the nature of its ownership base and long history of production, ownership throughout the Permian is fragmented. We will target bolt-on opportunities with the clear strategic synergies I previously listed to leverage both our understanding of the subsurface geology and our existing midstream and infrastructure investment. Our approach will be disciplined.","We'll also continue to actively swap and trade small blocks of acreage. Year to date, we have swapped approximately 10,000 acres through many small negotiated transactions. These trades will enable longer lateral development and improved returns without material capital outlay.","As we have continued to appraise and develop our own acreage in the Permian Resources business, we have seen steady improvement in well productivity and a reduction in our drilling and completion costs. Improved logistical capabilities and integrated planning will ensure the majority of these cost savings are sustainable.","Through efforts to core up our acreage to drill longer laterals, we have lowered the breakeven cost on our inventory. Simply put, we can deliver more production with fewer wells. We expect to provide updated disclosure of our inventory and breakeven prices in early 2017 once we have fully integrated recent appraisal efforts and acquisitions.","I'm pleased with our progress to date. We have exceeded our production targets for the year with less capital than we had planned to spend, and we've positioned the company for continued profitable production and cash flow growth as we enter 2017. Directionally, we are planning for modestly higher oil prices in 2017 and will set our budget accordingly.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris Stavros.","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll focus on the following items: our third quarter segment and overall financial results; Oxy's balance sheet strength, liquidity, and cash flow in the context of the Permian acquisitions we just announced; and oil and gas production and segment guidance for the fourth quarter.","Third quarter 2016 reported financial results for GAAP purposes were a loss of $0.32 per diluted share compared to a loss of $0.18 a share in this year's second quarter. Our third quarter reported results included a net after-tax charge of $129 million related to non-recurring items in both the Oil & Gas and Midstream segments. Our core financial results for the third quarter of 2016 were a loss of $112 million or $0.15 per diluted share, a slight improvement from the loss of $136 million or $0.18 a share during the second quarter. Importantly, each of our operating segments generated improved quarter-to-quarter core financial results despite the continued challenging conditions for product prices.","Oil & Gas pre-tax core results for the third quarter of 2016 were a loss of $49 million compared to a loss of $117 million in the second quarter and income of $162 million in the same year-ago period. The sequential improvement of $68 million was primarily a result of higher product price realizations.","During the third quarter, the Oil & Gas segment recorded non-core net charges related to the exit from both Libya and Iraq of $61 million and a $38 million after-tax gain on the sale of some non-core non-operated oil and gas properties in South Texas.","Third quarter total company production volumes of 605,000 BOE per day were at the high end of our previous guidance range, with better than expected production results coming from Permian Resources, improved performance at Al Hosn in the UAE, and production growth in Oman from Block 62.","Total domestic production was 294,000 BOE per day during the third quarter, down sequentially from 302,000 BOE per day in the second quarter. Despite the overall decline in domestic volumes, production in Permian Resources of 121,000 BOE per day exceeded our earlier guidance by 5,000 BOE per day, largely due to better management around our base production. The sequential decline in third quarter domestic volumes was also partially due to a drop in production from the absence of gas-directed drilling activity in South Texas.","Our domestic Oil & Gas operations generated $67 million of free cash flow after capital during the third quarter. In a moment, Jody Elliott will discuss our plans for increased drilling activity in Permian Resources for the fourth quarter and as we exit the year.","International production from our ongoing operations was 311,000 BOE per day during the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 4,000 BOE per day compared to the second quarter. Higher volumes from Al Hosn and Oman contributed to the overall sequential increase, partially offset by a declining Colombia as a result of pipeline disruptions. The international Oil & Gas operations, comprised of our core four areas, generated nearly $300 million of free cash flow after capital during the third quarter.","Domestic Oil & Gas cash operating costs of $12.26 per BOE in the third quarter of 2016 were slightly higher on a sequential basis; however, declined by 7% compared to the full year 2015 cost of $13.13 per BOE. Nine month year-to-date costs are down nearly 10% compared with full year 2015, with the decline mainly the result of improved efficiencies and logistics management around our surface operations, including water handling as well as lower downhole maintenance and energy-related costs.","Cash operating costs in Permian Resources saw a further sequential decline in the third quarter and for the year to date have fallen to $8.43 per BOE, an improvement of 25% compared to 2015 full-year costs. Overall Oil & Gas DD&A for the third quarter of 2016 was $15.58 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015. Taxes other than on income were $0.97 per BOE for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.32 per BOE during 2015. The third quarter exploration expense was $9 million.","Chemicals third quarter 2016 pre-tax core earnings were $117 million compared with second quarter earnings of $88 million. The sequential quarterly increase in core earnings resulted from higher chlorovinyls production volumes and higher realized caustic soda prices. These improvements were partially offset by higher energy costs combined with lower vinyls margins. Vinyl prices remain largely unchanged despite significantly higher ethylene prices resulting from both meaningful planned and unplanned industry ethylene cracker outages. Our Chemicals business generated $100 million of free cash flow before working capital during the third quarter.","Midstream pre-tax core results were a loss of $20 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $58 million in the second quarter. Despite the loss, the results came in at the positive range of our previous guidance, with the sequential improvement resulting from better Oil & Gas marketing margins.","During the third quarter, we renegotiated some of our crude oil supply contracts, which resulted in an after-tax charge of $103 million. The new agreement should mitigate some of the transportation costs and improve our overall profitability going forward.","Turning to our cash flows for the third quarter, we generated $860 million of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes and adjusted for a one-time payment for the renegotiation of a crude oil supply contract as well as some tax-related items. Net working capital changes provided $50 million of cash during the period. We expect that this trend on working capital will continue as we exit the year at a slightly higher run rate for capital expenditures compared to the current pace of spending and activity.","Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $642 million, bringing our total year-to-date capital spending to approximately $2 billion. As Vicki mentioned, our capital spending in the fourth quarter is expected to increase modestly, as certain project-related expenditures in both Chemicals and Midstream have been deferred into the latter part of the year.","In addition, we plan to recycle some of the efficiencies and savings generated around drilling and completions back into our Permian Resources drilling program in addition to pursuing some project opportunities in Colombia. Despite the higher planned capital spending during the fourth quarter, our 2016 total capital program is expected to come in slightly under our original budget of $3 billion. We paid $575 million in dividends during the third quarter and ended the period with $3.2 billion of cash.","As Vicki mentioned, yesterday we announced several acquisitions of producing properties and non-producing leasehold acreage in the Permian as well as interest in several enhanced oil recovery and CO2 properties and related infrastructure. These acquisitions were funded with existing cash on hand and without the use of any equity. The transactions are immediately accretive to cash flow and at current commodity prices. Although our view on product prices remains relatively conservative into next year, we believe we have the balance sheet flexibility to allow us to cover a modest increase in our capital program, which we expect to deliver production growth of 5% to 8% in 2017.","Assuming oil prices of approximately $50 per barrel, we expect to generate cash flow from operations [CFO] of at least $4.5 billion in 2017. Incremental cash flow contributions would include: $150 million from the startup of the joint venture ethylene cracker; approximately $200 million from improving results in the Midstream segment, which would include the Ingleside crude oil terminal; and at least $100 million from the announced Permian acquisitions. In addition, every $1 per barrel improvement in oil prices would provide a further $100 million of operating cash flow.","With respect to guidance and as Vicki mentioned, we now expect our full year 2016 production growth from ongoing operations to be approximately 7% and exceeding the high end of our previous 4% to 6% range. We expect our companywide production volumes to be in a range of 600,000 to 610,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter. We anticipate our overall domestic production to be in the range of 290,000 to 295,000 BOE per day, which includes a partial contribution from the Permian acquisitions during the quarter.","Permian Resources production is expected to be roughly flat with volumes seen during the third quarter, with full year 2016 growth estimated to be about 12%. International production is estimated to be in the range of 310,000 to 315,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter. This incorporates the impact of a planned maintenance turnaround at Al Hosn and assumes normal operations in Colombia.","Our plan is to remain disciplined with our capital within the current price environment and to recycle some of the efficiency and productivity gains realized this year into greater activity during the fourth quarter and early next year. We expect this additional activity to help support our Permian Resources production as we exit this year and provide a platform for growth into 2017. Jody will share some of those specifics during his prepared remarks.","In the Midstream segment, we expect the fourth quarter to generate a pre-tax loss of between $20 million and $40 million. While quarter-to-quarter changes are inherently volatile in this segment, we anticipate favorable spreads for our West Texas to Gulf shipments to continue, higher domestic pipeline earnings, as well as increased flow of crude to our Ingleside crude terminal in anticipation of full operations beginning early in 2017.","In Chemicals, we anticipate pre-tax earnings of about $100 million for the fourth quarter, or roughly flat with the third quarter.","Our DD&A expense for Oil & Gas is expected to be approximately $15.50 per BOE during 2016, and depreciation for the Oil & Gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1.4 billion. The combined depreciation for the Chemical and Midstream segments should be approximately $655 million. Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pre-tax during the fourth quarter.","Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every $1 per barrel change in WTI. And a swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects our annual operating cash flow by about $45 million. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our full year 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 36%. Our international tax rate should be about 55%.","I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliot, who will provide an update on activity around our Permian operations.","Jody Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Chris. Today, I will provide a review of our domestic operations during the third quarter, guidance on our program in the fourth quarter and an outlook for the start of 2017.","For this year, our Permian Resources business achieved significant improvement in well economics across our Permian leading acreage position through step change advancements in well productivity and field development design. We believe this improvement in value starts with our subsurface characterization, where we are leveraging our geology, petrophysics and geochemistry expertise to achieve breakthroughs in our multi-bench appraisal, stimulation and other key subsurface design factors. We expect to quickly deliver a new series of breakthroughs in 2017 as we advance our seismic-based characterization and second phase of geoscience analytics.","On the cost structure front, we continue to lower our capital and operating cost structure through faster drilling, leveraging engineering innovation and integrated planning to optimize execution and logistics. We expect these efforts, when combined in our field development plans, will ensure Oxy is a leader in realizing maximum value per acre by optimizing recovery and capitalization.","Our unconventional business is well positioned to provide a competitive return in a low-cost environment and achieve significant growth in an improved price environment. As a result, during the third quarter we added a drilling rig in Permian Resources plus another at the beginning of the fourth quarter and have capacity and locations on standby to respond to improved pricing in 2017.","Turning to the performance of Permian Resources. In the third quarter, we achieved daily production of 121,000 BOE per day, a 4% increase versus the prior year. Oil production declined modestly due to lower capital spending, with nine wells put online versus 54 wells in the third quarter of 2015. Improved well productivity and our emphasis on base management mitigated some of the base decline on the horizontal wells. In the second and third quarters, we completed gas processing and compression facilities, allowing for the capture and sales of more gas and NGLs.","As we announced yesterday, we acquired producing properties and non-producing leasehold acreage in the Permian. In Permian Resources, we acquired 35,000 net acres in southern Reeves and Pecos Counties, where we currently operate and have a working interest. The properties will include approximately 7,000 BOE per day of net production, with 72% oil from 68 horizontal wells.","On key portions of the acreage, we gained operatorship where we had existing non-operated interest, and most of the acreage is already held by production. Development will initially target the Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B and Bone Spring. Simply put, we know the acreage very well. It's very competitive with our existing inventory. We expect to drill longer laterals, execute multi-bench development and leverage our existing infrastructure in the area, notably the joint venture gas processing plant completed this summer.","This transaction brings our overall position in the leasehold area to 59,000 net acres, with an aggregate acquisition cost under $2 billion. We plan on allocating approximately $200 million in capital in 2017 to the acquired acreage, utilizing one to two drilling rigs.","Turning to our activities in our core development areas. Much of the focus of the drilling program in the second and third quarters was to appraise the potential for multi-bench development in southern Reeves, Eddy, Howard, Glasscock, and northern Reagan County. In southeast New Mexico, we drilled and completed two Cedar Canyon Third Bone Spring wells and one Cedar Canyon Wolfcamp A well in Eddy County. All of the wells had 30-day peak IPs over 1,000 BO per day.","In southern Reeves County, we brought the Roan State 24 51H Second Bone Spring well online at a peak rate of 944 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 702 BOE per day and a 90% oil cut. The well had a 4,500-foot lateral and increases our confidence in the potential for multi-bench development for our acreage in the area. We're on the learning curve in developing this bench and expect well productivity to improve as we apply our experience in drilling and completion technology and further integrate our subsurface analysis.","In Glasscock County, we brought the appraisal well, Powell 1720 1H, online with a 7,500-foot lateral, which targeted the Spraberry formation with a 30-day rate of 931 BOE per day. As cited last quarter, we now compare and benchmark our well cost on a cost per 1,000-feet of lateral basis as we continue to increase our lateral lengths. Slide 23 illustrates our demonstrated improvement in well cost, which has declined roughly 38% from 2015.","Similarly, our 1,000 foot of lateral per rig per quarter has also improved from 25.2 per rig in 2015 to 35.4 per rig in the third quarter. We believe that a significant percentage of these improvements in efficiency are driven by structural changes in how we drill and complete wells and expect to continue to improve these efficiencies as we add drilling rigs.","In the Delaware Basin, we're aggressively appraising new benches while maintaining focus on improving well recoveries in our development benches. In southeast New Mexico, we tested a new Second Bone Spring slickwater frac design on the Cedar Canyon 27 Fed 5H with 2,000 pounds per foot and 50-foot cluster spacing. The cumulative production results from the new design have exceeded the first half 2016 design, and we expect to see continued improvement in future results. We're targeting an average well cost of $7.1 million for the Second Bone Spring and $8.3 million for the Third Bone Spring with 7,500-foot laterals and the increased completion size. Overall, we're very encouraged by the development and appraisal results in southeast New Mexico and we expect to increase activity in Q4 and throughout 2017.","In the Texas Delaware, we drilled one well and turned one appraisal well to production. The reduction in activity in the area is consistent with the overall balance of activity shift between Texas and New Mexico, and we plan to increase activity in this area in the fourth quarter. Our upcoming wells in the fourth quarter will test new completion designs and drilling technology that we believe will drive step change value addition across all of our development areas. We expect to increase our average lateral length from approximately 5,200 feet in 2016 to over 9,000 feet in 2017.","Shifting our results to the East Midland Basin, in the third quarter we drilled eight wells, brought four wells online, three of which have not reached peak production rates. We had multiple record drilling and completion achievements during the quarter. For example, we drilled a Wolfcamp B 7,500-foot lateral in 12.5 days rig release to rig release. We completed 10 frac stages in one day, and we drilled and completed two Wolfcamp A horizontals for $4.6 million and $4.9 million. Well productivity measured by the initial production rates per thousand foot of lateral continues to improve.","In the Permian Resources as a whole, we achieved another quarter of lower quarter-over-quarter field operating expenses, due mainly to improved surface operations with optimized water handling, lower workover expenses, and better downhole performance. Since the second quarter of 2015, we've reduced our operating cost per barrel by 28%, continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements.","As stated earlier, our focus on maximizing production from existing wells has been central to reducing declines in the business. We expect that our average annual uplift for our investment will be approximately 6,000 net BOE per day. This is another example of leveraging our decades of base management expertise in the EOR business to our Resources business.","As previously stated, we expect to increase our drilling activity in the fourth quarter of 2016 and bring on approximately 20 wells. We expect production to be about 120,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter and be growing as we exit the year. With over 115 wells planned for 2017, we expect to achieve double-digit production growth in Permian Resources.","In addition to the recent acreage acquisition, we've been actively trading and swapping acreage in order to core up our position. We've traded approximately 10,000 acres, which will enable longer lateral development. So for 2017, we expect to drill more wells with more than double the total lateral length drilled in 2016.","Now I'd like to shift to our Permian EOR business. We continue to take advantage of lower drilling cost and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. Permian EOR had another quarter of free cash flow generation. Drilling costs are running 22% below our benchmark target, and we've lowered cash operating expenses by 20% since the fourth quarter of 2014 and 7% year over year, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and injectant costs.","In similar fashion to our Resources business, the capital savings achieved by the EOR team will be reinvested into additional wells and CO2 flood expansions. As we've mentioned in previous calls, the residual oil zone development, or ROZ, is a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval. The ROZ underlies most of our major EOR properties and can be developed between $3 and $7 per barrel. Year to date, we've completed 94 well deepenings and recompletions along with 36 new wells in the ROZ developments. We anticipate an additional 50 deepenings and recompletions and 10 new wells in ROZ developments in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Yesterday, we announced acquisitions of working interest in 11 producing oil and gas properties and related infrastructure. The acquisition increases our ownership in several properties where we currently operate or are an existing working interest partner. These properties have production of approximately 4,000 barrels of equivalent per day at 80% oil, with estimated net crude developed producing reserves of approximately 25 million BOE and total proved reserves of approximately 41 million BOE.","To summarize, our domestic business will provide competitive returns in a low-cost environment and achieve significant growth in an improved price environment. We believe our Permian business is uniquely positioned to leverage our subsurface innovation in unconventional and leadership in enhanced oil recovery to maximize the value per acre across our entire 2.4-million-acre portfolio. We plan to exit this year running eight drilling rigs on our operated acreage plus another 1.5 to 2 net rigs on our non-operated development acreage. We're pleased with the strides our teams have made in subsurface characterization, execution, and performance thus far in 2016 and look forward to continuing breakthroughs in 2017.","Thank you, and I'll now hand it back to Chris Degner.","Christopher M. Degner - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Jody. We'll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I've got two questions. Vicki, I wonder if I could kick off with the acquisition last night. You've shown before the relative priority for the use of cash, and you've also shown us that you've got a fairly deep inventory of existing assets. I'm just trying to understand the rationale as to why $2 billion is the right use of cash versus a step up in activity on your existing acreage. If you could, just help us understand the rationale a little better and maybe some of the nuances about working interest changes, what it brings to you by way of operating capability and so on. Just help us understand the numbers a wee bit.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Doug, we've been looking at this. We've had ownership in this area for a while now. And what made us very attracted to this is the fact that it has the potential for five-bench development and the fact that it's so close to our Barilla Draw area where we've already installed infrastructure. We believe that the infrastructure in Barilla Draw combined with the infrastructure that was installed by a very prudent and efficient operator will enable us to combine the two and provide those synergies around that infrastructure to share that. The five benches, the shared infrastructure, and the operational efficiencies that we'll gain by combining these two areas and becoming operator of it where we can manage the development to maximize the net present value we believe was the best use of our cash at this point.","This inventory fits within the less than $50 per barrel breakeven price for us or the price that generates positive NPV of $10 for us, so that we think is very prospective. We like how it fits. We believe that we can further develop Barilla Draw. It will help with the economics there. So the combination of the two of them provides us quite a bit of net present value.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Vicki, I don't want to belabor the point, but I think Jody suggested one to two rigs in this area. I guess what I'm really trying to understand is, to justify the NPV \u2013 understand the NPV of the incremental wells, but to justify the NPV of the incremental wells plus the $2 billion acquisition cost, one would imagine you have to run at a pretty healthy pace above what you were going to do on your existing portfolio. So again, can you help us \u2013 guide us to where the activity level on this acreage goes to justify the $2 billion price tag?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","The one to two rigs would be the initial starting point for us on this acreage. We expect to spend about $200 million in 2017. But in 2017, remember now, we're still trying to balance cash with what our expectations are around oil prices. We do expect improving prices in 2018, which is where we expect to really launch into a much more aggressive development of both Barilla Draw and this new area. So we expect that we're going to be very aggressive with the development on this once we get into 2018, where at that point we expect the supply gap to narrow such that the prices will warrant a much higher level of activity.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and a very, very last one for me, a very quick one on Chemicals. Given the cracker starts up at the beginning of next year, can you just give us some guide on the free cash flow delta on that project as you move from 2016 into 2017? And I'll leave it there, thanks.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Okay.","Robert Lee Peterson - Occidental Chemical Corp.","Hi, this is Rob Peterson. So we'll just continue the spending of capital. We'll carry a small amount for commissioning the startup into 2017, and then we'll stop spending that and start generating cash from it. So it will be a several hundred million dollar flip between spending capital and generating cash out of the cracker, depending on the ramp-up time.","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","The swing, Doug, is actually about $300 million in terms of spending versus the contribution. So that's the delta, if you will, spending to cash flow.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just wanted to check order of magnitude. That sounds great, guys. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. I just want to follow up on the cash flow side of things. Chris, you mentioned $4.5 billion of CFO at $50. And if we use the CapEx, call it $3.5 billion, that would be $1 billion of free cash flow versus a dividend of $2.3 billion. So I guess what I was wondering is how you planned on funding that gap if oil is $50 or even if it's $55. Would you be looking to add debt to the balance sheet? Would you be looking to sell assets? And generally, Chris, just how are you thinking about target leverage following this acquisition?","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Phil, it's a good question. It's going to come from a combination of a number of different sources for the cash. Without being completely or terribly specific about any given thing that we're going to do at any given moment, what I would say is obviously it's going to depend on commodity prices. I mentioned the sensitivity around our cash flow to commodity prices. But should the need arise, we would expect to monetize some non-core non-strategic assets that would more than, we believe, cover our needs and when including our expectations for next year's cash from operations. So I don't anticipate or expect us to fall short or have any issue with that. We've got multiple levers that we can pull on in terms of filling any gap, certainly to the extent that you just did the arithmetic around, and more should need be. And the capital remains very flexible, certainly within the range, depending on commodity prices.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And on the target leverage side of things, post this deal, Vicki, you mentioned maybe even looking at additional bolt-on deals. How do you think about target leverage and the size of what bolt-on would mean relative to the acquisitions you've just done?","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","The leverage amounts, we're comfortable with that within our ratings right now. We'll obviously, depending on what the acquisition looks like, if we do acquisitions, it depends on what it looks like in terms of how we're going to look to fund it. And so some acquisitions are better sourced through leverage, some through other means. So we'll just have to look at it. It depends on what the acquisition looks like, the composition of the cash flows around the acquisition, the composition of the production in terms of determining how much leverage you're comfortable with for any given type of activity or specific acquisition. So the answer is it really depends.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","And, Phil, with respect to the bolt-on acquisitions, we look at a lot of things in the Permian. And this is the first thing that we've seen in a while that really fits well with our current operations and really made sense from a long-term development standpoint. You may have heard our name associated with some things in here recently that \u2013 those are things we didn't bid on. We look at a lot of things, but what we always want to do is make sure that it's a good fit. and as Doug had alluded to, that our net present value of what we expect our development to be is going to cover the cost of the acquisition. And so that rules out a lot of things for us.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Maybe another follow-up \u2013 I know you referenced the addition of rigs into the fourth quarter in the Permian. But what level of activity is implied in the Permian in the $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion budget for 2017? And how much of that budget is allocated to Permian Resources?","Jody Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Ryan, this is Jody. The activity level currently planned for 2017 would be about six rigs in the Permian Resources area and three rigs in EOR. And then depending on what that final capital number is, we can scale that up, scale it down, again, depending on commodity prices or where that final direction is on the capital budget.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","And we've said previously, although it's not final yet, that our capital spend would probably be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion for Resources.","Jody Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","And, Ryan, the other point I want to make is all the work that we've done this year around our characterization, around our field development planning, the upsizing and optimization of our stimulation has created this ability with very low capital intensity to generate a lot of production. So that inventory mix in 2017 will be optimized where we can grow production significantly with a fairly modest rig count.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, can you talk a little bit about your infrastructure position in the Basin, how you feel like you're positioned to be able to ramp activity in terms of the flexibility you have over the next few years, whether you see yourselves, or the Basin in general, the industry in general, having any bottlenecks? Anything there would be great.","Jody Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Ryan, I think as far as our field development planning, that's one of the key things is that we try to get ahead of the game, whether it's water disposal, frac water movement, gas takeaway, oil takeaway. We try to plan those things in advance and build out ahead of when that need is going to be. So whether it's southeast New Mexico, we announced the startup of the joint venture gas plant recently in the Delaware. Those are all things to stay ahead of the infrastructure game.","The new acquisition has considerable infrastructure, fresh water, salt water infrastructure, 4 million barrels of frac storage, 40 miles of distribution line. It has produced water treatment systems, 15 SWD wells, gas compression. So all those things that have been done extremely well in this acquisition are the same things we do on our own assets.","And maybe Vicki or Chris will want to address the greater Permian infrastructure takeaway.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Ryan, I would just say that with respect to our takeaway capacity out of the Permian, we're very well positioned there. We have excess capacity above and beyond what we expect our growth to be. That's been a little bit of a drag on our Midstream business here recently, but we expect that to be a real benefit to us going forward.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I guess maybe to come back to expectations in the fourth quarter here. How should we think about the acquired volumes coming in as part of the guidance of the 120,000 BOE per day for Permian Resources? Does that imply that Permian Resources is actually declining here in the fourth quarter and that adds on? Or how should we think about the exit rate you indicated would be higher?","Jody Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Roger, the 120,000 BOE per day includes our estimate of the acquisition. So there's some modest decline in the base core business pre-acquisition. Again, the activity level is ramping up. As you know, when you're doing multi-well multi-pad development with zipper fracking, the production comes lumpy. So a lot of that activity happens in the fourth quarter and the production will come very early in the first quarter of 2017.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So potential for a little bit of \u2013 if things go really well, we can see it in December, otherwise thinking about it as a 2017 event?","Jody Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","That's correct.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then can you walk us through with the acquisition here a little bit? The 700 locations obviously indicate potential for significant upside, some of which clearly will be price-driven and some of which is going to be based on drilling. How did you come to the 700? And what's an idea of how we should think at say maybe $60 oil in 2018 where that 700 locations could go?","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Roger, the 700 locations is based on our conservative nature with assessing our developmental properties. So that's the minimum location count in the Wolfcamp A, the Wolfcamp B, Second Bone Spring. We're very optimistic about the two additional benches in the Bone Spring and in the Wolfcamp debris flow, which sits between the Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B. At $60, again, that inventory just continues to grow, whether it's tighter spacing.","The other aspect is we continue to improve both well performance and our execution results. I mentioned that we have some technology things working in the drilling area, which we believe can be a step change in multi-well, multi-pad development. And so as we test those in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of 2017, we'll be more able to talk about some of those details. But we think that would generate even more bench activity, not just in the acquisition, but on all of our core areas.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And just a final question. You mentioned this acreage was fairly HBP. Is there a percentage you can give us that maybe isn't? Give us an idea of maybe where the one to two rigs initially have to be focused.","Christopher G. Stavros - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think it's north of 80%. And a lot of those are just clock drilling obligations as opposed to expiry issues.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the comments with regards to the CapEx cash flow for 2017. And if we take the acquisition side of things away and just look at the strategy with regards to growth versus free cash flow versus dividend, I think in the past you talked about wanting to try to cover that dividend with free cash flow. And perhaps $50 is just the low end of your oil range and will ultimately go higher, but I wanted to see if there's any change in your strategic thinking about the importance of covering the dividend with free cash flow, recognizing that Oxy is unique in even having free cash flow of this magnitude in the first place.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I'll tell you, Brian, we consider that, covering our dividend with cash flow, to be a priority for us. It's very critical. But we do view 2017 as a transition year. We don't expect prices to get to the point where it's reasonable for us to cover our dividend with cash flow until 2018. That's why we're ensuring that all the decisions that we make will enable us to get through the transition year of 2017. We have other levers we need to pull if that supply\/demand balance doesn't narrow in 2018, so there are other things that we can do. But we're certainly expecting an oil price that is certainly closer to our cash flow neutral standpoint.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And then shifting to the Permian, the acreage position as you highlighted it is very vast. Can you talk to whether you see your interest and the need for additional acquisitions to achieve the type of scale that you desire as you're doing with this acquisition here to be competitive to or more competitive with others in the basin that have contiguous acreage positions?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","We viewed this acquisition as a very unique opportunity because of the reasons I've described. We don't see any need to acquire any additional acreage unless it's smaller bolt-ons that do provide us the efficiency to develop what we currently have, and those are the types of things that we would target going forward.","Our inventory is huge, and we still haven't fully appraised the inventory we have. So what we view this to have done is in the greater Barilla Draw area, what it's done for us is just, in addition to the 59,000 acres associated with the acquisition, we have in that general area around 100,000 acres. So that gives us a really sizable position that's bigger than most positions, and that's why this was so important to us. It was a special case because, as you've noticed, we haven't really acquired anything in the last couple years. And this is the reason, we're looking for those things that provide us a unique opportunity to do something that's what we consider to be really a step change in a given area.","Looking at the rest of our acreage, we're spending quite a bit of time and effort to appraise the rest of what we have and to rank it in terms of development. So now we feel very comfortable with the Greater Barilla Draw area. Southeast New Mexico is in prime position for aggressive development, and we have some areas in the Midland Basin as well. What we have to do now is we've got our appraisal team working on those parts of our acreage that are outside of those areas.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Could you characterize the sum of the acreage that you believe now is developable and to the comment you just made?","Jody Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I think we'll update the full inventory picture in the fourth quarter. To give you a little bit of color, with all the appraisal work and all the subsurface work we're doing, we've changed the landscape of that inventory. We've doubled the lateral miles of inventory. The NPV on that existing inventory is up over 66%. We have 27 rig years of inventory at less than $40 a barrel, so we've really grown the existing inventory. This asset, it's really \u2013 the acquisition asset is really about just taking ownership in an already derisked core area with incredible infrastructure. So that's going to allow us, when you think about sand, when you think about water, when you think about logistics, people, supply chain leverage, it really allows us to hit all of those key drivers that lower F&D cost and keep our OpEx costs really low.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. You significantly beat Permian Resources volumes guidance for the second time in three quarters. And if I shift to the guidance, what are the ranges on the 2017 fuzzy bars for Permian Resources on slide 22? I'm just trying to square the circle here of whether that range reflects the enhanced completions, longer laterals, and increased wells drilled in the presentation, or if it's based on 2015 year-end technology, as are the location counts? It just looks low versus the commentary.","Jody Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Evan, that forecast is based on what we know today. So it's the latest version of our completion designs and our expansion. The fuzziness is really a function of what's the final capital budget going to be that year. But we're not forecasting enhancements or improvements that have not been demonstrated at this point in time. So those are all upside opportunities.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","And, Evan, let me add to that that Jody and his team along with the support of the subsurface characterization team have beaten their forecast for about what, eight quarters in a row or so?","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Any numbers on the high end of that? It looks like 135,000 BOE per day. Is that right?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","It's a little bit higher than that.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, maybe a second one, if I could, on the acquisition. Could you say how much of the acquisition was allocated to Permian Resources versus EOR? It looks close to $21,000 an acre versus the $43,000 an acre headline for Permian Resources, if we back out what you paid for J. Cleo using that cost basis metric. Is that right? And then on the other side of I guess Singer's question is with a larger Tier 1 footprint, will that increase for high-grading your portfolio or potential asset sales? I'll leave it there.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I would say that on the net value per acre, we were in the upper $20,000s on what we calculated for that. And with respect to the tiering of the acreage, this certainly gets us what I believe is going to be Tier 1 for us. I believe that this area will certainly be comparable with our best area, which is southeast New Mexico. The fact is that the opportunity to have five benches is going to make the infrastructure cost so minimal on a per BOE basis that I do believe that this is just going to continue to improve.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And drive \u2013 since it would take capital, would there be another high-grading on the back of that?","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","There could be. It really depends on product prices for 2017. We'll continue to balance our capital with our cash flow needs and the balance sheet.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. I appreciate it, guys.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","And the next question is from Matt Portillo of TPH. Please go ahead.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Just starting off on the Permian Resources side, I was curious if you could provide any incremental color or commentary around the base design that you're currently utilizing in the Texas Delaware Basin and what you may be testing on a leading-edge basis that may be giving you some incremental excitement in terms of increased productivity on the wells.","Jody Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","Matt, it's really basin. It's sub-basin specific, almost field specific in those designs. But in general, it is tighter cluster spacing and higher sand concentrations, and then doing trials to understand where you've hit diminishing returns. But in general, more sand, tighter cluster spacing is generating better results. But combining that with longer laterals has really been the key for us.","And as you look at the numbers I talked about on extending lateral length, that's another real benefit for us. In New Mexico, this year we'll average around 5,000-foot laterals. We'll go almost to 7,000 feet next year. In the Texas Delaware, it's a little over 5,000-foot laterals. Next year it will be closer \u2013 this is effective lateral length \u2013 over 9,000 feet. And in East Midland Basin, we probably averaged \u2013 we'll average around 7,800-foot laterals in 2016, and in 2017 that will be over 9,000 feet. So the combination of extended lateral giving us really better EURs, better decline profiles combined with this continued integration of our geoscience with the stimulation design.","The drilling technology piece is something that we'll talk a little bit more about in future quarters, but it's really an innovative way to access multiple benches and again leveraging your infrastructure across multiple benches with minimizing your facility cost.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","And just a quick follow-up there, is there any color you can provide I guess just on what the base design looks like today? I'm just trying to reference point in the Texas part of the play specifically where your proppant loading is and where your fluid volumes are and maybe...","Jody Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","It's in the 1,750 to 2,000 pounds per foot range, but we've trialed and will trial higher.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, and then just a follow-up question. On the New Mexico side of the border, it looks like you've started to delineate some of your acreage in Eddy County. I'm just curious. As you guys look at additional resource potential across New Mexico, what interest you have in, I guess moving into 2017, in terms of focusing on some incremental zone delineation in the Wolfcamp and Avalon horizons.","Jody Elliott - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","So New Mexico will be one of the key places we operate in 2017. This year we've spent quite a bit of effort in the appraisal mode in New Mexico, testing the Third Bone Spring, testing the XY, Wolfcamp D. So we will continue as part of our development plans to appraise those other benches. Again, we believe New Mexico has many bench opportunities beyond what we've talked about previously in our inventory.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","And last question from me. I just wanted to follow up on a previous question from an infrastructure perspective. So just to clarify there, I think there's some industry concern that as Permian growth accelerates over the next few years that the main infrastructure bottleneck may become the pipe capacity out of the basin. And so I wanted to just make sure that I understood your comments that you guys feel comfortable over the next few years that there are no pipe constraints or you have solutions in the work that can essentially debottleneck that.","Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.","I suspect there are going to be pipeline constraints for others, but I can tell you, we have plenty of capacity tied up and we'll be able to actually still contract and take third-party volumes to Houston. We have quite a bit of capacity, so we feel very comfortable with where we are.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Degner for closing remarks.","Christopher M.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Christopher Stavros. Please go ahead sir.","Christopher G. Stavros","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental Petroleum's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call.","Joining us on the call this morning from Los Angeles, we have quite a sizable group: Steve Chazen, Oxy's President and Chief Executive Officer; Cynthia Walker, Oxy's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bill Albrecht, President of Oxy's Oil and Gas Operation in the Americas; Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas Business; Willie Chiang, Executive Vice President of Operations and Head of Oxy's Midstream Businesses; and our Executive Chairman of the Board, Dr. Ray Irani.","In just a moment, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Cynthia Walker, who will review our financial and operating results for last year's fourth quarter and full year 2012.

Cynthia, please go ahead.","Cynthia L. Walker","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Core income was $1.5 billion or $1.83 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with $1.6 billion or $2.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $1.4 billion or $1.70 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012. The improvement from the third quarter reflected the effect of higher liquids production, higher realized NGL and domestic gas prices and reduced operating expenses in the oil and gas business. It's partially offset by lower earnings in the midstream segment.","In the fourth quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $1.8 billion, representing $1.1 billion after-tax or $1.41 per diluted share. Almost all of the charges were for impairments in the oil and gas Mid-Continent business units, over 90% of which were related to the natural gas properties that we acquired more than 4 years ago on average.","While the performance of the properties was generally as expected, natural gas prices have declined by approximately 50% since the acquisitions. Also, in 2012, natural gas prices and NGL prices used for reserve calculations were significantly lower than prices used in 2011, resulting in declines in economically feasible reserves in these properties.","In addition, despite the recent modest increase in natural gas prices, drilling in many of the gassy areas remains uneconomic. As a result, we continue to operate at minimal levels in these areas as we've communicated previously. The charges related to the natural gas properties reflect the impairment of such properties to approximate fair value.","Net income after the fourth quarter charge was $336 million or $0.42 per diluted share.","I will now discuss the segment breakdown for results of the fourth quarter. Oil and gas earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012, excluding the charge, were $2.3 billion compared to $2 billion in the third quarter of 2012 and $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. We delivered a quarter-over-quarter improvement despite a decline in WTI prices as a result of higher liquids production, higher realized NGL and domestic gas prices, and importantly, lower operating expenses.","Oil and gas production costs were $14.99 per barrel for the 12 months of 2012, compared with $12.84 per barrel for the full year 2011.","Our fourth quarter production costs were $14.95 per barrel, which was $1.04 per barrel lower than the third quarter level. I would note that these reductions occurred during the course of the quarter and our year-end exit rate on a per-barrel basis was lower than the fourth quarter 2011 average and well below the fourth quarter 2012 level. This gives us confidence in our operational efficiency efforts as we begin 2013. Steve will review the drivers of the performance and our expectations for 2013 in more detail.","The fourth quarter 2012 total daily production on a BOE basis was 779,000 barrels, a new record set by the company. This was up 13,000 barrels per day from the third quarter of 2012 and up 4% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Our domestic production was 475,000 barrels per day, an increase of 6,000 barrels per day for the third quarter of 2012 and now the ninth consecutive quarter of domestic volume production. Production for the -- Production was 6% higher for the fourth quarter of 2011, almost all of the net sequential quarterly increase in production came from oil in California and the Permian Basin.","Domestic gas production was down slightly from the third quarter, which was offset by higher liquids production, resulting from higher yields from our new Elk Hills gas plant.","Latin America volumes were 32,000 barrels per day, which was flat compared to the prior quarter in the same period in 2011. In the Middle East, production was 272,000 barrels per day, an increase of 7,000 barrels per day from the third quarter of 2012. Higher spending levels in Iraq and Oman resulted in 8,000 barrels per day higher production. Dolphin production, as with the last quarter, was lower due to the full cost recovery of pre-startup capital. Other factors affecting production sharing and similar contracts, including oil prices, did not significantly impact this quarter's production volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 or the third quarter of 2012.","Further details regarding other country-specific production levels are available in the Investor Relations supplemental schedules that we provide.","Fourth quarter realized prices were mixed for our products compared to the third quarter of the year. Our worldwide crude oil realized price was $96.19 per barrel, a slight decrease from the third quarter while worldwide NGL prices were $45.08 per barrel, an increase of about 11%. And domestic natural gas prices were $3.09 per million cubic feet, an improvement of 25%.","Fourth quarter 2012 realized prices were lower than the prior year fourth quarter prices for all of our products. On a year-over-year basis, price decreases were 3% for worldwide crude oil, 18% for worldwide NGLs and 14% for domestic natural gas. Realized oil prices for the quarter represented 109% of the average WTI price and 87% of the average Brent price. Realized NGL prices were 51% of the average WTI price and realized domestic gas prices were 92% of the average NYMEX price.","At current global prices, a $1 per barrel change in oil prices affects our quarterly earnings before income taxes by $37 million and $7 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGL prices, a change in domestic gas prices of $0.50 per million BTUs affects pretax earnings by about $30 million. These price change sensitivities include the impact of production sharing and similar contract volume changes.","Taxes, other than on income, were generally related -- which are generally related to product prices were $2.39 per barrel for the full year of 2012 compared to $2.21 per barrel for the full year of 2011.","Fourth quarter exploration expense was $82 million. We expect first quarter 2013 exploration expense to be about $90 million for seismic and drilling in our exploration programs.","Our fourth quarter DD&A rate was $14.47 per barrel, and we expect full year 2013 to be approximately $17 per barrel.","In the chemical segment, earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012 were $180 million compared to $162 million in the third quarter of 2012 and $144 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. The sequential quarterly improvement reflected higher caustic soda and PVC prices, partially offset by higher energy and feedstocks. The year-over-year increase reflected higher export volumes for caustic soda and VCM and lower feedstock cost.","For the first quarter of 2013, chemical segment earnings are expected to be about $150 million. Typical weak seasonal demand, particularly in the construction and agricultural market segments, combined with the recent increases in ethylene and natural gas costs may tighten margins in the first quarter.","Midstream segment earnings were $75 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $156 million in the third quarter of 2012 and $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. The 2012 sequential quarterly decrease in earnings was caused by lower marketing and trading, foreign pipeline and power generation earnings.","The worldwide effective tax rate on core income was 37% for the fourth quarter of 2012. The rate was lower than the prior quarter and our guidance, largely due to a higher portion of domestic income in the fourth quarter than foreign income. Our fourth quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedules.","We expect our combined worldwide tax rate for the first quarter of 2013 to increase to about 40%.","Now turning to cash flow. In the 12 months of 2012, we generated $12.1 billion of cash flow from continuing operations before changes in working capital. Working capital changes reduced our full year cash flow from operations approximately $800 million to $11.3 billion.","Capital expenditures for the 12 months of 2012 were $10.2 billion, of which $2.5 billion was spent in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter 2012 capital spend was approximately $100 million lower than the third quarter of 2012, driven by an approximately 12% reduction in oil and gas spending, partially offset by increases in the chemical and midstream segments. The higher capital at chemicals was related to the construction of a new membrane chlor-alkali plant in Tennessee, which is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2013. Midstream capital was higher mainly due to the Al Hosn gas project.","Total year capital expenditures by segment were 80% in oil and gas, 15% in midstream and the remainder in chemicals.","Acquisitions for the 12 months of 2012 were $2.5 billion, of which $1.3 billion was spent in the fourth quarter on domestic oil and gas properties.","Financial activities, which included 5 quarterly dividends paid, stock buybacks and a $1.74 billion borrowing earlier this year resulted in a net use of cash of $850 million. These and other net cash flows resulted in a $1.6 billion cash balance at December 31.","During the year, we bought about 7.5 million of our own shares at a cost of approximately $580 million. Approximately 5 million of the shares were purchased in the fourth quarter at an average price of $76.15. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the 12 months of 2012 were 809.3 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 810 million. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2012 were 807.1 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 807.7 million.","At the end of the year, we had approximately 805.5 million shares outstanding.","Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 16% at year end. And finally our return on equity in 2012 using core results was 14.6%. And the return on capital employed was 12.6%.","Copies of the press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings in the Investor Relations supplemental schedules are available on our website at www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR system.","I will now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to comment on 2012 performance as well as year-end oil and gas reserves and discuss our 2013 capital program and provide guidance for the first half of the year.","Stephen I. Chazen","Thank you, Cynthia. Oxy's oil and gas -- domestic  oil and gas segment produced record volumes for the ninth consecutive quarter and continued to execute on our oil production growth strategy. Fourth quarter domestic production of 475,000 barrel equivalents a day, consisting of 342,000 barrels of liquids and 800 million cubic feet of gas per day was an increase of 6,000 barrel equivalents per day compared to the third quarter of 2012. The increase in our domestic production over the third quarter in 2012, almost entirely in oil, which grew from 260,000 barrels a day to 265,000.","Gas production declined 12 million cubic feet a day on a sequential quarterly basis, mainly in the Mid-Continent, which reflects the reduction in gas-directed drilling we have mentioned over the past couple of quarters. Higher natural gas liquids volumes, resulting from better yields from our new Elk Hills gas plant, offset the decline in gas production there. Our total domestic production grew from 428,000 barrels a day in 2011 to 465,000 barrels a day in 2012 or about 9%. Our total domestic oil production grew by 11% from 230,000 barrels a day in 2011 to 255,000 barrels a day last year.","The company's total daily production reached a record of 779,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter and 766,000 barrels for the full year. This resulted in a 5% increase for the year.","We have embarked on an aggressive plan to improve our operational efficiencies over all cost categories, including capital, with a view towards achieving an appreciable reduction in our operating expenses and drilling costs to at least 2011 levels in order to create higher margins from our production.","With regard to driving efficiencies in our cash operating costs, we are running well ahead of my earlier plan. We recognize that cost efficiency is a result of many decisions that are made at all levels of the organization, in particular numerous decisions that are made at the field level. All of our business units stepped up to the challenge of reducing our costs and involved their personnel at all levels, from business unit management all the way to field level personnel, to generate ideas to improve cost efficiency. Our employees have responded well to the challenge. The business units generated many good ideas, large numbers of which were generated by field level personnel. Many of these ideas have already been implemented and the results are apparent through reductions already realized in operating costs. There are still many more big and small ideas that are in the process of being implemented, which we believe will result in additional improvements.","In the fourth quarter, the company's total production cost were $1.04 per barrel lower than the third quarter. Improvements were realized across most business units, most notably the Permian and Elk Hills. The reductions resulted from efficiencies achieved across most cost categories, including savings in surface operations, reductions in the use of outside contractors, curtailment of uneconomic downhole maintenance and work-over activity, as well as related overhead.","In 2013, we expect to realize further improvements in all of these categories. We expect our production cost per barrel to be under $14 in 2013, which is significantly lower than 2012 average costs. Many of the steps already taken in the fourth quarter, which is only partially reflected in the quarter's average costs, along with additional measures being implemented early in the year, to result in meaningful additional cost reductions in 2013 and beyond.","We are also seeing strong early results from our efforts towards improving drilling efficiency and cutting our well costs through simplification of our well design, focusing on activities in fewer geologic plays and favoring high return -- higher return conventional activity.","Our goal for 2013 is to reduce our U.S. drilling costs by 15% compared to 2012 and we are approximately halfway towards that target with further improvements expected during the next couple of quarters.","We've increased our dividends at a compounded rate of 15.8% over the last 10 years through 11 dividend increases. We expect to announce further dividend increase after the meeting of the Board of Directors in the second quarter of February. As a result of our consistent, long-term record of growing our dividend, we are proud to have been selected for inclusion in Mergent's Dividend Achievers indices for 2013. This is a highly regarded series of indices that track companies with long -- strong, long-term dividend growth.","We haven't completed our determination of our year-end reserve levels, but based on our preliminary estimates, we produced approximately 280 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2012. Our total company reserve replacement category from all categories including revision was about 143% or about 400 million barrels.","Depressed domestic gas prices and changes in our plans for drilling on gas properties resulted in negative revisions to our domestic gas reserves. Natural gas reserve reservations represented approximately 60% of the total revisions. If gas prices recover in the future, a portion of these reserves will be reinstated. Additionally, we experienced some negative revisions due to reservoir performance.","Our 2012 development program, excluding acquisitions and revisions, replaced about 175% of our production with about 490 million barrels of reserve adds. Our 2012 program, including acquisitions, but excluding revisions of prior estimates, replaced 209% of our production. We believe these latter 2 approaches are an appropriate way to evaluating the progress of our overall program.","At year end, we estimate that 72% of our total proved reserves were liquids. Of the total reserves, about 73% were proved developed reserves.","I'll now turn to our 2013 outlook. Domestically, we expect oil production for all of 2013 to grow by about 8% to 10% from the 2012 average. With lower drilling on gas properties, we expect gas and NGL production to decline somewhat. Planned plant turnarounds in the Permian CO2 business will cause additional volatility production in the first half of the year.","Internationally, at current prices, we expect production to be lower in the first quarter due to a planned turnaround in Qatar. Production should be relatively flat for the rest of the year compared to the fourth quarter although there is some possibility for growth.","In our capital program, we are currently in an investing phase in many of our businesses where a higher-than-normal portion of our capital is spent on good longer-term projects.","In 2013, we expect to spend about 25% of our total capital expenditure on projects that will make a significant contributions to our earnings and cash flow over the next several years. I previously talked about the excellent Al Hosn gas project. We've also started the construction of the BridgeTex pipeline, which we'd expect to start operations in 2014. This pipeline is designed to deliver crude oil from West Texas to the Houston area refineries, which will open up additional markets for oil from the Permian region and improve our margins. We're also investing in gas and CO2 processing plants to expand the capacity of these facilities to handle future production plants and in a new chlor-alkali plant in the chemical business.","Our total capital spending is expected to decline by approximately 6% in 2013 to $9.6 billion from the $10.2 billion we spent in 2012. The reduction in capital will come entirely from the oil and gas business where the fourth quarter spending rate was already close to the level planned for all of 2013. Almost all of reductions will be made in domestic operations. Midstream capital spending will increase mainly for the BridgeTex pipeline. The 2013 program breakdown is expected to be 75% oil and gas, 11% in the Al Hosn gas project, 9% in domestic midstream and the rest in chemicals.","The following is a geographic review of the 2013 program. In domestic oil and gas, development capital will be about 46% of our total capital program. We expect our average rig count in the United States to be about 55 rigs during 2013 compared to 64 rigs in 2012, a decline of about 14%. We've eliminated our less productive rigs to improve our returns. Our total domestic oil and gas capital is expected to decrease about $900 million compared to 2012. Permian capital should remain flat.","In California, we expect to reduce capital about $500 million from 2012 levels, which represents ongoing well cost reductions and efficiencies and a modest shift towards more conventional drilling opportunities and the constraints of the current environment. To improve the efficiency of our capital spending in California, we have planned our 2013 program level based on what we know we can execute with our existing and the conservatively anticipated permits. We may revise our program during the course of the year if we can gain more certainty about the environment.","In the Mid-Continent, we expect to reduce spending by about $400 million from 2012 levels. We reduced activities in higher-cost unconventional levels, specifically in the Williston and the lower-return gas properties, mainly in the Mid-Continent and Rockies. The modest decline in rig levels compared with well cost reductions lead to an overall U.S. oil and gas -- a decline in the U.S -- overall U.S. spending compared to 2012. However, as a result of planned efficiencies, we can drill a similar number of wells as we did in 2012. Compared to 2012 split, we will spend a higher percentage of our 2013 capital on oil projects. As a result, U.S. oil production is expected to grow -- continue to grow this year.","Internationally, our total Al Hosn gas project will decline modestly from 2012 levels and will make up about 11% of our total capital for the year. While Iraq's spending levels continue to be difficult to predict reliably, capital in the rest of the Middle East region is expected to be comparable to 2012 levels. Exploration capital should decrease about 15% from 2012 levels and represent about 5% of the total capital program. The focus of the program domestically will be in the Permian Basin and California with additional international drilling in Oman.","The midstream capital will increase by about $400 million due to the BridgeTex pipeline project.","Chemical segment will spend about $425 million, which includes construction of a new 182,500 ton per year membrane chlor-alkali plant in New Johnsonville, Tennessee that we expect to begin operations in the fourth quarter.","In summary, assuming similar oil and gas prices into 2012 and our expectation of comparable chemical and midstream segment earnings, expect our 2013 program will generate cash flow from operations of about $12.7 billion and invest about $9.6 billion in capital spending. In 2012, we returned $2.3 billion in total cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, excluding the fourth quarter accelerated payout.","Our dividends, excluding the fourth quarter accelerated payout in 2012, was $1.7 billion. We expect this amount to increase in 2013 on an annualized basis by amount comparable to our recent dividend growth rate.","We expected a $5 change in our realized oil prices will change cash flow from operations by about $450 million.","We're now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Doug Terreson of ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, it sounds like the teams have been very successful in identifying some of these expense opportunities and at a pretty surprising pace. So my question is whether or not their early success indicates that there may be greater potential than you guys had originally envisioned? And you talked about several cross-categories in your commentary, and the second question is were you surprised by the opportunities in particular areas or were the savings fairly broad based and spread out?","Stephen I. Chazen","Bill will answered in more detail. But on the overview, we've been -- I think both Bill and I have been stunned by how the people, especially in the field operations, have responded to this. So a lot of great ideas, some of them maybe a little off in left field, but a lot of great ideas. And so we've been very pleased with this. I think Bill can give -- and it's really spread over a lot of categories. There's no one thing we can point out and say it was caused by this or that. And I think maybe I'll let Bill talk about it here for a minute because Bill's been out talking to the people in the field.","William E. Albrecht","Doug, can you hear me? Hello? Okay. Very good. Like Steve said, these savings have been generated both on the capital side as well as the operating cost side. And on the capital side, as Steve mentioned in his remarks, we're well on our way to achieving our targets. We're about halfway home on the capital side. And on the operating expense side, which is where our field people really do come into play, and very important that those folks that are closest to the well had embraced this, they really have. I mean, we're actually more than 50% toward our goal on the operating expense side, more like 2\/3 of the way there. And it's across a lot of different categories. Just top to bottom, not just one specific thing.","Stephen I. Chazen","I'd like to go back, Doug. I mean, the goal here is not just cutting the costs, but making more margin. And so it isn't just about you cut the cost by closing down a facility or something, but the goal is creating more margins, so, so far, we haven't seen any reduction in our production as a result of this.","Operator","Your next question comes from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's actually Drew Venker. I just wanted to ask you guys there's been a number of shareholder initiatives in the past few months targeted mainly at option companies revolving around separating business lines to boost valuation. So one could argue that your chemicals and midstream business could receive a similar valuation uplift? What are your thoughts around separating those segments from the upstream?","Stephen I. Chazen","We're open to any ideas that will generate real value. The midstream segment is, I hate to use the bad word, but integrated with our mostly Permian operations. And we believe that our oil company gets better prices for the product, the oil. And putting it in a form where some third party shared in that may not be the best thing to do. Chemical companies -- this is a chlorine and caustic business -- chemical companies as a [indiscernible] group don't generate huge multiples. So I mean, there's other things people could talk about doing that -- and we look at all this stuff regularly to see whether there's real value here that could be created. So both Ray and I are large shareholders in the business. We're not here to collect salaries. And so from our perspective, most of our net worth, or at least I'll say it for me, is tied up in this. So from our perspective, we're perfectly aligned with the shareholders in this. And our goal is to make the shareholder -- the stock go up and increase our net worth that way rather than through 5% increase in our salary or something. So I think that -- I think we're perfectly aligned. A lot of people I know in the business don't have a lot of stock, but we're perfectly aligned on this and we continue to look at things that make sense that will increase value. But those 2 segments are small compared to the total and so -- but I'd be very cautious about the midstream because it's so heavily integrated into our margins in the Permian. Because one of the advantage we have in the Permian is we control our own infrastructure and to be a fiduciary -- you still could control it. Being a fiduciary is not necessarily what you want to be. We can -- Willie -- Willie Chiang who runs that business can maybe talk about it a little bit.","W. C. W. Chiang","I'll may make a comment on just the what we're seeing in the fourth quarter and first quarter. The differentials, you can see how they've been significantly depressed fourth quarter because of turnarounds and pipeline maintenance out of the Permian, we were seeing significant discounts. And I think a good example of what Steve talked about is our project that we're working with Magellan on BridgeTex to get access to the Gulf Coast through Colorado City, which is essentially midland. And as you all well know, when you have constrained supply that's not a good thing. So price signals work, infrastructure gets built and we're able to match supply with demand and get access to other markets. And I think to do that without control in a midstream company is a little more difficult, but we see it as a real, real advantage that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple, please, Steve. Steve, on the cost cutting, you signaled earlier this year the competitive conference side of this had been going. But a couple of months ago, when I had the opportunity to travel with you, you also signaled that you've had a 50% increase in cash OpEx between first quarter of '11 and the third quarter of '12. And I suggest there could be a lot further to go. Could you give us an idea of just how you're feeling about getting back to that early '11 cash OpEx numbers as a stretch goal and then what you might do with the incremental cash flow that clearly would be quite significant coming out of that? And I have a follow-up, please.","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, I hate to overpromise here, so I think we'll stick with our current outlook. We've been -- both Bill and I have been surprised and even -- and in Sandy's operations, too. I'm surprised at a lot of the ideas that have been generated. So while I'm, I don't know if the word is euphoric; for me, euphoric, about what we're doing, I just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We'll deliver what we say and hopefully a bit more. I really don't want to go into overstating it, but it's certainly looking very strong right now. What are we going to do with the cash? We talked about this forever. When the stock was poor, after the last call we took -- we stepped up and bought a fair number of shares. And had I known it was going to respond so quickly to stock, I would have bought more shares admittedly. But my ability to predict the stock price is modest on a good day. So there could be some of that. There could be higher dividend growth. But the goals are still the same. When the stock price doesn't reflect the reality of the business, that'll be used. And when people get negative about the stock for usually short-term reasons, we'll deal with that. And dividends are important part of the business. So exactly what we're going to do, I don't know. But even with the numbers I've given you, you should understand with the numbers of the cash from operations less the capital, there's $3.1 billion of difference and that's really last year's product prices. And that, I think I've been reasonable, if you will, in figuring that number out. So I think that with the dividends taking a little more than half of that, it still leaves a fair amount left and I would expect over time that number will widen. The Al Hosn project, which if somebody asked about it, we'll get Sandy to talk about it, the Al Hosn product is going to add a lot of cash flow to the company and obviously reduce our capital spend. So as we look forward to 2015 and late 2014 maybe, but 2015 for sure, company's cash flow will grow. We can't treat our business the same as the small producer. Small producer takes all his money and drills wells with it. So his current production may look a little better. But we have to spend a fair amount of our money on the long term and the projects like Al Hosn and maybe additional projects in the Middle East will help our business over time and you suffer a little bit now. But on the long run, these are things that build the company out. So if that answers your question.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That was a very long answer, but yes, it answered. My follow-up will be a little quicker. The transition to a little bit more conventional drilling in California, I guess this is kind of a bread-and-butter exploration you guys talked about a couple of years ago. Can you just elaborate a little bit as to what you're seeing in terms of the split of activity and what expectations you have out of that program? I'll leave it there.","Stephen I. Chazen","It's a slight shift actually. It's not a huge shift. The program -- one of the issues we had -- I had really last year was that as we tried to boost the program, we couldn't really -- we counted on being able to drill. And if we didn't get the permit or whatever, you wound up with a fair amount of rig inefficiency because you couldn't drill the rig. You couldn't the well. You had to find some other location for the rig. So we put in a very conservative program this year that can be delivered fairly straightforwardly without a lot of problem, with decent results, we think, and better results than we had last year. As the issues clarify later in the year and if we see good opportunities, we could shift. But I think right now, we want high certainty, good returns and that's what we're doing in California and in the Permian. So I mean, that's really the goal of this year. And if we see better opportunities later on, we'll do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ed Westlake at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on depreciation. Obviously, you've given a guidance of $17. Now, you're obviously spending more and you've got the Al Hosn unproductive CapEx. As you look out a bit further beyond this year, do you think depreciation will just continue to rise with the capital spend, or are there some moving levers to expect DD&A to flatten out at some point?","Stephen I. Chazen","I think it's likely to flatten out. We're very close. If you look at the program and forget the revisions, if you just look at the program and the overall finding and developing cost of program, once you see those numbers, you haven't seen them yet of course, you'll see the $17 is very close to what we're doing worldwide. And when Al Hosn comes on, the depreciation expense per BOE is going to fall for the company so -- because you're going to get low depreciation barrels. So I can't say it won't vary a little bit. But I think as we roll through this year, we ought to be okay. I think our F&D on the program basis, again ignoring revisions, is actually pretty good. And I think that this is -- you don't really know, of course, but we're very close here. So I think we had to sort of suffer through it this year. And as we roll into next year and the year after, we ought to see improvements in the DD&A just from what we have in our portfolio. In addition, we should pick up some margin on our oil barrels in the Permian as that market equilibrates. And so I think that -- and some additional chemical earnings from the new plant. So I think our overall cash from operations and earnings will get better, but I think we're close here on the DD&A. I don't think there's not really much more -- and we've taken out some -- in the charge, we took out some of the things that were a drag on it.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then shifting to the Permian, Permian capital is flat. California capital is down. I think from the presentation you released earlier this year, the net share of Permian acreage is increasing. So could you just give us an update on sort of the rig program that you planned actually in the Permian and maybe some of the EURs and rig cost that you're seeing in the horizontal program in particular. And I guess, a follow-on would be how much production you think you'll get from the acquisitions that you made in 2012 and '13?","Stephen I. Chazen","I'll answer the last part and let Bill talk about the Permian program. Last part is we picked up a few thousand barrels a day in the Permian in the fourth quarter, under 5,000 surely. 3,000 or 4,000 a day, I would guess by the time we're through. And we picked up a little gas in California. I did sell forward or whatever the form of art [ph] is for that, the gas that we bought at the lower $4 an Mcf for 15 months, so we get about 1\/3 of our money back in the 15 months that we put into it. So in that basis, a reasonable cost. And that's really all you'll probably see. Bill can talk about our Permian program, and a lot smarter than I am.","William E. Albrecht","Ed, we're looking to average somewhere between 25 to 27 rigs in the Permian. And roughly 1\/3 of that program will be in the Wolfberry, which we've spoken to you about in previous calls. Another 1\/3 is going to be mainly in the Delaware Basin. And then the remainder will be centered around several other anchor-type programs. And of course, the well cost that you mentioned, horizontals, depends on a lot of things, lateral length, the depth of the well and those sorts of things. But what we've seen is about a 50% or so overall weighted average capital cost reduction in a number of our anchor programs in the Permian.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So that's 5-0 or 15, sorry?","William E. Albrecht","I meant to say 15.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","He has new target now. Great, okay.","William E. Albrecht","No, it's 15.","Stephen I. Chazen","There's some guy in the Permian who just had a heart attack.","Operator","Your next question comes from Leo Mariani of RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just hoping for a little bit more detail on the Permian. Are you guys planning on significantly increasing horizontal Permian activity in 2013 versus 2012?","Stephen I. Chazen","Bill can answer that.","William E. Albrecht","Yes, Leo, really not so much. Only about 15% to 20% or so of our wells in the Permian are going to be true horizontals. Now having said that, we do drill a number of highly deviated wells, but those are still not horizontals. It's only in certain specific limited plays where we're drilling horizontal wells.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just in terms of the Bakken, it sounds like that's an area you guys made probably the most significant cuts, if I'm not wrong in that statement. Just any thoughts around when that activity could pick back up? If you guys get to your cost reduction targets, will you expect that to pick back up later in 2013? Just any color you had around that would be helpful.","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, we've already seen some sizable, actually reductions in the costs, but we're not where we need to be. And so we're going to continue to drill at a moderate rate there and see what goes on. But we're down to sort of all right numbers. And of course, the product price is now better there than it's been. So -- but I think we'll hold this level -- we'll likely hold this level this year of drilling and work on reducing our costs and spending less time moving rigs because there's a lot of money we spent on moving rigs around. So if you concentrate your program in a few places, we can, I think, get better results. Once we see better results, I think we can boost the program next year. We're trying to keep the capital under control this year. There's always more money that could be spent. We could spend some more money here. We could spend more money there. We're trying to keep the program under control this year. Next year, as the capital needs of some of the longer-term projects start to roll over, then we can look at what's the best use of the capital. For this year, I think we're trying to be conservative and only spend the money on the best things we can.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right, that's helpful. And I think, Steve, you mentioned potentially other projects in the Middle East. Is there anything kind of looming in 2013 on the near-term horizon?","Stephen I. Chazen","Sandy?","Edward Arthur Lowe","We're working on projects, small incremental additions in Oman and bringing on our Block 62 properties. We're also in the queue hopefully for more Abu Dhabi-related projects. But nothing exactly on the horizon in 2013. Middle East should be viewed -- I view it like the Permian in some ways. You go through long periods in the Permian where it's quiet and then all of a sudden something new comes along and you get a period of growth and then you go through another period. For the Middle East, we're in the building phase. Then, as the time progresses, it'll again be the star for a period and something -- and then it'll come down again. The whole business is cyclical. This isn't a business that's -- and fairly long term. In the Middle East, I think you really have to take a long view of it and focus on those things that you can manage and things that will generate long-term returns because once one of these projects is running, they generate a lot of cash and earnings for the company. You just have to invest to get there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the volumes, Steve, in the past, you talked about 5% to 8% at a global level. This may be an unnecessary detail, but it's not a number that you -- you haven't put out a total volume target. I'm not sure it particularly matters, but I guess implied you would be a kind of a 5% company level growth for next year. Is there any particular reason that you're not specifying that 5% to 8%?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, there is. The target still exists, let's not argue, but the target's there because if we grew about 5% last year and if we look ahead to the Al Hosn project going on, you'll be -- for the multiyear period, you'll be there. The reason I'm not is as we cut back on the gas drilling, the outlooks that we have are difficult to measure exactly because they tend generally to overstate the decline because of the way they compute it. And so it's really about the U.S. gas and that's the only thing that I view as -- and that's why we're not -- I wish you guys would stop talking about BOEs or at least convert it 25 to 1 or something. But that's really our issue is that our gas production you just don't know what's going to happen exactly. We can predict the oil production, I think, reasonably well because the program is focused on that and it's pretty reliable and designed to be conservatively estimated. The gas is just hard and so that's why we're staying away from the BOE sort of calculation. But as far as profitability goes, this is where the money is. If somebody thinks we ought to drill some gas wells to break even, I suppose we could do that, to make some BOE numbers. But I mean, the money right now is in oil, I mean, black oil. I don't mean NGLs. And so that's why we're doing it.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, perfectly understood. In the past, you've also been -- you're frank about how difficult it is to forecast the gas number. You said the same thing about the international volumes. How confident -- I mean, within ...","Stephen I. Chazen","No, just Iraq. The reason in Iraq is we don't know what the capital is because it's not in our control. I mean, there's another operator there, so if they spend more money, you'll get more production. And if they spend less, you'll get less production. But on a cash flow basis, you get the money back so quick. Let's say, you put another $200 million or whatever the number is into capital, you'll get the $200 million back within 6 months. So it's sort of -- and that's the number that I -- it's not in our control. The things that are in control we could at least more or less figure, but things that are not in our control and in the control of somebody else, it's just very hard. And so you can wind up a lot more or fewer barrels in Iraq depending on what they spend. Nobody should be bothered by that really, but it's not something -- it's like gas decline and not something I can estimate. But it's even more out of our control because it's a third-party operator operating in a difficult environment.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I totally understand. On acquisitions, you talked about transitioning to an organic -- more of an organic approach. A couple of years ago, we hit highs of $5 billion of acquisitions per year. You said this past year, it was $2.5 billion. Can you talk a bit about where acquisitions will fit in, in 2013, again best guess?","Stephen I. Chazen","It just depends -- we can't create acquisitions. Somebody has to want to sell. And at the end of last year, for tax reasons or whatever, we had to rush people in the fourth quarter. So if you want to run a lot of acquisitions, you ought to go to people in Washington and talk about raising capital gains taxes or something and we'll get more acquisitions. We can't really predict it. $1 billion, $1.5 billion is probably sort of there at some point, but we don't see anything this quarter that amounts to anything. There's really no activity and nothing really that amounts to anything on the horizon. Right now, in the areas we would acquire, which is basically the Permian, we've got our -- we've got a full program when we can manage of acquisitions right now, especially capital-intensive ones, which is almost all of these are now are not a high priority.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, and disposals. What about the Bakken?","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, anything that adds value, we would look at. Bakken is a -- if costs were a little better and it's a place where there's a lot of oil in the United States. The differentials have gone away, but if somebody liked to buy my desk and they pay the right price, they're more than welcome to it. There's not much in the drawers.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then just finally for me, if I could while we got Willie Chiang there as well. You referenced that the Midland differentials, but you've also spoken about good realizations essentially for the company. There's the midstream element just sort of squaring the circle. I think what you're saying is that you'd get already a relatively premium price in the Permian because of the infrastructure access that you have and that we shouldn't look too hard at these Midland differentials as being that meaningful for you. But at the same time, you're adding more pipeline capacity to further avoid any risk of -- how should we kind of put all of that together?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, we'll let Willie answer that.","W. C. W. Chiang","Paul, I think if you look at the infrastructure in the industry right now, industry is -- the infrastructure has lagged the prices signals. Price signals haven't been there. People haven't built out. We all wish we would have built more infrastructure earlier. We don't deal only with the Brent-TI spread. We also have the Midland, the Cushing spread. And so if you're limited in pipeline capacity takeaway as we are currently in the Permian, we saw some huge differentials fourth quarter with combined turnarounds, as I talked about in some pipeline on maintenance. So again, we're trying ...","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess my question was -- sorry, I was just going to interrupt and just say that so  the point is that you did suffer from those differentials?","W. C. W. Chiang","Oh yes, yes.","Stephen I. Chazen","We didn't suffer much, that's true.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Keep going, Willie, sorry.","W. C. W. Chiang","Well, my point is, yes, by putting more infrastructure in and making sure we have access in different markets. I think going forward you should see that we won't get as impacted with any of these abnormalities between -- the basis difference between regions.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And then finally, Willie, I guess you expect LLS prices to be pressured down and Permian prices to rise in some combination. What is your thoughts? And I'll leave it there.","W. C. W. Chiang","I think there's a lot of other people kind of looking at LLS prices in different basis differentials. Our key is getting Permian to the Gulf and making sure we get the highest prices possible.","Stephen I. Chazen","We're not good at oil price forecasting.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Portillo of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions for me. In terms of -- as we think about your free cash flow growth in the outer years and kind of the near-term focus on reduction in capital spend, Steve, I think you alluded to the fact that kind of the incremental capital or the incremental free cash flow may go to dividend increase? And so just trying to understand how you guys are thinking about that relative to the historical growth rate, and should we expect the potential see that accelerate over the next few years as you roll off some of these major projects?","Stephen I. Chazen","First of all, it's a board decision, not mine. I'll have a view, but it's not really mine -- not my decision to make. Everybody here is committed to dividend growth and exactly what it'll be just depends. It just depends on how predictable it is. It also depends on the stock price to some extent. If you get downward movement in the stock price, we may shift some more money to buying in some shares. So you should expect double-digit growth in the dividends going forward, but whether we know exactly what it'll be in any one year is hard to say. But I think as we look through this whole process in the next 2 or 3 years, we ought to see increased free cash flow and the ability to pay higher dividends.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just a second question for me on -- just looking through the slides quickly here. Approximately 60% of the reserve revision was related to gas price. The other 40%, I guess, was related to reservoir performance. Could you give a little more color around where we should have just expected regionally to see that revision on the reservoir side, and any color as to what drove that revision downwards?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, I think the Mid-Continent had some performance issues in some of the gas reservoirs, which we -- that way. And then there's an old reservoir in old Elk Hills which underperformed. I think those are the 2 major areas where there was performance revisions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Faisal Khan of Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a few questions. You mentioned before that you had a high level -- high number of contractors earlier in the year and that part of the cost-reduction effort was getting, removing some of those contractors from the cost structure. Can you give us an idea of what the number of contractors where at the beginning of this cost-reduction effort and where they are today?","Stephen I. Chazen","Contractors are difficult number because there's guys out in the field that are contractors. You hire Halliburton or something, that's really not what we're talking about. These are mostly office-related contractors. And the numbers, I think...","William E. Albrecht","It's in the hundreds.","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, hundreds of them, how many of we let go.","William E. Albrecht","That's how many we've let go, Steve. It's in the high hundreds.","Stephen I. Chazen","High hundreds. And that's maybe 20%, 25% of what's there. But these aren't the contractors like the Haliburtons out. This isn't work over -- guys doing work over. These are guys primarily in the offices.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And is there more of these kind of cutting to go or is there -- you think you're kind of done at this point with this part of the cost structure?","Stephen I. Chazen","You're never done looking at costs. It's like nobody's ever done. When you take a layer out, you look at where you are, you see what's going on, you see if you're hurting your production, hurting your margins and then you go look at it again. These are -- you take the things that you know you can handle first and then you move down the road. Getting done with looking at costs, it just never happens. So nobody really -- there's no plan that says every month you're going to fire 100 contractors or something. It just -- we're trying to do it in a way that's not done with a meat axe but with a scalpel.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And on the reserve additions, I think previously you had not booked anything for the Shah gas project. And at this point, I'm not sure if you have or haven't, but was that part of the reserve additions, the $400 million?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, it was.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And how much -- was it a big part of it or...","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, it was. We've spent $2.6 billion, I think, so far, isn't that right, Sandy? We spent $2.6 billion on it so far. So I would assume that there'd be some reserve additions associated with the spending. We've only booked maybe 1\/3, 40% at best of the reserves and we spent -- Sandy?","Edward Arthur Lowe","We spent about 70% of the money.","Stephen I. Chazen","So we're pretty far behind booking relative to the spending. So you should expect to see more additions over the next 2 or 3 years. And really beyond that as the project matures and there's more opportunity for gas delivery, I think you'll see a lot more additions. So I think we're very early in the booking here and this is about as little as we could actually book given the facts.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then on the $2.5 billion of acquisitions you made this year, how much production did that add to your portfolio during the year? In what geographies or how much acreage did you guys pick up in those $2.5 billion?","Stephen I. Chazen","I don't really know. Most of it was done in the fourth quarter, so it didn't add anything. So you picked up a little bit in the early part of the year, but virtually, all of -- nothing really of a few thousand barrels a day maybe in the last year. But almost all of the production basically closed at the end of the year. So last year was sort of nothing.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And was this mostly centered in the Permian or also into California and other parts?","Stephen I. Chazen","The production -- it's always the same. Permian is the largest piece. Hopefully, every so often you find a piece in California, but it gets harder and harder for us. And some occasionally in the Bakken, if you can get the right price. It doesn't really change the strategy, the plan, the acquisitions don't change very much. Occasionally you find something in South Texas maybe that adds to what we have, but those tend to be pretty small.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on your production growth guidance, for domestic oil volumes, the 11% -- 10%, 11% sort of number that you have out there, is that -- I take it that's also mostly -- most of that growth is coming from the Permian, or what's the -- what do you expect California to contribute to that growth?","Stephen I. Chazen","No, no, no. The oil production will come from Permian and California, both, and maybe a little out of the Bakken even. But I mean, that's -- we're spending the money in the Permian so that's what you're going to see it. But we're also spending a fair amount of money in California and again they're focused on oil drilling. Our California oil production, as we get through -- as we head into '14, will grow sharply as some of these steam floods and other things start to come on. So once we get through the permitting phase of that activity, you'll see some more volume, oil volume growth, into '14 and '15.","Operator","Your next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question for you. As we look at the Permian Basin and the view of relatively, let's say, as a percentage compared to the industry low horizontal drilling, what is it you need to see out there to get more aggressive on the horizontal side? Is it strictly a cost-per-well issue, is it the decline rates that continue to hold you back? I mean, kind of walk us through that if you would.","Stephen I. Chazen","Well, it's all of the above. I think we've said this before, but if you over drill high decline wells, while it may excite you for this quarter or next quarter or something, it makes next year more difficult because you're faced with high decline wells. So our program is a balance of all those activities. And so it's designed to make a sustainable program, not one that gets a big, big, big level right off.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, I understand that. But if you're looking at it, and I know you look at your overall portfolio from very much the return criteria, I mean, if the returns were the same for the horizontal wells or potentially even better, would you move more aggressively towards that? Or is it the decline rates and the year-over-year comps have become tougher that keeps you from ...","Stephen I. Chazen","We'll let Bill answer. He knows more about it than I do.","William E. Albrecht","Roger, really what dictates an increase in horizontal drilling is the reservoir and the targets that you're going after, which is why in the Permian, as I said earlier, you really don't see a huge proportion of your wells being horizontal because we've got other targets, multiple pay-type targets and reservoirs that are more amenable to vertical drilling as opposed to horizontal. So really, what dictates it more than anything is the target.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that kind of falls into my next question. I mean, if we look at a lot of the other operators out there, they're talking about moving to, say, 50% horizontal, 75% horizontal. If we separated out the CO2-related drilling out there and really just sort of look at the highly deviated wells and the horizontal wells, how would you compare to that? I'm just trying to understand where you fit in, where you will be fitting in over the next, say, 12 to 24 months?","William E. Albrecht","Well, I think as some of these unconventional plays prove themselves up I think you could expect to see a little bit more increase in horizontal drilling. But as I said before, 1\/3 of our program is in the Wolfberry, which is vertical drilling essentially. And another 1\/3 is in the Delaware Basin, which, again, is largely driven by vertical drilling. So as some of these unconventional plays mature, then I think you'll see a little bit more in the way of horizontal holes in those reservoirs.","Stephen I. Chazen","We're not -- we have a lot of acreage. We're not trying to spend the maximum amount of money right off the bat. We're trying to learn from what other people are doing, cutting through it. While other people have maybe less acreage or less opportunities, they're basically into this and we'll learn from them and we'll begin some of their wells because of our large position rather than go and be the experiment or we can actually learn for a relatively low cost to figure out whether these things make sense. These plays are relatively new. Determining the ultimate recoverable reserves of a play that's 1 year old or 18 months old when you have huge decline, initial decline rates, is very difficult and we tend to be fairly conservative of how we look at it because we don't know how it's going to flat -- how the curve is going to flatten. And that's maybe just us, but we can afford to wait, be patient and thoughtful about this. And we're maybe less convinced than other people about the ultimate recovery. But we'll find out here in the next year or 2 as these plays mature and our position is good enough that we can do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eliot Javanmardi of Capital One.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","I think many of the questions have been asked already, but I did want to ask you one more. You had mentioned that it looks like you're now 2\/3 of the way through your cost-cutting goals. I just want to get some clarification around what number we're looking at to start with and where that -- and what number we're trying to end with just from a clarifications standpoint? Could you help me out there?","Stephen I. Chazen","Bill will answer that.","William E. Albrecht","I mean, on an absolute dollar basis, Eliot, we're looking at $450 million to $500 million of reduction in absolute OpEx. That's on the domestic side.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what was the time frame to meet that target? It was mid-year or for '13 or...","William E. Albrecht","That's an overall average target for 2013.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So your 2\/3 ...","Stephen I. Chazen","So as you think about it, it's a little less than the beginning and so the exit rate will be different, it will be higher. Otherwise, you won't make the average.","Operator","Your last question comes from John Herrlin of Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Couple of quick ones. With the cost savings, it's all the Oxy initiatives, no help on the services side at all?","Stephen I. Chazen","Very little, but we're starting -- we're not ignoring that. But right now, it's really all within our power. And we're not planning that, but there's clearly some out there. So we would hope to get some from that, but what we're planning on is what we could do within our control.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. With the Elk Hills plant, is that now fully operational? Are you running it full?","Stephen I. Chazen","Yes, and you can see how it's generating more NGLs. As for the gases you can't see it exactly. But the gas is down at Elk Hills. But the equivalent amount of BOEs were converted into NGLs. So even though we're getting good -- not good gas prices but relatively good gas prices in California, you get better prices for NGLs.","Christopher G. Stavros","Thanks very much for joining us today. And should you have further questions, please call us here in New York. Thank you.","Stephen I. Chazen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.
